Every time trees are earmarked for felling to make way for a developmental project, environmentalists and other like-minded citizens have been quick to try and stop it or look for alternatives. This time around, it is the proposed felling of 627 trees in about eight hectares near Lalit Mahal in Mysuru for the setting up of a helipad that has got the goat of green activists. Environmentalist Bhanu Mohan of the Parisara Samrakshana Samithi has been at the forefront of the agitation against the helipad. “Initially, as many as 627 trees were earmarked to be felled, which we protested, by painting over the numbering of the trees. Subsequent to our protests, this number was brought down to 150, but our contention is that a helipad here does not hold any value and can easily be set up elsewhere, like, for instance, at the Exhibition Grounds or near the airport, etc. This area, where the trees are set to be chopped, is too close to the Chamundi Hills forest area, and any disturbance to the ecosystem here, will have an adverse impact on the flora and fauna in the region. We are hopeful that the public objection to the project will have a positive result. Else we will take the legal course to solve this issue,” she says. The destruction of even 150 trees and the subsequent hustle and bustle surrounding a helipad will be catastrophic for the ecosystem of the area, says Arun Kumar Raje Urs, who has been studying the bird and butterfly activity in the area. “The area near Lalit Mahal is home to about 190 species of butterflies. Butterflies are very sensitive to nature and at the height of the monsoon, millions of them migrate here from the Western Ghats to the trees near Lalit Mahal, where they then go into diapause (a hibernation of sorts) till the weather becomes more favourable for them to return. Every year these butterflies come here, even though the Chamundi Hills forest area is close by, so, imagine what will happen to them if all the trees here are cut? Even if the butterflies and other migratory birds continue to converge here, the noise, pollution and increased human traffic owing to regular helicopter flights will affect them adversely,” explains Arun.

In response to a question in his latest telethon, Khan had said, "History tells us that when ‘fahashi’ (obscenity) increases in society, sex crimes go up and the family system breaks down". Pakistani journalist Reema Omer tore into him on Twitter. "PM’s comments linking rape with "obscenity" are ignorant, dangerous and condemnable," she wrote. "His propagation of this rape myth shows he has no understanding of the issue, and amounts to providing excuses for criminal acts of perpetrators while blaming the victims." Another social media user responded to Omer with a sarcastic defence of the PM. "You need to give him (Imran Khan) a break as he is saying what he is told or messaged. His past life shows how colourful he was." Rights activist Meena Gabeena didn't hold back either. "I can guarantee that one day a number of women will come out with accusations on Imran Khan of harassment and even rape," she said. "A man with such mentality is definitely in the crime himself." Pakistan’s legal fraternity, rights groups and women rights forums, too, condemned Khan, terming his remarks "factually incorrect, insensitive and dangerous". A statement signed by representatives of several rights organisations, including the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, War Against Rape and Pakistan Bar Council’s Journalist Defence Committee, said that the PM had actively fostered and promoted rape culture and rape apologia. "In a country where the total reported cases of rape represent only the tip of the iceberg, such statements have the effect of further traumatising and silencing survivors of sexual violence by placing the blame on them, instead of on those who carry out the crime and the system that enables rapists," the statement said. "Comments of this nature also disregarded the prevalent cases of sexual violence that seemed to have escaped the Prime Minister’s attention, including but not limited to the rape of minor girls as young as a few months old, sexual abuse of young boys, even in madressahs, and sexual abuse and violence within the confines of the home, perpetrated by family members, including mehrams (a person whom a Muslim cannot marry)."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistanis-troll-pm-imran-for-blaming-obscenity-in-society-for-rape/articleshow/81958134.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Vardhan said demands of some politicians to open vaccination to all were attempts to cover up poor progress in delivering the shots. He said such statements were “most concerning” as the objective of the inoculation drive was to reduce mortality among the most vulnerable, and prioritisation was unavoidable as long as supply of shots was limited. Vardhan’s statement came after Maharashtra alleged shortage of vaccines was resulting in vaccination centres shutting down, and demands from some leaders, including the Maharashtra and Delhi CMs, that vaccination eligibility age be lowered drastically. The minister’s rebuttal of Maharashtra’s allegations was sharp. Calling its attitude “lackadaisical”, he said, “the inability of Maharashtra government to act responsibly is beyond comprehension.” Throughout the last year, Vardhan said, he had “been a witness to the misgovernance and utter casual approach of the Maharashtra government in battling the virus”. “Today, Maharashtra not only has the highest cases and deaths in the country but also has one of the highest test positivity rates in the world. Their testing is not up to the mark and their contact tracing leaves a lot to be desired. Focusing all their energies on playing politics and spreading lies to create panic is not going to help the people of Maharashtra,” Vardhan said. The minister was also critical of the Chhattisgarh government which refused to accept Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin when it was cleared for emergency use in clinical trial mode and said it had earned the dubious distinction of promoting vaccine hesitancy. He added that quality of testing needed to improve in Karnataka, Rajasthan and Gujarat. In Punjab, high CFR needed to be improved by early identification of those needing hospitalisation, he added. The minister said Maharashtra had vaccinated just 86% of health workers with the first dose. The equivalent numbers for Delhi and Punjab are 72% and 64%. On the other hand, 10 Indian states/UTs have done more than 90%. “Among frontline workers, Maharashtra has vaccinated only 73% with the first dose. Equivalent numbers for Delhi and Punjab are 71% and 65%. There are five states/UTs that have already done more than 85%,” he said. The health ministry has also written to Maharashtra, Punjab and Delhi pointing out lapses in coverage and advised them to take immediate corrective action to improve the vaccination coverage. The Centre has maintained that the priority is to protect those who are vulnerable and at higher risk of mortality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/harsh-vardhan-lashes-out-at-maharashtra-govt-for-saying-vaccine-supplies-running-low/articleshow/81959573.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Sachin Waze claims 2 ministers, Ajit Pawar's 'aide' asked him to extort big time||MUMBAI: A fresh letter bomb hit the Maharashtra government on Wednesday with arrested assistant police inspector Sachin Waze alleging in a four-page letter addressed to the special NIA court that transport minister Anil Parab of Shiv Sena had asked him to initiate talks with a trust for a “Rs 50-crore settlement” to close an inquiry. The minister also asked Waze to identify fraudulent contractors listed with the BMC and demand at least Rs 2 crore from 50 of them, the letter said. The letter spoke of an alleged “Rs 2 crore demand” by former home minister Anil Deshmukh after NCP chief Sharad Pawar considered cancelling Waze’s reinstatement and alleged someone claiming to be “very close” to deputy CM Ajit Pawar asked Waze to collect Rs 100 crore a month from illegal gutka sellers. In addition, the letter reiterated former city police chief Param Bir Singh’s allegation against Deshmukh of demanding to arrange Rs 3-3.5 lakh each from 1,650 bars and restaurants. NCP said it was not reacting to the letter as there was no direct reference to Ajit Pawar. Waze’s lawyer Rounak Naik said the letter was not accepted by the court, which directed Waze to follow due procedure. Waze alleged that in November 2020, he was approached by a man who claimed he was “a very close person of deputy CM Ajit Pawar”. Read AlsoMumbai: DCP and ACP named by Singh in his letter take a different lineThe controversy over hafta collection from bars and restaurants which led to Anil Deshmukh’s resignation as home minister has taken a twist, with two police officers who were relied upon by former police commissioner Param Bir Singh to support his allegation taking a different stand. The man, he said, explained to him about illegal “gutka and tobacco trade” in Maharashtra and gave him phone numbers. “The said Mr (man) insisted I should collect a monthly amount of Rs 100 crores from these illegal gutka sellers,” the letter said. Waze claimed when he refused to do such an illegal act, he was warned he may lose his post again. The letter said that in July/ August 2020, Waze was called Parab to his official bungalow and asked to look into the SBUT (Saifee Burhani upliftment Trust) complaint, which was under preliminary enquiry, and told to bring the trustees for “negotiation” about the enquiry. “He also insisted to initiate primary talks to get Rs 50 crores from SBUT in order to close the said enquiry. I had expressed my inability to do any such things as I do not know anyone from the SBUT and I also did not have any control over the enquiry,” the letter said. Read AlsoParam Bir Singh overruled CIU chief on Sachin Waze posting: ReportThe crime branch chief had objected to the posting of Sachin Waze in the elite crime intelligence unit, a report prepared by joint CP (crime) Milind Bharambe said.Waze further alleged that in January this year, Parab called him to his bungalow “and asked me to look into the enquiry against fraudulent contractors listed in the BMC”. “He told me to collect at least Rs 2 crores from about 50 such contractors. The said enquiry is undergoing on an anonymous complaint. The said enquiry was under preliminary enquiry in the CIU and until my transfer from the CIU nothing incriminating was found,” the letter said. Repeating Singh’s charge, Waze alleged that in January this year, Deshmukh had ordered him to extort Rs 3-3.5 lakh each from 1,650 bars and restaurants in the city. Waze said he told the then home minister there are only about 200 bars and turned down Deshmukh’s demand saying “it was beyond the scope of my capabilities”. Read AlsoMumbai: NIA questions Param Bir Singh, Pradeep SharmaThe National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday questioned former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh and former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma as part of its probe into the planting of gelatin sticks in a Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house on February 25 and the deathWaze claimed when he left the meeting held at the minister’s bungalow ‘Dyaneshwari’, the latter’s PA advised him to comply with the demand if he wanted to keep his job and post. Waze said he had brought this meeting to the notice of then police commissioner (Singh). “I also expressed my apprehension that somewhere in the future I would be embroiled in a false controversy. The honourable CP sir encouraged me and categorically instructed me to not to involve in any such illegal collection of money from anyone and for anyone,” Waze stated. The letter also said Waze’s reinstatement last June, following his suspension in 2004, was opposed by certain “agitators”. He said when NCP chief Sharad Pawar wanted his reinstatement revoked, Deshmukh had demanded Rs 2 crore from him to convince Pawar to let him stay on. “I had expressed my inability to pay such an amount. On this, the home minister sir asked me to pay in later course,” the letter said.

A source told TOI that the security agencies are “very hopeful” about Maoists handing over the abducted commando unharmed as they are purportedly keen to project a “human” face in the local media, after having justified the recent killing of 22 security personnel as a “retaliatory strike” they were forced to carry out to neutralise the massive anti-Naxal operation launched by the security forces in Bijapur area. TOI has learnt from reliable sources that the Chhattisgarh police have roped in a set of ‘independent’ emissaries to open a dialogue with the Maoists holding Manhas in their custody. On Wednesday, the CPI(Maoist) put out a photograph of Manhas in which he was looking fine. The emissaries, who are said to have worked with the CPI(Maoist) in similar situations in the past, are likely to travel to the interiors to talk to the Maoist leaders and convince them for his unconditional release. “We believe that Maoists are keen to show their ‘human’ side to the locals as well as in the media. Past precedents indicate that Maoists may well agree to free the hostage without putting forth any demands. So far they have not communicated any conditions. It is possible that he may be handed over to the emissaries on Thursday itself. We need to wait and watch,” a police official said while pointing to the press release put out by CPI(Maoist) spokesperson Vikalp on Tuesday, assuring that Manhas would be in safe custody of ‘janatana sarkar’ until his release upon appointment of ‘emissaries’ by the government. The official cited the case of Canadian national John Salazak who was detained by the Maoists in Sukma area of Chhattisgarh in 2017 for allegedly “inadvertently” entering “their area” while on a cycling expedition. The Chhattisgarh Police, which was urged by then external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj as well as the Canadian embassy to ensure his safe return, had at that point of time engaged emissaries who managed to convince the Maoists to hand him over to the government without any conditions. While the energies of the counter-Naxal forces including the Chhattisgarh police are focused on securing the early and safe release of the abducted CoBRA personnel, a source indicated that the abduction may have given a time breather to the Maoist attackers behind Saturday’s encounter, from an immediate retaliatory strike. “The PLGA-1 attackers led by Hidma may have bought time to cross inter-state junctions and CPI(Maoist) to review its strategies to pre-empt an imminent retaliatory strike by the security forces,” said a senior IPS officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/emissaries-finalised-to-seek-crpf-mans-release/articleshow/81960120.cms||Bharti Jain

Your vote will be wasted if all of you gherao them and that is exactly what BJP wants,” she said. The Election Commission has sought a report from the district magistrate. “I want a peaceful vote. People should be allowed to cast their votes. The CRPF should not stop people from voting. Who has asked central forces to tell people: ‘Vote for BJP’? Who has asked them to do ‘Modi or Didi’? I respect real jawans but not this BJP CRPF who are assaulting women, harassing people,” she said. Her statement prompted BJP to lodge a complaint with the EC. Banerjee had tried to create a law-and-order problem, the party said, adding that the statement “against our own security forces is seditious and anti-national”. The CM urged people to lodge FIRs against the men in uniform“if they tell you that you cannot vote”. Banerjee urged voters, especially women, to be brave. “These central forces are going to villages to ensure that women do not vote. So, my mothers and sisters, if you are told not to vote, will you listen? A single vote is more important than guns and bombs,” she said. She also attempted to set the record straight about the imposition of prohibitory orders during polling. “A rumour is being spread that the entire area comes under Sec tion 144 on election day; this is wrong. Section 144 is there only 200 metres around poll premises. Nothing stops people from going to vote in groups,” she said, adding, “During elections, policemen turn BJP supporters”. Mamata said she would not allow people to go to detention camps, like in Assam. “All who live in Bengal are Indian citizens. The state has already recognised refugees settled on state government land. The state cabinet has also decided to grant land deeds to those on central government and private lands. We will fight for you,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mamata-tells-voters-to-gherao-bjps-crpf-if-it-creates-trouble/articleshow/81960349.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

One of the reasons they do so is fear of being marked as a “D (doubtful) voter” and possibly getting disenfranchised. In the just-concluded elections, too, Muslim-dominated constituencies saw big voting numbers. The 34 constituencies where they are in the majority registered an average turnout of 84%. In the remaining 92 constituencies where the number of Muslim voters is negligible, the average polling percentage was 79%. In this poll, the state’s average polling percentage was just over 82%, but seven constituencies with a concentration of Muslim voters reported a turnout of over 90% and three others registered a little over 89%. Among these 10 seats, four had been won by Congress and six by AIUDF in 2016. Minority student leader and former Assam Minority Students’ Union (AMSU) advisor Azizur Rahman, who is contesting the Naoboicha seat, said the turnout of Muslims on polling day had always been higher than voters of other communities because they were greatly influenced by parties and candidates. “Unlike other people, the Muslims (Bengali-speaking migrants) are less educated, poor and take their decision collectively,” Rahman said. “There is one more reason for them always coming out in large numbers. They live in fear… if they do not vote they will be marked as ‘D voter’ on the electoral rolls,” he added. Hafizur Rahman (26) has never missed any election and has voted for the fifth time this year. A voter in Jania constituency, Hafizur, travelled over 150 km to his home to vote as he fears that if he doesn’t vote, there will be D-mark before his name on the electoral list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/assam/fear-of-d-voter-tag-drives-assam-muslims-to-poll-booths-in-droves/articleshow/81960491.cms||Prabin Kalita

The court decided to extend Mishra’s ED custody till April 12 based on “disclosures” made by police officer which the anti-money laundering agency cited to argue that it be allowed to keep him in order to track the beneficiaries of the huge coal mining scam involving the loss of hundreds of crores to the exchequer. Mishra, arrested by the ED in the national Capital on April 4, has been accused of receiving about 300350 cartons containing about Rs 168 crore of illegal cash during May-September 2020 from a coal mafia. Sources said the suspended cop has been very “cooperative”, something the ED repeated in court on Wednesday in order to hold on to Mishra for another week, and has shared with investigators details of how scam money running into several crores was sent to Thailand and London. The scam, allegedly masterminded by one Anup Majhi, has taken on political significance because of his links with Vinay Mishra, a TMC functionary who is said to be very close to CM Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee. In its application for Mishra’s remand, the ED claimed the cop was evasive on the total money he had received from the coal mafia in Purulia-Bankura till he was confronted with vouchers showing he had received about Rs 168 crore. The former SHO later said he had acted as per the “instructions” of Vinay Mishra, the ED claimed. “Evidences are there about him receiving Rs 168 crore in just 109 days from Anup Majhi for his political bosses, including Vinay Mishra,” the agency told the court. Before he was arrested, Mishra had refused to appear before the ED despite six summonses. The ED’s allegations are sure to be fuel for the already intense fight between TMC and BJP in the assembly polls. BJP has cited arrests of Vinay Mishra and Ashok Mishraas evidence of its charge of corruption against the TMC government, and the latter has hit back by accusing the Centre of misusing probe agencies to settle political scores.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/bengal-cop-received-rs-168-crore-in-coal-mining-scam-ed-tells-court/articleshow/81960551.cms||Pradeep Thakur

---||India||CJI Bobde calls unprecedented collegium meet||NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented decision that would go against a much practiced convention, Chief Justice S A Bobde has scheduled Supreme Court Collegium meetings on Thursday even after the President has appointed Justice N V Ramana, the most senior SC Judge, as CJI designate. CJI Bobde will retire on April 23. Justice Ramana was appointed on Tuesday as the next CJI and will take oath of office on April 24. It is a convention that once the President appoints CJI-designate, all files get routed through the next CJI and the incumbent CJI refrains from holding Collegium meetings to recommend the appointment of Judges to the SC or HCs, appointment of chief justices of HCs or transfers of HC judges. Justice Bobde took oath as CJI on November 18, 2019, and will retire after a tenure of one year and five months. Though many Collegium meetings were held, differences of opinion among CJI and member Judges - Justices Ramana, R F Nariman, U U Lalit and A M Khanwilkar - prevented the CJI from recommending even a single name for appointment as an SC Judge. As a result, the oldest vacancy in the SC, caused by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi's retirement on November 17, 2019, has not yet been filled. Since then, four more Judges - Justices Deepak Gupta, R Banumathi, Arun Mishra and Indu Malhotra - have retired taking the total vacancies of Judges' post in the SC to five. Though the convention is against an incumbent CJI presiding over Collegium meetings after the President has named his successor, CJI Bobde has decided to ignore it and scheduled for Thursday the five-member Collegium for considering names for appointment as SC Judges and also the three-member Collegium for scrutinising suitability of names suggested by various HC Collegiums for appointment as HC Judges. Convention or not, calling of the Collegium meetings just two weeks before his retirement is an indication that CJI Bobde does not want to go down in the annals of the Supreme Court as the only CJI who has not appointed a single Judge to the SC. A precedent of this nature was narrowly escaped by CJI H L Dattu, who during his one year three month tenure had appointed Justice Amitava Roy as CJI. Justice Dattu's tenure saw the tussle between judiciary and executive over the National Judicial Appointments Commision, which was ultimately struck down by a five-judge constitution bench by four to one majority in October 2015. Though CJI Bobde has convened the Collegium meetings, there is no guarantee that the recommendations for appointment of persons as SC Judges, if at all made, would be honoured by the Union government. Sources in the law ministry said that the government may not accept the recommendations made by the Collegium headed by CJI Bobde in breach of convention. If the government does not accept the recommendation, if any, made by the Collegium on Thursday, then too CJI Bobde would become the only CJI to retire without appointing a single Judge to the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cji-bobde-calls-unprecedented-collegium-meet/articleshow/81960555.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The recommendation came as regulators in the United Kingdom and the European Union emphasized that the benefits of receiving the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks for most people - even though the European Medicines Agency said it had found a ``possible link'' between the shot and the rare clots. British authorities recommended that people under 30 be offered alternatives to AstraZeneca. But the EMA advised no such age restrictions, leaving it up to its member-countries to decide whether to limit its use. Several countries have already imposed limits on who can receive the vaccine, and any restrictions are closely watched since the vaccine, which is cheaper and easier to store than many others, is critical to global immunization campaigns and is a pillar of the U.N.-backed program known as COVAX that aims to get vaccines to some of the world's poorest countries. ``This is a course correction, there's no question about that,'' Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, said during a news briefing. Van-Tam said the effect on Britain's vaccination timetable _ one of the speediest in the world _ should be ``zero or negligible,'' assuming the National Health Service receives expected deliveries of other vaccines, including those produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. EU and U.K. regulators held simultaneous news conferences Wednesday to announce the results of investigations into reports of blood clots that sparked concern about the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The EU agency described the clots as ``very rare'' side effects. Dr Sabine Straus, chair of its Safety Committee, said the best data was from Germany, where there was one report of the clots for every 100,000 doses given, although she noted far fewer reports in the U.K. Still, that's less than the clot risk that healthy women face from birth control pills, noted another expert, Dr. Peter Arlett. The agency said most of the cases reported were in women under 60 within two weeks of vaccination, though it was unable to identify specific risk factors based on current information. Experts reviewed several dozen cases that came mainly from Europe and the U.K., where around 25 million people have received the AstraZeneca vaccine. ``The risk of mortality from COVID is much greater than the risk of mortality from these side effects,'' said Emer Cooke, the EMA's executive director. Arlett said there is no information suggesting an increased risk from the other major COVID-19 vaccines. In a statement, AstraZeneca said both UK and EU regulators had requested their vaccine labels be updated to warn of these ``extremely rare potential side effect(s).'' ``Both of these reviews reaffirmed the vaccine offers a high-level of protection against all severities of COVID-19 and that these benefits continue to far outweigh the risks,'' it said. The EMA's investigation focused on unusual types of blood clots that have occurred along with low blood platelets. One rare clot type appears in multiple blood vessels and the other in veins that drain blood from the brain. ``We are not advising a stop to any vaccination for any individual in any age group,'' said Wei Shen Lim, who chairs Britain's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization. ``We are advising a preference for one vaccine over another vaccine for a particular age group ... out of the utmost caution rather than because we have any serious safety concerns.'' In March, more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, suspended their use of AstraZeneca over the blood clot issue. Most restarted _ some with age restrictions _ after the EMA said countries should continue using the vaccine. Britain, which relies heavily on AstraZeneca, however, continued to use it. The suspensions were seen as particularly damaging for AstraZeneca because they came after repeated missteps in how the company reported data on the vaccine's effectiveness and concerns over how well its shot worked in older people. That has led to frequently changing advice in some countries on who can take the vaccine, raising worries that AstraZeneca's credibility could be permanently damaged, spurring more vaccine hesitancy and prolonging the pandemic. Dr. Peter English, who formerly chaired the British Medical Association's Public Health Medicine Committee, said the back-and-forth over the AstraZeneca vaccine could have serious consequences. ``We can't afford not to use this vaccine if we are going to end the pandemic,'' he said. In some countries, authorities have already noted hesitancy toward the AstraZeneca shot. ``People come and they are reluctant to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, they ask us if we also use anything else,'' said Florentina Nastase, a doctor and coordinator at a vaccination center in Bucharest, Romania. ``There were cases in which people didn't show up, there were cases when people came to the center and saw that we use only AstraZeneca and refused (to be inoculated).'' Meanwhile, the governor of Italy's northern Veneto region said earlier Wednesday that any decision to change the guidance on AstraZeneca would cause major disruptions to immunizations _ at a time when Europe is already struggling to ramp them up _ and could create more confusion about the shot. ``Put yourself in the place of citizens _ it is hard to understand anything,'' Luca Zaia told reporters. The latest suspension of AstraZeneca came in Spain's Castilla y Leon region, where health chief Veronica Casado said Wednesday that ``the principle of prudence'' drove her to put a temporary hold on the vaccine that she still backed as being both effective and necessary. On Wednesday, South Korea said it would temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine in people 60 and younger. In that age group, the country is only currently vaccinating health workers and people in long-term care settings. Officials in Italy and Spain also said Wednesday that AstraZeneca would be recommended for people over 60 years of age. After the EMA's announcement, Belgium's health minister, Frank Vandenbroucke, declared a four-week ban on administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to people under 56, but said that would have little impact on the vaccination campaign, since few from that age group are in line to get the shots this month. ``For the vast majority of people the benefits of the Oxford AZ vaccine far outweigh any extremely small risk,'' said Dr. Anthony Harnden, the deputy chair of Britain's vaccination committee. ``And the Oxford AZ vaccine will continue to save many from suffering the devastating effects that can result from a COVID infection.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-advises-limiting-astrazeneca-in-under-30s-amid-clot-worry/articleshow/81960558.cms||---

As soon as the news spread, locals thronged the house. In the meanwhile, someone informed the police. A team of police and district officials rushed to the spot and started investigations to find the antiquity of the chest. Tehsildar Derapur Lal Singh, who heard about the discovery of the giant- sized steel chest, asked his subordinates to take its possession under the supervision of police. The action unfolded in the evening of Wednesday when a JCB machine was roped in for digging of a basement to lay foundation of the house by its owner Shankar Dayal Tripathi at Bani Para village. During digging, the driver noticed the chest in the mud and alerted Tripathi. “On cleaning it, Tripathi realized that it could be containing something precious from the ancient era. Subsequently, he tried to open it, but in vain,” a villager recounted to district officials. Inspector Rura Prabhat Singh said: “The total weight of the chest is around 4 quintals. It has a unique ancient design. Once all formalities will be in place, we will open it in the presence of senior officials. We have also sought help of the archaeological department for its examination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/ancient-chest-found-in-rura-of-kanpur-dehat/articleshow/81975478.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Mumbai||One in 3 Covid survivors got neurological condition in 6 months: Lancet study||MUMBAI: A new research paper in The Lancet has said one in three Covid-19 survivors in the United States developed a neurological or psychiatric condition within six months of the infection. The study, which tracked electronic health records of nearly 2.4 lakh Covid patients mostly from the US, said anxiety was the most common post-Covid ailment that affected 17% of the survivors, followed by mood disorders (14%). A small percentage suffered brain hemorrhage and dementia, especially among patients who suffered severe Covid infections. Pandemic-causing viruses have been associated with long-term neurological problems in some survivors. Studies have shown people born during the 1918 Spanish Flu had two- to three-fold risk of developing Parkinson’s-like symptoms than those born before 1888 or after 1924. During a recent talk, neuro-psychiatrist Dr Rajesh Parikh from Jaslok Hospital, Pedder Road, said meta-analysis of pandemics that preceded Covid—Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)—had shown sleep disorders in 100% of the survivors. Memory impairment was seen in about a fifth of the patients while 10% had depression, he had said. An unrelated study from Canadian McGill University a few months back said as Covid- causes a cytokine storm in many patients, it could lead to an increase in the incidence of Parkinsonism among those recovered. The new Lancet paper underlines this SARS-CoV-2-neurological link. The study’s lead author Paul Harrison from the University of Oxford in the UK said: “These are real-world data from a large number of patients. They confirm the high rates of psychiatric diagnoses after Covid-19, and show that serious disorders affecting the nervous system (such as stroke and dementia) occur too. While the latter are much rarer, they are significant, especially in those who had severe Covid-19.” Neurologist Dr Dhanashri Chonkar from Fortis Hospital, Mumbai, said similar complaints have been noticed in Mumbai as well, mainly because viruses induce changes in the brain’s neurochemicals. “Families of survivors say they have noticed cognitive impairment in their elderly relative after Covid,” she said. Stress and depression are other problems diagnosed in post-Covid clinics in Mumbai. The Oxford team also said brain diseases and psychiatric disorders are more common after Covid than after flu or other respiratory infections. A senior neurologist with a public hospital, though, said it’s difficult to prove that Covid has had a specific role in triggering degenerative neurological diseases. “How are we to know the patient wouldn’t have got the disease in normal course of time anyway?'” the doctor asked. Dr Chonkar concurred, saying it is difficult to pinpoint Covid or any viral infection for the appearance of a degenerative disease. “In an elderly patient, for instance, family members may be noticing cognitive impairment now that they are spending time at home and keeping tabs after the Covid infection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1-in-3-covid-survivors-got-neurological-condition-in-6-months-says-lancet-study/articleshow/81957238.cms||Malathy Iyer

An eight-member committee has been set up to study the performance of private aided educational institutions, including schools and minority institutions, in the state and, if necessary, suggest ways to continue or withdraw aid to these institutions. The committee has been tasked to give its report within seven days. Various college managements and student associations are strongly opposing the move. Prof Ratna Kumari, former vice-chancellor of Sri Padmavati Mahila Viswavidyalayam, Tirupati, is appointed as chairperson of the committee. The government, in its order, stated that the percentage of admissions in aided courses is gradually decreasing year-on-year and filling aided staff vacancies in such aided institutions and possible demands of unaided staff for regularization into aided posts would lead to huge financial burden on the exchequer. The government may take over those private-aided educational institutions who are willing. The committee will conduct a detailed analysis of performance of private aided educational institutions in the last five years in terms of student enrolment in the aided and unaided sections, faculty student ratio in aided and unaided sections and other factors. Various student associations slammed the proposal to stall grants for aided colleges. “The government should strengthen the aided college system rather than withdrawing funds. Aided colleges are providing quality education in rural areas where government colleges are not available. The committee formed by the government is perfunctory and how can it give an elaborate report in seven days’ time,” said A Ravi Chandra, state president, PDSU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-mulls-reforms-in-pvt-aided-colleges/articleshow/81956528.cms||Venu Lanka

On Monday and Tuesday, India had reported more than 1 lakh daily new infections. To contain the virus spread, local authorities in several parts of the country have imposed lockdown restrictions that limit economic activities. The domestic currency opened at 73.52 against the greenback. It finally settled at 74.56 to the dollar, its lowest closing level since November last year. The rupee also logged its worst single-day fall since August 5, 2019. “The rupee depreciated amid concern over rising Covid cases in India and lockdown restriction in some states. Furthermore, the RBI kept its repo rate unchanged for the fifth consecutive policy meeting and maintained an accommodative stance,” said Saif Mukadam, research analyst at brokerage firm Sharekhan. The central bank kept its key policy repo rate unchanged at 4% but warned that the recent surge in Covid infections has created uncertainty over economic growth recovery. The central bank’s accommodative policy stance also led to a rally in the bond market with the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilts closing at 4 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) lower at 6.08%. The 30-year G-sec yield also softened by 4bps to 6.74%, while yield on 10-year state loans and AAA-rated corporate bonds softened by 7bps to 6.73%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rupee-sees-worst-fall-in-20-months/articleshow/81958138.cms||---

---||Kanpur||All three accused of harassing nuns on train released on bail in Jhansi||Jhansi: All three Hindutva leaders, including an Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) cadre, involved in harassing two nuns and their two students recently, were granted bail by the city magistrate’s court here on Wednesday. All the three were set free by late evening, though the case against them will be tried further, police said. All the three persons, Ajay Shankar Tiwari, an ABVP cadre, Anchal Arjaria, president of Rashtra Bhakt Sangathan and Purgesh Amaria, secretary of Hindu Jagran Manch, were arrested by GRP on April 2 in connection with the harassment of two nuns and their two students, who were travelling to Raurkela, Orissa from Delhi in Utkal Express on March 19. All the four were forcibly deboarded in Jhansi by GRP on the application filed by Tiwari, who accused them of religious conversion which later on came out to be false. The matter snowballed into a controversy after Kerela CM made a written complaint to home minister Amit Shah, who assured of justice from an election rally. An investigation was initiated by SP GRP Lucknow, Saumitra Yadav, who holds additional charge of Jhansi. Based on his report, all the three were arrested as a preventive measure. City magistrate, Salil Patel, said: “All the three were arrested under section 151 CrPC for the breach of peace. They have been released on bail and I have given next date on April 22 for further trial.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/all-three-accused-of-harassing-nuns-on-train-released-on-bail-in-jhansi/articleshow/81957549.cms||---

Those found infected included eight healthcare workers at AIIMS-Patna. There were 5924 active cases in Bihar. On Tuesday, the state had reported 1080 new cases. Patna reported 522 new cases, one of the day’s highest in the past several months. There were 2562 active cases in the district. Some other districts with substantial number of new cases included Gaya (128), Bhagalpur (78), Muzaffarpur (74) and Jehanabad (68). Officially, three deaths were reported in the state, taking the toll to 1591. One death each was reported from Munger, Saharsa and Bhagalpur. But the silver lining was that 553 patients had recovered in the past 24 hours, taking the state’s recovery rate to 97.24%. State health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit urged the people to maintain all Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. “It is our request to the people to use masks, maintain distance, wash hands and avoid going to public places and travelling,” said Amrit after inspecting hospitals at Bhagalpur and Gaya on Wednesday. AIIMS-Patna nodal incharge for Covid-19, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said out of the eight healthcare workers who had tested positive, four were resident doctors and four nurses. He further said out of the 2449 RT-PCR tests done, 110 were found positive — the highest in the past 15 days. As on Wednesday, there were 116 patients admitted in the hospital. Meanwhile, 1,07,841 doses of Covid-19 vaccines were administered on Wednesday. The number of beneficiaries taking the first shot was comparatively less (94,116) than usual. However, another 13,725 beneficiaries got the second shot. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has asked all the states to provide vaccination facilities at both private and public offices. There should be 100 eligible beneficiaries, which means above 45 years of age, willing to take the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/41-jump-in-daily-cases-as-1527-more-test-covid-ve-in-bihar/articleshow/81956078.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Ahmedabad||Covid cases rise 20% in 8 cities, 72% in rest of Gujarat in a week||AHMEDABAD: The pandemic, centered around major cities and urban areas in Gujarat so far, is fast spreading its tentacles in semi-urban and rural areas. Analysis of the weekly cases reveal that Gujarat, in the first seven days of April, recorded 20,755 new cases, which was 34% higher compared to the cases (15,529) in the last week of March. But the growth pattern this time is worrying – the eight major cities having municipal corporations including Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Junagadh and Gandhinagar – cumulatively recorded weekly growth of 20%. At 13,829 weekly cases, they accounted for two-thirds of the cases. But on the other hand, the rest of Gujarat recorded a 72% spike – from 4,028 cases in the last week of March to 6,926 in the first seven days of April. The growth is three-and-a-half times more compared to the eight municipal corporations. The rest of Gujarat accounted for one-thirds of the weekly cases. “The trend is startling on multiple counts. If we see the trend of 2021 so far, the eight municipal corporations have accounted for 70% of daily cases led by Ahmedabad and Surat, which often contribute over 60%. When the cases started rising from mid-March, the rise was primarily recorded in urban areas. From March 15 to 30, the average daily contribution of the cities was 73.5%,” said a city-based epidemiologist. “But now districts like Patan are recording 100+ cases for the past two days. Mehsana and Jamnagar also recorded 60+ cases.” Experts pointed out that several of the districts are not equipped for the surge. Thus, the burden would be shifted to the adjoining urban areas. “Right from pathological labs to test samples to get beds with ICU and ventilatory facilities, these districts form the catchment area for the cities which are already under duress. Even in the post-Diwali surge, the cases in rest of Gujarat were in the range of 600-800, which has now increased to 1,181 on Wednesday,” said a senior health department official on condition of anonymity. On Wednesday, six out of 22 deaths were from outside municipal corporation areas.

Nalanda district education officer (DEO) Manoj Kumar had lodeged a written complaint against them. The DEO, at the instruction of Nalanda DM Yogendra Kumar Singh, raided different localities in Biharsharif and found various educational institutions violating the Covid guidelines as the number of active cases in Nalanda stood at 91 on Wednesday. Coaching institutes located in Tikulipar and Dhaneshwar Ghat localities were open but agreed to close their institutions, but the owners of three institutes refused to follow the guidelines, leading to their arrest. Amid the police action, Nalanda reported 22 fresh Covid cases. Nalanda civil surgeon, four health workers, seven students and staff members of Nalanda Sainik School, four employees of Nalanda coach factory, Harnaut, besides a doctor couple and a medical staff had tested positive recently after receiving two doses of vaccine against coronavirus. The administration carried sanitisation and other related works in the 35 micro containment zones in the district. According to the district immunization officer, Dr Ram Sahay, around 4,000 persons of 45+ age group received Covid shots on Wednesday. The number of beneficiaries on Tuesday was over 12,000. Officials attributed the less number of vaccinations on Wednesday to the shortage of vaccines. A total of 1,60,000 beneficiaries have been inoculated in Nalanda since the launch of drive on January 16 this year, said Sahay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-coaching-institute-owners-arrested-in-biharsharif/articleshow/81956075.cms||Farrukh Nadim
---||Business||Sebi fines Ambani brothers Rs 25 crore in 21-year-old case||MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi on Wednesday imposed a Rs 25-crore fine collectively on Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani, the erstwhile main promoters of the undivided Reliance Group, along with several of the family members and group companies. They were penalised for alleged irregularities relating to the issue of 12 crore equity shares in January 2000 by Reliance Industries (RIL). Sebi imposed the penalty on Ambani family members and related entities since it was found that the takeover code was violated during the allotment of shares by RIL. According to Sebi’s order, in January 2000, RIL allotted 12 crore shares to 38 entities from within the Reliance Group. The allotment was made after exercise of the option on warrants attached with 6 crore non-convertible debentures (NCDs), which were issued in 1994. From the disclosure filed with the bourses by RIL, it was found that these 38 entities were ‘persons acting in concert’ (PACs) with RIL promoters. Through this conversion, RIL promoters together with the PACs had increased their stake in the company from 22.7% as of end-March 1999 to 38.3% as of end-March 2000. Out of these, 7.8% shares were acquired as a result of a merger and hence were exempt under the then prevailing Takeover Regulations. However, 6.8% shares that were acquired by RIL promoters together with PACs in exercise of 3 crore warrants were alleged to be in excess of the 5% ceiling under the same regulation. Hence the imposition of the Rs 25-crore fine on these entities, the Sebi order said. RIL was yet to comment on the Sebi order, which was issued on Wednesday evening. Sebi said that the Ambani brothers and all the other entities named in the order jointly and severally would pay the total fine within 45 days of the receipt of the order. The order noted that while determining the quantum of penalty, no quantifiable figures or data were available on record to assess the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage and amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default committed by the entities. “However, the fact remains that the (RIL group entities and promoters) by their failure to make public announcement, deprived the shareholders of their statutory rights/ opportunity to exit from the company,” it noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-fines-ambani-brothers-rs-25cr-in-21-year-old-case/articleshow/81958202.cms||---

Altogether, 515 ZPTCs and 7,220 MPTCs will be going to polls. Despite uncertainty over the polls, the SEC continued polling arrangements. Returning officers, polling supervisors and other ground level staff were trained on Tuesday. Officials handed over ballot papers, ballot boxes and other polling material to the staff on Wednesday evening. Buses have been arranged for the polling staff to reach polling stations. The SEC passed orders directing polling staff to apply indelible ink on the little finger of the left hand instead of the forefinger. The decision was taken as voters have already got a mark on their forefinger during the gram panchayat elections in February. Increased attention will be given to sensitive and hypersensitive polling stations. In the wake of the recent Maoist attack in Chattisgarh, the SEC has directed the police to be especially cautious along the Andhra Odisha Border.

---||Kanpur||Mulayam’s close confidante Ramphal Balmiki files nomination from Saifai||(With Pic) Kanpur: Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav’s close confidante Ramphal Balmiki filed his nomination for the post of Saifai village head on Wednesday. Like the former Saifai village head, late Darshan Singh Yadav, who had been winning the panchayat election unopposed, Balmiki too is most likely to be elected without any contest. Insiders said the decision to field Balmiki from Saifai was taken by party president Akhilesh Yadav. Recalling his long association with party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav, Balmiki said, “I have been with SP patriarch since 1967. I accompanied ‘Netaji’ in party’s ‘Kranti Rath’ on several occasions.” While filing nomination, Balmiki remembered late village head Darshan Singh, and said, “He was like my elder brother and strong pillar and was a guardian figure for people of Saifai. I used to address him as ‘Guruji’. His contribution to Saifai is an inspiration.” He expressed his gratitude to Mulayam, Akhilesh, Prof Ram Gopal Yadav, Shivpal Yadav, former Badaun MP Dharmendra Yadav and former Mainpuri MP Tej Pratap Yadav for reposing their confidence in him and fielding him for the village head post of their native village Saifai. Balmiki’s wife had been elected as district panchayat member several times. The post of gram pradhan of Saifai has been declared as Scheduled Caste seat for the first time. Since 1972, the post of village head was with Darshan Singh Yadav who had passed away in October last year after prolonged illness. Darshan had served as gram pradhan of Saifai, the native village of the Yadav clan in Etawah district, for the past 48 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/mulayams-close-confidante-ramphal-balmiki-files-nomination-from-saifai/articleshow/81957544.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Several handloom weavers’ associations and NGOs met Union secretary of textiles, UP Singh, in New Delhi and apprised him of the situation. A delegation comprising Macherla Mohan Rao of National Federation of Handlooms and Handicrafts, Gunjan Jain of Vriksh, Delhi, Ankush Seth of MATEE, Delhi, held discussions with senior officials in the textile ministry and brought key issues being faced by weavers in the backdrop of Covid-19 to their notice. The NGOs also urged the Centre to help entrepreneurs set up small-scale spinning mills to produce ready-to-weave yarn. “Urgent intervention of the Centre is required to empower handloom weavers and strengthen the sector,” said Mohan Rao. They explained that the powerloom industry is resorting to illegal practices in producing handloom reserved items and selling them as ‘handloom’ in domestic markets at a premium price. They said that such violation of the Handloom Reservation Act is severely affecting the livelihoods of weavers. Pointing out that the Handloom Reservation Act needs to be amended, particularly in respect of Section 2 of (e), Mohan Rao said, “There is an urgent need to remove ambiguity in definition to make clear distinction between hand printing and hand embroidery vis-a’-vis digital printing and machine embroidery.” He said the government should take immediate steps to invent a device to distinguish between powerloom and handloom fabric in collaboration with technological institutes like the IITs. Gunjan Jain said the presence of fake products in the market is detrimental to the handloom industry. She also requested the Union textile secretary to recommend exemption of GST on yarns, dyes/chemicals and handloom products. Mohan Rao said the Centre should initiate measures to involve students from NIFT, NID and other design institutes to undergo internship with handloom weavers and bring new designs in tune with changing trends of the domestic and export markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/protect-handlooms-from-onslaught-of-powerlooms-weavers-urge-centre/articleshow/81956575.cms||Samdani MN
---||Delhi||Wearing mask must even while driving alone: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: The mask is a “suraksha kavach” or a protective shield against the spread of novel coronavirus and wearing it is compulsory even while driving alone in a private vehicle as it is a public place in the times of a pandemic, Delhi High Court observed on Wednesday. Upholding Delhi government’s order last year to fine even single occupants in a car if found without masks, Justice Prathiba M Singh said, “It (mask) protects the person wearing it, as also the persons to whom the person is exposed. Since the inception of the pandemic, wearing of masks has been one measure that has saved millions of lives. In fact, wearing a mask even in one’s own home is encouraged if there are elderly persons or persons suffering from comorbidities.” A vehicle moving across the city, even if occupied at any point by one person, will constitute “a public place owing to the immediate risk of exposure to other persons under varying circumstances”, said the court, dismissing a batch of petitions filed by lawyers challenging challans issued to them for not wearing masks in cars. Rejecting their argument that driving alone in a car poses no risk to others and doesn’t require a mask, the high court added that there could be “several possibilities in which while sitting alone in the car, one could be exposed to the outside world. Thus, it cannot be said that merely because the person is travelling alone in a car, the car would not be a public place”. Masks are also necessary irrespective of whether a person is vaccinated or not, the court pointed out, adding that since the outbreak of the pandemic, globally as well as nationally, scientists, researchers, international organisations and governments have emphasised the importance of wearing facial masks to control the spread of the disease. The other focus of the verdict was on what constitutes public place in the context of the Covid pandemic. “To determine what constitutes a ‘public place’, the manner in which the coronavirus can spread is the crucial part. It is now settled and accepted universally that the coronavirus spreads through droplets either through breathing of a person or from the mouth. The risk of exposure increases multiple times if a person comes into contact with a person who is infected and is not wearing a mask,” Justice Singh observed. The court pointed out that a person travelling alone in a car “may have visited a market, or workplace, or hospital or a busy street, prior to entering the car or vehicle. Such a person may be required to keep windows open for the purposes of ventilation. The vehicle may also be required to be stopped at a traffic signal and the person could purchase any product by rolling down the window. The person may thus be exposed to a streetside vendor”. It added, “If a person is travelling in the car alone, the said status is not a permanent one. It is merely a temporary phase.” There could be other occupants earlier or later and “there could be elderly family members or children who may be picked... or even simply friends or colleagues may travel in the car in the immediate future. Such persons can also be exposed to the virus if the occupant was not wearing the mask,” the court noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wearing-mask-must-even-while-driving-alone-hc/articleshow/81958216.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Patna||Khagaria doctor, clerk held for taking Rs 1.8 lakh bribe||KHAGARIA/PATNA: Two trap teams of vigilance investigation bureau on Wednesday caught a senior government doctor and head clerk of Khagaria civil surgeon office while accepting a bribe of altogether Rs1.8 lakh to close the department inquiry against a nurse for impersonation and release her salary held since August last year. While Dr Subhash Chandra Baitha Suman was arrested from the restroom of Gogri primary health centre, head clerk Rajendra Prasad Sinha was nabbed from his official quarter at Baghwa Chowk in Khagaria Bazar. Suman was arrested while accepting Rs 1.5 lakh as a bribe from the nurse, Ruby Devi. Sinha was caught taking Rs 30,000 as a bribe from Ruby’s husband Sanjeet Kumar. Baitha is the medical officer in-charge (MOIC) of Gogri sub-divisional hospital in Khagaria. The nurse was posted there. As per the vigilance bureau sources, the health department received complaints that the woman working as a nurse at the sub-divisional hospital was not Ruby, but an impersonator. Sources said an inquiry was initiated. The nurse’s salary was withheld in August last year. “She was getting a salary of Rs 57,544 per month,” the sources said. “A bribe of Rs 1.5 lakh was demanded by the doctor for closing the departmental inquiry and releasing her salary for the last seven months. The clerk demanded Rs 50,000 to put up her file before the district civil surgeon,” a vigilance source said. The source said after negotiation, the clerk agreed to do the work for Rs30,000 while doctor didn’t budge from his demand. “A vigilance team led by DSP Vimlendu Kumar Verma trapped the doctor while another team led by DSP Sarvesh Kumar Singh caught the clerk,” the source said. When contacted, Khagaria civil surgeon Dr Ajay Kumar Singh said Ruby was appointed as a nurse in August last year. “After verification, the health department found her documents valid. However, soon after she joined, her relatives started submitting written complaints that the nurse was impersonating Ruby by forging documents,” he said. Dr Singh said an inquiry was initiated. “Ten days back, Munger SP submitted a report that Ruby is a genuine person and her documents were also bonafide,” he said. Singh said her salary would be released soon. “She continued working all these times,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/khagaria-doc-clerk-held-for-taking-rs1-8-lakh-bribe/articleshow/81956061.cms||N P Thakur

While the number of cases are around 42 in Chhapra, 11 were found positive at Sonepur, In fact, Covid, has now spread its tentacles in 15 out of 20 blocks of Saran district. Saran DM Dr Nilesh Ram Chandra Deore on Tuesday said that at present the district has 83 active cases, out of which, 80 have been allowed home quarantine, two have been sent to PMCH, while one has been admitted to the Covid ward of the sadar hospital. Altogether 28 micro containment zones have been created in the district. “All SDOs, BDOs and other officials have been advised to strictly impose the Covid protocol and educate the people to use mask, avoid crowd and to wash hands frequently,” the DM said. Adequate number of vaccines have been made available and the administration is set to increase the number of vaccination centres in the district. Deore also made an appeal to the business houses and other establishments to avoid crowd and limit the number of guests up to 250 in marriages and 50 in case of ‘shradh ceremony’. Saran SP Santosh Kumar also underlined the importance of using mask, social distancing, avoiding crowd, particularly in vegetable markets, buses etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/spike-in-covid-cases-in-saran-after-holi/articleshow/81956091.cms||H K Verma

A boost in testing facilities is the need of the hour while doctors have urged people to follow Covid-19 guidelines to check the viral spread and mortality. They have also called for opening up the vaccination drive to those in the 18 to 45 age group, better availability of vaccines and increase in manufacturing. “Currently, around 1,600 beds are available in the district for Covid-19 patients while 85% to 90% are mild or asymptomatic cases and are in home quarantine. A home isolation monitoring centre has been set up at Andhra Medical College with 40 faculty and staff members. They are to call and check on mild Covid-19 patients under home isolation in urban and rural areas based on test reports and alert ANMs and ward volunteers,” Covid-19 nodal officer for north coastal AP, Dr PV Sudhakar, told TOI. Medical superintendent at the Governments Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD), Dr KVV Vijaya Kumar said that while symptoms of the disease are more or less similar, the severity of infection has increased, indicating new strains or variants of the virus. “Some patients, irrespective of their age or co-morbidities, are getting hypoxia in no time and are succumbing,” the doctor said. Doctors have also called for upgrades to testing facilities with more labs, kits, and manpower. Currently, only RT-PCR testing facilities are available at AMC and few other private labs. Results through these tests take a few days to arrive and doctors have suggested the restoration of TrueNat testing and addressing the paucity of lab technicians. “As per government of India’s order, TrueNat machines from our CDSC lab have been withdrawn and are to be used only for testing of tuberculosis. There is also no provision for separate swine flu tests and we have to depend on clinical analysis and treat accordingly. While Covid cases are spiralling, instead of depending only on time-consuming RTPCR tests, where results are often delayed, we request the central government to restore TrueNat tests,” said Dr Vijaya Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/amid-second-wave-limited-testing-and-vaccination-pose-a-challenge/articleshow/81956393.cms||Sulogna Mehta
---||Patna||75 teams formed to screen people at Patna Junction, Danapur railway station||PATNA: Alarmed over the increasing number of Covid cases in the state, the district administration on Wednesday set up control rooms with helpline numbers in three large hospitals of Patna. ADM-rank officers have been deputed as nodal officers at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) and the AIIMS-Patna, an SDO-rank officer of Patna City will monitor the functioning at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), Patna DM Dr Chandrashekhar Singh said. Senior doctors of these hospitals would act as health coordinators there. One may dial 0612-2304104 at PMCH, 0612-2630104 at NMCH and 0612-2451245 at AIIMS-Patna for help. The DM said 75 medical teams were formed for screening passengers through rapid antigen tests from April 9 on reaching Patna Junction and Danapur from Maharashtra. Those found positive would be taken to different isolation centres in the town. He said the number of medical teams could be increased if needed. Besides, isolation centres were also being created in all blocks for keeping Covid positive patients reaching from highly affected states. Hundreds of people, including migrant labourers, are expected to reach Patna in the next few days. “I have given instructions to complete these isolation centres by Thursday and depute sufficient number of staff and health workers for taking care of those to be brought there,” the DM said. Meanwhile, the number of patients at PMCH rose to 55 in the 100-bed Covid ward, its superintendent Dr IS Thakur said. He said the control room set up on the ground floor of the Rajendra Surgical Block had become functional. A computerized display board also became functional at PMCH since Wednesday evening for giving details of availability of beds in the Covid ward. “Health bulletins would be released on the display board in the morning and evening hours, giving the health status of the patients admitted there,” Dr Thakur said. “Our doctors and health workers are working with dedication,” he said. At AIIMS-Patna, all the 110 beds, including 30 ICUs, were occupied, said its nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Sanjeev Kumar. He said multispecialty treatment facility, including dialysis, for the Covid patients was also being offered at the AIIMS-Patna. Those complaining of renal, cardiac, neuro or other problems and pregnant women with Covidwere being attended to by specialists, he added. The Covid ward with 106 beds has been shifted to maternity and child welfare block at NMCH, said its superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/75-teams-formed-to-screen-people-at-patna-junction-danapur-railway-station/articleshow/81956109.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Covid protocol back in hospitals as second wave lashes Bengal||KOLKATA: With the second wave underway and the number of fresh cases spiking rapidly, health officials are putting in a number of plans to counter the recent surge. To begin with, the state health department has reissued the Covid Patient Management System (CPMS) that it had released to hospitals and nursing homes last July during the first wave to dispel complaints of confusion and poor patient care. Currently, the virus is spreading at a tremendous pace — almost twice the rate during the first wave. Healthcare experts have warned of a massive multiplication in the number of infected in the next four to five weeks. The health department has now asked hospitals to ensure 100% data related to various aspects of Covid patients. “Due to the recent upsurge and the rapidly rising number of positive patients needing hospital care, we have to resort to diligent use of this online CPMS so that patient management is better and each patient can be monitored by health administrators at all levels. The directive is for all health units cutting across private and public facilities,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan. The health department has directed hospitals to ensure that details of each admission of a Covid patient in real time on CPMS and patient monitoring score (PMS) of each patient — whether admitted in the general ward, critical care unit or in a high dependency unit — are duly entered in the system. The vital parameters of all patients and their investigative reports have to be uploaded in the system everyday. Hospitals have also been told to indicate discharges promptly and enter details of each death into the system within four hours. Making it easy for the families to know the status of the patients, an OTP-based interface has also been made part of the CPMS. All that one needs is to enter the mobile number of the family member provided during admission. “This is in order to enable anxious family members get access to a patient’s status online at any time,” said an official. Hospitals said they are familiar with the CPMS and there are only minor changes this time, like the number of times data has to be uploaded in a day. They said they would have no problem getting back to using this system. The health department has also asked hospitals to stay prepared in terms of number of beds and manpower. In many hospitals that have Covid facilities, services of doms, scavengers and security personnel have also been extended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-protocol-back-in-hosps-as-2nd-wave-lashes-bengal/articleshow/81957067.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Business||RBI makes prepaid instruments on a par with bank a/cs||MUMBAI: The RBI has extended payments system access to KYC-compliant prepaid instrument issuers and standalone credit card companies and brought them on a par with banks. This has been done to enable financial inclusion using prepaid instruments, which can now almost double-up as a bank account. Withdrawal of cash from ATMs using non-bank prepaid instruments (PPIs) is now allowed. Further, the RBI has cleared PPI issuers, credit card companies and white label operators to participate in centralised payment systems like Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT). This will enable holders of prepaid instruments to send and receive money from other bank accounts. The RBI also doubled the end-of-the-day limit for maximum balances that can be held by a payments bank to Rs 2 lakh from Rs 1 lakh. Explaining the rationale, RBI executive director T Rabi Sankar said that the basic idea of allowing cash withdrawal is to level the playing field between banks and non-banks and reduce the need to actually hold cash. “The fact that a PPI holder can access cash whenever he wants to reduces the need to hold cash. We believe this will give a big push to digitisation in the system,” he said. Paytm Payments Bank MD & CEO Satish Gupta said, “The decision to increase the limit on maximum end-of-day balance to Rs 2 lakh for payments banks account holders will enable us to cater to the growing needs of our customers. Similarly, doubling of the current limit on the outstanding balance in full KYC PPIs to Rs 2 lakh will incentivise migration to full KYC PPIs, which will further bring financial inclusion across the country. We support an open and interoperable digital payments ecosystem and are looking forward to the detailed guidelines on this subject.” Another chief of a payments bank said that the limit could have been increased to Rs 5 lakh as this would have enabled onboarding of small businesses who do not have access to bank accounts offering digital services. The RBI move to put prepaid instruments on a par with banks is seen by some as providing an alternative to basic bank accounts for financial inclusion. While banks have been compelled to open crores of basic savings accounts under the Jan-Dhan Yojana, it is not remunerative for them. In the past, some banks had experimented with issuing prepaid as an alternative to salary accounts to contractors employing construction workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-makes-prepaid-instruments-on-a-par-with-bank-a/cs/articleshow/81958110.cms||---
---||Business||In a 1st, RBI to buy Rs 1 lakh crore bonds in Q1||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced a government securities acquisition programme (G-SAP 1.0) where it has committed to buy bonds worth Rs 1 lakh crore in the first quarter. This unprecedented step has been taken by the central bank to keep interest rates in check as part of its efforts to support growth, which RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said was paramount. The central bank’s announcement had the intended impact with the yield on the 10-year bond falling more than 11 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) after the announcement to 6.07% from 6.18%. This is not the same as the RBI using its balance sheet to support government borrowing. “Since bonds are being purchased from the secondary market, this would amount to monetisation of debt. On the contrary, monetisation of fiscal deficit, if it amounts to printing money in that particular year to finance it, is inflationary as it is effectively subscribing to the primary issuances of government,” said SBI group chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh. He added that monetisation of debt, however, may not be directly inflationary as it entails financing through G-secs in secondary market and, if carried judiciously, is not inflationary particularly when there is over-capacity as in the current situation. “The RBI clarified that the G-SAP will run alongside its other instruments, namely longer-term repo/reverse repo auctions, forex operations, operation twist, and other open market operations. Given this, it is no surprise that bond yields have softened since the policy announcement,” HSBC chief economist Pranjul Bhandari said in a note. “The bond market was in a wait-and-watch mode going into FY22 to digest Rs 12 lakh crore of G-secs supply. With the explicit guidance now on the G-sec buying programme, supply concerns seem to have been addressed, to a certain extent,” ICICI Securities said in a research report. RBI deputy governor Michael Patra said, “This is the first time that the RBI is committing its balance sheet to conduct of monetary policy. It is different from open market operations where we announce the amount and the timing. We are giving up this discretion to give an assurance to markets. Giving a number enables participants to plan their actions accordingly.” He added that it was a judgment call to announce a scheduled asset purchase and could go awry, but it was a challenge that the RBI has taken up. Internationally, central banks have been buying assets from banks as part of their quantitative easing programme. Patra said that the RBI chose to buy government bonds as it was the best quality asset, and the prices of government bonds have an impact on all credit markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/in-a-1st-rbi-to-buy-rs-1l-cr-bonds-in-q1/articleshow/81958052.cms||---
---||Business||Covid-cautious RBI holds rates, vows growth support||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: The RBI on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged and vowed to maintain an easy policy stance to sustain growth. But the central bank cautioned that the recent surge in Covid infections adds uncertainty to the domestic growth outlook amid tightening of restrictions by some state governments. The monetary policy committee (MPC) decided to keep the repo rate — at which the RBI lends to banks — unchanged at 4%. It also unanimously decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of Covid on the economy. The MPC also decided to retain the GDP growth estimates for 2021-22 at 10.5% and the projection for CPI inflation has been revised to 5% in the fourth quarter of 2020-21, 5.2% in the first quarter of 2021-22, 5.2% in the second quarter, 4.4% in the third quarter; and 5.1% in the fourth quarter, with risks broadly balanced. “In the domestic economy, the focus must now be on containing the spread of the virus as well as on economic revival — consolidating the gains achieved so far and sustaining the impulses of growth in the new financial year (2021-22). A key aspect of this strategy will be to strengthen the bedrock of macroeconomic stability that has anchored India’s revival from the pandemic,” RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said in his monetary policy statement. The RBI has cut rates by 115 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) since March last year, but has been on a pause against the backdrop of rising inflationary pressures. Retail inflation shot up to a three-month high of 5% in February due to rising food and fuel prices. “Juxtaposition of high frequency lead and coincident indicators reveals that economic activity is normalising in spite of the surge in infections. Rural demand remains buoyant and record agriculture production in 2020-21 bodes well for its resilience. Urban demand has gained traction and should get a fillip with the ongoing vaccination drive,” said Das. He added that India is better prepared to meet the challenges posed by this resurgence in infections. He said fiscal and monetary authorities stand ready to act in a coordinated manner to limit the spillovers of the surge in infections to the economy at large and contain its fallout on the ongoing recovery. “There is concern around rising cases of infections but as Martin Luther King Jr had said and I quote: ‘We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope’,” said Das. He said the evolving CPI inflation trajectory is likely to be subjected to both upside and downside pressures. The bumper foodgrains production in 2020-21 should result in softening of cereal prices in future. Mitigation of price pressures on key food items such as protein-based components and edible oils would also depend on supply-side measures and easing of international prices. The MPC noted that underlying inflation pressures emanate from high international commodity prices and logistics costs. The softening in crude prices seen in recent weeks, if it sustains, can assuage input cost pressures, said Das.The RBI governor was confident that the country and the economy would be able to deal with the surge in infections as vaccination drive picks up pace. “In contrast to the previous year, the hope generated by vaccination drives in several countries at the start of the year 2021 has been somewhat offset by rising infections and new mutant strains worldwide,” said Das. “Yet, the speed and collective endeavour with which the world mobilised scientific energies to develop vaccines, and pandemic-related protocols, that have now become a way of life, give us hope and confidence that we will sail through this renewed second/third surge. Localised spurts in rates of infections will hopefully ebb with the Covid vaccination drives. I truly believe in the indomitable spirit of the human race which confronted the trial by virus during 2020 with resilience and fortitude and the will to survive. Let 2021 be the harbinger of a new economic era for India,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-cautious-rbi-holds-rates-vows-growth-support/articleshow/81958079.cms||---

This will apply to all borrowers irrespective of whether the moratorium had been fully or partially availed, or not availed. Earlier, the Indian Banks Association (IBA) had asked banks to refund interest on interest to those who have been charged. This followed an order by the Supreme Court on March 23 this year in a case filed by borrowers seeking interest relief. Even before the order, the government had said that it would compensate lenders for refunding interest on interest on small loans below Rs 2 crore, which has already been done. The new directive applies to all loans. In a circular to all lenders, the RBI said that all lending institutions must immediately put in place a board-approved policy to refund/adjust the interest on interest charged to the borrowers during the moratorium period. The method for calculation of the refund amount would be provided by the IBA after consultation with industry bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lenders-told-to-refund-interest-on-interest/articleshow/81958131.cms||---
---||Kolkata||KMC, NKDA plan reopening of safe homes as cases surge||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) is gearing up to reopen some of major safe homes in Kolkata predicting a surge in number of Covid-19 patients who might have mild or no symptoms. Primarily, the civic authorities have planned to reclaim three floors of a multi-storey building at Anandapur off EM Bypass. While two of the three floors could be converted into a 400-bed safe home, the third floor would be reserved for doctors and paramedics. Last July, the KMC had opened its first safe home here. Apart from this building, the KMC health department is also planning to make use of adequate space in Kishore Bharati stadium located near Bypass and convert it into safe homes. The civic brass is also keen on reopening a building close to Science City which was made a safe house when Covid-19 cases peaked last year. TimesViewThe public health system's response will have to closely follow the situation on the ground. What was in place last summer will have to be brought back as we approach last year's disease count.“We have decided to reopen some of the major safe homes following a resurgence of Covid cases in various parts of the city. We need to spruce up these homes which were shut down five months ago following lack of demand. Now, with the new Covid strain spreading, we need to make ready all sorts of arrangements,” said a KMC health department official. The official expressed apprehension that if Covid cases soar, there will be dearth of beds both at government and private hospitals and, hence, alternative arrangements for asymptomatic patients will have to be made at the earliest. However, the civic body has made it a point that safe homes would be made available only to Covid patients with mild or no symptoms and who have no space at home to stay in isolation. “We have thought of elderly citizens who don’t have much space at home to stay in isolation in absence of caregivers. People from the low-income group who test positive and can’t stay in isolation because of dearth of space will also be accommodated,” said a KMC health official. In a similar move, the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) is also reviving its Covid safe house, which is now being used as a vaccination centre. The two-storey building constructed by the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) in New Town’s Action Area II was being used as a 17-bed safe house for Covid patients last year. However, only a few patients had availed of the facility towards the end of last year and the last patient left in December. The building was left unused for some time before it was turned into a Covid vaccination centre. With the number of active Covid cases on the rise in New Town, the building will be used as a safe home again. According to officials, there are over 100 active Covid cases in New Town at present and the number is increasing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-nkda-plan-reopening-of-safe-homes-as-cases-surge/articleshow/81957112.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Jadavpur University ties up with hosp for staff vax; others work out details||KOLKATA: Jadavpur University has arranged for its teaching and non-teaching staff to get vaccinated for Covid at M R Bangur Hospital from Thursday. The hospital will make arrangements for the drive on the hostel premises in the second half every day. Initially, only 50 to 60 people will be vaccinated daily, which can be increased depending on the registration. Several colleges across the city have either started assisting their staff in getting vaccinated or are in the process of finalizing the details. Currently, the government allows vaccination for all above 45. JU had initially tried to include even those under 45 and the dependants of the staff, but, for the time being, only the non-teaching and teaching staff above the age of 45 are eligible. “A help desk has been set up in the university for registration. Any teaching and non-teaching staffer can come with their Aadhaar card, office ID and mobile phone to complete the process. The university will schedule the day and time for vaccination,” said a JU official. Earlier this month, the university had reduced the number of working days from five days a week to three after a surge in Covid cases. “The safety of our staff is the priority,” said the official. “The issue of vaccinating our staff was discussed in a meeting after the government allowed those above 45 to get the shot. We might send the idea to the government for approval,” said an official of Bethune College. At The Bhawanipur Education Society and College, the authorities have decided to reimburse the cost of vaccination of the staff and their dependants. A principal of a north Kolkata college said such an arrangement could also prove counter-productive. “The government has made arrangements in several places and now one doesn’t even need to register before taking the shot. We must create more awareness so that people go to their nearest centres for vaccination instead of rushing to any one centre,” the principal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ju-ties-up-with-hosp-for-staff-vax-others-work-out-details/articleshow/81957173.cms||Zeeshan Javed

He ordered Dr Aseem Kumar Das, deputy superintendent, to take charge of the superintendent. The action was taken after Pratyaya made a surprise visit to the JLNMCH to review the functioning of its Covid ward. He was shocked to see the attendants of some of the Covid patients present there in the isolation ward without even PPE. “It was disturbing and surprising and showed gross negligence on the part of the superintendent in the management of Covid ward,” Pratyay told this newspaper. He said the attendants could become ‘super spreaders’ of the virus. Departmental proceedings have also been ordered against Dr Bhagat, he said. Pratyaya said these unprotected attendants could infect all those in their families and neighbourhood. After reviewing other arrangements, Pratyaya directed the hospital authorities to use its maternity and children healthcare block for the Covid patients. On his visit to Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital at Gaya, the principal secretary directed the authorities to create a donning and doffing area for PPE kits as per the Covid guidelines. There, too, Pratyaya directed the hospital authorities to dedicate the maternity and child healthcare building as Covid ward within three days. The dedicated Covid ward must have separate gate so as to keep other departments of the hospital safe, he told the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhagalpur-hospital-superintendent-removed/articleshow/81956224.cms||---

The French carmakar will not export vehicles from India, instead it plans to export components under the highly localised C-Cube vehicle programme. Citroen is already exporting gearboxes to its European plants from India. The company said it will roll out one new product a year and that its C-Cube vehicles will have nearly 100% local content. “We are not going to export cars at this stage. We are exporting gearboxes to Europe from India. Our C-Cube platform will help us export components. C-Cube programme will be heavily localised which will irrigate other markets,” said Roland Bouchara, senior VP marketing & sales, Citroen India. While the C5 Aircross — positioned above the premium SUV and below the luxury — will be the flagship product, Citroen India will also roll out one new product every year and the C-Cube range of ‘multiple body styles’ are ‘not going to be premium price or positioning’. And while diesel is the focus for the C5 Aircross, the C-Cube products will have petrol engine options and “at the appropriate time when the market is ready we will bring hybrids and EVs,” said Bouchara. Citroen also does not have any announcements about the Ambassador brand which it acquired from CK Birla group. “We bought the name Ambassador and we will see the best way to use the name in the future,” he said. As for the global merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot to create Stellantis, the synergies are currently being worked out, said Bouchara. “At the group level as well as in India we are working on it but the organisation is still to settle down and the India strategy has not yet been finalised but synergies are part of the focus,” he added. The company’s vehicle assembly factory at Thiruvallur has a capacity to crank out 1,00,000 vehicles while its Hosur plant can make 300,000 gearboxes a year. The company has put in a total Rs 2,000 crore investment including land, capex and R&D. Citroen is offering the C5 Aircross through online buying in 50 cities as well through 10 dealerships.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/citroen-c5-aircross-suv-priced-at-rs-30l/articleshow/81957683.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

ICICI Bank, Infosys and Reliance contributed the most to the sensex’s gains with 27 of its 30 constituents closing higher. According to Gaurav Dua, SVP, head — capital market strategy, Sharekhan, the RBI maintained status quo as expected on policy rates and reassured the market on its commitment to retain accommodative policy stance till the prospects of sustained economic recovery is secured. “The easing of yield curves and the committing to keep interest rate low with ample liquidity are positive for the equity markets too,” Dua said. The consistency and continuity in the monetary policy stance is expected to support positive market sentiment, he said. The gains in the sensex came on the back of a Rs 227-crore net buying by foreign funds and a Rs 381-crore investment by domestic funds, BSE data showed. In its post-policy statement, the RBI said that to ensure congenial financial conditions for the economic recovery to gain traction, the central bank will buy gilts worth Rs 1 lakh crore during the current quarter. The first purchase under this plan would be for Rs 25,000 crore on April 15, 2021. The central bank’s accommodative policy stance also led to a rally in the bond market with the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilts closing at 4 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) lower at 6.08%. The 30-year G-Sec yield also softened by 4bps to 6.74%, while yield on 10-year state loans and AAA-rated corporate bonds softened by 7bps to 6.73%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-rallies-460-pts-as-d-st-cheers-policy/articleshow/81958146.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Patna||Bihar: Covid-19 takes its toll on NOU examinations||PATNA: The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has taken its toll on the Nalanda Open University (NOU) examinations which commenced here a couple of days back. The attendance of students in examinations is nearly 50% of the registered candidates. NOU registrar (examinations) Sanjay Kumar said that the examination of post graduation courses of 2020 commenced under full Covid-19 protocol on Monday but the attendance of students on the first two days was far from satisfactory. For instance, only 442 out of 1,127 students appeared at MA/MSc mathematics examination. Similarly, the number of students who took the examination in PG geography course was 822 against 1,585 admitted students. “The attendance of students in the examinations of all other subjects is also much less than the expected,” Kumar said. The examinations were scheduled to be held in June-July last year, but it was hit by the pandemic. When the wave of Covid subsided, NOU started the pending examinations of the last academic session and conducted examinations of intermediate and graduation courses early this year. But, unfortunately, the second wave started rising just before the commencement of PG examinations, affecting the presence of students in examinations. The registrar said that the current examinations are being held at five centres—A N College, College of Commerce, Science and Arts, G D Patliputra (Plus Two) School and Beur Central Jail besides the NOU headquarters at Biscomaun Bhawan. Only two prisoners are taking the PG examinations at Beur jail this year. “More than 5000 students were supposed to take the PG examinations this year, but the number has drastically reduced,” he added. It may be mentioned here that examinations at NOU are held under strict invigilation in presence of police and magistrates. All the examination halls have CCTV cameras, said NOU sources. PATCH PU PhD Exam Patna University (PU) has made necessary preparations for holding its PhD course work examinations under full Covd-19 protocol on Thursday and Friday. “More than 330 scholars are supposed to take the examination at Magadh Mahila College,” said PU examination controller R K Mandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-19-takes-its-toll-on-nou-examinations/articleshow/81956118.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Bihar: Backlog at RMRI as test reports delayed||PATNA: With the Covid-19 cases soaring once again, people in the state capital are rushing to the health centres to get themselves tested. This spike in demand for Covid-19 tests over the past week has led to a backlog at the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRI), which gets the majority of the samples for the RTPCR test from Patna. As a result of the backlog at RMRI, test reports are getting delayed for over a week. A group of people, who had given their samples as early as March 31 at the Shastri Nagar Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHC), were protesting at the centre on Wednesday over the delay. “It has been a week since I gave my sample and I was told that I will get a message on the phone. But no such message regarding Covid-19 test has come yet,” said a Bailey Road resident, who has been running to this PHC for the past couple of days, for the report. Sanjeev Kumar, who had given his sample at the same PHC on April 2, is waiting for the report, which is leading to the delay in joining back at his job in Delhi where a test report has been made mandatory for those returning from outstation. The Rajbanshi Nagar nodal medical officer, Dr Dipankar Kishore Ranjan, who sits at the same campus said in the past few days the rush at the health centres has increased compared to the previous month and this was leading to the delay at RMRI. Dr Dipankar said while a month ago, 12 to 17 samples were tested at that UPHC in a day, the number has now crossed 50 per day. The health department’s special secretary and state health society executive director Dr Manoj Kumar said the rush is only in Patna. “We are getting the backlog cleared and trying to smoothen the process," Manoj added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/backlog-at-rmri-as-test-reports-delayed/articleshow/81956093.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Bihar: ‘Govt will seal private hospitals charging patients exorbitantly’||PATNA: A couple from a village in Patna district was shocked when a private hospital in the state capital on Tuesday asked the duo to first arrange Rs3 lakh for treatment of breathlessness. Raju Paswan, 35, from Chiksi under Paliganj block has been suffering from breathlessness. He was found negative is the rapid antigen test done at Jehanabad for Covid-19. However, an ambulance driver brought him to the private hospital on the 70ft Road near Sipara where the doctors said he was Covid positive. “The hospital staff asked us to deposit Rs20,000 immediately and arrange Rs3 lakh fast, saying my uncle was positive for Covid-19. The demand was made even when his RT-PCR test was not done. When we pleaded helplessness, they asked us to deposit at least Rs15,000 immediately. However, we called a few people from our village living in Patna and they suggested us to shift him to the PMCH,” said Chitranjan, who accompanied his uncle Raju. Chitranjan said the hospital was not ready to hand over the patient and said he had gone missing. “After several calls from our known people, they released the patient only after charging Rs13,000 for a few hours,” he said. When told about the incident, health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit said action will be taken against such hospitals for exploiting common people in the name of Covid-19 treatment. “We will seal the hospital immediately. This will send a strong message that private players cannot make poor people fool in the name of treatment. I also request people to let us know if such incidents happen anywhere,” he said. Pratyaya further said the department will once again advertise the charges fixed for treatment of Covid-19 patients in the private hospitals. Hospitals in Patna have been kept in ‘A’ category while those in Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Gaya and Purnia are in ‘B’ category. The other districts are in the ‘C’ category. Again for Patna, hospitals which are NABH accredited can charge maximum Rs10,000 for an isolation bed with oxygen support, Rs15000 for ICU without ventilator and Rs18,000 with the ventilator support. Those without NABH accreditation will charge Rs3,000 less in all the categories. Similarly, hospitals in the B category and also NABH accredited will charge Rs 8,000 for an isolation bed with oxygen, Rs 12,000 for ICU and Rs14,400 for ICU with ventilator support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-will-seal-private-hospitals-charging-patients-exorbitantly/articleshow/81956170.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Rajkot||Covid cases rise 20% in 8 cities, 72% in rest of Gujarat in a week||AHMEDABAD: The pandemic, centered around major cities and urban areas in Gujarat so far, is fast spreading its tentacles in semi-urban and rural areas. Analysis of the weekly cases reveal that Gujarat, in the first seven days of April, recorded 20,755 new cases, which was 34% higher compared to the cases (15,529) in the last week of March. But the growth pattern this time is worrying – the eight major cities having municipal corporations including Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Junagadh and Gandhinagar – cumulatively recorded weekly growth of 20%. At 13,829 weekly cases, they accounted for two-thirds of the cases. But on the other hand, the rest of Gujarat recorded a 72% spike – from 4,028 cases in the last week of March to 6,926 in the first seven days of April. The growth is three-and-a-half times more compared to the eight municipal corporations. The rest of Gujarat accounted for one-thirds of the weekly cases. “The trend is startling on multiple counts. If we see the trend of 2021 so far, the eight municipal corporations have accounted for 70% of daily cases led by Ahmedabad and Surat, which often contribute over 60%. When the cases started rising from mid-March, the rise was primarily recorded in urban areas. From March 15 to 30, the average daily contribution of the cities was 73.5%,” said a city-based epidemiologist. “But now districts like Patan are recording 100+ cases for the past two days. Mehsana and Jamnagar also recorded 60+ cases.” Experts pointed out that several of the districts are not equipped for the surge. Thus, the burden would be shifted to the adjoining urban areas. “Right from pathological labs to test samples to get beds with ICU and ventilatory facilities, these districts form the catchment area for the cities which are already under duress. Even in the post-Diwali surge, the cases in rest of Gujarat were in the range of 600-800, which has now increased to 1,181 on Wednesday,” said a senior health department official on condition of anonymity. On Wednesday, six out of 22 deaths were from outside municipal corporation areas. While Gujarat recorded its yet another peak at 3,575, Ahmedabad city for the first time breached 800 daily cases mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/covid-cases-rise-20-in-8-cities-72-in-rest-of-gujarat-in-a-week/articleshow/81961257.cms||Parth Shastri

Officials have been directed to keep at least 1,500 beds in intensive care units (ICUs) across various hospitals in the next ten days. The situation in the district has raised concerns as 850 new cases were recorded in the first week of April itself while the entire month of March saw 1,600 cases. Health wing authorities are of the view that the second wave will hit hard over the next ten days and have advised that everyone must be alert at this point. “Around 20% of the new Covid-19 cases registered in the district are those who participated in family functions and other events. Public gatherings are increasing the spread of Covid-19 and we should focus on such areas,” district collector A Md Imtiaz said. Officials explained that the situation in metropolitan cities is becoming worse as many high-risk patients are unable to get beds. Many hospitals had removed Covid-19 wards and started regular operations which, officials said, is the main reason for shortage of beds. Imtiaz directed the district medical officer and other officials to contact corporate hospitals and arrange sufficient ICU beds and isolation wards for Covid-19 patients. Meanwhile, as many as 2.57 lakh people from the district had been administered the Covid-19 vaccine till Tuesday. The vaccination drive is continuing at nine urban local bodies which includes Vijayawada, Gudivada and Machilipatnam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/1500-icu-beds-to-be-readied-in-krishna-dist/articleshow/81956468.cms||Venu Lanka

The older boy was produced before the police by his family members on Wednesday evening. Siwan Women’s police station SHO Pramila Kumari said that the elder boy hails from the girl’s village where the incident took place. “The family has just produced the accused boy before the police. His medical examination has been completed. We are now taking him to court to seek direction to send him to remand home,” the SHO told TOI over the phone on Wednesday evening. She said that his friend is yet to be produced before the police by his parents. “He is from a neighbouring district of Uttar Pradesh and was living at his maternal grandfather’s residence in the village for the past few months,” she said. Pramila said the incident took place around 5.30 pm on April 3 when children were playing in the village. The two boys took the minor girl into nearby bushes and gang-raped her. “Later she went to her mother crying and narrated the entire incident,” SHO said. “The minor girl’s parents along with her reached the women’s police station on April 4. Her father lodged an FIR against both accused boys,” she said. She said the minor girl had received injuries in her private parts due to which she had suffered bleeding. “Her blood-stained clothes were taken for forensic examination. The minor girl has the taken names of both boys before the police,” the SHO said, adding her medical examination report is awaited. Pramila said police had gone to the village soon after the matter came to light but both boys were shifted elsewhere by their parents. “Male members of both families were not found in the village. The women were directed to produce the two boys before the police as soon as possible,” she said. Pramila said the younger accused, who is yet to be produced before police, has been sent to his native village in Uttar Pradesh. “His relatives have been directed to bring the boy before police,” she said. The SHO said such an incident is shocking and it was not clear what prompted both the minor boys to commit such a serious crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/five-yr-old-girl-gangraped-by-two-minor-boys-in-siwan/articleshow/81956110.cms||Debashish Karmakar

He urged the people not to lower guard as the virus is more virulent in the second wave. The number of people testing positive for the virus has increased in the past 2-3 days as the district had 103 active cases till Tuesday, he said. “We have created 22 containment zones in the district and marked 15 areas as micro containment zones. In the micro containment zones, infected persons will be asked to stay at home,” the DM said. The pattern of coronavirus has changed. “Earlier, we used to see only one person in a family infected. But, the virus behaviour is changing and we see several members of a family carrying the virus. It has become more infectious,” he said. “Apart from emphasising on contract tracing, paramedics and nursing staff have been deployed at transit points at bus stands and railway stations with Covid-19 rapid antigen kits. We ask people to stand in a queue for test. Thereafter, they are sent to the Covid care centre in a vehicle arranged for them,” said the DM. About the ongoing vaccination, the DM said, “Of the 1,32,072 vaccinations, at least 1,18,741 received their first dose while the rest 13,331 were given the second dose. The speed of giving jabs to the people picked up pace on Tuesday and we will scale it up further. Routine immunisation for children will not be hampered due to testing and vaccination process for the Covid-19,” he added. Civil surgeon (CS) Dr S K Verma said, “Around 14 SUVs fitted with loudspeakers will move across the district to create awareness among people against the Covid-19. People will also be convinced about the need to wear masks properly, maintain a distance of 6ft from others outside home, wash hands with soap or use of sanitiser. Though, our main purpose is to urge people to go for Covid-19 testing and vaccination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/22-containment-zones-created-in-purnia-dist/articleshow/81956117.cms||---

NCH is the largest Covid-19 hospital in south Gujarat. The doctors have been complaining of work pressure for the past few weeks. At present over 800 Covid-19 patients are admitted to Covid-19 hospital in NCH. “We are taking care of the Covid patients round the clock and there is huge pressure on each doctor.

Meanwhile, resident doctors at Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER) too have announced going on strike if their demands for additional staff and increased work pressure is not addressed by the senior officials of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). “We will go on strike if senior officials do not find solution to our demands,” said a resident doctor at SMIMER.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/resident-doctors-at-nch-on-strike-from-today/articleshow/81956228.cms||---

About 10% of commercial space has already been booked by retail players. Currently, out of two commercial towers – Block R1 and Block R2 as a single unit with a combined built-up area of 4,53,000 sq feet are being auctioned with some units having been already sold 15-20% above the reserve price. The station is being jointly redeveloped by Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), in partnership with National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC), on an EPC (Engineering Procurement and Construction) mode. The total construction cost for the station development is estimated to be Rs 190 crore and for commercial development is Rs 170 crore, including maintenance cost for two years. “We are enthused by the overwhelming response garnered by the project. The redeveloped station will enhance the travel experience, boost tourism and real estate and have a multiplier effect on local economy. The entire project is slated to be completed by December 2022, while the station is likely to be upgraded earlier,” said vice-chairman, RLDA, Ved Parkash Dudeja. The Railways has around 38 acres of land parcel at Gomtinagar railway station out of which eight acres is being utilised for station redevelopment and retail and commercial development. Two commercial towers, Block R1 and Block R2 having a combined built-up area of 4,53,000 sq ft is being developed comprising retail outlets, parking, etc. The average lease price is pegged at Rs 6,625 per sq ft for Block R1 and Rs 5,900 per sq ft for Block R2. The proposed commercial development of the railway station will be leased for 60 years and is located in the vicinity of luxury apartments, high-end commercial spaces and a five-star hotel. The redeveloped station will have state-of-the-art amenities such as segregation of arrival and departure, CCTV surveillance, centrally air-conditioned common spaces, an integrated building management system, treated water for horticulture use and much more. Gomtinagar railway terminus (GTNR) is an under-construction railway station situated on Barabanki-Lucknow suburban railway. It has connectivity to other parts of the city via Shaheed Path. The property has frontage on the main road of Vibhuti Khand, Gomtinagar which is developing rapidly as a commercial and retail hub. To complement the redeveloped Gomtinagar station and for efficient utilization of office and retail space thus generated, RLDA is in advanced stages of bidding out an additional 5.5 acres of land earmarked for residential development on a 99-year lease. The residential development will introduce a ‘walk to work’ concept and will be most utilitarian keeping in view the recent retail development in Gomtinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gomtinagar-rly-station-project-gains-traction-among-investors/articleshow/81959588.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Union health min says it’s ‘MVA’s bid to divert attention from failures’||New Delhi/Mumbai: Describing allegations of vaccine shortage by the Maharashtra government as “utterly baseless,” Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday said they were “an attempt to divert attention” from the state’s “repeated failures to control the spread of the pandemic” and its “poor vaccination efforts by just continuously shifting the goal-posts.” Vardhan said the MVA’s “focusing” of “all their energies on playing politics and spreading lies to create panic” was not going to help the people of Maharashtra. Throughout the last year, Vardhan said in a statement issued on Wednesday evening, he had “been a witness to the misgovernance and utter casual approach” of the state government in battling the virus. He alleged that “the lackadaisical attitude… has singularly bogged down the entire country’s efforts to fight the virus.” The minister said the Centre had “regularly counselled” the Maharashtra government, made available all resources and sent Central teams for help. “However, the lack of efforts on the part of the state government is now clearly visible and come to haunt us all. Today, Maharashtra not only has the highest cases and deaths in the country but also has one of the highest test positivity rates in the world. Their testing is not up to the mark and their contact tracing leaves a lot to be desired.” The state’s performance in vaccination is also not great, he added. While deputy CM Ajit Pawar has demanded all those over 18 years old must be vaccinated, CM Uddhav Thackeray has asked the Centre to open up vaccinations for all over 25. Without naming anyone, Vardhan said that “when states ask to open up vaccine supplies to everyone over 18, we must presume that they have done saturation coverage of healthcare workers, frontline workers and senior citizens.” However, Maharashtra, he stated, “has vaccinated only 86% of health workers with first dose. The equivalent numbers for Delhi and Punjab are 72% and 64%... 10 Indian states/UTs have done more than 90%.” He added Maharashtra has vaccinated “just 41% of healthcare workers with the second dose. Equivalent numbers for Delhi and Punjab are 41% and 27%. There are 12 Indian states/UTs that have done more than 60%.” Among frontline workers, Vardhan said, “Maharashtra has vaccinated only 73% with first dose…there are 5 Indian states/UTs that have already done more than 85%. Vaccination of frontline workers with second dose for Maharashtra is at 41… there are 6 Indian states/UTs that have done more than 45%.” When it comes to senior citizens, Vardhan said Maharashtra has vaccinated just 25%, Delhi 30% and Punjab 13%, while 4 states/UTs have vaccinated more than 50%. “It is shocking,” he noted, “to see how the state government is putting Maharashtrians in danger by letting people escape institutional quarantine mandate for the sake of their personal Vasuli.” “The inability of the Maharashtra government to act responsibly is beyond comprehension. To spread panic among the people is to compound the folly further. Vaccine supplies are being monitored on a real-time basis, and state governments are being apprised regularly about it,” he said. Vardhan also accused the Chhattisgarh government of trying to spread misinformation and panic on vaccination. He criticised it for being heavily dependent on rapid antigen tests and for having refused to use Covaxin. Other states need to bring healthcare systems “up to the mark,” Vardhan said. Quality of testing needs to improve in Karnataka, Rajasthan and Gujarat, and in Punjab, high case fatality rate needs to be arrested by early identification of those needing hospitalization. Vardhan said he was “constrained to speak out now because my silence should not be misconstrued for weakness” and added that “playing politics is easy, but improving governance and health infrastructure is the real test.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/union-health-min-says-its-mvas-bid-to-divert-attention-from-failures/articleshow/81960273.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||IAF choppers fail to make headway against forest fires, sent back||DEHRADUN: The two IAF Mi-17 helicopters deployed by the Centre following the Uttarakhand government’s request were sent back on Wednesday. The choppers were unable to operate due to hostile weather conditions. Forest department officials said that another reason for sending the choppers back was that the Met department had issued an alert for rain and snowfall, which was expected to douse the fires. In Tehri, the chopper assigned for Garhwal region managed to barely cover six spots while the one sent to Kumaon remained parked in Haldwani and for three straight days, was unable to take off due to low visibility. Meanwhile, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) was deployed for tackling the blaze in Nainital. According to sources in the forest department, the high wind velocity that caused turbulence and the smoke from forest fires that resulted in poor visibility, had increased manifold since April 1, making it impossible for the choppers to fly. The chopper assigned to Garhwal region managed to pour water over burning forests at six spots in Tehri and Pauri in six sorties in the past two days before the operation was called off. These areas are among the worst-affected by forest fires, with Pauri having lost over 550 hectares and Tehri district 220 hectares. A senior forest official said that apart from environmental odds, the choppers also faced logistical problems. “Ideally, foam should be used to douse flames, not water. Also, the IAF exercise would have proved heavily expensive. In this situation, NDRF and fire extinguishing facilities need to be upgraded to battle the fires,” he said. To recall, on Sunday, the state had requested the Centre for IAF choppers to be sent to Uttarakhand to tackle the worsening forest fire situation. Union home minister Amit Shah then directed two choppers and NDRF personnel to be deployed on priority to tackle the situation. Till now, over 1,900 hectare of land, four human lives and seven animals have been lost to the wildfires, apart from damages to rare biodiversity in reserved areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/iaf-choppers-fail-to-make-headway-against-forest-fires-sent-back/articleshow/81956251.cms||Shivani Azad

So much so, at some hospitals, Covid-19 patients are being given primary treatment on stretchers, wheelchairs and even in the hospital waiting rooms, due to lack of beds in the Covid wards.Al-Mehmood General Hospital, run by a trust at Jambusar, 50km from Bharuch, is one such hospital which is flooded with Covid-19 patients.

According to Dr Ajwad Khanya, administrator of Al-Mehmood General Hospital confirmed that at least six patients were given treatment in the common area of the hospital due to non-availability of beds. “The patients needed medical support so on humanitarian grounds our medical and paramedical staff started treatment at the best available places in the hospital,” said Khanya. Dr Sueb Mukardamwala, a physician at the hospital said, “Number of Covid patients are coming from the interior villages of Jambusar. But our hospital has only one oxygen tank and four ventilators. It is an alarming situation that so many patients are getting infected and are coming to the hospital. We are soon starting a 25-bed covid centre in nearby town Amod.” Bharuch health office (epidemic) Dr Nilesh Patel said that about 625 Covid-19 positive patients are under treatment in government and private hospitals in the district. “A total of 1,332 beds are reserved for covid patients of which 366 are with Bharuch Civil Hospital and ESIC Hospital at Ankleshwar. Around 142 coronaviruse infected patients are in government hospitals and 483 in private hospitals,” said Patel.“We still have 700 Covid beds available. We are putting in our best efforts.

The court asked the state government to ensure that private hospitals only charge the amount from Coronavirus patients, decided by the HC. Hearing on the petitions relating to Coronavirus was scheduled on April 19, but it was advanced in the wake of spurt in Covcid cases in the state. The court was told by the state government that private hospitals have been allowed to carry out Covid-19 testing; in 81 hospitals across the state, eligible patients are being treated under Ayushman scheme. The bench of chief justice, Mohd. Rafiq and Justice Sanjay Dwivedi in its order said that rates of testing and treatment of coronavirus should be widely publicised so that people are aware of the money they can be charged and if the bill is in excess to that, they can make a complaint to the competent authority. Phone numbers of these officials should also be made public. The court further asked the state government to include more hospitals in the list of hospitals where Ayushman card holders can get treatment and file a status report in this regard on next hearing. Amicus curiae in the matter, senior counsel, Naman Nagrath, was present in the court during hearing, while advocate, Sanjay Verma, appeared in the case for petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ensure-that-people-arent-exploited-in-the-garb-of-covid-treatment-hc-to-mp-govt/articleshow/81957323.cms||---

---||Delhi||Marriage industry finds itself tied in knots||New Delhi: Kapil Nagpal, who runs four banquet and marriage halls in the city, has been fending phone calls from agitated families. “They had finalised everything, done the bookings and the preparations were in the final stage. How can the government suddenly take a decision to impose curbs on social activities at night?” asked Nagpal. The marriage and banquet hall industry — which only has certain auspicious periods during a year during which it has to earn anything it can — has been affected by the pandemic on several occasions in the past year. The next lagan period from April 20 to May 15 now suddenly doesn’t look too promising either. Sameer Arora, general secretary, Community Welfare Banquet Association of Delhi, said that while markets and usually crowded places can remain open in the daytime, the important social necessity of weddings is being hit. “The number of guests could have been restricted, or a fixed window allowed. But the night curbs are not logical,” asserted Arora. He argued that when other essential services were permitted, the marriage industry should also be considered just as indispensable. Many banquet hall owners said a compromise would be to start the curbs around 11pm rather than 10pm and allow at least the immediate family of the married couple should be allowed to stay on the banquet premises till a later time. Nagpal himself pointed out in Hindu customs, the marriage takes place at an auspicious muhurta, which usually falls late at night or in early morning. This timing is sacrosanct. Banquet hall operators have sent a petition to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal requesting relaxations in the restrictions. The petition says, “It may be imposed in a phased manner over a smaller time frame from now till 20th April. The situation may be reassessed and then a call may be taken to change or further impose night curfew. It is also requested that timings be changed from 10pm-5am to 11pm-5am. This will give us sufficient time to ensure that many functions already booked with us are completed.” Recently, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan attributed the surge in Covid-19 infections to large-scale wedding gatherings, local body elections and the farmers’ protests, among other things. The wedding industry is a large employer of skilled and semiskilled labour, ranging from cooks and labourers to wedding cards makers and decorators. Bimal Jain, head of the Delhi Wedding and Greeting Card Manufacturers Association, claimed to be already feeling the impact. “People who had ordered wedding cards are now in two minds about how many guests should be invited and the number of cards to be printed,” he said. And if weddings are disrupted, how can wedding bands not be affected? Praveen Kumar, who runs Nisha band in west Delhi, pulled his hair saying how just when things were normalising after a dismal year, their source of income is again in disarray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/marriage-industry-finds-itself-tied-in-knots/articleshow/81958240.cms||Paras Singh
---||Lucknow||No comprehensive plan to tackle Covid crisis, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Expressing concern over the rapid rise in count of Covid-19 infections and deaths in Uttar Pradesh, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday said the situation in the state is getting scary by the day but Chief Minister is busy addressing election rallies in poll bound states as a star campaigner. “The ruling BJP has been repeatedly patting its back for limiting the spread of Covid-19 in the state but the second wave of the infection has exposed the reality behind all such claims,” the former UP CM said. “There is nothing on ground to suggest that people will get any relief from the government during the pandemic. The government labs are collecting samples in the name of Covid test but it seems the exercise is more of a formality. People are not getting the test results timely as a result of which those suffering from severe infection often end up in a critical condition by the time the test results are received,” Akhilesh said. The SP chief said over a year has passed since the pandemic brought life to a standstill but the government is yet to spell out any comprehensive plan to tackle the crisis in the long run. Educational institutions are yet to resume regular offline classes and online classes are a sham for most of the students enrolled in government schools. “In the absence of internet and smartphones, students and their parents in rural areas are feeling cheated, he said. Retrenchment has led to people losing their jobs as a result of which a new segment of ‘jobless individuals’ has come into existing where age is no longer a factor, Akhilesh said.  “The irony is that instead of observing the pandemic protocols, the ruling BJP is openly and blatantly flouting them at party events in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala. Prime Minister, union home minister and other party leaders are addressing election rallies and taking part in road shows as if coronavirus infection does not exist in those states,” Akhilesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-comprehensive-plan-to-tackle-covid-crisis-says-akhilesh/articleshow/81959600.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The government directive stated that “nobody can travel standing in the bus” from April 6-30, which has resulted in commuters sitting on all available seats. “It has reduced crowds in buses and conductors not only ensure that every commuter is seated, but check that all are wearing masks,” said BEST spokesperson Manoj Varade. Latest figures on Wednesday showed it ferried 20.3 lakh commuters on April 6, when the new rule came into effect as per the ‘break-the-chain’ mission. Officials said the average daily ridership on weekdays in the past month was 25.1 lakh, but ridership on Tuesday fell by nearly five lakh. Experts said the new rule will benefit BEST as buses often went packed and there was a “very high risk” of getting infected during travel. BEST officials said daily revenue collection dipped by Rs 22 lakh. Transport expert Gaurang Vora said that the BEST buses were a lifeline for the city. "Office goers, courier boys etc prefer the red bus for travel daily. Nobody wants to miss a bus as the frequency is bad on few routes, and therefore they board the first bus available. This has led to crowding in the buses and increased the risk of infection. It is good that now buses will have no standees -- and no commuter rubbing shoulders with another person," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-daily-ridership-falls-by-4-8-lakh/articleshow/81959607.cms||Somit Sen

The sad demise of the ex-captain of Under-15 cricket team of Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA) shocked the entire cricket fraternity. His family members alleged the deceased could not get bed in ICU or a bed with ventilator in private hospitals on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday. The doctor who attended to him told TOI, “He did not have any types of comorbidities. He tested positive a week ago and was in home isolation. He was a relative of a doctor friend, who called me at around 12.30am for a bed. I was shocked to hear SpO2 had depleted to 30-40.” The two doctor friends tried to find a bed with ventilators at some private hospitals but could not get any. “He was finally brought to casualty ward of my hospital, and died within 10 minutes at around 3.07am,” said the doctor. The last rites were performed at Ambazari ghat on Wednesday morning. “We are in shock and cannot believe that we lost him. He led the Under-15 VCA team and scored centuries in Poly Umrigar Trophy against Rajasthan and MP. He was among the few from Vidarbha to get selected for trials for Indian team to play Under-15 Asia Cup to be held later in Sharjah. He was the pride of St Xavier’s High School. He had stopped playing cricket a few years ago,” said his coach. One of his family members said, “He was unable to breath on Tuesday night. We and doctors under whom he was taking treatment tried their level best to get a bed immediately but could not. Finally, doctor managed an ambulance and bed but he did not survive.” Doctors from GMCH and IGGMCH said, “Some patients in home isolation are landing up in hospitals with SpO2 below 50. Patients should continuously monitor temperature, SpO2 and pulse rate, and should immediately report to a hospital in case of drop in any one of the parameters. Some patients are unable to survive with SpO2 below 50 at the time of admission.” As reported by TOI on Wednesday, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has no system to monitor parameters of positive patients in home isolation despite guidelines issued by the state government last month. NMC also miserably failed to ensure 50% of active patients are in Covid Care Centres (CCCs) for monitoring vital parameters in every four hours to prevent deaths. Around 80% patients are in home isolation and only around 1% in CCCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/34-yr-old-cricketer-reaches-hosp-with-o2-at-30-dies-within-10-min/articleshow/81957328.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Still, chances are high that you could be Covid-19 positive.Doctors across the state are coming across an increasing number of cases where patients test negative in RT-PCR but their high-resolution CT (HRCT) reveals significant infection in the lungs.The problem has become so acute that the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has issued a notification stating that the current strain of Covid-19 does not necessarily show a positive test on RT-PCR but the insurance companies and third-party administrators (TPAs) should treat them as Covid. “In cases where RT-PCR is negative but findings in HRCT and lab investigations are suggestive of viral etiology,the claim should be treated as that of Covid unless proved otherwise,” states VMC’s order issued under the Epidemic Diseases Act“I have come across patients who have tested negative in RT-PCR but their radiological tests revealed they require hospitalization. One patient’s score is 10 out of 25 in CT scan. This means that his lungs have already got affected,” said Dr Krutesh Shah, president of SETU, an Association of Private Hospitals of Vadodara.Infectious disease specialist Dr Hiten Kareliya says he has started asking Covid-19 suspects to undergo RT-PCR tests and HRCT chest early instead of earlier practice where a patient would be asked to undergo CT scan only a couple of days after the test.“We are seeing many cases where the patient has no symptoms or just mild fever and weakness but the infection spread to lungs rapidly,” said Kareliya“RT-PCR’s sensitivity is 70% which means there are 30 % chances of false negativity. But if there is evidence in CT scan, it is Covid-19. In such cases, we go for repeat tests which affirm infection majority of the times,” said Dr Niraj Chawda, MD, Nand Hospital.Similar cases are seen in Rajkot too. “There are a lot of cases where patients are testing negative for Covid, but CT scan reveals pneumonia. This may be happening due to limitations of sampling procedure and RT-PCR test itself which has an accuracy of about 70%,” said Dr. Jayesh Dobariya, critical care specialist in Rajkot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/rt-pcr-negative-but-you-may-still-be-infected-by-coronavirus/articleshow/81957331.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Allahabad||Raniganj MLA accuses SP Pratapgarh of assault||Prayagraj: A high voltage drama played out at the camp office cum residence of district magistrate, Pratapgarh, for more than two hours on Wednesday when ruling party MLA from Raniganj assembly seat, Dheeraj Ojha alias Abhay Kumar, sat on a dharna to protest against anomalies in the voters list being prepared for panchayat polls. The MLA accused superintendent of police (Pratapgarh) Akash Tomar of misbehaving with him and assaulting him. Coming out from DM camp office campus in a torn kurta, Ojha alleged, “I was assaulted by SP Pratapargh without any mistake. The SP is intentionally targeting me.” Videos of the incident with Ojha lying on the ground and shouting against the SP went viral on social media soon. SP (Pratapgarh) issued a clarification through a post on social media saying, “MLA Dheeraj Ojha was sitting on dharna at the residence of the district magistrate to protest against anomalies in voters list. When I asked him not to do so, he started leveling false allegations against me.” “The allegations are false, DM Nitin Bansal was also present with me during the entire episode,” said Tomar. Earlier, while sitting on dharna, the MLA said, “Local officials are not performing their duties sincerely and this forced me to sit on dharna.” “There are anomalies in voters list and local administration is not taking action against corrupt officials and goons,” he added. Ojha also claimed that he had informed officials about people grabbing government land and misuse of government schemes in many villages, but no action was taken. He also alleged that the Goonda Act was imposed on some people and other cases were registered but the administration did not take any action against them. The MLA refused to call off his dharna till the administration takes necessary action on his grievances. In the meantime, both DM and SP arrived at the spot and made a futile attempt to pacify the MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/raniganj-mla-accuses-sp-pratapgarh-of-assault/articleshow/81957581.cms||---

According to sources, the video was of Khakhrechi village in Maliya taluka, where the patients had queued up outside a private clinic. The Morbi district administration claimed that patients seen in the video were not Covid-19 infected. Jayesh Katira, chief district health officer (CDHO) Morbi said, “The video is of a private clinic. We have a primary health centre (PHC) in the village. We have been telling people to approach that PHC for health related issues, but they go to the private practitioners whom they trust.” This is the second such incident in Morbi in a week. Last week, a video of migrant labourers being treated on the floor of a ceramic factory had gone viral on social media. Box: BJP leader rebukes Morbi collectorRajkot: BJP leader Kanti Amrutiya allegedly rebuked Morbi district collector J B Patel over services at the government hospital in the district on Wednesday. A video of the incident went viral on social media. According to sources, when Patel visited the civil hospital in Morbi to review Covid-19 the situation, Amrutiya and his supporters allegedly questioned the collector over the services there.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal elections 2021: Four ex-European colonies on poll dance||KOLKATA: When residents of “mini-Europe” in the heart of Bengal cast their vote on Saturday, their political representatives will have their task cut out: Working harder for the cultural and commercial revival of the vibrant past of these former European outposts. Towns of Serampore, Chinsurah, Bandel and Chandernagore — all in Hooghly district — will be voting on Saturday. Residents of these former non-British colonies, have been asking their representatives to chalk out a holistic plan to preserve the art, culture and architecture in this region which is gradually decaying. A lot of work has been done but the residents feel the region’s potential as a tourist attraction is yet to be tapped properly. After Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer and first European to reach India, landed on India’s west coast in the 1490s, the Portuguese began to build a community in Bandel. The Dutch soon founded a settlement in Chinsurah, while the Danish set up an enclave in Serampore, followed by the French in Chandernagore. They built ports, warehouses, churches, forts, luxurious mansions, libraries and educational institutions in these towns, many of which still bear a testimony of those times. “This entire stretch along the Hooghly has immense tourism potential. The state government has taken steps to revive the glorious cultural and commercial past of this region, but we feel more needs to be done to tap the potential,” said Terrance D’Souza, who is a resident of Bandel and vice-principal of a local school. The pocket is already witnessing a slow but palpable revival. The four towns have become a definite feature in the must-watch lists of tourists visiting the state to savour a slice of Europe. The transport department has recently commenced a heritage cruise to tour the European outpost along the Hooghly. In Chinsurah, where the Dutch founded Fort Gustavus and traded in spices and textiles, most monuments are at the risk of getting ruined. “Both the central and state governments should give responsibility to people who know this subject and prepare a holistic plan to preserve this slice of European culture scattered across the country. This can be used for tourism,” said Debabrata Majumdar, a local resident and member of Chinsurah Project by the natives to promote the town on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/four-ex-european-colonies-on-poll-dance/articleshow/81957340.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Dehradun||HC asks Uttarakhand to try artificial rain to douse forest fires||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday directed the state government to explore the possibility of using artificial rainfall through cloud seeding to douse the forest fires raging in most of the hill districts of the state. The court also ordered the government to deliberate if the state disaster response force (SDRF) can be given helicopters and other modern equipment to tackle the wildfires, saying that it would be easier to douse them from the air. The directions came from the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma while hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) regarding the blazes. Though the PIL was initiated suo motu in 2018, it had been lying dormant since October that year. However, on Monday, an advocate brought the issue to the fore, following which the court started hearing the petition again. Meanwhile, the head of forest force (HoFF), Rajiv Bhartari, who was personally present before the court through video-conferencing, said that over 65% of the posts of forest guards and 82% posts of assistant chief conservator of forests are lying vacant in Uttarakhand. The official cited lack of staff and funds as major reasons behind the non-implementation of the action plan to control the forest fires in the state. Reacting to this, the court directed the state government to ensure that funds are provided to the concerned department so that these vacancies are filled, preferably in the next six months. “The forest department head informed the court that the department has an action plan to tackle the forest fires. However, it could not be implemented because of the shortage of staff and funds with the forest department. The court has now directed the government to provide funds so that all these vacancies are filled,” said Dushyant Mainali, the advocate on whose request the PIL is being heard again. Further, the court has also directed the state government to comply with the directions passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in August 2017 in the Rajiv Dutta case in six months. The NGT, in its judgement, had directed the state to ensure that enough manpower, financial resources and firefighting equipment are available with the concerned departments. The green body had also directed the state government to carry out forest fire mapping and involve locals in controlling forest fires and preventing such occurrences. “The NGT judgement also said that a network of automated surveillance and watchtowers should be created for timely detection and intervention. Even though it’s been almost four years since the judgement, the government is yet to comply with any of those directions,” Mainali added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/to-tackle-raging-forest-fires-uttarakhand-hc-directs-state-govt-to-explore-possibilities-of-artificial-rain-through-cloud-seeding/articleshow/81956289.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Vadodara||‘Insurers can’t cite VMC guidelines to reject claims’||Vadodara: With the new notification giving a protocol for admission of Covid-19 patients and inspection teams verifying if admissions were justified, many may be concerned about the fate of their medical insurances if the notification is made a ground for denying mediclaim. But experts and lawyers say that insurance companies cannot turn down claims on such grounds. “The civic body has only issued guidelines for regulating the availability of beds in such times. Since it is not a law, the insurance companies cannot use them for rejecting the claims,” said prominent lawyer Jaideep Verma. “Insurance companies and their third-party administrators cannot use these guidelines. Even if they do, how can they deny the fact that the patient has taken the treatment at the hospital?” said Akhil Dave, another lawyer who takes up insurance claims related cases. “Also, the policy is an agreement between a person and insurer wherein the latter says that whenever the policyholder needs help, they are there,” he added. The policy’s terms and conditions also do not mention that guidelines issued by a body like VMC will be binding on it. Time and again courts deciding insurance claim disputes have also stated that doctors are the authority on deciding the line of treatment and insurance company cannot challenge that. “Insurance companies may use the guidelines and reject the claims, but this justification will not stand in court,” said P V Moorjani, who runs a trust for consumer rights. “However, the consumer courts have always said that the doctors will only decide the treatment and whether hospitalization is required or not,” he added. Lately, a majority of private hospitals in the state are declining cashless treatment facility for Covid-19 to mediclaim policyholders. The hospitals on their part say that TPAs are delaying authorization letters as well as final settlements, which, even if approved are done with haphazard cuts in the final bills. As many as 20 approvals were put on hold by TPAs recently in Vadodara citing admission protocol notification that was issued by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/insurers-cant-cite-vmc-guidelines-to-reject-claims/articleshow/81956194.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Delhi||Govt readies for providing Covid shots at workplaces||New Delhi: The turnout for Covid vaccination dipped on Wednesday, with only 41,412 people getting the jab till 6pm as compared to 76,642 during the same time the day before. However, a major reason behind the dip is that government dispensaries carry out general vaccination on Wednesday and Friday and do not give Covid vaccines. A total of 22,951 people in the 45-59 age group got the jabs, while 10,119 above 60 years turned up for the first dose and 7,545 people beneficiaries for the second. Only three minor adverse events were reported on Wednesday. Delhi government is preparing to organise vaccination at public and private workplaces having 100 or more eligible and willing beneficiaries. The Centre has allowed vaccination at public and private workplaces with some conditions in a move to increase the coverage. “The government is ready to vaccinate all Delhiites and we want the Centre to remove the age restrictions. The district authorities will identify such workplaces and organise the sessions according to the central guidelines,” said an official. The vaccination is going on 24 hours at 34 government hospitals in Delhi. At all such hospitals, one third of the total vaccination sites function throughout the night. Out of the six vaccination sites at each of these hospitals, two function 24 hours. An official said the restrictions on travel from 10pm to 5am might also have contributed to the low turnout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-readies-for-providing-covid-shots-at-workplaces/articleshow/81958302.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Allahabad||Control room for instant response in fire cases set up||Prayagraj: After several recent incidents of ready harvest of wheat catching fire in the fields, resulting in heavy losses to farmers, a control room has been set up by the district administration for immediate action in cases of fire outbreaks and evaluation of loss. Last week, villagers in Nawabganj area had attacked revenue officials and policemen after a major fire erupted in fields over delay in response by fire tenders. It is worth mentioning that crops worth several lakhs are destroyed every year due to fire which occurs mainly in hot summer season. However, this year incidents of fire in fields are taking place early. In many of the incidents, farmers allege that fire started due to high tension wires passing over their fields, snapping and falling on the crops. To take immediate action in cases of fire, District Magistrate Bhanu Chandra Goswami ordered to set up a control room which will give instant response after receiving information about fire in the fields in any part of the district. ADM Finance and Revenue MP Singh said control room has been set up in the hall on the upper floor of Sangam Sabhagar at collectorate. The control room will function from 8am-10pm. In case of fire, information can be given on helpline number 0532-2641577, he added. The control room will function under Assistant Chakbandi Officer Vinay Singh. Four staff at the control room will work in two shifts. Besides, landline incidents of fire can be reported on mobile numbers 7905609585, 9415582431, 6306165699, 9450181328, 9628178162, 7007415224 . Instant action will be taken after receiving information and an enquiry will also be carried out by lekhpal of the concerned area. On Sunday, massive fire erupted in the fields at Jinha village under Nawabganj police station of trans-Ganga area.

She has appealed to the central and state governments to take the matter more seriously. Referring to the intense campaigning taking place in states like West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry where assembly elections have either just concluded or are taking place, the former UP chief minister said that the second wave must be taken more seriously by all governments and also by the people. “However, the blatant violation of Covid rules, especially in election rallies and roadshows, is extremely worrying. It is necessary for the government to pay attention to this,” she said. Mayawati had earlier appealed to the central and state governments to quicken the pace of vaccination in the country, demanding that the process should be made free for poor and vulnerable sections of society.

---||Allahabad||Health deptt deploys 50 RRTsfor approval of home isolation||Prayagraj: The re-emergence of Covid-19 crisis has put district health authorities in an overdrive to ensure proper treatment, care and isolation of patients to prevent further spread of the infection. Since most people opt for home isolation, the health department has deployed 50 Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) for inspection of requisite facilities, care at home of a patient. The permission for home isolation is granted only after the RRTs inspect the home of a patient and approve the facilities, living conditions and presence of a caregiver. Additional CMO (ACMO) and Nodal Officer (RRT) Dr Anil Kumar said only asymptomatic patients below 60 years can opt for home isolation if they have the requisite facilities at home and can avoid contact with other family members. For home isolation, patients must have a home quarantine kit comprising a pulse oximeter, thermometer, masks, sterile gloves, sodium hypochlorite and tablets of ashwagandha, giloy and vitamin C. “On an average, over 50% of patients without symptoms seek home quarantine facility. Once a patient applies for home isolation, an RRT is assigned to visit the home for inspection. The team compiles details including patient’s name, age, sex, address, ward no (number of monitoring committee), mobile number, date when they tested positive. The RRT also notes if there is cough, cold, breathlessness, blood pressure, blood sugar and oxygen saturation, besides details of any other ailment,” Dr. Kumar, added. Deputy Nodal Officer, Dr. Anupam Dwivedi said “Patients suffering from any other ailments are not eligible for home isolation facility. The RRT also verifies details like the number of rooms and toilets and family members. A total of 975 patients were under home isolation till April 6. As per guidelines, a caregiver should be available on 24x7 basis to tend to the patient and a communication link with the hospital is a prerequisite. The guidelines mandate that patients must download the Aarogya Setu app and it should remain active at all times. Officials said patients should monitor their health regularly and keep the district surveillance officer informed about the latest status. The patient also has to give an undertaking stating to voluntarily maintain strict self-isolation for the prescribed period. Immediate medical attention must be sought if there is difficulty in breathing, dip in oxygen saturation, persistent pain, pressure in chest and mental confusion persists. The Covid caseload crossed the 1,000 mark on Tuesday as 1,084 people tested positive in Prayagraj district in a day, and as many as 287 out of 1084 patients were granted permission for home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/health-deptt-deploys-50-rrtsfor-approval-of-home-isolation/articleshow/81957598.cms||Kapil Dixit
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: I told ministers I couldn’t do their bidding, says Sachin Waze||MUMBAI: Sachin Waze’s lawyer Rounak Naik said the handwritten letter the arrested API wanted to submit to the court was not accepted by the court. He said the court directed Waze to follow due procedure. Waze alleged that in November 2020, he was approached by a man who claimed he was “a very close person of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar”. The man, he said, explained to him about illegal “Gutkha and tobacco trade” in Maharashtra and gave him phone numbers. “The said Mr.. (man) insisted that I should collect a monthly amount of Rs 100 crores from these illegal Gutkha sellers,” the letter said. Waze claimed that when he refused to do such an illegal act, he was warned he may lose his post again. The letter said that in July/August 2020, Waze was called by Sena minister Parab to his official bungalow and asked to look into the SBUT (Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust) complaint, which was under preliminary enquiry, and told to bring the trustees for “negotiation” about the enquiry. “He also insisted to initiate primary talks to get Rs 50 crores from the SBUT in order to close the said enquiry. I had expressed my inability to do any such things as I do not know anyone from the SBUT and I also did not have any control over the enquiry,” the letter said. Waze further alleged that in January this year, Parab called him to his bungalow “and asked me to look into the enquiry against fraudulent contractors listed in the BMC”. “He told me to collect at least Rs 2 crores from about 50 such contractors. The said enquiry is undergoing on an anonymous complaint. The said enquiry was under preliminary enquiry in the CIU and until my transfer from the CIU nothing incriminating was found,” the letter said. Repeating Singh’s charge, Waze alleged that in January this year, Deshmukh had ordered him to extort Rs 3-3.5 lakh each from 1,650 bars and restaurants in the city. Waze said he told the then home minister that there are only about 200 bars. Turning down the minister’s demand, he claimed, “I also told the home minister sir that I would not be in a position to collect any amount from any such bar for him as it was beyond scope of my capabilities.” Waze claimed that when he left the meeting held at the minister’s bungalow ‘Dyaneshwari,’ the latter’s personal assistant advised him to comply with the demand if he wanted to keep his job and post. Waze said he had brought this meeting to the notice of then police commissioner (Singh). “I also expressed my apprehension that somewhere in the future I would be embroiled in a false controversy. The honourable CP sir encouraged me and categorically instructed me to not to involve in any such illegal collection of money from anyone and for anyone,” Waze stated. The letter said Waze’s reinstatement last June, following his suspension in 2004, was opposed by “agitators”. He said when NCP chief Sharad Pawar wanted his reinstatement revoked, Deshmukh had demanded Rs 2 crore from him to convince Pawar to let him stay on. “I had expressed my inability to pay such an amount. On this, the home minister sir asked me to pay in later course,” the letter said. Waze said that subsequently, he was posted at the criminal intelligence unit. He alleged that after a couple of months, Deshmukh reminded him about the payment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-i-told-ministers-i-couldnt-do-their-bidding-says-waze/articleshow/81958344.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Also, on Wednesday, the waiting period for cremation at city crematoriums went up to minimum four hours.This resulted in an altercation between the relatives of the deceased and the hospital administration, said sources.According to sources, the high number of deaths in the covid wards of the city hospitals has disturbed the cremation process. Rajkot has four crematoriums and each has a separate arrangement for cremating bodies as per Covid-19 protocol. Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) has set up a control room for cremation of bodies. Once it gives nod to hospitals, the body leaves for cremation. RMC commissioner Udit Agrawal said “We have made this arrangement (control room for cremation) for smooth functioning of the system. Looking to the number of death, we are trying our best to reduce waiting time.”Meanwhile, 490 fresh cases were reported from Rajkot district with 395 from the city area. This is the new peak for Rajkot district as well as city.

Hopeful of a breakthrough, shop owners’ federations agreed to hold off Thursday’s planned protests for two days as they await his response. Thackeray informed the wholesalers and retailers that the state would consider their demands and suggestions. He said the government did not want to hamper business and the only aim of the restrictions was to reduce crowds. “We are in this fight together. The government is not your enemy, we don’t want business to suffer. Give me two days to think about what can be done without adding to the risk of spreading the infection,” he said. Thackeray appealed to them not to talk about taking to the streets. “If the government decides to concede your demands, you will have to follow all the rules set by the government ,” he said. He said shop owners should get their employees tested and vaccinated. He urged them not to get “instigated” by the opposition party. Afterwards, associations like FAM deferred Thursday’s protests awaiting the chief minister’s response. CAMIT chairman Mohan Gurnani said: “We expressed our resentment to the CM, who said we are your friends and not enemies. He appreciates our problems and asked for two days to find some solution.” Viren Shah of FRTWA said: “The CM accepted that corona does not spread in shops where there is no crowd.” Traders in Kolhapur agreed to wait till Thursday evening for a decision. Sanjay Shete, president of the Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said from Friday they would defy the ban and if coercive action is taken, they would force essential supply shops to shut too. The traders’ body in Aurangabad district submitted a memorandum to the government demanding a relief package, failing which they sought permission to commit mass suicide. Representatives of the Association of Chartered Accountants and Company Secretaries, too, met Thackeray, who asked them for SOPs for staggered work hours.

Accompanied by her son and former Mainpuri MP Tej Pratap and her daughter-in-law Raj Lakshmi (Lalu Yadav’s daughter), Mridula reached the block office and filed her nomination papers for the post of block development council (BDC) member. Several Samajwadi Party leaders were present on the occasion. Saifai block, which was constituted in 1994, always had a pramukh, who was a member or closely associated with the Yadav clan. The 55 BDC members from the Saifai panchayat elect a block chief and out of those 55 all are often BDC members of the Samajwadi Party. For the first time, Ranveer Singh, son of Mulayam’s eldest brother Ratan Singh, was elected as the head of Saifai block. Ranveer, was elected as the block head of Saifai in 2000 again. However, after his sudden demise in 2002, the responsibility of the block head of Saifai in 2003 was given to Dharmendra Yadav, son of Mulayam’s younger brother Abhayram Yadav. Dharmenra vacated the seat a year later when he was elected as MP from Mainpuri in the 2004 Lok Sabha byelections as Mulayam vacated the seat after becoming the chief minister in 2003. Thereafter. Mulayam’s close confidante Nathu Singh’s nephew Arvind Yadav remained as the block head till the responsibility was passed on to Ranvir’s son and Mulayam’s grandson Tej Pratap, who became the block pramukh in 2011. He vacated the seat in 2014 after he was elected from the Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat. Thereafter, Tej Pratap’s mother Mridula took over at the new pramukh of Saifai block. To recall, Saifai block head seat was initially declared reserved under SC (women) category, but state election commission had recently announced fresh delimitation of the block and declared it reserved under OBC category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/lalus-in-law-mridula-yadav-filespapers-for-bdc-member-in-saifai/articleshow/81957555.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Kochi||HC asks EC to provide reason||Kochi: The Kerala High Court on Wednesday asked the  Commission to place on record the reasons for postponing the elections to three Rajya Sabha seats in the state. The tenure of Rajya Sabha members from Kerala — Vayalar Ravi of Congress, K K Ragesh of CPM and P V Abdul Wahab of Indian Union Muslim League — will end on April 21. Justice PV Asha’s directive came while hearing petitions filed by Legislative Assembly secretary and S Sharma MLA for a court directive to conduct the elections during the currency of the present Legislative Assembly. The elections were originally scheduled from April 12 to 16. A counsel representing the Election Commission had submitted that notification for the Rajya Sabha elections will be issued before April 21. However, counsels representing the petitioners questioned why the election schedule has not been announced. After announcing that the notification will be issued on March 24, a communication comes out on 24th that election is deferred as a reference has been received from Union ministry of law and justice. Now, the Election Commission is submitting that the polls would be held before April 21 but no reason has been given for such actions, the counsel pointed out. Though the Election Commission’s counsel argued that the initial announcement about the polls was not a notification in terms of Representation of the People Act and that reasons for postponement will be published later, the court directed for informing the reason by filing a statement by Friday. The Election Commission had on March 29 informed the court that elections to the three Rajya Sabha seats will be conducted within the statutory period. A submission in this regard was made by advocate Deepu Mohan Lal, the standing counsel for the Election Commission. During the hearing, Election Commission’s counsel had submitted that all timeframes are statutorily fixed and the commission has to abide by it while fixing dates. It had issued a communication on March 26 that date will be fixed within statutory period. The petitions are based on apprehension as the legislative assembly has not been dissolved and the retirements happen only on April 21, the counsel had submitted. The Election Commission is fully conscious of the statutory scheme and election will be conducted, the counsel had submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-asks-ec-to-provide-reason/articleshow/81957352.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Health workers fret over 24-hour jabs amid movement curbs||NEW DELHI: Both beneficiaries and healthcare workers at various hospitals have raised concerns over the operation of vaccination centres in late hours amid movement restrictions since 10pm. They argue that people are coming from far-flung areas using public transport. Even with an e-pass, it will be extremely difficult to return home without public transport, said a beneficiary. Doctors and nurses at both private and civic hospitals pointed out that if the movement restrictions continued for long, even the staffers coming from the rest of NCR would face difficulty and might resist working late. “Hindu Rao Hospital in the north and Swami Dayanand in east Delhi are operational for 12 hours and Girdhari Lal Maternity Hospital for 24 hours,” said a senior doctor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation. “We are ready to divide the staff in shifts and even work longer hours as we have limited staff. But how will we find any mode of communication after 10pm? Finding taxis, autos or reaching nearby Metro stations will be a challenge even if we carry identity cards.” Healthcare workers also claimed that the footfall in late hours was comparatively low and there were barely four-five visitors till 9pm. “We may have thought about making some arrangement for the stay of staffers coming from other parts of NCR at the hospital but we don’t know how long this exercise will continue. Also, a Covid ward may soon be opened in our hospital again, so we can’t afford to allow people to stay back,” said a nodal officer of a private hospital in east Delhi. Considering that the turnout response is good at local dispensaries, nursing homes and mother and child care centres, doctors suggested starting vaccination facilities in neighbourhoods like Gurgaon. “We are getting good response at hospitals such as Purnima Sethi Multi-Specialty Hospital where the turnout is more than 400, but we have even better response at local dispensaries where 150-200 people are coming for vaccination. Since these are located close to households, people don’t fear catching infection unlike in big hospitals,” said Narendra Chawla, leader of house at South Delhi Municipal Corporation. Procuring an e-pass won’t be easy, said north corporation mayor Jai Prakash, who claimed to have written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for reviewing the extension decision. Despite repeated attempts, Delhi government didn’t respond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/health-workers-fret-over-24-hr-jabs-amid-movement-curbs/articleshow/81958327.cms||Vibha Sharma

The gap between two Covaxin shots can range from 28 to 42 days.A six-member team of doctors and nurses went to Pawar’s residence along with a life-support ambulance. After the vaccination, Pawar tweeted: “Coincidentally, today is World Health Day. On this occasion, I urge all citizens to take active part in the fight against this virus by completing the Covid vaccination process as soon as possible.”The state has been pushing for mobile units to be used to boost vaccination rates and as a benefit to bedridden or elderly people. Public health activist Ravi Duggal said the provision should be extended to everyone and not just the privileged. “This is not surprising that he gets this facility at home. Yes, there would be many bedridden persons who should get domiciliary access but providing such access for vaccination should not be done without provision of emergency care in case there is an adverse reaction like anaphylactic shock or other serious event,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/just-out-of-hosp-pawar-gets-2nd-vax-shot-at-home/articleshow/81959312.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune: In home isolation? You may have to sign Rs 25,000 ‘bond’||PUNE: Covid-19 patients opting for home quarantine may soon have to give an undertaking stating that they will follow all isolation norms or pay Rs25,000 as fine. Legal experts and activists slammed the Pune civic body’s move, saying it would do more harm than good during the pandemic. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is contemplating to make such an undertaking/bond mandatory. “If a patient leaves home and breaks the isolation rules, he/she will have to pay Rs25,000. The patients will be monitored using different methods,” additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal told reporters on Wednesday. According to the PMC officials, over 35,000 patients are in home isolation in the PMC limits. “We have appealed to patients to follow the home isolation norms, but some of them are blatantly violating the rules. So, the step of taking the bond has been contemplated,” said Agarwal, adding that an order giving details about the bond would be issued in a couple of days. Activists vehemently opposed the proposal. “If the order is meant to create psychological pressure on rule violators, then it can be understood. But this is a very impractical solution. It will have an adverse impact on the civic administration. If all those staying in home isolation revolt and demand institutional quarantine, will the PMC be able to accommodated them?” asked Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ forum. Legal practitioner Vishal Jadhav also opposed the move, saying it would set a wrong precedent. “Such an order may amount to infringement on people’s rights. Though the epidemic Act has given enormous powers to authorities, they should be used wisely. The aim of the action should be reformation and not just charging a heavy fine,” he said. Asim Sarode, another legal expert, termed the move “irrational”. “It is unfortunate that a health crisis is being used to mint money. How can the PMC assure that the monitoring will be accurate?” he asked. Agarwal said the monitoring would be physical and virtual. PMC staffers would pay surprise visits to the homes of positive patients, she said. When the violation is proven, the defaulters would have to pay Rs25,000. Abhijit More, a medical practitioner and health activist, said that PMC was trying to wash its hands off the responsibility and putting the burden on citizens. “Many PMC-run Covid care centres started last year have been shut down. People have been left with no option but to stay in home isolation,” he said. According to the civic officials, if a patient tests positive for Covid-19, the information reaches the civic administration from the lab. Those who wish to stay in home isolation need to give that in writing to the civic administration. A PMC official said facilities like separate room, washroom and presence of a caregiver were a must for home quarantine. Now one more document — the bond — would be added to it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-home-isolation-you-may-have-to-sign-rs25k-bond/articleshow/81958338.cms||---

The DMs of such districts will also take a call on extending closure of educational institutions based on local conditions. The CM said that he would be carrying out a surprise inspection of Prayagraj, Varanasi and Gorakhpur while directing the health minister and health education minister to tour districts and based on local conditions to issue directions for curbing the rise of Covid-19 cases. The government has identified Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Kanpur Nagar, Gorakhpur, Meerut, Gautam Budh Nagar, Jhansi, Bareilly, Ghaziabad, Agra, Saharanpur and Moradabad where rate of infection is rising, claiming that there has been a fall in positivity rate in some of these districts. Special secretary level officers will be deputed in all these sensitive districts as nodal officers. Meanwhile, anticipating the return of migrant workers from Maharashtra and some southern states in light of increasing cases there and also the upcoming panchayat elections in the state, the CM has said that rapid antigen testing should be done at airports, railway stations and bus stops. With special trains to be started from Maharashtra and other states in the coming days, the CM said, it is necessary to maintain strict vigil in Gorakhpur, Gonda, Basti and nearby districts where most people are expected to return. “Increase contact tracing and ensure that nigrani samitis and integrated command and control centres are active. Those not wearing masks should be fined,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/take-call-on-curbs-but-ensure-essential-services-cm-to-dms/articleshow/81959620.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Civic authorities inspected the facility before giving a nod. “Availability of vaccines on campus will give a boost to our fight against the pandemic and we hope that our students (who are mostly under 45 years) will be allowed to get vaccines in the near future as this is very much required to bring the campus back to life,” said Chaudhuri on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-sets-up-vaccination-facility-on-its-campus/articleshow/81958353.cms||---

These would help ascertain if there is a new mutant strain of the virus in the state.Last month, the central health ministry had announced that it had found a “double mutant” strain in over 200 samples from Maharashtra, but added it is not the cause for the second wave. The double mutant variant, with mutations E484Q and L452R, is specific to India.Tope said if the NCDC reports are made available, the state public health officials could work on changing the treatment protocols in those areas from where the strains were collected. The second wave sweeping across Maharashtra has so far been characterised by asymptomatic and mild cases. “Most cases wouldn’t have been detected if they were not tested as part of the contact tracing programme,” said a public health department doctor.State health officials said the issue of sharing detailed sequencing reports had been raised in meetings earlier with the Union health secretary, but there has been no response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fear-mutant-at-play-want-reports-from-centre-tope/articleshow/81958862.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Delhi||More units to monitor seismic activity in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Owing to a large number of earthquakes hitting Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR) over the last one year, National Center for Seismology (NCS) on Wednesday said it had deployed additional earthquake recording instruments to closely monitor seismic activity. Additional machines have also been deployed to carry out field studies in the region, which will characterise sub-surface structures, officials said. NCR had been experiencing a number of minor and medium-intensity earthquakes between April and August 2020. During this spell, the epicentre of the earthquakes was found to be located in areas such as northeast Delhi, Rohtak, Sonipat, Baghpat, Faridabad and Alwar. The seismology centre, which falls under the ministry of earth sciences, said experts were consulted before 11 additional temporary field stations were deployed in the months of May and June 2020, which are currently operational. It said magnetotelluric (MT) geophysical surveys, which involve measurement of the time-varying electric and magnetic fields to determine distribution of electrical conductivity in the subsurface, had being carried out in collaboration with Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG), Dehradun, across the Moradabad Fault (in Moradabad and its surrounding areas) and Great Boundary Fault (in Bareilly and its surrounding areas). “The MT survey has been completed across major faults of the Delhi region such as Mahendragarh-Dehradun Fault, Sohna Fault, Mathura Fault, Moradabad Fault and Great Boundary Fault. The data analysis is in progress,” said NCS on Wednesday. A total of nine earthquakes have been recorded in the Delhi region in the last three months, with their magnitude ranging between 1.8 and 2.9 and were mostly located in west Delhi, south-west Delhi, Rohtak, Sonipat, Baghpat, Bahadurgarh and Ghaziabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-units-to-monitor-seismic-activity-in-city/articleshow/81958340.cms||---

Singh was heading the city police when Waze registered the case of planting gelatin sticks. Waze headed the Crime Intelligence Unit and reported directly to Singh on almost every investigation. Even after the case was transferred to the ATS and then NIA, Waze used to meet Singh in his chamber and hold meetings.Waze probed several high profile cases at the elite CIU. NIA wanted to find out from Singh about Waze’s reading of the case, his questioning of Hiran on his vehicle being used. “This is to ascertain what all Singh knew about the case. We also require some clarity on some other issues,” an official said.Singh arrived at the NIA office at around 9.30am and left around 1 pm. Singh was removed from the city police chief’s post last month and appointed DG (Home Guards).NIA also questioned former inspector Pradeep Sharma. The encounter specialist had worked under Singh when he was Thane city police commissioner. Sharma, who was dismissed from service for his links with the underworld, returned to the force following a court order and was posted as senior inspector of the anti-extortion cell in 2018.Sharma was grilled about his alleged meeting with Waze days before Hiran’s death. Cop Vinayak Shinde, arrested with Waze in this case, was an accused along with Sharma in the fake encounter of Chhota Rajan aide Lakhan Bhaiya in 2006. Sharma was the only one acquitted in the case. Waze was in Sharma’s team in 2004 when the custodial death of 2002 terror suspect Khwaja Yunus took place. Since then Waze was under suspension for 17 years before his controversial reinstatement last June. In 2019, Sharma resigned from the police force to contest the assembly election on a Shiv Sena ticket. He lost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nia-questions-param-bir-pradeep-sharma/articleshow/81958597.cms||Ahmed Ali

A formal notification in this regard is, however, still expected. A meeting of the representatives of the chemist associations in the city was called by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) on Tuesday evening. VMC officials insisted in the meeting that the chemists should not sell Remdesivir vials in retail and the stocks should go to hospitals. The chemists, however, insisted that they would not sell the drug if the administration could ensure that the injections were sold at Rs 1,680 price by hospitals. The chemists have claimed that they are selling the drug at this price even as hospitals were charging amounts as high as Rs 5,400 per vial, which was the maximum retail price (MRP) of a particular brand. “The MRP ranges from Rs 899 to Rs 5,400 even as the landing costs and the price charged by the distributors is much low. We are willing to sell the injection at Rs 1,680 in retail, which is beneficial to consumers. Also, we asked the VMC to ensure that hospitals do not write prescriptions and hand them over to patients if they are being given stocks directly,” said Gujarat State Druggist and Chemist Association president, Alpesh Patel. “There is shortage of antiviral drug – Remdesivir – because of surge in number of Covid-19 patients. There is a demand-supply gap and hence we are currently managing it through barter system within our own circles,” said Dr Krutesh Shah, president of the association of private hospital in the city SETU. City unit BJP president Dr Vijay Shah, who coordinated between hospitals, chemists and officials to resolve the issue said that the hospitals had agreed to provide the vaccine for around Rs 1,700. He said that the notification in this regard would be brought out shortly. The BJP has also started services to provide packed food to persons who are in home isolation and for immersing the ashes of deceased Covid positive persons. Officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao, however, said that there was no official intimation in this regard so far. He said that the state government was looking into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/remdesivir-to-be-sold-at-rs-1700-bjp-city-unit-claims/articleshow/81956343.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Covid-19 claims 40 lives in 24 hours in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Covid-19 has claimed 40 lives in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of deaths to 8,964 on Thursday. Going by the official bulletin on Covid-19, this is 1.7 times of the number of deaths reported in March. Consider this: as many as 87 persons died due to the complications caused by the coronavirus in March whereas 153 persons have lost their life to the pandemic infection in the first seven days of April. Clearly, the jump in loss of lives is 75.86%. Alarmed over such rapid loss of lives, experts noted that the key to check the spread of pandemic virus, disease and deaths was in the hands of the people. “Viruses change as they circulate, and these changes may alter the virus characteristics. It’s key to stop the spread of the virus at its source: maintain hand hygiene, physical distancing, masking and all other measures to reduce transmission,” said Dr Madhup Bajpai, WHO regional team leader for UP field office. Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases continued to increase. As many as 6,023 new cases in the past 24 hours took the tally to 6,45,351. The daily average of cases is comparable to the situation in the first week of September. The gap between new cases and new recoveries continued to remain high which added to the number of active infections. While 1,484 recoveries were recorded in the past 24 hours the number of active cases went up to 31,987. The jump in active cases was about 16% from the previous day. Health officials stated that over 12,000 persons were undergoing treatment at government and private hospitals, while the remaining are under home isolation. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad urged people to follow Covid-19 prevention protocol in individual and general interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/apr-1st-week-deaths-more-than-mar-nos/articleshow/81959677.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Kolkata||Wooing high-rises high on candidates’ checklist||Kolkata: Poll candidates across parties are drawing up separate strategies and pointers to woo the block of residents at housing complexes spread across Behala, Tollygunge, Kasba and Jadavpur constituencies. Housing complexes feature among the top half of the checklist for every candidate as they contribute to a large number of voters inside a gated premise who can make or break a closely fought contest in assembly elections. Residents of high-rises on both sides of the EM Bypass, however, said they are not allowing entry to any political parties to campaign. “Multiple political parties approached us but we had to turn them down as it goes against our privacy policy. Besides, owing to the Covid situation, we can’t take any chances,” said Nilanjan Das, secretary of the flat owners association at Upohar condominium. In Behala West constituency, from which TMC heavyweight leader Partha Chatterjee is contesting against Tolly-star Srabanti Chatterjee, there is around 25 high-rise complexes with more than 250 voters. The residential societies have emerged as a lucrative campaigning field in the upcoming assembly elections. Chatterjee, who had an informal adda with the residents of Diamond City West on Ho-Chi-Minh Sarani, regularly visits the housing complex. Chatterjee highlighted bringing dedicated water connection to several housing complexes in his constituency as one of the major developments done by him. “Our housing complex is within ward No. 127. We are yet to receive a separate water connection but we have been informed it should arrive soon ,” said Deepak Agarwal, president of the Diamond City West Apartment Owners Association. Merlin Jabakusum, another residential complex, has around 300 voters. “We have been allotted a water connection for our complex,” said Sourav Roy, president of the Merlin Jabakusum Society. The residents have also received support during the pandemic from the government and Chatterjee. Sharing her campaign strategy for housing complexes, Jadavpur’s BJP candidate Rinku Naskar said: “We are asking our supporters to transmit our message to their friends and acquaintances living in these complexes so that our message gets spread even without us entering the complex,” said Naskar. Jadavpur’s CPIM candidate Sujan Chakraborty, however, sought a different strategy. “I have earmarked a flat belonging to a party acquaintance inside the complex and we are sitting there in an informal adda. There, we are calling some flat owners and sharing our vision with them,” said Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wooing-high-rises-high-on-candidates-checklist/articleshow/81957371.cms||Somdatta Basu
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Househelp allowed beyond 8pm all days, delivery 24x7||MUMBAI: BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal issued directives on Wednesday allowing delivery boys, domestic help, drivers and other service staff to carry on their work beyond the 8pm lockdown rule and on all days of the week. The new directives also clarified who would be allowed movement during the weekend lockdown in the city under the government’s ‘Break the Chain’ order. These include online food and essential supply delivery, roadside food stalls that provide takeaway services, students and candidates who must appear for competitive exams, househelp, cooks and drivers. Lockdown guidelines currently in force in Mumbai restrict movement beyond 8pm. Chahal, in the civic circular, has said house help, drivers, nurses and medical attendants who provide services to senior citizens and ailing people at home are allowed movement between 7am and 10pm on all days. The government, in its April 5 order, had said the local disaster management authority would need to decide on allowing domestic help, drivers and cooks to work past 8pm and on weekends. Meanwhile, all home delivery of food and essential supplies through online service providers and apps is allowed 24 hours on all days in the week. It has also been clarified that during the weekend lockdown, takeaway from restaurants in person is not permitted, though home delivery is allowed. The government directive had stated that takeaway orders, parcels and home delivery services were to be allowed only between 7am and 8pm, and not for 24 hours. During the weekend lockdown, roadside food stalls, including fruit stalls, are allowed to provide parcels or takeaway services. No person can stand around and consume the food. Importantly, all students or candidates who have to attend various exams, including competitive entrance tests, are allowed to make necessary movement during the weekend lockdown and their exam hall tickets should be considered valid for the purpose. They are allowed to be accompanied by one guardian or parent too. The state government on Wednesday also issued a clarification stating food shops that have been listed as essential services also include those for poultry, meat and fish. The order stated that supply of gas will now be included under essential services too, apart from financial institutions and offices of Sebi-recognised market infrastructure institutions.

---||Lucknow||NDC panel hails UP govt for makeover of primary schools||Lucknow: A 32-member delegation of the National Defence College (NDC), which is currently in Uttar Pradesh, on Wednesday visited a government primary school in Baskhi ka Talab area of the state capital and appreciated the make-over of campuses that was done under Yogi government’s dream project Operation Kayakalp. The NDC, comprising six army officers from Indonesia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Afghanistan, went around the campus and were largely impressed by the cleanliness and upkeep of classrooms and staff rooms. Sharing their thoughts with the school staff, the delegation members said Operation Kayakalp has changed the very face of government schools in UP. The high-ranking delegation also visited an anganwadi centre and congratulated the government officials for their efforts. The delegation, said government officials, was 'pleasantly surprised' to know that over 93,000 primary schools out of 1.3 lakh in UP have already undergone transformation in terms of infrastructure and were now all set for installation of modern facilities in the classrooms and teaching tools. The members of delegation also raised queries about the government's scheme on providing free books, school bags, shoes, socks and sweaters to the primary school students facing financial hardships. The officials were told that with CM’s efforts, the basic education department saw an increase of 54 lakh students this year. Praising the Yogi government for doing such a great work for the makeover of anganwadi centres, the delegation members noted that anganwadi centres were aptly interactive and more child-friendly. “Facilities like creche and smart teaching and learning aid available at these centres are meaningful,” said a member of the delegation. They also stopped by a pond where the delegation was told that the UP government has announced that a pond will be built in every village - an initiative to be financed through MNREGA to provide employment to migrant labourers. Rohit Sharma, senior Indian Revenue Service officer and coordinating officer of the delegation, said that the visiting officers, drawn from various armed forces and civil departments, were completely smitten by the beauty and flawless maintenance of these places. They were also briefed by additional chief secretary, department of micro, small and medium enterprises, Navneet Sehgal about the One District One Product (ODOP) scheme, the flagship initiative of the Yogi Adityanath-led UP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ndc-panel-hails-up-govt-for-makeover-of-primary-schools/articleshow/81959685.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||The other khaki: Why this ‘force’ on Delhi roads is caught in the middle||NEW DELHI: It might not be incorrect to say that for many Delhiites, their first brush with the words ‘civil defence’ was when they saw them emblazoned on high visibility vests worn by volunteers who held up placards on the roadsides on the merits of the odd-even road rationing scheme in 2016. In the five years since, they were deployed in large numbers for the two subsequent odd-even schemes and Delhi government’s anti-pollution 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign for cars to switch off at traffic lights last year. Along with the Home Guard, the Civil Defence Volunteers, or CDVs, are also deployed in public buses as marshals. With the city in the grip of Covid-19, CDVs are back on the roads, this time to assist the authorities in enforcing Covid precautions and prosecuting violators. Their gear too has become more formal — khaki uniform, belts, shoulder loops, arm patches, lanyards and sharp-looking maroon berets or fatigue caps. The getup has led to confusion sometimes between them and Delhi Police, and perhaps the sense of authority imparted by the dress has something to do with an increasing number of complaints about the CDVs’ high-handedness, particularly with regard to penalising people. On their part, the volunteers claim to be at the receiving end of public ire whenever they fulfil their responsibility, the latest being to fine those not wearing the mandatory mask. That they have no authority to prosecute violators and can only assist officials authorised to issue challans sometimes pushes people into their worst behaviour, complained CDVs. A state government official said the volunteer force was set up by the government of India under its civil defence policy, brought under the Defence of India Act in 1962 and then The Civil Defence Act in 1968. “The Civil Defence got its present form then, along with the uniform and rules and regulations. The khaki uniform has always existed and hasn’t suddenly appeared now,” the official said. The uniform, however, is no guarantee against road rage or ire at being fined Rs 2,000. “People use extremely bad language once they realise we are not policemen,” said one aggrieved volunteer. “Some get really aggressive and it is not easy hauling up the violators.” The growing animosity was visible during the scuffle between the CDVs and road users near the IIT intersection in south Delhi on Tuesday when a motorist was flagged down for not wearing a mask. The fight that followed led to police registering two FIRs and a protest by CDVs outside the office of the district magistrate (South). In the last one year, the volunteers have been the muscle behind the measures taken to tackle the spread of Covid. Their deployment and work ranged from manning access points at containment zones to doorstep delivery of essentials in sealed areas, guarding quarantine facilities, distributing food to the poor and homeless, managing crowds at ration distribution centres and of late, helping authorities in creating awareness about Covid-appropriate behaviour and in prosecution drives. Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot looked at the problem from the CDVs’ perspective when he said, “If you look at the overall picture and the amount of work done by CDVs, incidents like the IIT scuffle are rare. The volunteers deployed in active duty number around 35,000, including around 14,000 in transport buses.” The minister added, “Such incidents do happen and will happen in the future too. But every incident has to be seen in the right perspective, and keeping in mind the facts and circumstances.” The life of a CDV is not easy, not even remunerative, receiving an allowance for voluntary work per day when deployed. While the amount given was around Rs 500 in 2016, it has been raised to Rs 783 now. Even though the allowance is not a huge draw, for many CDVs, this income is welcome and enhanced by public respect. “You feel a sense of belonging and camaraderie with other volunteers, many of whom are yet to get a fulltime job,” said one volunteer. “Then, there is also the sense of power, of being part of a ‘force’. You only have to be 18 years old and physically fit to join Civil Defence. There are no exacting recruitment standards like in the police force. I feel proud of my uniform and of doing something for the country.” The government official said, “Unlike in the odd-even days when their role was to create awareness, now the CDVs are not only promoting Covid safety norms, but also enforcing them, having been deployed by the district administrations. The district magistrate is the ‘controller’ who decides where they are deployed. They don’t act independently. So if there are a few cases of excess, you can’t blame the institution, which has done extraordinary work for decades.” BJP writes to Baijal, demands change of uniform for volunteers  In the wake of recent controversy involving civil defence volunteers, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor on Wednesday wrote to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal seeking his attention towards the complaints of harassment and corruption levied against them. He demanded an inquiry into the process of enrolment of these volunteers and their duty deployment. He also sought that their uniform, which is similar to Delhi Police personnel, be changed. The complaints came after a few civil defence volunteers stopped small goods carrying vehicles and asked for e-bills etc, which fall outside their domain, for extortion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-other-khaki-why-this-force-on-delhi-roads-is-caught-in-the-middle/articleshow/81958349.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The body of soldier Sunil Shinde (39) was found buried under a heap of snow three days ago and was brought home on Wednesday. The martyred solider is survived by two school children — a daughter who studies in class 4 and a 14-year-old son studying in class 9 — besides his wife and elderly parents. Shinde’sbody was brought home early morning after which army personnel and his family members performed the last rites. Shinde and a few other army personnel had gone missing during a rescue operation which they had been engaged in in January. It was during this rescue operation that Shinde had been reported missing. Shinde’s family members said that they received a call from army personnel three days ago informing them that his body had been found as the snow had cleared up. The body, wrapped in the Tricolour, reached Badlapur around 1.30 am by his colleagues from the Indian Army. As word had already spread in the neighbourhood that the body would be brought home at that late hour, locals had gathered around his residence to pay their last respects to the soldier. The last rites were performed at the Majarli crematorium in Badlapur. Shinde, whose family hailed from Osmanabad district of Maharashtra, had joined the Indian Army 13 years ago, said a member of his family.He had been serving in the engineering department. Two years ago, he was posted in the Leh region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-badlapur-soldiers-kids-say-final-bye-to-dad-found-buried-in-snow/articleshow/81959689.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Chandigarh||Day after attack on BJP MP’s car, 4 BKU activists arrested||SHAHABAD: Farmers, under the banner of BKU Haryana (Charuni), on Wednesday gheraoed the Shahabad police station in Kurukshetra district after four workers of the farm outfit were arrested for allegedly attacking the vehicle of Kurukshetra MP Nayab Singh Saini on Tuesday. The protesters demanded that the charge of attempt to murder be dropped from FIR. The arrested men were produced in the court, which sent them to judicial custody. A case against 11 identified BKU workers and 8 to 10 others, who are unidentified, has been registered under sections 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 307 (attempt to murder), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the IPC at Shahabad police station. Police officials said they had a video of the incident, in which protesters can be seen confronting the MP’s vehicle, attempting to forcibly bring him out and smashing the windshield. “Four identified accused have been arrested. Other accused are being identified on the basis of the video and action will be taken on the basis of facts,” they said. Though police did not reveal the names of the arrested men, sources in BKU said all four — Kulwinder Singh of Majri Mohalla, Gurmeet Singh of Mamumajra, Hakam Singh of Ratangarh village and Kehar Singh of Damli village — were residents of Shahabad block. Soon after the arrests, BKU Haryana (Charuni) state spokesperson Rakesh Kumar Bains and senior leader Jasbir Singh Mamumajra led hundreds of farmers in raising slogans against the government at Shahabad police station. They demanded the release of the arrested workers and demanded that Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code be dropped as it was not relevant. “It is injustice with farmers, to silence their voice,” said Rakesh. To control the situation, Shahabad DSP Atma Ram and Pehowa DSP Gurmail Singh called five farm leaders to the police station and held a meeting with them for about one hour. The farmers ended their protest after the meeting. “We have assured to conduct a fair investigation, on the basis of the facts. The case registered will be reviewed and carried forward accordingly,” DSP Atma Ram said. Rakesh said, “No such crime has been committed that the police should add Section 307 of the IPC and arrest our union workers. These are attempts to suppress the voice of farmers. We held discussions with the police. They asked for facts from us and we have given them the same. The police have assured to review the case within three days and submit their report before the court accordingly. But we are not satisfied with the police assurance and have called a panchayat at Shahabad on April 12.” A press release issued by the police states: “On April 6, 2021, Kurukshetra MP Nayab Singh Saini had come from Naraingarh to Shahabad to the house of Inderjeet in Majri Mohalla for personal work. At the same time, BKU members had gathered to gherao the house of Shahabad MLA Ram Karan Kala. Farmers came to know about the arrival of MP in Shahabad and the BKU members went to gherao him in Majri Mohalla.” “When the MP was about to leave in his car, the BKU members raised slogans against him and showed him black flags. They tried to open the door of the MP’s car... Some protesters even... smashed the rear windshield of his vehicle. In this incident, the MP had a narrow escape and was safely evacuated with the help of a police team,” it adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/day-after-attack-on-bjp-mps-car-4-bku-activists-arrested/articleshow/81958341.cms||JK Singh

---||Chandigarh||Three Punjab ministers to meet Piyush Goyal today to talk DBT||CHANDIGARH: Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and PWD minister Vijay Inder Singla will accompany state food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu to meet Union food minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday to discuss the contentious issues of direct benefit transfer (DBT) to farmers and slashing of the state’s share of rural development fund (RDF). “The chief minister has reiterated that arhtiyas (commission agents) will continue to be in the picture. However, at the same time, we have to protect the system (of procurement). In case of a scenario where the Centre continues to insist on DBT... then to safeguard the interests of the stakeholders, we will work out a plan,” Ashu told media persons on Wednesday. However, he denied that testing of the DBT system had begun. Punjab Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh will also be present in the meeting to put forth the state government’s point of view. Singla has been asked to attend the meeting as his uncle was the head of arhtiyas’ association in the state. Meanwhile, there are indications that the state government may have to put in place ‘Plan B’ to ensure that the forthcoming wheat procurement is not affected if the Centre continues to stick to its demand for DBT. Ashu, who left for Delhi after attending a video conferencing with chief minister Amarinder Singh in the evening, added, “Apart from the issue of DBT, the issue of RDF and shortage of space for storing food grains are also on agenda for the meeting.” “Piyush Goyal talks of transparency but for the past three seasons, we have been making online payments to farmers but through arhtiyas. There is no way that arhtiyas can tamper with the payment. This time, too, payments will be made to farmers within 48 hours,” he added. Ashu had an hour-long meeting with Goyal through video conferencing on Tuesday, but the Union minister reportedly insisted that the state switch to DBT as it is only Punjab that is making e-payments through arhtiyas. “I tried to convince the Union minister that Punjab is a state that contributes crops to the central pool and its production is more than consumption. The state has to be, therefore, treated differently,” he said. The minister added that the Centre had to issue a cash credit limit for the forthcoming wheat procurement as Punjab government has maintained healthy accounts for the past four years, unlike the previous SAD-BJP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/3-pb-ministers-to-meet-goyal-today-to-talk-dbt/articleshow/81958358.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Delhi||Delhi: No permanent jobs, DBCs threaten stir from April 20||NEW DELHI: Unhappy with the apathetic attitude of councillors and municipal officials towards domestic breeding checkers’ demand to regularise them as field workers, the DBC associations have decided to go on strike from April 20. The associations have started holding protests at the zonal offices since Tuesday. These workers, who are primarily responsible for doing household surveys to check mosquito breeding and guiding field workers for spraying of mosquitoes for 25 years, claim to be involved in multiple other tasks such as checking open defecation, and property and toll tax collection. The deliberative wings of the municipal corporations are insisting on creating new posts for them by changing the MCD Act and getting the central government’s permission, though the Centre last year banned creating new posts in government departments. The associations claim that despite requesting the deliberative and the executive wings for enrolling them against vacant posts of field workers — there is no official post called DBC in the Act — the corporations intentionally decided to waste time by pursue the issue with the lieutenant governor. “We raised our concern when the north and south corporations were about to bring the proposal in House meetings. We have made it clear that we are not in a position to wait any more,” said Devanand Sharma, president of Anti-Malaria Karamchari Sangh.The association has decided to protest every day till April 20. “We have given 15 days to the corporations to revisit their decision but no reply has come,” said a worker. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash claimed they had sent the proposal to Delhi government for creating posts and also looking at the field worker option. Leader of opposition Vikas Goel, an AAP councillor, said Delhi government couldn’t do anything when the Centre had issued the guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-permanent-jobs-dbcs-threaten-stir-from-april-20/articleshow/81958360.cms||---

The traders demanded that the civic officials tender apology and refund the penalties taken from some shop-owners. VMC standing committee chairman, Hitendra Patel and former mayor, Sunil Solanki had to rush there and pacify the traders.  “The civic officials walked in the market and began penalizing shop-owners. They accused the traders of not following social distancing norms and and avoiding masks,” said Nimesh Mehta, president, Baroda Grain Market Association (BGMA).  On Tuesday, rumours of lockdown were rife in the city so many citizens flocked the Hathikhana grain market to stock up food grains and other provisions early on Wednesday morning. It wasn’t our fault that so many rushed to the market. We all were going around in the market and urging them to not panic and maintain social distance,” Mehta told TOI. “Instead of joining us in pacifying people, the VMC teams started behaving rudely with the shop-owners,” he added. “The teams charged Rs 5,000 that was later reduced to Rs 2,000. We explained them the situation but they were very arrogant and refused to budge. So we closed all the shops in Hathikhana. These shops will open when the VMC officials apologize to the shop-owners and refund the penalty amount,” said Chirag Modi, joint secretary, BGMA.  Hathikhana has 250 shops that sell food grains and other provisions at wholesale rate. Standing committee chairman Patel said, “I visited assured the traders that they won’t be treated in unfair manner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/traders-fume-at-crackdown-buyers-suffer/articleshow/81956429.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Police lathicharge defiant traders attempting to open shops||NAGPUR: The growing discontent among shopkeepers against the 25-day lockdown took an ugly turn in the city on Wednesday. Police resorted to a mild lathicharge on traders in Mominpura when they tried to open their shops in defiance of the lockdown order. The shopkeepers also tried to browbeat video journalists against shooting shops dealing in non-essential commodities operating brazenly. This led to tension in the area, which forced Tehsil police station personnel to resort to a mild lathicharge to disperse the crowd and shut shops of non-essential commodities. Eyewitnesses told TOI that at around 12.30pm, Sameer Sheikh, a head constable from Tehsil police station, was on duty in Mominpura area. During patrolling, he spotted many non-essential shops in Chudi Galli open. He objected to these shops remaining open, which infuriated shopkeepers, who tried to manhandle the cop. Two other cops, who were at a distance, rushed to Sheikh’s rescue and alerted the control room. Additional force was deployed, which had to resort to mild lathicharge on the agitated crowd (mostly shopkeepers) to maintain order. Later, riot control police team too was deployed to ensure lockdown implementation in the vicinity. No shopkeepers were injured and soon the situation was under control. Tehsil police have booked the violating traders under relevant sections of IPC including 188, 140, 144 etc. Shops dealing in essential commodities and major vegetable markets like Cotton Market, Gokulpeth market were abuzz with activity. Even though NMC and state government have issued clear guidelines about the lockdown, still many private offices functioned with full capacity, while many shops of non-essentials too were found open in many areas including Zingabai Takli, Jaripatka, Mahal and Sakkardara. The Sitabuldi Merchants Association (SMA) on Wednesday gave a 48-hour ultimatum to the Maha Vikas Aghadi government to withdraw the “lockdown with restrictions” order from April 9, failing which shops dealing in non-essential commodities will start functioning, they said. BJP’s Vyapari Sanghtana, led by MLCs Girish Vyas and Pravin Datke, staged protests against the state government during the day in Itwari and on Kelibagh Road (Mahal). Riot Control Police (RCP) teams were deployed at Mominpura, Itwari and Jaripatka areas to maintain law and order in Nagpur. SMA executive member Hussain Noorallah Ajani and others staged a silent protest on Sitabuldi main road terming the MVA government’s lockdown decision was akin to backstabbing traders. According to Ajani, traders had extended all possible cooperation to the government over the last 13 months of the pandemic. “However, in return, we got nothing and now we have been slapped with another lockdown,” he said. “The pandemic-induced lockdown last year, restricted openings later, followed by the near-lockdown-like situation in most of March, have immensely impacted the with many facing precarious financial situation. Most of us are already reeling under huge debts and this 25-day lockdown will force many traders to either end life or beg to barely make ends meet,” traders said. During a tour of the city on Wednesday, TOI spotted private vehicles including two-wheelers in large numbers on the city roads as well as national and state highways. As compared to day 1, fewer police personnel were seen on the streets and those who were present, seemed to be ignoring people freely coming out onto the streets for minor reasons. TOI spotted at least a hundred youngsters riding triple seat in blatant violation of the traffic rules. Public transport, including Aapli Bus and autorickshaws, remained on the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/police-lathicharge-defiant-traders-attempting-to-open-shops/articleshow/81957392.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

It is also planning to deploy mobile vans for RT-PCR testing across the state. Last week, the department had issued orders to the committee set up to suggest measures to increase testing to examine if government labs can operate in three shifts and carry out testing 24x7. The state had also asked the panel, headed by state health assurance society CEO Sudhakar Shinde, to check if there is a need to increase manpower and supply of testing kits at the labs. “RT-PCR testing has already been ramped up on our suggestions. Maharashtra is carrying out the highest number of tests per day over the last weeks,” said Dr Shinde. “Now, we will examine if testing can be done 24x7 in three shifts and will make recommendations accordingly,” he added. Last June, the panel had suggested that government labs must ramp up testing and operate 24x7 so that more tests can be done free of cost. Last week, for the fourth time, the state brought down Covid-19 testing rates, with an RT-PCR test costing as low as Rs 500 to Rs 800, and an antibody test ranging between Rs 250 and Rs 550. The government also slashed the fee for collecting patient sample from residence, the transport, testing, and reporting of samples to Rs 800 from Rs 980.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-plan-to-run-testing-at-govt-labs-24x7-deploy-mobile-vans/articleshow/81958400.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

According to businessmen, the rate has increased by 30% to 40% and if both the Centre and the state government did not intervene at the earliest, they would be in dire straits.Hemant Abbi, executive member of the Moti Nagar United Factory Association, said, “The rate of yarn used in shawl manufacturing has increased by more than Rs 150 per kg in the past few months. Acrylic yarn, which is mostly used by our industry, earlier cost Rs 240-Rs 250 per kg, but now its price has shot up to Rs 370 per kg. Despite such huge increase in our cost of production, we have not increased the rates of our products and are absorbing the losses rather than passing them on to our customers. Our repeated attempts to convince the yarn manufacturers to drop the rates have failed. They blame the rise on the increase in the rate of the raw material used by them, but there is no evidence to prove it. Now it is up to the Central and the state governments to help us, else our industry will be destroyed.”Sanju Dhir, chairman of Ludhiana Woollen Manufacturers’ Association, said, “The average increase in the rates of yarns has been 30-40%, while there are some yarns that have witnessed a price increase of 100%. This is an unprecedented situation for our industry, as earlier too the rates increased, but after a while they came down. But this time, the rates have only been increasing for several months. We have written a letter to the ministry of textiles, seeking intervention.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/increase-in-yarn-rates-leaves-garment-inc-in-knotty-situation/articleshow/81957393.cms||Mohit Behl

Officials said the drive will continue for the next few weeks till all employees receive the two shots. “Owing to the increase in Covid cases across the country, we have decided to vaccinate all our staffers above 45 at a vaccination site set up at the airport. All of them are frontline workers and they are at risk of contracting the infection. Once the vaccination for those aged below 45 begins, we will vaccinate them as well,” said airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee. Doctors and paramedics of Charnock Hospital running the medical unit at the airport organised the vaccination drive that began at noon on Wednesday and continued till late evening. But from Thursday onwards the site — the arrival gate No 3C at the airport— will remain open between 10am and 5.30pm. Airport officials said employees can register themselves on the CoWIN platform or walk in and register themselves at the site and then conduct the registration process before taking the first jab. Airport officials said the current phase will benefit 4,000-odd employees out of the 15,000, who work at the airport, including operating crew, customs, immigration and other supporting staff. “This is a significant move in controlling the pandemic as the airport currently handles approximately 1 million travellers a month. Even though the drive is for the people in the 45-plus age group in the initial stages, we have requested state health officials to consider airport employees as frontline workers and extend vaccination to all employees,” said Rahul Wadhwa, the chairman of airlines operators committee (AOC) at the airport. The airport is also expected to start a Covid testing lab on the airport premises from later this month, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccination-drive-takes-off-at-kol-airport-for-all-45-plus-employees/articleshow/81957401.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

After committing the crime, the accused told a neighbour about it and the toddler was declared brought dead at a local hospital. The accused, G Vikram Kumar, 35, is a barber from Thondupally village near Shamshabad. Five years ago, Vikram married Spandana from Shamshabad. According to police, recently, Vikram Kumar started suspecting that his wife was having an extramarital affair. “Vikram had an argument with Spandana on Tuesday night and after she slept, at around 1.30 am, he picked up their eight-month-old son and drowned him in the water sump at their house,” Shamshabad inspector Y Prakash Reddy said. After committing the offense, Vikram could not sleep and started loitering near the house. “While Vikram was moving in front of his house, a neighbour spotted him and invited him for a tea at a nearby shop. While going for tea, Vikram told the neighbour about dropping his son in the water sump,” the inspector said. The neighbour immediately brought Vikram home and they woke up Spandana. They picked up the toddler from the water and rushed him to a nearby hospital in Shamshabad, where he was declared brought dead, the inspector said. Based on the complaint lodged by Spandana’s uncle, U Pandu, cops registered a murder case against Vikram Kumar under section 302 of IPC. The accused has been picked up and he will be produced before the court on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/suspecting-wifes-fidelity-barber-drowns-8-month-old-son-in-sump/articleshow/81958368.cms||---

---||Nagpur||State board to promote all Std IX & XI students without exam||NAGPUR: Maharashtra government has decided to promote all Std IX and XI students without an exam to the next academic level due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Since the last one week, education minister Varsha Gaikwad has been announcing a slew of ‘student-friendly’ decisions, starting with various sops for board exams and auto-promotion till Std VIII. In an exclusive interaction with TOI on Monday, Gaikwad revealed that the decision on postponing SSC and HSC exams will also be taken in a few days. Education department prepared the auto-promotion proposal for Std IX and XI after taking feedback from teachers, parents’ groups and government officials regarding conduct of physical exams during the pandemic. Gaikwad said, “While promoting students, we have kept in mind how these levels (IX and XI) are crucial foundation for the subsequent board exams. So we will be providing students with all academic materials and guidance they require through various platforms.” Academics, parents and even former education officials have supported Gaikwad’s decision. Ashok Gavhankar, general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association, said, “A wonderful decision. It has saved over 20 lakh students from threat of Covid-19 infection. If these students had been called to school for a written exam, then the health risk posed would have been very high.” Himself undergoing Covid-19 treatment, Gavhankar said, “This particular strain is very infectious and students may not follow all health safety protocols. So it is very important to not allow these students to congregate at a common place.” Zafar Khan, president of School Headmasters Charitable Association (SHCA), said this was one of the best decisions made by the government. “Life and health of children is above all academic assessments. These (IX and XI) are anyway internal exams, so there is no harm in auto-promoting students . Look at the number of children getting infected in this particular wave. That’s more than enough reason for government to promote students,” said Khan. Last week, Gaikwad had announced auto-promotion policy for students of Std I-VIII, which is covered under the ‘no-fail’ guidelines of Right To Education Act (RTE). Since Std IX and XI are out of this rule’s purview, a separate decision regarding the same was required. Mahesh Karajgaonkar, former joint director (state education department), said, “Considering the Covid-19 situation this was an appropriate decision.” Senior academic Ashnarayan Tiwari said, “This decision is in favour of students and will help them gain confidence as they proceed to the next class.” Dilip Bose, a senior principal, said, “While I appreciate the decision, as students do not waste an entire year, I am a bit worried about the academic part. Going into X and XII level without a sound grounding is not an ideal way to start. But, with cases rising rapidly in Maharashtra we cannot blame anyone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-board-to-promote-all-std-ix-xi-students-without-exam/articleshow/81957535.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rs 1.5 crore found in bank account of API’s firm, NIA tells court||MUMBAI: The NIA alleged before a special court on Wednesday that Mansukh Hiran was a co-conspirator (in the bomb scare case) and had been eliminated. Seeking an additional four days of custody of suspended API Sachin Waze to complete the probe, NIA also said he and others hatched the plot to eliminate Hiran on March 2 and 3. The NIA also said Rs 1.51 crore was found in an Axis Bank account in the name of a firm floated by Waze. NIA further said investigations revealed that in the recent past, he had even given a total of around Rs 76 lakh to an accomplice. This was revealed in the accomplice’s statement, NIA said. ASG Anil Singh submitted that NIA wanted to ascertain the source of all this money and find out if Waze was extorting money for himself or others. NIA also wanted to find out how an officer of Waze’s level could have so much money. Special judge Prashant R Sitre sent Waze to NIA custody till April 9. Waze was arrested on March 13 in connection with the recovery of explosives from an SUV found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25. NIA is also probing the murder of Hiran. The NIA said it wanted to ascertain how gelatin sticks were sourced, who financed it and if Waze’s money was used. NIA submitted there was a deep-rooted terror conspiracy and it wanted to ascertain why it was planned to create terror in the minds of people. It said Waze had 8 high-end vehicles. NIA told court it needed more time to unearth the cash trail and other articles. It said Waze, as police officer, was well aware of his legal rights and dodging the investigation. Waze’s lawyer, senior counsel Aabad Ponda, said he had no objection as it was in his interest to stay in NIA custody and he wanted to co-operate with CBI as he had done with NIA. Meanwhile, co-accused Vinayak Shinde, a constable, and Naresh Gor, a bookie, were sent to judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-1-5-cr-found-in-bank-account-of-apis-firm-nia-tells-court/articleshow/81958370.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The decision was taken after a detailed discussion with Ahmedabad Hospitals & Nursing Homes Association. Also, municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar requisitioned, once again, the Samras hostel in Memnagar as a Covid care centre. Interestingly, exactly a year ago, the Samras hostel was being readied as India’s largest Covid facility with 1,200 beds. A sfew days later, on April 15, the centre began admitting patients. The hostel was mainly to isolate people with moderate to mild symptoms till they recovered. The last patient walked out of the Samras hostel on December 27 last year. On January 7 this year, the hostel was handed over to the education department. On Wednesday, however, Kumar requisitioned the hostel once again and moved in 500 beds for isolating Covid patients. “Citizens should be assured that adequate care will be accessible to them if they contract the virus,” said a senior AMC official. “We are simultaneously making arrangements for oxygen as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/samras-hostel-back-nursing-homes-roped-in/articleshow/81960481.cms||---

Carpeting of approach roads leading to Jalandhar via Ladowal National Highway bypass and from the bridge to the underpass has also been approved. Both these projects, which have been a long-pending demand of the area residents who had been facing traffic jams due to the narrow bridge, will largely benefit people of South City, Ladowal, Barewal and those using this road to go to Jalandhar. The bridge site near Jhammat village was inspected on Wednesday by officials of departments concerned along with councillor Mamta Ashu on behalf of cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. She said, “The areas surrounding Jhammat village have witnessed development of a large number of residential colonies, besides some educational institutions. The commuters have been using the existing bridge and facing frequent traffic jams due to its narrow width of just 3.7 metres. After the matter was taken up with the state government, Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA), irrigation department and others surveyed the area and prepared a detailed project report.”The councillor said, “The project has been divided into three parts—constructing new bridge with width of 12 metres, laying of concrete on the approach roads connecting Jalandhar via Ladowal National Highway bypass and from the bridge to the underpass. GLADA will be the executive agency of the project and the construction will be over within two months once the work starts. The project is in the tender stage now and its work order will be issued soon. Once complete, the traffic congestion and jams will be a thing of the past. Clear directions have been issued to the officials to ensure that the timelines of the project are followed.” She said people could contact her anytime for suggestions on the project. Hailing the move, Gurdeep Singh, a local property dealer, said, “Widening of this bridge was important as the narrow one was built years ago. Now with increased urbanisation and traffic in the nearby areas, huge jams ail commuters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/new-bridge-to-come-up-near-jhammat-village/articleshow/81957402.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: Govt allows workplace vaccination from April 11||NEW DELHI: The Union health ministry has allowed workplaces — in both public and private sector — to organise vaccination sessions for their employees from April 11, in an effort to ramp up the exercise amid rising infections. However, only employees aged 45 years and above can get vaccinated, and outsiders, including eligible family members, can’t be vaccinated at such session at workplaces. The move is aimed at making the vaccination drive more “citizen-centric” as a substantial proportion of the population aged 45 years and above are working in the organised sector of the economy. The health ministry has also issued guidelines to support states/UTs to help organise these sessions. Covid-19 sessions may be organised at workplaces which have about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries, by tagging these workplaces with an existing covid vaccination centre,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a letter to all states and UTs. The sessions will still require beneficiaries to register on the Co-Win portal prior to vaccination, and the workplace management will designate one of its senior staff members to be the nodal officer for coordinating with district health authorities or private Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) and support vaccination activities. Facility for onsite registration will also be available, but only to employees of the workplace. “The schedule of vaccination session can be made up 15 days in advance and intimated to the work place so that maximum attendance is ensured on the day of the vaccination. In most of the work places vaccination schedule may, however, be completed in less than 15 days,” the guidelines said. “The work place CVCs staff engaged in Covid-19 vaccination will follow existing SOPs for vaccination and reporting adverse events following vaccination,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-govt-allows-workplace-vaccination-from-april-11/articleshow/81960573.cms||---

The title belongs to a clutch of city history lovers who undergo an intensive four-month program conducted by Khaki Tours every year, entailing sessions on everything from Mumbai’s heritage to its flora and fauna. As one of eight candidates who became ‘ambassadors’ last year, Sagar now notices ancient buildings in Mumbai so keenly that his wife has to warn him to focus on the road at times. From the BMC headquarters deck, when he points to the Amar Jawan memorial these days, city-based women confess they have walked past it for years not knowing that it was built to commemorate Syed Hussain and Mangal Gadia, two soldiers in the British army who had planned a revolt against the East India Company in 1857. Now, like Joshi, other applicants will opt for the programme that begins in May and ends in August this year. Given the pandemic situation, the programme will be held online and those interested can apply before April 25 on the Khaki Tours website, says Bharat Gothoskar. “Last year, we received hundreds of applications of which only 35 were selected for training, and only eight became ambassadors,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ambassadors-of-mumbai-get-to-learn-show-citys-history/articleshow/81959713.cms||---

State Congress president Girish Chodankar held chief minister Pramod Sawant responsible for the sharp rise in cases and said that Sawant’s decision making lacked logical process. “The chief minister should take major decisions based on certain factors. Across Goa people are confused about the imposition of Section 144 and its removal a few days later,” Chodankar said. Congress has also demanded that Sawant, BJP MLAs and BJP functionaries be booked for organising gatherings and birthday parties and not following social distancing norms and Covid SOPs. “BJP deliberately pushed people into Covid pandemic once again with their celebrations of birthdays, foundation day event, Hunar Haat exhibition and other gatherings. We demand that Goa director general of police must first book the chief minister and all other BJP functionaries for violating Section 144 at Mandrem and also against the organisers of Hunar Haat,” he said. “It looks like the government is clueless, directionless and the intellectual bankruptcy of the CM has been exposed. The clueless CM needs to explain to the people the rationale behind imposition of Section 144 when Covid cases were low and subsequent withdrawal of the same when almost all hospitals and care centres are full with rising Covid cases,” Chodankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-cms-decision-making-lacks-all-logic/articleshow/81958381.cms||---

Consequently, as quorum couldn’t be reached even after adjourning the meeting by several hours, chairperson Balkrishna Hodarkar later cancelled the meeting. Significantly, most of the councillors who chose not to attend the meeting are believed to owe allegiance to Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral. As only six councillors were present at the meeting that commenced at 11 am, Hodarkar adjourned the meeting to 3.30 pm. However, the adjourned meeting saw the presence of seven members which was still insufficient for a quorum, thereby compelling him to cancel the meet. Chief officer of CCMC Ajay Gaude told TOI that though the special meeting couldn’t be held for want of quorum, the chairperson was free to convene any number of ordinary meetings and transact the required business hereon. “The special meeting was convened today in accordance with the provisions of the Goa Municipalities Act which mandates a chairperson to do so within one week of his getting elected. A number of standing and statutory committees are required to be formed at this meeting. However, for special meetings a quorum of 50% of the members is required, while for ordinary meetings 1/3 of the members constitute the quorum,” Gaude said. Hodarkar, speaking to TOI, expressed his disapproval over the development. “The elected representatives should understand they have an obligation to attend the council meeting as it is the proper forum to raise civic issues, discuss matters of public concern and find solutions. If they have acted under political pressure in not attending the meeting, they should realise that they are answerable to the public who voted for them,” Hodarkar said, adding that the current development will have no effect on the stability of the council. Gaude said that other issues of urgent nature like undertaking pre-monsoon works and appointment of tendering of sopo contract, etc, will be taken up at the ordinary meeting of the council which is likely to be held on April 15. On April 1, Hodarkar was elected chairperson of the CCMC, 8 votes against seven, by a secret ballot, defeating Vishwas Sawant, the candidate backed by Cabral. However, he had to face the prospects of a no-confidence motion being moved against him by 10 of his fellow councillors within minutes of his election. The motion, however, was rejected by the director of municipal administration on technical grounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabral-backed-councillors-skip-first-curchorem-meet/articleshow/81958371.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On Wednesday, hoteliers’ federations AHAR, HRAWI and NRAI along with other district associations formed the United Hospitality Forum of Maharashtra (UHFM) to protest against what it called “oppressive steps” taken by the state government in its bid to control the pandemic. UHFM will conduct silent protests at various restaurants across Maharashtra at 12.30pm on Thursday. AHAR president Shivanand Shetty said, “Lakhs of families are dependent on this industry. So we have formed this forum to voice our protest and press for measures that are conducive for us to do business.” Meanwhile, confusion prevailed over various rules, including home delivery by wine shops, in the absence of a formal notification. Pali Hill corporator Swapna Mhatre said, “Shop owners are uncertain about which shops are allowed to stay open and which are not. Why couldn’t the government call it a lockdown if they are asking non-essentials to stay shut?” Traders in Navi Mumbai and Panvel turned their ire against the shutdown. Protests erupted in Vashi, Nerul, Airoli, Kamothe and Panvel with adherence to Covid safety protocol. One trader from Vashi said, “We cannot afford yet another closure after the last one year. We have just settled down with adequate manpower and are getting business back to normal. We will protest against such decisions taken by the government." Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation sealed nine shops, one beer shop and one badminton court inside Kalyan Sports Club which were functioning despite closure orders. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/traders-protest-restaurants-decry-shutdown-in-mumbai-city/articleshow/81957472.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Corporations start reserving pyres for Covid victims||NEW DELHI: In the wake of the sudden rise in Covid cases, Delhi’s three municipal corporations have once again started reserving funeral pyre platforms at key cremation sites. East Delhi Municipal Corporation has reserved a total of 35 funeral pyres for bodies of Covid victims. A senior EDMC official said that these platforms would specifically cater to the bodies received from Covid-19 designated hospitals. “A total of 10 funeral platforms will be available in Karkardooma, 15 platforms in Ghazipur Shamshan Bhumi and 10 platforms in Seemapuri cremation ground. Buland Masjid and Mulla Colony burial grounds will cater to bodies of Covid victims that require a burial,” a senior official said. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said, “A separate area consisting of 10 platforms has been reserved for bodies of Covid patients. Three CNG furnaces have also been set aside for them. Separate arrangements have been made for families of Covid patients at Nigambodh Ghat.” During last year, Nigambodh Ghat and Punjabi Bagh cremation ground were the two key main facilities, which accepted the bulk of the Covid-related funerals.An official from the south corporation said that the pre-November arrangement would soon be restored to tackle any emergency. “Last year, we had designated six cremation facilities for this purpose and similar arrangements can be restored if the need arises. We have the capacity to process 200 bodies per day,” the official said. Another SDMC official said that a total of 15 platforms have been reserved for such bodies at Punjabi Bagh and Hastsal cremation grounds. Officials, meanwhile, say that the number of deaths due to the coronavirus is comparatively less this year. “Compared to 2020, the death rate is still very low as treatment methods and infrastructure have developed. But if the infection continues to spread at this rate, some of the patients will eventually need critical care. We are prepared to tackle any situation,” said an official. Delhi reported 20 Covid deaths on Wednesday, taking the toll in the city to 11,133.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-start-reserving-pyres-for-covid-victims/articleshow/81958397.cms||Paras Singh

The new rates announced on Wednesday by the municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar were a revision of the rates declared on December 15. Senior AMC officials said that the rates were revised after carefully considering the financial burden on the AMC and to reach more people who need timely treatment. Exactly one month earlier, the AMC had unpaid bills amounting to Rs 260 crore and an additional Rs 39 crore for medical equipment requisitioned for Covid treatment. “The AMC received just Rs 240 crore as grant from the government. Now most of those pending bills have been cleared,” said a senior AMC official. Additionally, Kumar in his order requisitioned 240 beds at Shushila Mansukhlal Shah (SMS) hospital in Chandkheda again. SMS hospital was de-notified as a Covid hospital in August last year after demand for Covid beds reduced. Another 160 beds have been requisitioned at the Gujarat Cancer Society Medical College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-to-pay-20-less-for-covid-beds/articleshow/81960472.cms||---
---||Surat||Six caught for billionaire farmer’s murder in Gujarat||SURAT: Cracking the April 2 loot and murder of a billionaire farmer in Dumas, the city crime branch arrested six members of a Mumbai-based gang near Bhatia toll plaza on Wednesday. Investigation revealed that the gang wanted to carry out a loot of Rs 160 crore from a bungalow in Badlapur city of Thane district and they needed cash to buy weapons and equipment for this crime. During the early hours on April 2, five persons entered the victim Bhupendra Patel’s house in Kadi Faliya locality of Dumas, tied him up and searched for cash. However, they found only Rs four lakh. They then thrashed Patel to extract information about more cash during which he died due to strangling. A woman named Chetna living in Patel’s neighbouring home was also arrested for her allegedly tipping off the gang that he had Rs three crore at home earned from a land deal. Bhupendra’s neighbour Chetna Patel (40) was arrested in the evening after she tested negative for Covid-19. She tipped the accused gang that Bhupendra has Rs three crore in his house that he earned from a land deal. “She was driven by greed and her sister in Mumbai knew one of the accused Pratap Gida. Through her sister, she passed on the information,” said a senior police official. The robbers first entered the compound of Chetna’s home and jumped the wall to enter Patel’s house. Investigation revealed that the gang had come on the night of March 31 and was about to enter Patel’s house. But when a dog started barking, Chetna’s husband Lalit woke up and went out to check. Seeing him, two men escaped from there and Lalit saw them too. They returned a day later and Chetna had kept the iron grill of her compound open so that the robbers could enter the compound stealthily. They entered Patel’s house again and executed the crime. “Police cracked the crime in which a gang of hardened criminals from Mumbai are involved. By arresting the gang, we prevented another loot near Mumbai for which the gang was preparing,” said Ajay Tomar, city police commissioner. Those arrested were Vishal Vaniya, Pratap Gida, Mithun alias Shetty Mohan Vaniyan alias Rohit Shetty alias Bairansinh Rana, Pintu Arjun Chaudhary and Ketan Ramesh Hadiya, all members of the gang from Mumbai. Gida and Hadiya, both natives of Mendarda in Junagadh, were involved in three offences in Junagadh and Savarkundla. Shetty and Chaudhary are involved in two offences registered in Malad in Mumbai and Karnataka. Police recovered two country-made pistols, two cartridges, two stolen motorcycles, eight mobile phones and cash Rs one lakh from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/six-caught-for-billionaire-farmers-murder/articleshow/81956495.cms||---

A bench of justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale said the protection is subject to Purvesh cooperating in the probe and the probe itself would be subject to outcome of the petition. Pratap Sarnaik, his sons —Vihang and Purvesh — and brother-in-law Yogesh Chandegala had petitioned the HC. Senior counsel for Sarnaik, Amit Desai, questioned ED’s probe. The apex court had protected Pratap Sarnaik, Vihang and Chandegala from coercive steps. Desai submitted that ED was seeking to drag Sarnaik and family as he was a ruling party MLA who took up cudgels in important cases including one against TV journalist Arnab Goswami. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, said the probe was justified and despite summons they sought time on health grounds and didn’t participate in the probe. HC granted Purvesh protection as others had it too but did not stay ED’s probe. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-mlas-son-gets-hc-relief-in-ed-case/articleshow/81959725.cms||---

In Bathinda, police were deployed in large numbers near Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal office and stopped the activists from going to his office. BJP workers then sat on the road to register their protest. Meanwhile, protesting farmers too came to the road and raised slogans against the BJP. Farmers asked the BJP workers to send the bangles to two corporate houses. Police did not let farmers and women workers come near each other. Bathinda tehsildar accepted the bangles from BJP activists at the protest site. BJP Mahila Morcha Punjab president Mona Jaiswal said law and order was worsening in Punjab, as rapes and murders were being committed. “The way BJP MLA was thrashed and stripped in Malout was an example of the worsening situation,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/farmers-oppose-bjp-mahila-morcha-protest-in-bathinda/articleshow/81958398.cms||---

The effect was immediate with a 140% jump in the number of beneficiaries. On Wednesday, 125 people got vaccinated, up from 52 on Tuesday when Parihar went campaigning solo. An officer of the rank of assistant municipal commissioner, Parihar toiled for three hours under the scorching sun in Hingna tehsil making announcements in lanes and bylanes urging people to step out for vaccination. He also got down from the vehicle several times to meet and convince people on the road. An electrical and telecommunications engineer-turned-public servant, Parihar used the garbage collection vehicle without waiting for a car or auto-rickshaw to reach out to people. “We had already hired an auto-rickshaws with speakers for campaigning but it would have taken an hour to get ready and start the work. Also, it would go fast and not wait to ensure people heard and understand the message,” Parihar said. “I thought it would be better if I go right away and the vehicle available the earliest happened to be the garbage collection one,” he said. “I felt the public address system fitted atop the vehicle would be useful though the vehicle is not glamorous,” said the officer. Asked about hygiene, Parihar said the garbage-collection vehicles were being sanitized every weekend and cleaned periodically. “Our sanitation workers too are human beings who function from this vehicle, hence I felt why not me,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hingna-mc-chief-officer-rides-garbage-van-for-vax-campaign/articleshow/81957541.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: DCP and ACP named by Singh in his letter take a different line||MUMBAI: The controversy over hafta collection from bars and restaurants which led to Anil Deshmukh’s resignation as home minister has taken a twist, with two police officers who were relied upon by former police commissioner Param Bir Singh to support his allegation taking a different stand. Immediately after Singh was transferred as DGP, Home Guards, on March 17, in his letter addressed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, he had alleged that Deshmukh had called assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to his official bungalow and asked him to collect Rs 100 crore from bars and hoteliers and other establishments. Singh had also annexed WhatsApp chats between him and assistant police commissioner Sanjay Patil (see graphic) to support his claim. Deshmukh had claimed Singh asked some questions to Patil and got the answers he expected and this was part of a larger plot. Patil, in his statement dated March 22 recorded as part of the internal inquiry, told joint police commissioner (crime ) Milind Barambe that on March 1, he had met Deshmukh along with other police officers to brief him about a raid conducted at a hookah parlour in Thane. But before or after this visit, he had never met the then home minister. Patil said further that he met Waze at the ‘official premises’ where the latter told him that he had come to brief the home minister about some investigation. Waze told him that the minister sought information about the collection of Rs 3 lakh each from 1,750 bars and restaurants in the city, Patil said in his statement. But the ACP in the statement said he was unaware whether the meeting between Waze and Deshmukh took place or not, he said. Singh’s letter had said, “Shri Patil along with DCP Bhujbal were called at the official residence of the Hon’ble Home Minister for a meeting (on March 4.) While ACP Patil and DCP Bhujbal were made to wait outside the Hon’ble Home Minister’s cabin, Mr. Palande (Deshmukh’s personal secretary) went inside the chamber of the Hon’ble Home Minister and after coming out took ACP Patil and DCP Bhujbal on the side. Mr. Palande informed ACP Patil that the Hon’ble Home Minister was targeting a collection of Rs. 40-50 crores which was possible through an approximate 1,750 bars.” DCP Bhujbal said he had attended a meeting on March 4 at Deshmukh’s official residence as a nodal officer to brief the seniors about issues related to crime. Asked if he met Deshmukh and his assistant and if there was any discussion on money collection from bars and restaurants, Bhujbal said ACP Patil later came there and he told the minister’s assistant that the information about such establishments was not based on facts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dcp-and-acp-named-by-singh-in-his-letter-take-a-different-line/articleshow/81958407.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Entrance tests for courses likely only in or after May||MUMBAI: The delay in this year’s admissions to professional courses will spill over to the coming academic session. The state’s CET cell recently floated a tender to appoint an agency for comprehensive CET-related work, from registrations to conduct of tests and announcement of results. A firm is likely to be finalised in the last week of April, so entrance tests for many courses will be scheduled only in or after May. The cell usually conducts MBA entrance test in March, engineering and other tests in May. Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown pushed last year’s entrance tests to October and November, and admissions for some courses concluded in February. For some, like law, the process is going on, due to technical glitches in software in the beginning. While the cell is busy wrapping up admissions for the current year, aspirants are anxious about delays in admissions for the next academic session too. The registration process for MBA/MMS CET usually starts in February and the exam is in the second week of March. Students are inquiring about admissions, said Prof Rajesh Srivastava from Sydenham Institute of Management Studies. “The delay is causing anxiety among students. It will also affect students’ plans to study here or abroad,” he said. A government official said admissions to first year professional courses concluded late, so classes started late. “While the pandemic is unprecedented, universities and colleges will need eight to nine months to complete the syllabus properly for the current batch. The delay in 2021-22 admissions is natural. It will take time to normalise,” he said. For law colleges in Mumbai, the university has scheduled the first semester exam on June 14. Colleges have less than three months to complete the syllabus. An official said universities are not monitoring how lectures are being conducted online, and if syllabus is getting covered at all in this short period. “While autonomous professional colleges are taking extra efforts to ensure lectures are conducted, many others are only concerned about filling seats and getting fees. The delays will have a long-lasting effect on learning levels,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-entrance-tests-for-courses-likely-only-in-or-after-may/articleshow/81956510.cms||Yogita Rao

According to senior police officers, Ravi had “criminal antecedents” as he was accused of harassing a 25-year old man named Deepak of Behal town in Bhiwani district thorough social media, which led to the victim committing suicide. In this regard, an FIR was registered on October 25, 2017 against him in Behal police station. Later, another FIR under sections 147, 149, 283 was registered against him for rioting and obstructions of road in Tosham police station on April 6, 2018 and he was facing trial in that case.

To maintain law and order in the state, anti-social elements and persons involved in criminal activities will be externed from their respective districts or from the state within six months, he said. “This is for the first time that the state government has initiated such a process,” Sawant told reporters. A senior police officer said that every police station in each district has identified criminals for externment. Most of these persons are involved in cases of hurt, he said. The officer said that now the collector has been approached and the accused will be heard on the issue and the collector, if satisfied with the police proposal, will issue the externment order. If the collector issues the order, then those persons will have to leave the state for a certain period of time. In Goa, externment orders are issued under the Goa Maintenance of Public Order and Safety Act, 1988. The district police have also identified 60 budding criminals. “We have identified budding criminals in the 18-21 years age group, and a case has been registered against them,” a senior police officer said. “We suspect that they will be involved in criminal activities in the future,” he said. The officer said that police have called the budding criminals’ parents or guardians for counselling. The decision is important in the backdrop of a shootout at Merces recently. Within a year, this was the second incident of shootout within the jurisdiction of Old Goa police station, which was a result of verbal spat over a labourer among two poultry businessmen. A 40-year-old businessman from Betki was injured after bullets were fired at him at Merces, on Monday. In June, there was a shootout at St Cruz in which one person was killed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-process-to-extern-60-anti-social-elements-has-begun/articleshow/81958402.cms||---
---||Lucknow||VHP campaign to free temples from govts’ control||Lucknow: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad will launch a legal battle and mass awareness campaign to get temples in the country freed from governments’ control. The development comes in the backdrop of BJP objecting to Kerala government controlled Devaswom Board interfering in the functioning of temples in the southern state. Besides the legal courses and mass awareness campaigns, we will press the government to make a law to ensure that temples remain free of government control, VHP secretary general, Milind Parande told TOI. “There are scores of temples in the country which are under the jurisdiction of various state governments. The society and not the government should take care of the temples,” he said, pointing out that Devaswom Board is being used by Kerala's LDF government for political gains. Parande also questioned why only places of religious worship belonging to Hindus were being taken under government control. “This is not only discriminatory but also against the Hindu culture,” he said, stressing that the land belonging to the temple was being used for so-called “secular” objectives. “Daandaton ne jis bhaav se diya tha, wo dharmik aur bhagwan ki seva ke liye diya tha (The donations were made for religious purposes and for the service of God),” the VHP leader said, adding that the resources of temples should be used for spreading awareness of Hindu religion only. VHP’s stance comes after it carried out a grand crowdfunding drive for the upcoming Ram temple in Ayodhya. The organisation has been strongly advocating for Ram temple being called a ‘Rashtra mandir’, a narrative put forth by senior BJP leaders, including chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Parande said that besides Kerala, there is deep angst among Hindus in Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh over temples being controlled by state governments. “In some temples like Tirupati and Shrisailam, people from other communities have been employed. This hurts the Hindu society,” he said. The VHP leader claimed that the misuse of temple assets by the secular governments, and interference from corrupt bureaucrats and politicians in temple management is known to all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vhp-campaign-to-free-temples-from-govts-control/articleshow/81959730.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Jaipur||75% Covid cases in Dungarpur are migrants from Maharashtra, Karnataka||JAIPUR: Three out of four Covid cases in Dungarpur have a recent travel history to Maharashtra or Karnataka. The tribal-dominated area has recorded 560 cases in the last four days and out of those, 370 entered the state a week before Holi either from Maharashtra or Karnataka. Areas such as Aspur, Simalwara and Sagwara have become hotspots in Dungarpur. Holi in the tribal areas is followed by 8 to 10 day festive season. It is marked by the visit of its citizens from neighbouring states who live for 8-10 days post-Holi before they head back to their workplaces. This Holi, hundreds of tribals entered the state from Maharashtra, which is a major Covid hubs in the country. Since these visitors are heading back to the respective workplaces, they require negative a RT-PCR test for which they are making a beeline. “During testing, their reports are coming positive. The worry is that they had already spent 5-10 days in their respective villages and have participated in the religious ceremonies,” said Dungarpur collector Suresh Kumar Ola. Most of these people are from rural areas making the tracing more difficult for the administration. Their presence is also reflecting in other cities like Udaipur, Chittorgarh and Banswara. They have travelled by buses which pass through Dungarpur before going to Udaipur or Jaipur via Chittorgarh. Most of these cases are asymptomatic and the administration, fearing a major spike in cases, has made preparations for institutional quarantine at the village levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/75-covid-cases-in-dungarpur-are-migrants-from-maha-karnataka/articleshow/81957545.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Back for jobs, many still struggle to pick up pieces||Amritsar: One year after Covid-19 wreaked havoc on people’s lives, the dust is yet to settle. Factories closed and people lost their jobs in droves. The worst affected were migrant labourers, who had no savings to fall back on. One of them was Saroj Kumari, who had no idea how to feed her children after her husband was handed the pink slip. The family decided to return to their native place, Usmanpur near Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh (UP) but struggled to make ends meet. Eventually, they decided to return to Amritsar. “The coronavirus pandemic didn’t scare us as much as losing the job since we didn’t have any savings or anything to feed the family. We had never borrowed food, but now we were forced to stand in queues to receive free ration. Life became miserable,” said Saroj, who returned to Amritsar with her husband Jugi Lal in December. Since they had been living in Putlighar area of Amritsar for the past over one and a half decades with their three children, they hoped that a fresh start would be easier here. Even though things have not changed much, they say they are stronger than before. “The Covid-19 situation is almost the same as it was last year, the only difference is that we have not panicked. We are not even thinking of going back to our native place. We will live and die here,” she declared. She said the family had received some money from the UP government, but it was not sufficient for them to move on. Raju Singh , a worker in the hosiery industry, faced a similar situation. He had been living in Amritsar for over a decade and had returned to his native village of Bharai Khurd in UP. “On March 22, the factory closed down and I was jobless. I had nowhere to go and didn’t know how to send money back home so I also decided to go to my village.” Dismissing the claims of the UP government of extending financial help and giving jobs to migrants returning to their native places, Raju said, “I didn’t get any financial help or job. After waiting for a few months, I returned to Amritsar early this year but the job scenario had changed here as well.” As against a fixed salary, the factory owner now hired him on contract. “Earlier, I used to get around Rs 15,000. Now, I barely make Rs 10,000. Covid-19 has changed my life,” he said. General secretary of UP Kalyan Parishad, Rambhawan Goswami reasoned that those who returned had pressing commitments. “Only 30% to 35% of the migrants who shifted back to their native places have come back,” he said, adding that those who returned had financial compulsions here or had children in high school etc. “A few had taken advance from their factories, many had taken loans. Those who have children in higher classes have returned,” he said. Goswami said that the UP government paid Rs 1,000 per person for three months besides giving 5 kg ration per person for six months. He also claimed that the UP government provided them work under MGNREGA as well as loans on easy terms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/back-for-jobs-many-still-struggle-to-pick-up-pieces/articleshow/81958403.cms||Yudhvir Rana

---||Delhi||Evolution of arms: Red Fort plays to gallery||NEW DELHI: In August, a new museum at Red Fort will give you a glimpse of India’s weapons through the ages. The National Museum has decided to shift its arms and armour section to one of the barracks of the 17th century fortress as part of the India@75 programme and over 600 artefacts, including weapons from pre-history and armament from the 16th to 19th centuries will be put on display. The National Museum also plans to set up two other repositories in the barracks — one on the history of Jammu & Kashmir and another on India’s Independence struggle from 1857 to 1947. A museum source revealed that the staff was busy identifying, tagging, cleaning them in the laboratory and packing the precious objects for the shift to the fort. There are other collections showcased in the barracks and the National Museum’s three new installations will be added attractions there. “We have a good collection for the arms and armour section,” the source said. “However, for the Jammu & Kashmir and Independence galleries, we will have to collect meaningful artefacts from across the country.” Since 2019, the renovated barracks at Red Fort have housed several museums, including the Archaeological Museum, the Indian War Memorial Museum and one commemorating the life of Subhas Chandra Bose. The double-storeyed barracks had been built by the British after razing hundreds of structures in the fort following the exile of the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar to Burma. The World Heritage Site monument has been shut since January 19 after reports of bird deaths on the complex and the scare of bird flu in the air. The work on the three new museums, however, hadn’t been impacted by the closure. Asked when Red Fort could reopen, an Archaeological Survey of India official said, “The local authorities closed the fort due to rising cases of bird flu. We will reopen the monument for the public when we get permission from the local authorities.” Kamlesh Kumar Sharma, former curator (public relations) and currently a consultant to the National Museum, has been assisting in the establishment of the arms and armour museum, mostly on the selection of exhibits and the setup of the gallery. He reiterated, “The gallery will showcase the evolution of Indian weaponry and arms, starting from prehistoric stone weapons, proto-historic implements and then through the medieval ages.” He felt that Red Fort was ideal for a museum on arms because “this is where Indian history played out”. He said, “This Mughal structure is iconic and we have a suitably huge collection of Mughal armament, for instance, the bow of Bahadur Shah Zafar and the inscribed body armour of Aurangzeb. It is only fitting these items find a home in the fort.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/evolution-of-arms-red-fort-plays-to-gallery/articleshow/81958425.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

The children, brought in groups of 10-15, claimed that while staying at the ashram, they were sent out to work in a village as well. The shelter was being run by Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and child commission officials suspect that apart from using the kids as child labour, they might have also been brought to join the ranks of the organisation. The minor boys were rescued after the commission received a complaint about the unrecognised shelter and officials found that the boys were kept in unsuitable conditions. There were a total of 29 boys out of which 27 were rescued while two of them fled. Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights Sangeeta Beniwal said, “On being asked as to how they reached the ashram, most had no recollection about it, while one of the boys told us that an ‘uncle’ came to his village and promised the parents that he would provide education as well as a job to the child. They could not tell us if the parents had been given money for the same.The boys said at times they were sent out to work and now the boys want to go back home after exams.” In the coming days, the commission officials will start the process with their counterparts in other states to get the minor boys back home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/uncles-brought-boys-to-shelter-in-chomu/articleshow/81957548.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP: Vantangiyas to elect own gram pradhan for 1st time||LUCKNOW: Vantangiyas of Gorakhpur will have their first, active role as voters in the panchayat elections 2021. They will elect their own gram pradhan who would be the one from amongst them, thus marking the real empowerment of the village that, for years, has been demanding development but could not shed its tribal status given various reasons. When Gorakhpur goes to vote for panchayat election in the first phase on April 15 over 3,500 of its vantangiya voters will vote to choose their own independent gram pradhan for the first time in the history of their villages. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in his speech in the Legislative Council during the recent budget session had counted the voting rights for vantangiya villages in panchayat elections as one of the achievements of his government in the last four years. Vantangiyas are a tribe of forest-dwellers. District magistrate, Gorakhpur, K Vijyendra Pandian said, “These villages voted in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, but now they will vote to elect the gram pradhan of their own choice. Earlier, these villages were clubbed as majra tola with other villages and voted for candidates of those villages.” Vantangiyas are a tribe of forest-dwellers. Gorakhpur had five of these villages since the time of the British. In October 2017, the CM got the tribal settlements converted into revenue villages under the provisions of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act. Conversion of vantangiya settlements into revenue villages was one of the priorities of the Yogi government. Even before he became the CM, he used to visit these villages on Diwali every year since 2007 or so. When TOI visited Rajahi Khaletola, one of the recently vantangiya villages that was converted into a revenue village by the Yogi government, in April 2019 ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, the village was showing signs of development. Dhanauta, a resident, was unequivocal in her support for Yogi Adityanath. “Baba naseeb jaga dihin (Baba has changed our fate),” she said. Another villager Rajaram Nishad had said, “In last less than two years a primary school has come up within a km from the village and close to 60 pucca houses are under construction under Prime Minister Awas Yojana. At least 60% houses have got the ceiling (chhath) which may not take much time for us to move in. The road that takes one into the village has been levelled up under MGNREGA. Two drinking water tanks equipped with an electric pump, solar panel and electricity poles are other recent additions. Once we get a toilet it will be 100% development for us.” Vantangiyas were named after the Tongs tribe of Myanmar (former Burma). Vantangiyas settled in these villages in 1922 when British employed them for plantation and management of forest. Most of these villages in Gorakhpur lie inside what was once a dense jungle of sakhu trees. It was the vacant land between sakhu trees which was given to a vantangiya family to grow veggies, fruits and other eatables. Vantangiya villages in UP had been demanding conversion into revenue villages since 1980. Conversion has made these villages entitled to government schemes like Ujjwala, Saubhagya, PM Awas and toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen). Each family has also been given an alternate source of income like poultry. But, the right to elect their own gram pradhan who would know the requirements and conditions of the villages and work accordingly would be the biggest thing to come the vantangiyas’ way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vantangiyas-to-elect-own-gram-pradhan-for-1st-time/articleshow/81959739.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Goa||Govt approves 10 posts of PIs, 150 posts of ASIs||Panaji: The state cabinet on Wednesday granted approval for creating 10 posts of police inspectors (PI) and 150 posts of assistant sub inspectors (ASI) by surrendering 219 posts of police constables. The cabinet note said that with increasing burden of law and order duties, the investigation of crime does not get adequate attention. A cabinet minister said that the decision is taken to strengthen the investigation as constables are not empowered to conduct investigations. “With PIs and ASIs, police stations will get additional manpower for investigation which helps in effective case solving,” the minister said. The cabinet note said the final sanctioned strength of the police department for the next five years is 111 posts of PIs, 610 posts of PSIs, 411 posts of ASIs, 1,274 posts of head constables and 4,020 posts of constables. The sanctioned strength of PIs and ASIs is less as compared to the other ranks so the promotional prospects of the subordinates are not hampered. Explaining the sanctioned strength, the cabinet note said that it takes more than 30 years for constables to get promoted to ASIs and over 15 years for PSIs to get promoted to PIs. The sanctioned strength of ASIs is 1/3rd of head constables and 1/9th of constables. Therefore, there is a need to increase the strength of ASIs in the police department for their urgent deployment at police outposts, border check posts, police stations, traffic cells, special branches and other duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-approves-10-posts-of-pis-150-posts-of-asis/articleshow/81958405.cms||---

He said the scheme, which comes into effect from May 1, will not require any fee for registration at e-Mitra. Gehlot was holding discussions with officials regarding effective implementation of the scheme at the chief minister's residence on Wednesday. Gehlot said usually people have to pay a premium of up to Rs 30,000 to get cashless health insurance of up to Rs 5 lakh, but for the health of people of the state, the state government would bear Rs 3,500 crore. The government will provide this health insurance to around 1.10 crore families as well as 13 lakh small and marginal farmers and families of more than 4 lakh contract workers under the ambit of National Food Security and Socio Economic Census-2011. Other families will be able to avail insurance for just Rs 850 per year. He said registration for the scheme is being from April 1 to 30. If a family misses registration, they will have to wait for three months. Gehlot instructed that this ambitious scheme should be widely publicised. Public representatives, officers-employees, health friends, voluntary organizations, social activists, enlightened people and young people should be made aware of the benefits of this scheme and play their social responsibility in registering more and more. and more people reach the camps. The CM said that e-Mitra operators are important links of this scheme. He directed that training should be given to e-Mitra operators for maximum registration through Janadhaar cards. He said beneficiaries holding Janadhaar cards could also register through the link available on health.rajasthan.gov.in website of the department of medical and health. The plan includes 1,576 packages of treatment for various diseases including Covid. Beneficiaries will be able to receive treatment in government and private hospitals affiliated to the scheme. This will also include medical expenses 5 days before hospitalization and 15 days after discharge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-registration-fees-for-chiranjeevi-scheme-cm/articleshow/81957550.cms||---

The sought relaxations in RT-PCR norms and also vaccination for all those involved in the tourism industry. “There have been large-scale booking cancellations, and fresh bookings are almost nil across the state. April-July period is peak tourist season, and if the present scenario remains same, there will be a major economic crisis not only in Mussoorie but also in all tourism destinations of the state,” said Sandeep Sahni, president of Hotels and Restaurant Association of Uttarakhand. Sahni claimed the current bookings are just 5% of the usual business during normal times. “The local economy and livelihoods of people have been severely impacted since the government advisory making RT-PCR mandatory for tourists from 12 states. It is a matter of survival for all, and the state government must keep this in mind while making Covid-19 guidelines,” said Rajat Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Traders Association. Representatives of the taxi union said that taxi bookings have reduced to 5-10%. After the RT-PCR advisory, all bookings have been cancelled for the Char Dham yatra. “Considering the increase in Covid-19 cases, hoteliers must be directed to strictly follow all standard operating protocols (SOPs), and they must not be asked to check just RT-PCR reports of tourists. Checking and testing must be done at the state borders,” Sahni urged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mussoorie-hoteliers-restaurateurs-shopkeepers-taxi-operators-seek-relief-from-government/articleshow/81956518.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Chandigarh||Rain, squall hit wheat crop hard||Bathinda: Rain and squall that hit the Malwa region on Tuesday night damaged or flattened the near-mature, ready-to-harvest wheat crop at some places. The procurement starts from April 10 but the storm has stopped harvesting, blackened the grain, and added moisture that will take days to dry up. Tough action to enforce the Food Corporation of India’s revised specifications worries the farmers. Farm unionist and BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) secretary Shingara Singh Mann said: “The inclement weather is expected to drive more farmers to return home from the protest sites on the Delhi borders to tend to the crop. It will take a special girdawari (revenue survey) to assess the loss and compensate them, since the untimely rain impacted almost the entire region.” Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal visited Ghudda village in Bathinda to assess the loss to the standing crop and demanded compensation for the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rain-squall-hit-wheat-crop-hard/articleshow/81958404.cms||---
---||Mumbai||If offenders cough up Rs 1,200, it may reduce menace of spitting: HC to BMC||MUMBAI: Bombay HC on Wednesday directed the BMC, police and state administration to take immediate steps to curb the menace of spitting by sensitizing the public. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni asked the police and BMC why they were collecting a nominal fine of Rs 200 though the law permits a maximum fine of Rs 1,200 for violators. The court passed the directions while hearing a PIL filed by a Mumbai lawyer, Armin Wandrewala, who claimed one of the reasons for the unabated spread of Covid-19 virus was ‘spitting’ and that the authorities were not doing enough to halt the nuisance. To ensure the menace is stamped out, Wandrewala, who argued in person, suggested BMC could appoint “wardens or marshals on a temporary basis”. She said there was an “urgent need” for strict and efficient implementation of anti-spitting law, but it is hardly ever discussed even in a public discourse on Covid prevention measures. While measures like wearing masks, social distancing and hand hygiene are reiterated, “no one talked about dangers of spitting.” She said people lower their masks and spit on streets. The bench asked the advocates for the state and BMC what was being done with regard to implementation. The BMC counsel gave some figures, which the judges felt were not quite right. Last January, over Rs14 lakh was collected in fines from 7,000 people for spitting. This year, till March 30, almost 12,000 people were fined Rs 23.6 lakh totally. The HC asked the authorities to take note of suggestions in the PIL and implement those which are acceptable and to file affidavits in reply. Recommendations include ward-wise and intra-ward monitoring by police and BMC on a war footing, inviting complaints from the public about spots where spitting is rampant, sensitization of BEST drivers and conductors, taxi drivers’ union, community service in addition or in lieu of fine for offenders. The matter is posted to April 21, but the BMC has to start taking more effective action in the meantime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-if-offenders-cough-up-rs-1200-it-may-reduce-menace-of-spitting-hc-to-bmc/articleshow/81959820.cms||Swati Deshpande

Existing households will have to pay Rs 5,000 for sewerage connection while for new construction, the amount is fixed at Rs 9,500. Besides, the households will have to pay 35% of water consumption bill as monthly sewerage charges for both existing and new connection. The sewerage and infrastructure development corporation of Goa Ltd (SIDCGL) is the nodal agency for providing sewerage facilities. A cabinet note said that appropriate sewerage system is essential for improving public health and quality of life in urban areas and for luring tourists. “Most of the places in Goa do not have sewerage system. According to the 2011 Census, only 16 per cent of Goa’s urban population is connected to sewerage system compared to neighbouring states of Maharashtra (40%) and Karnataka (38%). It is much lower than the all India average of 31%,” the cabinet note said. The existing and commissioned sewerage schemes include Panaji, Vasco, Margao, Fatorda and Navelim (part), Durbhat and Sakhali. The ongoing sewerage scheme expecting commissioning include Margao, Navelim, Ponda, north coastal belt, Colva, Ponda and Porvorim. As per the cabinet note, there is poor response for availing house sewerage connection by the public wherever connectivity is available. Accordingly, a draft notification is proposed for making the connections mandatory and the same is vetted by the law department. During the year 2008-2010 as there was poor response for availing the connections, a one-time subsidised scheme for Fatorda and Margao was implemented by the government in 2010. The cabinet note further said that since the government has spent huge capital cost in providing sewerage network and providing connectivity, the same is required to be put for public use and it is proposed to be implemented with revised tariff all over Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabinet-nod-makes-sewerage-link-mandatory-for-every-house-in-goa/articleshow/81958422.cms||---

This is the largest count of new cases in a single day after six months. Previously, 1,900 cases were recorded on October 7 last year. Experts hint at the possibility of a further surge. The state recorded five deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the death toll so far to 1,734. Within a matter of a week, the recovery rate dropped to 95.78% on Wednesday from 97.66% on April 1. While this is indicative of more number of patients under treatment either at home or in hospitals, the increase in morbidity is likely to hit many families. “In the first wave, we have already seen many middle class families come down to the below poverty line category just due to hospital bills. Now with the current wave, the spread is likely to be more. As a result there will be more hospitalizations and this will impact many households,” said a senior health official from the state. Meanwhile, testing was ramped up further on Wednesday. A total of 74,274 tests were conducted in the state. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) recorded 393 new cases of Covid-19 while neighbouring Medchal-Malkajgiri recorded 205 new cases crossing the 200 mark after five months.

Police jeeps and patrolling vehicles made rounds in the entire city area calling out shopkeepers and traders to wind up the business and after 9pm barricades were put up at various junctions with policemen stopping vehicles passing after the permitted hours.On Wednesday, 410 fresh cases were reported in Udaipur of which 75% (308) were from urban areas and rest from the district. Since last week, cases have been on the rise. While on April 1, total 123 cases were reported, it was 198 on April 5, 367 on April 6.Collector Chetan Ram Deora said despite various awareness campaigns and counselling, people are not yet abiding by the corona protocol and hence the cases are increasing. If people continue to take liberty for granted, the administration would be forced to increase strictness and lay more checks on civil life.Meanwhile, the health department has increased sampling and vaccination. Looking at the surge in cases, additional 514 beds have been arranged in four government hospitals. At present, 514 beds are available at the government hospitals of which 339 are vacant.

---||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh overruled CIU chief on Sachin Waze posting: Report||MUMBAI: The crime branch chief had objected to the posting of Sachin Waze in the elite crime intelligence unit, a report prepared by joint CP (crime) Milind Bharambe said. Bharambe filed the report after the home department on March 24 asked the commissioner of police to file a report on Waze following his arrest for planting of explosives in a Scorpio found parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and murder of Mansukh Hiran. The home department had asked eight questions pertaining to Waze. Bharambe submitted the report on March 30, addressing it to the additional home secretary, and city police chief Hemant Nagrale recently submitted the report to the home department. Waze was among the 57 cops reinstated citing shortage of manpower during the pandemic in June 2020 after 3 review meetings. Waze was initially given a non-executive posting at the local arms division on June 8. The same day, he was transferred to CIU in a meeting of the Police Establishment Board. Singh had also issued an order saying that henceforth, any appointment of senior inspectors of the crime branch will be not done without his consent, the report stated. CIU was always headed by an officer of the rank of inspector, but Waze was one rank junior. Waze has not followed the rules and directly and independently reported to Param Bir Singh, and Waze investigated under his guidance, the report said. “Sachin Waze was following the guidelines of the then commissioner of police about raids on illegal activities, whom to arrest or not,” the report said. The report said Waze never reported to any officer of the crime branch during his nine months’ tenure (June 10 to March 12, 2021). No officer of the crime branch gave any review opinion/directions in investigations handled by Waze because he directly reported it to the commissioner, the report said. Waze’s subordinates at CIU were also asked not to report to their immediate bosses. The report said this was brought to the notices of the commissioner of police, but then the latter had given directions from time to time, the report said. “Waze who was handling important cases like TRP manipulation racket, dual car registration racket involving Dilip Chabbaria and planting of gelatines outside the house of Industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s and few other cases, was briefing Singh regularly and Waze in turn used to brief the important decision taken to the other senior crime branch officers. As per the protocol an officer probing any case briefs the assistant, deputy, additional and joint commissioners of police,” the report said. The report said though CIU had three vehicles (Tata Sumo, Innova and Scorpio ) at its disposal, Waze used high-end vehicles like Mercedes and Audi and other private vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-flouted-rules-and-reported-directly-to-police-chief-says-report/articleshow/81958436.cms||Ahmed Ali

The process of installing digital meters will commence in the next two weeks, said minister of transport Mauvin Godinho, adding that taxi operators will be given the digital meters free of cost in the first six months. Stating that the decision to offer the digital meters for free is an effort to ease the financial burden, he said, “I expect all taxi operators to install the meters within this time (six months).” Godinho said that the state transport authority will be meeting shortly to revise the taxi rates, which were last revised in 2014. “While we will be installing the meters, the new rates will also be announced and intimated to them,” the transport minister said. Taxi operators recently agreed to get digital meters installed for their taxis on the condition that the fare rates should be increased. Their contention is that the rates were last fixed in 2014 and since then the fuel prices have gone up drastically. The digital meters’ installation was delayed in Goa, however, last month, Godinho had said that there are backhand services that must be completed to monitor and track the vehicles. Godinho said that within a week’s time, he will be calling all the taxi unions and stakeholders to take them into confidence prior to the installation and to take their views on how to streamline the taxis to be run at the airport. He further said that wearing of badges will be mandatory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mauvin-installation-of-digital-meters-to-begin-in-2-weeks/articleshow/81958429.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday,” said Dr Bhagirathi Joshi, chief medical officer, Nainital.

---||Lucknow||Congress, Left & TMC trying to curb Gorkha sentiments: CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: In an apparent reference to prolonged crisis around the demand for a separate Gorkhaland, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday flayed the Congress, Left and TMC for not opening channels of dialogue with the ethnic Gorkha community to bring them into mainstream politics, reports Pankaj Shah. “The Congress, Left, and now TMC, have been conspiring to crush local Gorkha sentiments,” Yogi said, addressing rallies in Jalpaiguri, Kurseong (Darjeeling) and Kaliaganj. “Dialogue is the biggest strength of democracy but the parties which ruled Bengal till now never had talks with Gorkhas,” Yogi said, stressing that BJP would find a political solution to the problems of Gorkha community within the ambit of Indian Constitution. He also underscored that the Gorkha community had a close affinity with the Gorakhnath Peeth that he heads. The Gorkhaland movement is a movement for a separate state in the Gorkhaland region of West Bengal for Nepali-speaking Gorkha people. The proposed state includes the hill regions of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Dooars regions that included Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and parts of Cooch Behar districts. The demand for a separate administrative unit in Darjeeling has existed since 1909. Mounting an attack on the Mamata Banerjee government, Yogi accused TMC of unleashing anarchy which has led to identity crisis before the youth who are forced to migrate. Yogi said the TMC chief had no sympathy with youth, women, farmers or traders. “Didi ko to ladaane se hi fursat nahi hai… (she is pitting people against one another),” he said, adding that she sympathized with people who were involved in loot and orchestrating riots. “TMC goons have only 25 days left to correct themselves. They should not attack BJP workers else they would not find any shelter if BJP comes to power just like in case of UP,” Yogi said. Accusing Mamata of threatening people by putting them in jail for chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram’, Yogi said: “You (Mamata) may hate BJP and its leaders but why hate Lord Ram? Those who have opposed Lord Ram have met a bad end. TMC’s ‘durgati’ (bad situation) is bound to happen in West Bengal elections.” Yogi also cornered the TMC government on the coronavirus front saying that goons of the ruling party pilfered the ration meant for the needy. He accused the TMC goons of usurping money released by the Centre for providing employment to people affected by pandemic. “Every penny would be squeezed out after May 2 and invested in development of Bengal,” he said. Yogi also slammed the ruling TMC for denying adequate payment to workers of tea gardens in Darjeeling. He said while in the rest of the states, the tea garden workers were getting over Rs 300 per day, it was less than Rs 200 in case of Bengal. He said UP witnessed a significant change after a strict curb on crime and corruption and implementation of the Central government’s scheme. “The state is progressing because there is a BJP government but Bengal is lagging behind on development parameters. People now want freedom from TMC,” Yogi said, insisting that assembly elections in Bengal were not for assuming power but for bringing in necessary changes to restore the pristine glory associated with the state and fulfil the dream of ‘Sonar Bangla’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-cong-left-tmc-trying-to-curb-gorkha-sentiments/articleshow/81959788.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Nagpur||94% drop in Gondia vaccination as shortage bites||NAGPUR: A day after Union health minister Harsh Vardhan claimed there was no shortage of Covid-19 vaccine in the country, vaccination was reduced by 94% in Gondia district as vials got exhausted. Reportedly, there will be no inoculation in Gondia on Thursday. People visiting 96 vaccination centres had to return without getting the jab. TOI had on Wednesday reported on the likelihood of the vaccination taking a hit in Gondia district. The district has been vaccinating around 5,000 people every day. Officials in Gondia told TOI only 303 doses were left at eight centres on Tuesday night. “Those were used up on Wednesday. The other 96 centres could not start vaccination as they had no doses. As we are not likely to get any stock from the government, no vaccination can be done on Thursday,” they said. Gondia vaccinated 5,651 on April 4. The functioning centres were reduced to 80 from 104 due to shortage the next day and only 4,751 could be jabbed. On Tuesday, only 10 centres operated and 1,318 got vaccinated. Gondia has been administering only Covishield. On Tuesday, Harsh Vardhan told state health ministers that the Centre will continuously replenish the vaccine stock. “States should vaccinate the prioritized groups in a mission mode. The Centre is providing the required quantities to all states and UTs,” he added. Even the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) on Wednesday tweeted there is no shortage of doses. According to officials of Amravati division, Yavatmal, Akola, Buldhana and Washim districts had to reduce vaccination centres from 545 to 375 on Wednesday due to shortage of doses. “Vaccination is going on at centres where doses are available. There is no stock available in the storerooms of these four districts from April 5 onwards,” they said. The officials added doses available on Wednesday night will likely be used in these four districts on Thursday. Only Amravati district was having stock sufficient for two days. In city, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) was reportedly left with around 80 doses of Covaxin after inoculation on Wednesday. “These will be kept for second dose and Covishield will be started for first dose on Thursday,” an official from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) told TOI. GMCH is vaccinating over 400 people per day. There were six centres in the city for Covaxin. NMC converted four of them into Covishield four days ago due to shortage of Covaxin doses. This forced a few healthcare workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW), 60-plus and 45-plus with specified comorbidities to travel to GMCH for second dose of Covaxin. Many reportedly delayed the second dose. Also, many people above 45-plus who wished to take Covaxin have delayed vaccination. “I booked vaccination for my wife and mother at Viveka Hospital on April 5. I postponed vaccination to April 7 as I came to know that the centre was converted into Covishield. I again postponed the vaccination as I do not want to take them to GMCH,” a resident of Hindustan Colony said. Nagpur Rural is also reportedly left with doses only for Thursday. Zilla Parishad (ZP) vaccinated 20,769 on Wednesday. ZP official said, “NMC provided us 20,000 doses on Tuesday as stock was exhausted on Monday. 2,500 are left in store room and around 25,000 at centres on Wednesday,” he said. NMC officials said around 50,000 doses of Covishield were available with centres on Wednesday, enough for four days. The civic body administered vaccine to 12,062 on Wednesday. As per officials of deputy director of health services (DDHS) office, remaining four districts of Nagpur division- Wardha, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli and Bhandara were having sufficient doses. “Vehicle has been sent to Pune. Nagpur division is likely to get 55,000 doses of Covaxin on Friday morning. No intimation has been received from the government for Covishield doses,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/94-drop-in-gondia-vaccination-as-shortage-bites/articleshow/81957569.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Speaking at the World Health Day webinar organized by the Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI), he said that it is everyone’s responsibility to stop the spread of Covid-19. “We have seen thousands of people walking back to their hometown during the last lockdown. We don’t want people to suffer again. There will be no lockdown, curfew or bandh in the state at this stage,” said the health minister. He said that unlike a year back, people are not scared of Covid-19. “Our staff are not scared anymore. They know that they don’t need a PPE kit to go near a Covid-19 positive patient and that an N-95 mask would do. The same is the case with patients as they are confident that they will recover from Covid-19,” he added, and said that corona is just like any other virus and that we have to live with it. Talking about corporate hospitals, he said, “Instead of exploiting the situation, corporate hospitals should stand by people and give them required medical care. They shouldn’t wait for the state to threaten or cancel their licence for charging exorbitant fees, but work on humanitarian grounds.” Eatala, who also held a review meeting with health officials on facilities at area and tertiary hospitals, said 60% of Covid-19 cases are from Maharashtra and added that despite sharing a border with them the situation is control here in Telangana. He asked people staying in the border areas to be extra cautious. He said most positive cases are asymptomatic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-allays-fears-says-no-lockdown-or-curfew/articleshow/81957564.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||1,900 pending complaints of crimes against women in Rajasthan: National Commission for Women’s chief||JAIPUR: The National Commission for Women’s (NCW) chairperson Rekha Sharma, who is on a three-day trip to the state capital, has expressed concern about increasing crimes against women in Rajasthan. She said there are 1,900 pending complaints with the commission and the state police failed to respond to requests for the action report. Lack of a state women commission despite reminders was also a cause of concern for NCW chief who has sought a meeting with CM Ashok Gehlot regarding it. “We had been sending letters to Rajasthan police asking for action reports in cases of crimes against women, but there was no response. In the suo motu cases also, there was no response which is despite the fact that we have 1,900 pending complaints in 2020 and earlier from various districts. Police officials claimed that they sent action reports of few cases to us, but we have not received any,” said Sharma. Sharma held a meeting with DGP M L Lather on Tuesday and discussed issues related to women safety. Sharma claimed that increasing cases of crimes against women was one of the reasons for her visit. Last month, the NCW had written to the DGP seeking a report about the case of the police officer who was asking for sexual favours from a rape survivor and was suspended from service followed by arrest by Anti-Corruption Bureau. Prior to this, the commission had taken cognisance of the case in which a married woman was allegedly trapped and raped repeatedly inside the compound of a police station in Alwar. Elaborating on the nature of complaints with NCW, Sharma told TOI, “Maximum complaints are about police apathy and while FIRs are registered, the investigations are not done swiftly. Moreover, there is a need to sensitise the lower rank police officials. There is also a need to change society’s mindset in Rajasthan and have laws to prevent child marriages and Nata Pratha. Awareness has to be raised which is the government’s responsibility.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1900-pending-complaints-of-crimes-against-women-ncw-chief/articleshow/81957566.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: A lower Court notice to Centre and NCERT over glorification of Mughals in textbook||JAIPUR: A lower court in Jaipur has issued notice to the Union ministry of education and director NCERT over glorification of Mughal rulers in the NCERT history textbook for Class XII. The petition sought to remove the facts which glorify Mughals and sought a ban on printing and publishing the substantive part in the history book. The court ordered the respondents to appear either on their own or through their advocate and present their reply along with the documents by April 19. P C Bhandari has filed a petition against the joint secretary, ministry of education, New Delhi and director, NCERT in civil court no. 17, Sanganer, Jaipur and demanded that in Page No. 234 of the Clas XII history book ‘Themes in Indian History’ Part-2 states that Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb issued grants to repair temples that were demolished during wars. When the petitioner sought information under RTI, the head of Department of Public Information replied that they had no proof to substantiate the printed matter, Bhandari then approached the court on January 19, 2021, seeking to remove the disputed part from the book. But even after two months of receiving the notice, the facts that glorified Mughals were not removed from the book, said the petitioner. Agarwal bail hearing postponed The hearing on the bail plea of suspended IPS officer Manish Agarwal has been posted for April 17 after the judge hearing the case could not sit on Wednesday. Rajasthan ACB on February 2 this year arrested the IPS officer in Jaipur. The official posted as the commandant of the State Disaster Response Force, Jaipur, was arrested after his name cropped up in a case in which a petrol pump owner, Neeraj Meena, was arrested for allegedly demanding money from a construction firm on the officer’s behalf. The 2010-batch IPS officer was accused of corruption while he was earlier posted as Dausa SP. The ACB on January 13 arrested Dausa SDM Pushkar Mittal, Bandikui SDM Pinki Meena, and Neeraj Meena for allegedly demanding bribes from the owner of a road construction company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/court-notice-to-centre-and-ncert-over-glorification-of-mughals-in-textbook/articleshow/81957560.cms||---

Police said that Chetna’s husband Lalit owns land worth nearly Rs three crore while her father was a government officer who worked in the city survey department. She tipped off her sister Renuka who lives in Mumbai few months ago that Rs 40 crore was kept in a house in Dumas. Renuka knew one of the gang members. However, the loot plan could not be executed then. Recently, Chetna again shared the information with Renuka that the deceased Bhupendra Patel had earned Rs three crore cash in a land deal and had kept the money in his house.  “Chetna is greedy and she planned to get a portion of the money looted from Bhupendra’s home,” said a police officer.  After the gang members arrived from Mumbai, Chetna met them on Udhna Magdalla Road near Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) and took them to show Patel’s house.  “Lalit was not aware of Chetna’s plans,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/greed-drove-millionaire-woman-to-plot-murder/articleshow/81956540.cms||---
---||Pune||Credai concerned over sop rollback||Pune: The newly-elected members of Credai Pune Metro said the real estate market could soon reach the level of sales achieved in 2019, but expressed concern over the rollback of incentives that had given a fillip to the sector after the first wave of Covid-19 infections. They said that they plan to carry out a mass vaccination drive of construction workers in the Pune metropolitan region, subject to availability of vaccines. Low rates on home loans and 3% stamp duty cut announced by the Maharashtra government had led to a boom in sales from September 2020 till the end of 2020-21 fiscal, with triple digit growth recorded in some markets, especially in Mumbai and Pune. However, the decision by the state government not to extend stamp duty cuts beyond March has raised concern among some developers. “With measures like lower interest from banks and reduction in stamp duty last year, there were hopes for the industry’s revival. But banks have again increased interest rates, which can have an adverse effect on the sector. Around 250 allied industries and lakhs of labourers depend on the real estate,” said Anil Pharande, the new president of Credai Pune Metro. Harsh Vardhan Patodia, the new national president of Credai, said that the market can recover fully to pre-pandemic levels. “Housing sales that fell 40-50% across 7-8 major cities last year due to the pandemic could bounce back to 2019-level this year, if there is no complete lockdown to curb the second wave of Covid-19. The importance of owning a home has also been propelled by the uncertainty Covid brought into people’s lives,” Patodia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/credai-concerned-over-sop-rollback/articleshow/81957565.cms||---

They say there is no check on violations especially around groceries and eateries. They add that some swimming pools have also opened in the Old City in contravention to rules. Joining them, political parties have demanded that the newly-elected GHMC Mayor visit Old City to understand the ground reality. “Old City has been completely ignored by the GHMC. The health department has also failed to address problems people are facing," Mohammed Ahmed, TDP GHMC minority vice-president, said. A resident from Muhajireen Camp in Old City told TOI that Covid-19 had claimed the lives of two people he knew in a span of a few weeks. “My sister and a friend’s brother passed away after they contracted Covid-19. Their demise shocked us and has created fear among us,” said Fareed. The elderly rue the lack of awareness about the infection and said they get little help in an emergency. They feel vulnerable with many youngsters roaming the streets throwing safety to the wind. “Authorities should take note of prevailing conditions.

Punjab is among the states hit hardest by the second wave, recording a steep rise in average daily caseload from 240 in the second week of February to 2,800 cases a day in the first week of April. Out of every 100 confirmed cases, 10 infected patients are currently undergoing treatment. Punjab has the third highest rate of active cases after Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. The projected number of cases for April indicates that the current trend will continue in the coming weeks. To meet the requirement of the projected number of patients, the government has increased the number of beds. There has been a rise in the number of new patients daily admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and put on ventilator support. As many as nine patients were admitted to ICU while three were put on ventilator support on April 4. The number of infected patients admitted to ICU went up to 15 on April 5. The count further escalated to 42 on April 6. To treat serious patients, the number of beds at Level III facilities equipped with intensive care units, ventilators and with oxygen support from 2,175 to 4,539. The number of Level II beds has been increased from 7,911 to 13,593. The government continues to rely heavily on private sector for providing care as 3,881 Level III and 9,684 Level II beds are in private hospitals. The occupancy rate is below 20% at both levels. Mohali has the highest number of 4,280 active cases, followed by Amritsar, Jalandhar and Ludhiana where 3,213, 3,124 and 2,876 infected people are undergoing treatment. These districts have maximum occupancy of beds at both levels and accounted for 44% of deaths reported this week. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar shared that as per projections, the current trend is likely to continue and the government has made arrangements keeping in mind the worst-case scenario. “Sufficient number of beds have been added to meet the demand in case of further steep rise in cases,” he said. Teams dispatched by the central government to nine districts of Punjab will examine hospital infrastructure besides assisting the local administration in taking measures for Covid control and management measures. These teams will be stationed in the state for three to five days and will daily appraise the central government on the ground situation in the state.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Panel to ensure pvt hosps don’t overcharge for Covid treatment||JAIPUR: A day after issuing an order for reserving 25% beds in private hospitals, the health department on Wednesday ordered constitution of a committee at the district level to ensure that patients are not charged exorbitant fees for Covid treatment. A four-member committee, which has been constituted by the state government to ensure that private hospitals do not charge exorbitant fees for Covid treatment, comprises additional district magistrate nominated by the district collector, chief medical health officer and specialists in medicine and anesthesia. “The committee will ensure that complaints should resolve within seven days,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (health). The health department had fixed charges of beds in ICUs and general ward beds along with certain diagnostic tests and directed private hospitals to charge patients accordingly. Besides, health department issued orders for deployment of IAS and RAS officers as nodal officers at private hospitals to keep a check patients were being provided with treatment without refusal. The nodal officers will ensure that private hospitals have sufficient supply of oxygen, beds with oxygen support and also availability of beds for Covid patients. The orders of deployment of nodal officers came a day after the health department ordered to reserve 25% beds in 60-bed and above 60-bed hospitals for Covid treatment. The nodal officers will ensure that the Covid patients referred by helpline 181 and by district administration should help them in getting beds for treatment in private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/panel-to-ensure-pvt-hosps-dont-overcharge-for-covid-treatment/articleshow/81957574.cms||---

Like their male counterparts, the female renunciates were also tonsured in a mass ceremony — that started early in the morning — at the Birla Ghat in Haridwar. This was followed by 17 rounds of pind-daan (an after-death ritual) offered by the renunciates— 16 for their forefathers and the last one for themselves.Later in the day, a ceremony called Vijay Hawan, which is to be held overnight, began. Following the Vijay Hawan, the women renunciates will take a dip in the Ganga and subsequently, be imparted deeksha on Thursday morning by Swami Avdeshanand Giri, Acharya Mahamandaleshwar of Juna Akhada, at his ashram. Mata Shailja Giri, Nirman Mantri, Juna Akhada, said, “A total of 200 women from different states will be ordained as Naga sadhvis on Thursday morning. All traces of their past life were erased after 17 rounds of pind-daan. Now, they will begin their new lives and connect with the supreme power. This is a transformation from materialism to spiritualism.” Meanwhile, Mahant Hari Giri, general secretary of Juna Akhada, told TOI, “Our women wing has handpicked the women renunciates to be inducted into Naga order. Only those willing are ordained as Naga sadhus. Now, these women are our sisters/mothers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/maha-kumbh-over-200-women-renunciates-to-be-ordained-as-naga-sadhvis/articleshow/81956554.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Chandigarh||Sikh referees Bhupinder, Sunny Gill to make English Football League history||LONDON: Two British Sikh brothers Bhupinder and Sunny Gill will make English Football League history this weekend when they become the first pair of British South Asians to officiate in the same match. The UK-born brothers are sons of Jarnail Singh, the first turban-wearing Sikh English Football League referee, who moved to Britain from Mehna village in Moga in Punjab. Their mother, Baljit, is from Khanna in Ludhiana. Britain’s highest-ranked, South Asian-origin assistant referee Bhupinder, 36, a PE teacher from Iver, will be assistant referee and his brother, Sunny, 37, the most senior British South Asian referee, who referees in the Vanarama National League, will be the fourth official, at the Bristol City vs Nottingham Forest Championship match at Aston Gate on Saturday. There will not be any spectators owing to Covid-19. Sunny is an HMP Feltham prison officer from Winkfield. “I do not think there are any other Sikh referees in English football right now,” Bhupinder said. “There are others from South Asian origin but definitely not Sikh. I want to represent the Sikh community and be a role model and encourage younger people from Sikh and any diverse background to get into refereeing. Everyone wants to be a professional footballer but is very difficult to make it at the highest level but now refereeing can be seen as a career and you can still be involved at the highest level. I get a buzz from knowing I am getting decisions correct and being part of the game. As a kid I dreamt of wanting to be on a football pitch in front of thousands of people and I am experiencing that.” “The last time I went back to Punjab was 12 years ago,” Bhupinder added. He said he fondly remembered the football stadium in Mehna. “We went there aged 10 or 11 and again 13/14, and we used to play football there every day with the local kids. “ He started off as a referee aged 14, refereeing youth football matches on Sundays. Then he stopped after a year to play football for Indian Ghymkhana Club in Osterley, but then injured his back. “That made me want to stop playing as I didn’t want my back to get worse and that is when my dad said you might as well pick up the whistle again.” By then he was 24. “We have 100 per cent inherited the talent from our dad. We had the experience of going to matches with him when we were younger and we would have debates about match and referee decisions, whereas normally people would be arguing about the football game,” he said. Jarnail has retired as a referee and works as a community support officer at Heathrow and is a match observer. “There are two South Asian heritage Sikh players in the Championship, so there is starting to be a slow influx of South Asians into football now, but we are waiting for that major breakthrough into Premier League. Still there are not enough role models at the higher level to encourage more South Asians to get into football, but it is getting there slowly. When my dad and his generation came to this country, parents would say sports isn’t a career so South Asians always strived to be doctors and lawyers,” Bhupinder said. Shadow secretary of state for international development Preet Kaur Gill, Britain’s first Sikh female MP, said: “I think ahead of Baisakhi to see this game and to see two Sikhs refereeing will be absolutely something the Sikh community here in Britain can be really, really proud of and will really inspire others.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sikh-referees-bhupinder-sunny-gill-to-make-english-football-league-history/articleshow/81957576.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Packet milk sales register 30% drop due to curbs||PUNE: Milk sales across Maharashtra have dropped by almost 25-30%, from an average per day sales of 1.2 crore litres to 86-90 lakh litres since the lockdown-like restrictions came into force, rough estimates from the Maharashtra Milk Producers and Processors Association have indicated. “Traders have cut down on milk purchases due to restrictions on market operations, fear of wastage and drop in customers. Retailers selling milk in open markets have also been unable to resume sales after the restrictions. If the major markets are closed, there will be an impact,” Prakash Kutwal, secretary of Maharashtra Milk Producers and Processors Association, told TOI. Kutwal said that grocery retailers have also cut down on the milk purchases because there is uncertainty in the market as to how much they would be able to sell as well as the restrictions on operation timings of stores. “They do not want to risk any wastage. I have spoken with major dairies in the state and all have unanimously quoted a drop in sales,” he said. Shripad Chitale, a partner at Chitale Dairy, said, “There has been at least a 20% drop in sales at our end, even in cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad, as people are working from home, restaurants are closed, functions have been cancelled and grocery stores are operating for a restricted number of hours. We have also written to the prime minister, among other authorities, requesting that Covid-19 vaccination should be kept open to essential staff involved in milk collection and distribution. If the staff in this sector does not work, it would hamper milk collection and distribution.” Sanjay Kalekar, general manager of Katraj Dairy, said, “There has been a 5-7% drop in sales after the restrictions, which caused restaurants and many other businesses to close.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/packet-milk-sales-register-30-drop-due-to-curbs/articleshow/81957579.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Hyderabad||CCMB wants govt to try its testing kit||Hyderabad: A day after the Telangana High Court slammed the state government for doing fewer RT-PCR tests, the director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Rakesh Mishra, said he has written to the state government to explore the possibility of using its dry swab Covid-19 testing kits to boost testing in the state. Addressing FTCCI members, on the occasion of World Health Day, Mishra said the CCMB’s testing kits allow for dry swab tests, which are not only cost effective but can deliver results faster than existing methods where samples are prone to spillage risk. “These dry swabs can be kept at room temperature and don’t need RNA isolation also. It saves time and costs,” he explained. In December 2020, CCMB and Apollo Hospitals had tied-up to jointly produce and commercialise these dry swab rapid test kits.  Hari Prasad, president, Apollo Hospitals Group, said people should not rush to get antibody tests done after getting vaccinated. “It only gives you a false sense of assurance if the antibodies are present or alarm if they are not. Both of which are not correct because there are other forms of immunity beyond antibodies,” he said. He said Apollo Group has seen patients, who had received the second dose and had very strong antibodies but still got infected. “This does not mean vaccine is not working,” he said, adding a majority of patients, who have been vaccinated and got infected, do not need hospitalisation. The ones who need are not going into acute phase. In the past, people in their 50’s and beyond required ventilation or oxygen facilities but now younger patients too need critical care support, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ccmb-wants-govt-to-try-its-testing-kit/articleshow/81957573.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi cops to go offline to collect challans||NEW DELHI: Having trouble paying traffic challans online? Delhi Police will soon be setting up collection counters on weekends for smooth disposal of challans to take the load off its website.  Though the plan is at an initial stage, it is likely to be implemented from next week. Several people had taken to Twitter to complain about server issues. The counters would be set up in the offices of the 11 traffic ACPs. “The plan has been finalised, but approval by senior officers is awaited. We wanted to begin operations this week, but it has now been postponed to next week. For now, there will be two counters at each ACP office. For disposal of more challans, we are planning to start the facility in traffic circles too,” said a senior traffic officer. The officer added that they had received complaints from people claiming they couldn’t pay the fines as the server was down. “At the counters, challans can be paid through cash or card.” In February, Delhi Traffic Police in coordination with Delhi State Legal Services Authority had organised a Lok Adalat for settlement of dues and issues, but it had turned chaotic after several people were forced to wait outside in long queues. Many senior citizens had to return as no Covid-19 norms were being followed. Around 80 lakh challans needed to be settled, but only about 1,58,000 were taken care of during the Lok Adalat. The annual data of prosecutions in 2020 showed that traffic police had collected Rs 235 crore as fines compared with around Rs 188 crore in 2019, a rise of 24%. The increase was seen despite traffic restrictions being in place during the lockdown. Though there has been a dip in violations this year, collection has gone up as fine amounts have increased after implementation of the amended Motor Vehicle Act. In April last year, 31 challans were issued for riding without a helmet. May and June saw zero violations for improper parking, riding without helmet, stop line, one-way and not carrying pollution certificate. In July, there were 14,769 violations, but by October they rose to 81,625. Around 49 lakh notices for speeding have been issued this year compared with nine lakh last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-to-go-offline-to-collect-challans/articleshow/81957586.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana to fix district-wise vaccination targets||CHANDIGARH: In a move targeted to have adequate coverage of the vaccination for Covid-19, the health department will now allocate district-wise targets. The department is now preparing the data on the basis of annul growth trend of the population. Ahead of launching vaccine, Haryana had identified 67 lakh beneficiaries. But after 90 days, keeping in view the variation in projected beneficiaries and actual actual number of persons who got the jab, the health authorities have tasked the national health mission (NHM) the nodal agency to replan the target taking into consideration population growth data of the districts. Sources said, a team of statistical researchers have already started work in this regard. According to officials, initially the data had been prepared on the basis of formula of percentage of population of various categories like health workers, frontline workers defense and para military personnel. “But the number turned out to be less than we had projected. For example, we do not have more than 20 camps of para military areas and the cantonments too are quite less. Hence, there was a gap. Now, since we have reached the level fo 45 years and above, we will prepare the targets of the districts on the basis of population growth,’’ said a senior official associated with vaccination. Initially, district officials were asked to collect information and prepare the data. Since they are occupied with vaccination, immunisation, testing and tracing, the data will be prepared at headquarter level only, the official added. Notably, for the last six days, with the persons with or without morbidities exceeding the number, Haryana is vaccinating on an average 80,000 to one lakh people daily. Till Tuesday evening, 20,97,292 persons had got the first and second doses of the vaccine across the state. It means that it has already crossed nearly 28% of the projected target. Till April 2, 1.88 lakh healthcare workers were given first dose and 1.17 lakh frontline workers were given first dosage. Similarly, out of them 1.13 lakh healthcare workers had got the second dosage and 50,000 frontline workers had got the second dosage. While over 14 lakh persons with or without co-morbidities had got the jabs. Meanwhile, during an interaction with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, Haryana health minister Anil Vij said Haryana will vaccinate 35 lakh people by the end of this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-to-allocate-district-wise-targets-on-basis-of-population-growth-trend/articleshow/81958444.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Ahmedabad||ISI terror smoke in Kalupur fires||Ahmedabad: The burning down of several garment shops in Kalupur is now caught in the sinister blaze of a terror conspiracy, with Ahmedabad Police arresting three men whose arson attack was allegedly spurred by Pakistan’s ISI. According to police, the men planned to disrupt law and order in the city by setting shops afire on the orders of an agent of Pakistan’s spy agency. Police said that an Amraiwadi resident, Bhupendra Vanjhara, along with his friends Anil Khatik and Ankit Pal, all aged about 30, had on March 20 torched seven garment shops in Kalupur. The loss is estimated to be Rs 54 lakh. Initially, Kalupur police had registered an application to file a complaint and began an inquiry. At that stage nobody in the security establishment had an inkling about a new terror module springing up in the country, said crime branch officers. Meanwhile, city police commissioner Sanjay Srivastava received an input that a message, “Kalupur me kaam ho gaya hai”, was transmitted to Dubai. Srivastava put the city crime branch on the case. On the basis of technical surveillance and human intelligence, police nabbed the three accused from Amraiwadi on Tuesday and began an inquiry. Cops learnt that a man named Baba Khan from Dubai had sent Vanjhara a friend request on Facebook in March 2020. Vanjhara, who fantasized of becoming a don, accepted the request after he saw that Khan was using an image of Haji Mastan, a former Mumbai gangster, as his profile picture. Crime branch officers said that Khan, an ISI agent, began to cultivate Vanjhara’s confidence. Eventually, the crime branch officers said, Khan used money as an inducement to persuade Vanjhara to launch arson attacks or trigger riots to stoke anarchy in the city. The officers said that Vanjhara’s mother is unwell and he had no means to earn a livelihood. So he accepted the assignment and began plotting ways to stir trouble in the city. In the end, Vanjhara decided that arson was the best option. He roped in Pal and Khatik for the mission. They zoomed in on shops near Rewdi Bazaar. The accused shot video clips of the fires and sent them to Khan. According to cops, Khan rewarded the three with a payment of Rs 1.50 lakh through an angadia firm in Mumbai. Crime branch cops got a lead and finally the three men were nabbed and booked under the provisions of the UAPA — Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act — and the IT Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/isi-terror-smoke-in-kalupur-fires/articleshow/81957596.cms||---

Addressing media, Chadha said the people of Punjab were joining the party after being influenced by the work done by the AAP government in Delhi. He said they saw AAP as the only credible alternative that could bring change in the state. Taking a dig at chief minister Amarinder Singh, Chadha said the people were leaving the Congress due to the “anti-people policies” of its government in Punjab. “CM Amarinder Singh did not fulfil any poll promise. He is an inefficient chief minister who betrayed Punjab by making false promises,” added Chadha. He added the Kejriwal government had made Delhi’s government schools world-class and introduced a new model of development by improving the condition of government hospitals. “Students are switching from private to government schools in Delhi. People are getting good treatment in government hospitals free of cost,” claimed Chadha. AAP Barnala MLA Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said before the elections, chief minister Amarinder Singh had promised ‘Ghar-Ghar Rozgar’ to the youth of Punjab, but after coming to power, reneged on his promise. “The Congress government abolished government posts in the name of reorganising departments. The youth of Punjab will definitely take account of false promises,” he said. Dhun was a member of the zila parishad from 2008 to 2013. In 2012, he contested the elections from People’s Party of Punjab from Khemkaran assembly constituency and got around 9,000 votes. He is currently an executive committee member of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-leader-from-majha-supporters-switch-to-aap/articleshow/81957582.cms||---

Police are yet to arrest him since he tested Covid-19 positive and was admitted to New Civil Hospital (NCH) for treatment. He will be arrested after discharge. Vekariya’s vehicle had knocked down a 29-year-old clerk in Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) to death on March 26. Deceased Urvashi Chaudhary was sitting on her moped parked on the side of the road while her brother had gone to a roadside eatery to buy eatables. Vekariya was initially booked for causing death by negligence and released a few hours after his arrest, which received wide criticism from the public. After Vekariya’s medical reports confirmed that he was drunk while driving, police approached the court to add section of culpable homicide not amounting to murder in the case. Following the court’s approval, police added the section and started efforts to nab Vekariya who was on the run. Police raided his premises in Ahmedabad and other location as well but could not locate the well-known businessman. Police are yet to find out where Vekariya had been hiding and also where did he consume liquor on that day. Two inquiries have also been ordered against officials of Umra police station for negligence. In one of the inquiries assistant commissioner of police, E division, has been asked to inquire by deputy commissioner of police Vidhi Chaudhary as to why Vekariya was not booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder in the initial complaint itself. In another inquiry ordered by city police commissioner Ajay Tomar, additional commissioner of police H R Muliyana has been asked to find out that why Vekariya’s name was not disclosed in the preliminary complaint registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bakery-owner-accused-of-mowing-down-woman-surrenders-to-police/articleshow/81956585.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Remdesivir supply crisis to continue for couple of days||Nagpur: The kin of Covid-19 patients and the medical fraternity woke up to an acute shortage of Remdesivir on Wednesday across the six districts of Nagpur division, including Chandrapur, Bhandara and Gadchiroli. There will be no respite from the short supply for a couple of more days due to the statewide demand for the life-saving injection. Apart from the collectorate, NMC, and Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), even city police too are keeping tabs on the situation to ensure panic does not lead to any untoward turn. Though the FDA data showed stocks of 7,881 vials of Remdesivir in Nagpur district, 3,289 in Wardha, 282 in Chandrapur, 304 in Bhandara and 302 in Gadchiroli on April 6, the supply at these places could barely meet the demand on Wednesday. Till a consignment of Remdesivir arrived late on Wednesday afternoon, there was much anxiety among Covid hospitals and pharmacies about their fast-depleting stocks in the backdrop of the high rate of infection. On Wednesday, the joint team of FDA and district administration, along with police, visited the offices of a pharmaceutical stockist and forwarding agent to scrutinize records, stocks, supply and distribution of Remdesivir. The team would now visit private Covid hospitals and their attached pharmacies. An FDA source said reputed pharmaceutical companies had been sending their consignments of 4,000 vials four times a week, but supply also depends upon availability and frequency of transportation facilities, which may fluctuate. “There is high demand in every other district of Maharashtra, with six to seven pharmaceutical companies catering to it. Remdesivir is not manufactured in Maharashtra but comes from Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Baddi in Himachal Pradesh,” said the FDA source. In the meanwhile, the Nagpur District Chemist and Druggist Association office-bearers Hetal Thakkar, Veerbhan Kewalramani, M Dubey and Rajendra Kawdekar met district collector Ravindra Thakare to request permission for retailers to sell Remdesivir, which was prohibited by him a day ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/remdesivir-supply-crisis-to-continue-for-couple-of-days/articleshow/81957583.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Fresh curbs spark one-way ticket rush for home states||PUNE: Harshvardhan Rao (34) is again homeward bound and has this time bought a one-way flight ticket for Hyderabad. “I am not sure when I will be back again,” said Rao, who is in Pune for about two years and has been working as a manager of an electronic store at a mall in Hadapsar. But with the mall again shutting down till April 30 following the government’s new set of restrictions to curb the Covid-19 spread, returning home was his “best option”. “The closure of malls and shops has again put a question mark on my employment. My employee told many of us to leave last week, without any words of assurance about the future. It is disappointing because I had come back to Pune barely five months ago after spending many months at home in Hyderabad. But this time, I have booked a one-way ticket,” Rao said. Rao’s is not the only instance of outstation professionals and workers leaving the city. The state government’s fresh restrictions have once again triggered such a movement and flight and train ticket sales have in the past week witnessed a noticeable rise. Santosh Gupta, owner of Shree Vinayak Holidays, said, “Since the past week, one-way flight tickets to places like Kolkata, Hyderabad, Patna, Delhi and various cities in Uttar Pradesh (UP) have gone up by over 30%. Most of those bookings are by young professionals employed in Pune. The restrictions have also hit restaurants and eateries because the professionals depended much on these facilities.” An airport official said there has been a sudden increase in the number of flyers. “Most of the flights, mainly to the eastern and northern states, are running full,” the official told TOI. Railway authorities said passenger traffic in the north-bound trains from Pune was at 100% since the past few days. “Three trains originate from Pune station between 4pm and 5:30pm for states such as Bengal, UP and Bihar. All these trains are running at full capacity, which means nothing less than 1,500 passengers. There is also a train from Pune to Danapur in Bihar in the late evening. This train is also running at full capacity. People seem to have panicked because of the restrictions and are going home fearing job losses,” a Pune railway division official told TOI. Cab driver Ravindra Birajdar, who returned to Pune from Latur barely five months ago, said, “There is no business again. I am looking for any kind of job that can fetch me Rs100 to Rs200 a day. I need to feed my family. I am thinking of returning to my village in Latur. But there’s no work in Latur too.

The news of the approval was tweeted by Mexico’s foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard. “Very timely decision by COFEPRIS to authorise the emergency use of the COVAXIN vaccine manufactured in India. The options for vaccination against COVID-19 in Mexico are expanded,” said the post by Ebrard, a translated version of which was retweeted by the Twitter handle of the Indian Embassy in Mexico. Covaxin now becomes the sixth Covid-19 vaccine to be approved in Mexico after Russia’s Sputnik V, the Pfizer & BioNTech vaccine, AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, Sinovac’s Coronavac and CanSino’s vaccine. Mexico joins other countries like Zimbabwe, Nepal, Iran and Mauritius, among others, to have approved the use of the desi vaccine. The nod by the Mexican health regulator comes over a fortnight after neighbouring country Nepal granted emergency use approval to Covaxin and about a week after India shipped about 1 lakh doses of the vaccine to Paraguay. Covaxin doses have already been shipped to other countries like Iran and Mauritius under India’s `Vaccine Maitri' programme. While Brazil is yet to give its nod to Covaxin, it has already inked an agreement to procure 20 million doses of the vaccine, even as Ukraine and France are in parleys with Bharat Biotech. It has also inked a pact with US-based biopharma player Ocugen for Covaxin in the US market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-gets-nod-for-use-in-mexico/articleshow/81957594.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Chandigarh||Punjab sets target of 2 lakh vaccinations per day||Chandigarh: With Covid-19 positivity and case fatality rate (CFR) rates in Punjab hitting 7.7% and 2% respectively in the last week, Punjab chief minister, Amarinder Singh on Wednesday directed the health department to increase the vaccination target to 2 lakh patients per day. He also directed the officials to increase the sampling to 50,000 per day, besides vigorously pursue contact tracing of 30 people per positive patient. Expressing concern at the high CFR rate, Amarinder directed chief secretary Vini Mahajan to undertake a public awareness campaign to motivate people to approach hospitals at early stages. He said the quality of health care in hospitals also needs to be improved and the list of approved hospitals with required facilities should be put out in the public domain. He said death audits should be done by all districts and private facilities that are not participating in the expert group discussions should be encouraged to do so. The health department said Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGI), Chandigarh was refusing to admit patients from Punjab, despite being referred through proper channels. To which the CM promised he would take up the matter with the Prime Minister during the video conference planned for Thursday. He said he would request him to direct the hospital to reserve at least 50 ICU beds for patients referred by the state government. Amarinder was chairing the weekly Covid-19 review meeting with officials of health department and medical experts. He said at present 90,000 people are being vaccinated per day, this needed to be raised to 2 lakh. “Vaccination is the only way to prevent the spread,” he said, directing the health department to take immediate steps to speed up the drive. He also said he would again urge the Union government to relax the age criteria of 45 years in areas showing weekly doubling of positivity rate. He said that the Union government should allow vaccinations to all potential super-spreaders — students above 18 years, teachers, councillors and sarpanchs. On the issue of vaccination supply, Vini Mahajan told the CM that the Union government had assured that the state will not face any shortage. The chief minister was assured by the health department that daily sampling will be increased to 50,000 – 35,000 RTPCR and 15,000 Rapid Antigen Tests. He was, however, told the government of India’s institutions like IISER, IMTech, AIIMS and PGI were sampling only 100 a day, which is low.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-sets-target-of-2-lakh-vaccinations-per-day/articleshow/81958440.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||India||EC asks Mamata Banerjee to explain ‘communal’ appeal to voters||NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Wednesday issued notice to Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee over a recent speech where she had allegedly appealed to Muslims not to split their votes among different political parties. Calling her statement — made during a speech at Tarakeshwar in Hooghly on April 3 — as a violation of Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act (corrupt practices/promoting enmity along communal lines for furthering prospects of election of a candidate), and provisions of the model code, the poll panel asked Banerjee to explain her remarks within 48 hours of receipt of the notice. In a speech at Cooch Behar soon after, PM Modi referred to Banerjee’s appeal and said if he had made a similar remark regarding Hindus, he would have promptly received an EC notice and several editorials would have been written on the subject. “Hamare baal noche jate (Our hair would have been torn out),” he had said. BJP had on April 3 complained to the EC alleging that Banerjee, telecast on TV channel ABP Ananda, appealed to the Muslim voters not to let their votes be divided. As per transcript of her speech sent to the EC by chief electoral officer of West Bengal, Banerjee had, while mentioning scholarships given to university students, mentioned Shikshashree for SC/ST, Swami Vivekananda Scholarship for general category and Aikyashree “for my brothers and sisters belonging to the minority community”. “I have given it to 2.35 crore beneficiaries. I am requesting my minority brothers and sisters with folded hands don’t divide the minority votes after listening to the devil (Shaitaan) person who has taken money from BJP,” she said. The EC notice cited model code provision that requires criticism of political parties to be confined to their policies and programmes, past record and work, and not extend to personal lives of leaders/candidates or be based on unverified allegations. Another provision debars appeal to caste or communal feelings for securing votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ec-asks-mamata-banerjee-to-explain-communal-appeal-to-voters/articleshow/81960798.cms||---

---||Delhi||No kidney transplants at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital for a year||NEW DELHI: Since the past one year, when the pandemic started, not a single kidney transplant has been conducted at Safdarjung Hospital. With Covid-19 cases rising once again, doctors say the life-saving surgery may not restart for a few more months. Dr Anup Kumar, who heads the urology and kidney transplant services at Safdarjung Hospital, said, “We have been working in limited capacity due to the diversion of infrastructure and manpower for Covid-19 patients for the last one year. Due to this, kidney transplants are not being conducted.” Coronavirus can be fatal. So can be other diseases. One should not privilege one ailment while totally ignoring others. The trick is to maintain a delicate balance between the two, especially in public healthcare. For millions, government hospitals are the only option. A closed door is almost a death warrant for them. TimesViewCoronavirus can be fatal. So can be other diseases. One should not privilege one ailment while totally ignoring others. The trick is to maintain a delicate balance between the two, especially in public healthcare. For millions, government hospitals are the only option. A closed door is almost a death warrant for them.Before the Covid-19 outbreak, 7-8 transplants were being conducted every month at the hospital. Dr Kumar said the waiting time had gone up to two years now. Some patients may not survive that long. AIIMS had also stopped kidney transplant services in March 2020 because beds and manpower from the nephrology department were diverted for Covid care. While the transplant services resumed recently, doctors said the critical service could get affected once again due to the need for more beds to treat Covid-19 patients. Dr Dinesh Khullar, chairman and head of nephrology and kidney transplant at Max Saket, said there was a 50% reduction in kidney transplants across the country last year. “We need to devise a mechanism to ensure that the critical care continues despite the pandemic. This is because studies show that mortality is higher among kidney failure patients who remain on dialysis compared with those undergoing kidney transplant in case they contract Covid-19. Dialysis patients are also at higher risk to contract the viral infection as they have to visit the hospital regularly,” he added. “Covid-19 is not going away so soon. We need to develop strategies to ensure that non-Covid patients continue to get the required treatment to save lives,” said Dr Sanjeev Gulati, director of nephrology and kidney transplant at Fortis Vasant Kunj. After the first three weeks of the lockdown last year, a group of doctors from 19 major hospitals (eight public and 11 private) from across the country participated in a questionnaire-based survey that sought to determine the effects of the lockdown on the care of patients with kidney disease, including those on dialysis. The survey results published in Kidney International Reports, an official journal of International Society of Nephrology, mentioned that the total number of dialysis patients at these centres came down from 2,517 to 2,404 during the lockdown. About 710 (28%) patients missed one or more dialysis sessions, 69 (3%) required emergency dialysis, 104 (4%) stopped reporting, and nine (0.4%) were confirmed to have died. A transplant is done to replace a diseased kidney with a healthy one from a donor. In the absence of this surgery, patients survive on dialysis by removal of waste products and excess fluid from blood through a machine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-kidney-transplants-at-safdarjung-for-a-yr/articleshow/81958586.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote constituted a panel named ‘Nagpur Covid-19 Committee’ under divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar and directed him to convene a meeting of all members on Wednesday itself at 5pm. The HC asked the panel to submit a comprehensive report on steps needed to tackle the emergency situation. The directives came while hearing a suo motu PIL(No. 4/2020) based on TOI reports on bed shortage, where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed amicus curiae assisted by Nidhi Dayani. “Health authorities are also experiencing dearth of doctors and nursing staff. This emergency is required to be addressed comprehensively by authorities to combat the return of pandemic.” The bench observed all cities in Maharashtra are witnessing thousands of Covid cases. “In Nagpur, it is reported that beds in private hospitals are full and only few are available in government hospitals.” Asking the Kumar-led committee to deliberate over the scenario, the bench told them to chalk out a comprehensive plan for tackling the pandemic. “It should spell out difficulties faced by health authorities and private hospitals. It should also give suggestions and solutions for dealing with the situation likely to arise in future and express its mind on other related issues.” Directing the panel to consider regulating Covid-19 patient admissions in all hospitals, including private ones, the judges pointed out there are complaints about non-serious or non-deserving patients getting beds because of financial status or medical insurance cover. “Such regulation may be in the nature of some Central Admission Authority or any other suitable way. The committee shall submit its report on all these aspects,” the HC said before adjourning the hearing till Thursday 2.30 pm to be held in judges conference hall. Covid-19 panel members: Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, collector Ravindra Thakare, NMC commissioner B Radhakrishnan, AIIMS director Dr Vibha Dutta, GMCH & IGGMCH deans, ophthalmologist Dr Anil Laddhad, IMA president Dr Archana Kothari, Vidarbha Hospitals’ Association president, MD medicine Dr Anand Kale, chest specialist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, and MD anesthesiologist Dr Imran Noor Mohammed HC directs extra manpower, expedited permits for AIIMS: The HC directed the new panel to positively consider AIIMS’ request for temporarily providing additional medical staff as per the chart mentioned in letter written to NMC additional commissioner on Tuesday. Earlier, AIIMS filed an affidavit that 100 beds were added of which 25 will be converted to oxygenated ones by Thursday. For that it will require statutory permissions like fire NOC and occupation certificate from MADC, NOC for HSD Tank from Department of Explosives, NOC for DG set from electrical inspector, and grant of lift license. The AIIMS also informed that it required the state’s support for additional medical staff such as eight specialist doctors (MD Pulmonary Medicine/General Medicine/Anaesthesiology), 48 duty medical officers (MBBS/BAMS), and 64 nurses for discharging responsibilities towards indoor patients. The government must consider bearing the remuneration of this additional staff, it said. “We direct MADC, electrical inspector and department of explosives to grant necessary approvals within three days as per the rules. We direct the electrical inspector to grant a lift licence within four weeks. About the provision of additional medical staff and also payment of remuneration, call in this regard would have to be taken by the new committee,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-names-panel-to-tackle-covid-emergency-in-city/articleshow/81957638.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Agri colleges may have to deal with 2 first-year batches||PUNE: The admission process for undergraduate agriculture courses in the state for the academic year 2020-21 was finally completed on April 5 at a time when the semester examination for most other courses are on the verge of starting. This is for the first time that the admission process for agriculture courses has been delayed by over eight months. By April, students are finishing their second-semester syllabus and preparing for examinations in May. For students enrolled in agriculture courses, the year has been almost lost. Now, there are questions about how will they cope with the syllabus and also whether colleges will have two first-year batches this year, as admission to the academic year 2021-22 will also take place later this year. The inadvertent delay in the admission process was first caused by the Covid-19 induced lockdown and later by the multiple technical glitches in the admission software. The agriculture officials have drawn up a plan where the first year of agriculture courses is expected to end by December 31. Harihar Kausadikar, director (education and research) at Maharashtra Council of Agricultural Education and Research (MCAER) said out of 12,819 seats in nine undergraduate programmes in the state, 11,640 admissions were confirmed this year.Q “The multiple delays in the admission process led to many students choosing other fields or taking a drop year. Agricultural degrees are high in demand in government, semi-government jobs as well as in agro-businesses, banking sector, insurance sector, agri-technology among others,” Kausadikar said. Another official said the agriculture department in consultation with the higher and technical education department has decided not to conduct the Centralised Admission Process for the 2021-22 batch by MahaIT. After the entrance test is conducted by the state CET cell, MCAER will be given the responsibility of conducting CAP from the academic year 2021-22, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/agri-colleges-may-have-to-deal-with-2-first-yr-batches/articleshow/81957618.cms||Ardhra Nair

They said that the state or respective boards should at least think of postponing the exams until the Covid-19 numbers drop. “When the state thinks that going to school can infect students, how are they expecting students to write exams in the current situation. Why can’t they wait for cases to come down to conduct exams,” questioned Ravi J, whose daughter will have to appear for SSC board examinations from May17. Parents said that the state should try to understand what students are going through. “Students are under tremendous pressure. They hardly got to attend physical classes; many couldn’t understand online classes...they are not well prepared. To top it, they will have to spend about three hours in the exam centre with a mask on, fearing that they might contract the virus,” said M Sunitha, whose child will appear for inter board exams. Many students, including those who will have to appear for CBSE and other board exams, took to Twitter. “I am an intermediate 1st-year student from Telangana state. From May 1 onwards our intermediate exams will start. Half the syllabus is not completed. In all colleges, situation is the same. I am sincerely requesting our #SabithaIndraReddy mam and #KCR sir to cancel intermediate1st-year examinations. Please help us,” read a tweet from Rishikesh M (@Rishike55727532). Some students from the state even tagged the PM. “Last year batch studied for the entire year, but no exams were conducted for them. This year, we did not get to go to school even for a month, but we are going to have exams. Plzz stop the exams,” read a tweet from@StudentsOfTela1.

The donations received by the four major temples in the state show that the average drop for the year 2020-21 is about 37% compared to the previous year. The shrines in question are Somnath temple in Veraval, Dwarkadhish temple in Dwarka town, Ambaji temple in Banaskantha, and Ranchhodrai temple in Dakor. While the slide is in the range of 20% to 55% for these temples on the standalone basis, between them the collections have dropped from Rs 119.35 crore in 2019-2020 to Rs 74.91 crore in 2020-21. Somnath has recorded the steepest drop in donations from Rs 44 crore in 2019-2020 to Rs 20.24 crore in 2020-21. “Somnath temple has registered more than a 50% drop in donations this year due to the Covid situation,” said P K Laheri, secretary of the Shree Somnath Temple trust. “The temple was closed for a long time during the nationwide lockdown and hence the income from allied services — be it dining or accommodation — was affected.” Laheri said that footfalls had reached 70% of pre-Covid levels a few months ago. Now, there has been a sharp decline again due to the rising number of corona cases. Ambaji temple has seen a modest drop among the four in donations received for 2020-21. As against Rs 51.63 crore in 2019-2020, it drew Rs 41.34 crore in the financial year ended March 31, 2021. “The donations plummeted from Rs 30-35 lakh per week to Rs 15-18 lakh per week. This change occurred three weeks ago,” said S J Chavda, deputy collector and administrator of Shri Arasuri Ambaji Mata Devasthan Trust. The trust received donations online as many devotees avoided travel. Ravindra Upadhyay, the manager of the Dakor temple, said there has been a 60% drop in the number of visitors compared to pre-Covid times. The temple was closed during the Holi festival to check the spread of Covid. The temple usually pulls in 3 lakh visitors during this period. Like many other shrines, the famous Dwarkadhish temple re-opened from June last year after remaining shut for three months. From Rs 11.72 crore in 2019-2020, donations in 2020-21 fell to Rs 6.35 crore. In pre-Covid times, 12,000 to 15,000 devotees visited the temple daily. “This went down to 3,000 daily visitors last year after the temple re-opened,” said a source in the temple trust. “The number had slowly gone up to 7,000 some time ago.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/37-dip-in-donations-at-famous-temples-in-gujarat/articleshow/81957623.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The cops suspect that she may be trying to save her sister. Police are relying upon call data records and internet protocol details to ascertain their location and activities at the time of the crime. They are also probing if the driver was on the phone. The woman has two sisters and all three are similar in appearance, a source said. Dr Shanti Swaroop Arora (72) and his wife Anjana Arora (62) were killed after the car hit and ran over them. “Deepakshi Choudhary (30) accompanied the injured couple to Manipal Hospital, who were declared brought dead.

However, doctors warn people against falling prey to such myths. Doctors said Covid-19, unlike other flu, is not following any seasonal pattern. “It is a myth that temperature rise will kill Covid-19. Covid-19 spread is unrelated to weather conditions. It can spread even when the mercury and humidity levels are high,” Dr V Nagarjuna Maturu, senior interventional pulmonologist, Yashoda Hospitals, Somajiguda, said. Unlike last year, when Covid-19 peaked in September, it has started to peak in March this year. Doctors said with the mercury levels rising, people are becoming more vulnerable to hyperthermia as well. “In hot weather conditions, people tend to sweat, remove their mask and touch their face more often. This increases their vulnerability to infection. People should be more careful in heat as many symptoms such as fever, dehydration in heat stress are common to Covid-19,” said Dr Aftab Ahmed, general medicine specialist, Apollo Hospitals, Secunderabad. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/summer-heat-will-not-kill-covid-docs/articleshow/81957612.cms||---

Police said they arrested five accused, including kingpins Sanjeev Gupta and Rahul Kumar Sharma, adding that Sharma tried to flee after firing at police but was caught. Police said they seized arms and mobile phones and impounded an SUV from Sharma and his associates. On Sunday, Rampur police had seized a consignment of 1,000 cartons of liquor worth Rs 32 lakh that was being sold illegally and launched a manhunt for the accused. Police said the gang used to sell insured liquor in the market illegally. They would later claim that the sold liquor consignment was lost or damaged in an accident and claim the insurance money, said police. Divulging details, Rampur SP Shogun Gautam said, “During interrogation, Sharma disclosed that he used to work as a manager with a transport company, which had a contract to transport and deliver liquor consignments made by Rampur Distillery. The gang used to sell insured liquor illegally in the market and then they would claim the insurance money from the insurance company showing the liquor consignment was damaged in an accident or stolen. They would prepare forged documents to claim money from the insurance company.” Rampur Distillery managing director KP Singh, meanwhile, said, “The responsibility lies with the transport company and not with the distillery. As far as the insurance claim is concerned, one needs to lodge an FIR into the matter, and then investigations are carried out by police and officials of the insurance company.” Police said they booked Rahul Kumar, Sanjeev Gupta, Rajeev Kumar, Mohan Lal and Aman Bhatiya under sections 307 (attempt to murder) 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 407 (criminal breach of trust by carrier) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and appropriate sections of the Uttar Pradesh Excise Act and the Arms Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/gang-selling-insured-liquor-illegally-busted-5-arrested/articleshow/81956595.cms||Nazar Abbas
---||Mumbai||Infections in big clusters commonly seen in second wave||Mumbai: Cluster infections appear to be playing a significant role in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. City doctors say rapid spread of the infection in much bigger groups and failure to prevent entire families from getting infected despite isolating index cases are emerging as key factors in the ongoing transmission. Some of the city’s major hospitals bear testimony to that. In the past three weeks, Goregaon’s Nesco jumbo hospital has treated three big clusters. The first group was of 49 construction workers from a Metro site; the second was of 13 labourers who picked up the infection while renovating a Mahalaxm flat. It emerged that a family member of the household was carrying the symptoms. Everyone from the family too was infected, said Nesco dean Dr Neelam Andrade. The third major cluster was a family of 16 that had picked up the infection following a wedding celebration. “We did see one or two members from the same family or co-workers getting infected together, but never in such big groups,” said Dr Andrade, adding fortunately all were detected and treated on time. Byculla’s Richardson and Cruddas Covid facility managed by BMC recently treated 11 students from Government Dental College in CSMT. The facility’s dean Dr Mayura Phulpagar said all had tested positive at the same time. “They share a mess, common areas and washrooms, which could have possibly led to the spread,” she said, adding all were mildly symptomatic and discharged three days ago. At SevenHills Hospital in Andheri, 40% of the cases fall in the cluster category. Dean Dr Deepak Adsul confirmed of the 1,650-odd beds occupied, more than 600 would be family members, contacts or people from the same workplace. A judge, his wife and children are among those admitted. “Family clusters are definitely on the top, but there are many with a history of religious and social gatherings,” he said. The hospital has been sending weekly samples of mild, moderate and severe patients for genome sequencing. “But no mutations or variants of concern have been found that could explain this. The disease appears to be more transmissible now,” he added. Genome sequencing of 223 samples from Mumbai has found the presence of the UK strain in 22 so far. Civic officials have made another vital observation. Previously, taking away the index case from a household could limit the spread. That no longer seems to be the case, said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. “We have seen that with one of our own staffers. We hospitalised her as soon as she tested positive, but her husband tested positive after five days regardless. Their daughter tested positive three days after the father. It could be that asymptomatic carriers and pre-symptomatic people are infecting,” he said. A state official said cluster infections are seen in every district. Dr Milind Kamble, dean, Government Medical College in Yavatmal, said at any given point, they have six-seven infected families, which was uncommon in the first wave. Weddings and gatherings are the source in most big clusters, said Dr Deepa Shriyan, dean of the Dahisar jumbo facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/infections-in-big-clusters-commonly-seen-in-second-wave/articleshow/81956962.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The new centres have been added in Amritsar, Ludhiana, Mohali, Jalandhar and Bathinda. Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said these districts required more hospitals for providing an optimal level of tertiary care to the patients infected by the virus. He said hospitals recommended by the expert committee and hospitals which have submitted self-declaration from these five districts have now been authorised as tertiary care hospitals for the treatment of severe Covid patients. Sidhu said even as there has been a rise in daily cases, the government is providing provided optimal level II and level III hospital facilities in the state. Patients are getting free of charge treatment in all government hospitals and critical patients who are referred to private hospitals from government facilities are also being treated free of cost, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-allows-79-more-private-hospitals-to-treat-covid-patients/articleshow/81958564.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was produced before a judicial magistrate in Kalol on Sunday, where he sought temporary bail on health grounds.The judicial magistrates granted him temporary bail for one day on health grounds with the observation that the magisterial court is empowered to do so under Section 437 of CrPC when the person is sick, though the charges levelled in the case are punishable with life imprisonment. The magistrate ordered temporary release of Shailesh Bhandari till Monday evening as the sessions court will also take up for hearing his plea for regular bail.Mukesh approached the sessions court on Monday through advocate Virat Popat demanding the cancellation of the temporary bail granted by the magistrate. It was argued that the magistrate has no jurisdiction to grant bail when the offence is punishable with life imprisonment.Applications filed by both brothers are pending with the Kalol sessions court. Shailesh Bhandari is also facing various criminal cases under prohibition laws and for allegedly illegally keeping a firearm. He has been granted temporary protection against police arrest by the high court in connection with the firearm possession case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/brother-seeks-cancellation-of-shailesh-bhandaris-bail/articleshow/81957645.cms||---

A city court remanded them in police custody till April 10. With this, the total number of people arrested in case of the alleged theft of pan-India sensitive data of corporate account holders in private banks and trading the information with buyers with an intent to siphon off funds went up to 17. The police had unearthed the crime on the night intervening March 16 and 17. Singh was detained on Tuesday from his residence in Allahabad and brought to Pune. The police said he had taken screen shots of a corporate bank account when he was posted in the financial institution’s Mumbai branch. He gave the screen shot to Bhimsen for sale, the police said. Substantial funds in these corporate accounts were lying untouched for more than a year. One of the accounts has a balance of Rs100 crore. Six other accounts have balances ranging from Rs10 crore to Rs25 crore. Collectively, the accounts have a balance of Rs216 crore. The police said the suspects had intended to siphon off these funds with the stolen data that included account details and personal identification numbers. The police said the information was leaked from the banks and not the data management centres. The suspects had sold data of seven bank accounts to various persons across India. Two buyers had even made an unsuccessful bid to siphon off money from the account having a balance of Rs100 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-bank-staffer-aide-held-in-data-theft-case/articleshow/81957640.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Fearing labour pangs, realtors in Hyderabad plan safety norms for migrants||HYDERABAD: With the steady rise in Covid-19 numbers bringing back the fear of stalled projects, city developers are seen pulling all stops to keep their working class safe.  If some are reverting to their 2020 quarantine norms – at construction sites – others are in the process of setting up isolation wards even as a few labour camps are drawing up plans to get the in-house migrant workers vaccinated at the earliest. “We have tied up with an NGO to facilitate the vaccination. Now, we will start the process to collating data on workers eligible for the jab and then get them vaccinated subsequently,” said an executive manning a labour camp in the Nanakramguda. He, however, said that many workers are apprehensive about getting the shot, for fear of extreme side-effects. “We will need to counsel these people first and then go ahead with the process,” the executive said. While Tapas Patel, CEO of Om Sree Builders and Developers, has also started the process of counselling, it is largely to reinforce the need for masks and other precautionary measures, among the workforce. Isolation camps at his site that were packed and done away with — after the intensity of the pandemic showed signs of reducing — are being brought back now. “Though we have not reported any positive case so far, we need to be prepared just in case a migrant worker takes ill,” said Patel, adding, “When the time comes, we also have to counsel them about the benefits of vaccination so allay their fears.” While the migrant labour strength at most construction sites in Hyderabad has bounced back to 50% to 70% (on an average) of the pre-Covid period, some worry that this might take a hit if workers contract the virus. “Though I don’t think we will see them go back to their homes again, like last time, it is important that they are safe and healthy. At our site, we have started the seven-day quarantine rule for all new recruits and vaccinated the office staff. We will take a call about vaccinating the migrant workers at a later stage,” said Rakesh Reddy, director, Aparna Constructions and Estates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fearing-labour-pangs-realtors-plan-safety-norms-for-migrants/articleshow/81957656.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Pune||Housing societies oppose total sealing, Rs 10,000 penalty||PUNE: Two umbrella organizations of housing societies have opposed the state government’s decision to declare an entire society a micro-containment zone even if one of its wings has five or more Covid-19 patients and slap a penalty of Rs10,000 in case of the protocol violation. “Most societies currently have more than five Covid-19 cases. We have to learn to live with the virus and help each other. The government is issuing rules without taking any of the federation members into confidence. The Rs10,000 fine for violation is too high for any society,” said Pune Co-operative Federation president Suhas Patwardhan. “All this restricts movement of people and affects supply of essential items. There should be an online meeting with the government officials ,” he said. Nearly 20,000 housing societies in the district are affiliated to the federation. The demands of the State Housing Federation, which has over one lakh members across Maharashtra, are also on the same lines. Both the groups are unhappy with the government’s order stating that the co-operative housing societies have to ensure that all persons entering the premises on a regular basis get their RT-PCR test done, till they are vaccinated in accordance with the norms. A resident of a big cooperative housing society in Pashan said because of seven cases in one building of the 13 wings and row houses, the entire society was sealed by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and it made life difficult for the remaining members to step out and get their daily needs. Ravindra Sinha, secretary of the Baner Balewadi Pashan Residents Association, said the micro-containment classification should apply to the particular wing or floor with five or more Covid-19 patients. “With most societies having multiple buildings, it is impractical to restrict the residents and there should be ward-level coordination between society groups and municipal staffers for ensuring prompt updates and preventing confusions. Tejaswini Dhomse Sawai, chairperson of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Cooperative Housing Society Federation, said the restrictions imposed by the government would have an adverse impact on Covid-19 patients in home isolation. “The are treated differently and their bare minimum requirements cannot be fulfilled. If you want citizens to assist such people, these restrictions will not help,” she said. Sudarshan Nair from Kedarinagar said sealing of buildings would make life more difficult in the time of Covid-19. “We should work towards helping those in isolation. There are several restrictions in place. Why impose additional constraints on the housing societies? Members of a society can help ensure that the quarantined people will not step out. Besides, the Rs10,000 fine is too much,” he said. A member of a society in Ambegaon said they have over 8-9 Covid patients in one of the eight wings. "Sealing the entire society will not help us because we have streamlined a system where the society members are helping all with daily essential services and arranging food for the infected people,” said Ajay Jagtap, a board member of the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/housing-societies-oppose-total-sealing-rs-10k-penalty/articleshow/81957660.cms||Nisha Nambiar

A convoy of six police vans and GPS-enabled Vajra vehicle accompanied the ambulance in which Mukhtar covered the 882km journey across three states in 16 hours. Soon after his arrival at Banda, Mukhtar was lodged in tanhai barrack number 16 after being scanned by door frame metal detector, pole metal detector and hand-held metal detector. A team of doctors will ensure round-the-clock monitoring of the don’s health. Earlier too, Mukhtar was lodged in tanhai barrack number 16 from 2017 to January 2019. Mukhtar will remain under constant surveillance as CCTVs have been installed all around the barrack where he has been lodged. Jail officials said that Mukhtar entered the prison around 5am and the team of doctors found him healthy. A team of doctors also collected his samples for Covid-19 test and the report turned out to be negative, jail officials said. Mukhtar hails from Ghazipur district and is a history-sheeter from Mehmudabad police station with 52 cases in his name, of which 15 are pending before the court. Earlier, the Punjab government had written to UP stating that it would transfer Mukhtar’s custody on or before April 8. The two states have been at loggerheads over the transfer of custody and the matter was eventually sorted out by the Supreme Court which directed Punjab government to send Mukhtar back to UP. Sources said when Mukhtar was lodged here in 2017, his family members had come to stay in Khaipaar locality which is barely a few kilometres away from the jail. They are likely to return here again, they added. However, senior police officials said they did not have any information in this regard and said police teams were checking nearby areas, lodges, restrooms and guesthouses. No criminal, big or small, will be spared: Yogi  Apparently referring to the return of don-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari from Punjab to UP’s Banda jail, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said no criminal or mafia, however big, would be spared. Addressing a rally in West Bengal on Wednesday, Yogi asked TMC workers to mend their ways or get ready to face “legal action for their wrongdoings”. “There is still time to correct yourself. Stand with BJP workers and vote in our support. Else, law will catch up with you after May 2. You must have seen the developments in UP. No mafia, whatever be their influence, will be spared. We will find them and put them in jail,” Yogi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-27-mnths-mukhtar-returns-to-ups-banda-jail/articleshow/81959827.cms||Arindam Ghosh
---||Pune||No experts to operate ventilators in rural areas||PUNE: The district health department is struggling to operationalise ventilator-supported beds at some of the sub-district and rural hospitals due to unavailability of expert doctors and health staff in rural Pune. In Khed tehsil, the health department has not been able to make use of 12 ventilator-supported beds at three rural hospitals in Chakan, Chandoli and Alandi. Dr Bhagwan Kakne, in-charge, Chandoli centre, said, “We couldn’t use seven ventilators here as we don’t have expert doctors and health workers to monitor their functioning round-the-clock. Also, our staff are currently engaged in treating Covid patients.” A section of health officials said that many centres were currently facing a similar situation across the district. However, officials maintained that they have roped in private doctors on clock-hour basis at these places. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Zilla Parishad, told TOI, “As per the government directive, only expert doctors like MD (medicine) and anaesthesiologists are allowed to work in district hospital, sub-district hospitals and medical colleges. As a result, we don’t have full-time expert doctors at rural hospitals and other facilities. But we have roped in private doctors on clock-hour basis to operate the ventilators.” Currently, there are 298 ventilator-supported beds across rural areas. But they are not sufficient in view of the rise in Covid patients. “Due to this, critical patients are forced to receive treatment at private Covid hospitals,” said health department sources. A group of social organisations and some private companies through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) arms have donated ventilator beds to government hospitals in rural Pune, but they are not being utilised during this critical time, said activists. They have demanded that the administration should make these beds functional so that poor patients can receive treatment in time. Shekhar Ghogre, former president of Chakan Municipal Council, said, “In Chakan, the Covid situation is getting worse and many critical patients are admitted in private hospitals as they don’t get required medical aid in government hospitals here. It is very unfortunate that the rural hospital in Chakan don’t have ventilator-supported beds.” Balasaheb Chudhary, an activist from Alandi, said, “Poor patients are at the receiving end in rural Pune as they can't afford to receive treatment at private hospitals. They are running from pillar to post in search of ventilator-supported beds and ICU beds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-health-department-struggling-to-operationalise-ventilator-beds-in-rural-pune/articleshow/81957677.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NIA questions Param Bir Singh, Pradeep Sharma||MUMBAI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday questioned former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh and former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma as part of its probe into the planting of gelatin sticks in a Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house on February 25 and the death of the vehicle owner, Mansukh Hiran, on March 4. NIA reportedly wanted to find out from Singh about the probe by suspended cop Sachin Waze’s team. Singh was heading the city police when Waze registered the case of planting gelatin sticks. Waze headed the Crime Intelligence Unit and reported directly to Singh on almost every investigation. Even after the case was transferred to the ATS and then NIA, Waze used to meet Singh in his chamber and hold meetings. Waze probed several high profile cases at the elite CIU. NIA wanted to find out from Singh about Waze’s reading of the case, his questioning of Hiran on his vehicle being used. “This is to ascertain what all Singh knew about the case. We also require some clarity on some other issues,” an official said. Singh arrived at the NIA office at around 9.30am and left around 1 pm. Singh was removed from the city police chief’s post last month and appointed DG (Home Guards). NIA also questioned former inspector Pradeep Sharma. The encounter specialist had worked under Singh when he was Thane city police commissioner. Sharma, who was dismissed from service for his links with the underworld, returned to the force following a court order and was posted as senior inspector of the anti-extortion cell in 2018. Sharma was grilled about his alleged meeting with Waze days before Hiran’s death. Cop Vinayak Shinde, arrested with Waze in this case, was an accused along with Sharma in the fake encounter of Chhota Rajan aide Lakhan Bhaiya in 2006. Sharma was the only one acquitted in the case. Waze was in Sharma’s team in 2004 when the custodial death of 2002 terror suspect Khwaja Yunus took place. Since then Waze was under suspension for 17 years before his controversial reinstatement last June. In 2019, Sharma resigned from the police force to contest the assembly election on a Shiv Sena ticket. He lost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nia-questions-param-bir-pradeep-sharma/articleshow/81958684.cms||Ahmed Ali

He founded the Girni Kamgar Sangharsh Samiti on October 2, 1989, and remained president till the end. A press note issued by GKSS said 10 defunct mills were revived by his efforts from 1988-1990.In 1999, Iswalkar took on the mission of seeking housing for mill workers on the mill lands of Girangaon in Central Mumbai. He pursued the cause with various governments for decades, and so far, approximately 15,000 former mill employees have been rehoused in these locations.  BJP state vice-president Chitra Wagh said a man like him would not come again. Journalist Nikhil Wagle said, “Thousands of mill workers have lost their most honest leader and I have lost a dear friend. He led a long battle for the housing rights of mill workers and won it.” Iswalkar is survived by his wife and four children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-champion-of-mill-workers-rights-datta-iswalkar-dies/articleshow/81958714.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

He managed to get back Rs 30 lakh. In an FIR filed with Vastrapur police, Girish Sujnani, a resident of Galaxy Tower, named Madhu Shrimali, a resident of Vankarvas in Sanand, as the accused.

---||Aurangabad||A year on, legal hurdles still in way of Aurangabad civic polls||AURANGABAD: Elections to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) that were due in April last year continue to witness legal hurdles even nearly a year after its term expired. The Supreme Court, which is hearing multiple petitions related to ward-formation within municipal limits among other objections, is likely to hear the matter on April 20. Sources privy to the matter on Wednesday said the state election commission (SEC), earlier in January, moved an application before the apex court seeking permission for publishing revised electoral rolls and invite objections, if any. “The case related to AMC polls was pending with the registrar of the Supreme Court with some of the parties and respondents still to submit their say. Certain headway is likely during the April 20 hearing of the case,” sources said. As regards to ward-formation, a section of petitioners has alleged incidents of breach of confidentiality and violation of minimum and maximum population norms in some wards. It was done either to reserve the ward for convenience of certain elements, it has been alleged. Besides legal hurdles, the pandemic situation prevailing over a year has also created roadblocks for the smooth conduct of elections. Civic activist Rajendra Datey-Patil said that able and experienced leadership was necessary at the AMC to meet different civic challenges. “Aurangabad was once hailed as the fastest moving city in Asia. However, it has been left behind on the path of development. A proper combination of elected representatives and office-bearers is necessary to push Aurangabad in the race for development,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/one-year-on-legal-hurdles-still-in-way-of-amc-polls/articleshow/81956615.cms||---

In many rural districts, e online classes have been patchy and students need help. Dinkar Temkar, chairman of the State Council of Education Research and Training, said a bridge course is a focused exercise where topics from the previous class relevant in the next class will be carefully chosen and taught to students so that they are able to navigate the difficulty level in the next class. “We feel that online education has not been able to reach all students and to ensure that students promoted to the next class have basic competency required for that particular class, a bridge course can be conducted. The course will be such that important topics in all subjects are covered in about one and a half or two months. This will help students better understand the concepts in the class they have been promoted to. This is especially true for standard XI students who got admissions late so syllabus has not been completed,” Temkar said. Another senior official from SCERT, Ramakanth Kathmore, said if it is left to individual teachers to decide their own bridge courses, there will not be standardisation of education. So the thought was to involve a group of teachers and SCERT officials in making a subjectwise, and classwise plan of what topics to include and then send this to all schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bridge-teaching-on-select-topics-for-students-ease-of-learning-in-next-level/articleshow/81957685.cms||Ardhra Nair

Traders, wearing black badges, will stage demonstrations along Laxmi Road on Thursday morning, with placards condemning the closure, the federation said. The traders, however, said that they will comply with the government order and observe complete lockdown on Saturday and Sunday, but keep their shops open from Monday to Friday. The FTAP, on Wednesday, sent a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, mayor Muralidhar Mohol and revenue and civic heads, including divisional commissioner and municipal chief in Pune, demanding revoking of closure order. Fatehchand Ranka, president, FTAP, said, “We held a meeting of our members on Wednesday in which it was decided to go ahead with two agitations. On Thursday, the traders will stand outside their shops on Laxmi Road, starting from Vijay Talkies chowk up to Quarter gate chowk, with banners and black ribbons, protesting closure of shops. The traders will stand on both sides of the road with 6feet distance between them.”. “We have decided to open shops on Friday if the authorities fail to withdraw the order of closure of shops. All the traders in the city will open shops at 10.30am and shut them at 6pm. Keeping shops closed for another 25 days is an injustice. Also, April is crucial for traders for GST-related work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-traders-threaten-to-reopen-shops-on-friday/articleshow/81957686.cms||Sarang Dastane

For 80 nursery seats, the school received 1,830 applications, while for a single seat in Std I, the school received 1,492 applications. The lottery for admissions under RTE for entire Maharashtra based on applications received was drawn on Wednesday through virtual mode. The lottery was conducted for 9,432 schools and 96,684 seats whereas the applications received was for 2.2 lakh children. The 25% quota admission is conducted for children belonging to economically backward and reserved category students who are eligible for admission to private English medium schools under various criteria set by the union government. Incharge of the RTE in Maharashtra, Dinkar Temkar, said the applicants will receive messages from April 15 onwards about their admissions.  “We have appealed to the parents that they should not depend only on the message but also check on the portal regarding their allotment with the login details,” he added. The admission process was conducted online and parents had to apply for their children by filling the details through the portal. Once the parents receive a message regarding school allotment on April 15, they should wait for the instructions from the education department for reporting to respective schools for verification of documents. The date of admission will be announced on the RTE portal, said Temkar. He added that during the period mentioned on the portal, the parents can visit schools and verify their documents following which their admission would be confirmed. “The parents should not rush to the schools and also ensure that they do not take their children for confirmation of admission to school. After the given period of confirmation of admission dates, if parents fail to confirm admission then they will not have any right on the allotted seat,” he added. If parents are out of town due to lockdown or any other reason then they should contact the respective admission committee of their city or district and send their documents for verification through e-mail or WhatsApp or any other mode. The applicants whose names are announced in the waiting list, will be notified once the admission of the regular list of students is complete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/single-class-i-rte-seat-in-abhinav-school-draws-1492-applications/articleshow/81957696.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

A ground of 23,000 square feet and a one-floor building is available at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Cantonment General Hospital. The PCB was planning to start a maternity ward there, but couldn’t because of funds crunch. Now, the board wants to utilise it for Covid emergency service, a PCB official said. The PCB has sent a proposal, seeking Rs90 lakh from the district administration for Covid treatment. Dr VD Gaikwad, the resident medical officer at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Cantonment General Hospital, said, “We will require funds, mainly to install an oxygen pipeline and hire doctors and medical staff on contract. If we get funds, we can make the ward operational within a fortnight. It is the need of the hour to have more oxygen-supported beds, in view of the rising Covid cases in the PCB limits as well as in the city. We are treating patients from Pune disrict, including Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits.” The district collector Rajesh Deshmukh, who had examined the board’s earlier proposal, told TOI on Wednesday, “We have been providing financial assistance to Pune, Khadki and Dehu Road cantonments to set up infrastructure for Covid treatment in their limits. A total of Rs12 crore has been sanctioned to them since last year. We would continue to extend our support to them, under the state disaster relief funds. As far as this particular proposal is concerned, the PCB had quoted a high price for PPE kits. We had categorically told them to re-examine rates as the kits are available at a lower price. We haven’t got the fresh proposal yet.” On this aspect, Gaikwad claimed that they had revised the proposal and reduced it to Rs90 lakh from Rs2 crore. “We are told that the proposal is now with the district civil surgeon office for the last few weeks,” Gaikwad added. All three cantonments in the Pune district are in a financial crisis and are totally dependent on the state government funds, a cantonment official said. “There is no special sanction of funds from the ministry of defence for building health infrastructure in the cantonments. As a result, the cantonments are forced to approach the respective district administrations for funds. Had the ministry released some special funds for Covid-19, it would have been a big relief for cantonments across the country,” said a senior official from the Directorate General of Defence Estates (DGDE), on condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcb-awaits-funds-to-start-ward-with-100-oxygen-beds/articleshow/81957693.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Ahmedabad||Permanent registration at vehicle showroom||Ahmedabad: By the end of May, you will be able to drive your brand-new vehicle out of the showroom with a permanent registration number. The state government is studying a new set of rules that makes temporary registration numbers obsolete by issuing a permanent number as soon as necessary documents are uploaded on the RTO portal. Officials said that the Centre implemented the new rules from April 1, and the Gujarat Transport department is now preparing to issue a notification for the same. Currently, once the documents along with details of the buyer are uploaded, the RTO inspector has to give online approval following which the new permanent registration number is generated. The process to generate a permanent number takes at least 15 to 21 days. Till then, the vehicle is given a certificate of temporary registration (CRTM) and a temporary number. The new system and new rules that are under consideration set aside the role of the RTO inspector, and the documents once uploaded by the dealer will be approved. The officials said that once the documents are uploaded from dealership and payment of RTO tax and vehicle tax (in case of corporation) is made, an online receipt will be generated, the vehicle will get registered immediately, and a permanent number will also be generated. However, in case of choice numbers, the person will have to wait till the auction. This will help the dealer to fit the HSRP even before delivery of the vehicle as all the process of uploading documents are usually done before the delivery. Also, a CRTM will only be issued if the sold vehicle is registered outside the state. An officer said that usually the insurance policy is issued for the first time on the chassis and engine number, but if the permanent number is generated then the same can be issued with the permanent registration number too. Pranav Shah, chairman, Gujarat region, Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA) says, “The new system will help dealers sitting in Ahmedabad register the vehicle anywhere in the state, provided the person has valid documents of the district he wants registration. The documents once uploaded in the system will ensure that the registration is done. This is big step towards paperless and faceless RTO process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/permanent-registration-at-vehicle-showroom/articleshow/81957690.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Goa||Healthcare workers begin to feel the pressure as Covid wards fill up||Panaji: After getting drenched in sweat and fainting on duty in their PPE suits, working for weeks on end without seeing their families, suffering from Covid-19 themselves, getting reinfected and hospitalised, living in constant fear of dying of the disease and spreading it to their family while helplessly watching critical patients succumb, healthcare workers are dreading the second wave as they see Covid wards filling up. “The good thing is that most healthcare workers have been vaccinated in time for the second wave. Last year, we suffered very badly with Covid-19 pneumonia,” a healthcare worker at GMC said. The year 2020 was “totally a surprise package” for them, the healthcare worker said, where nobody knew how long they would have to continue. “We were doing 8-12 hour shifts in our PPE suits, getting dehydrated and unable to use the washroom, drink water or eat properly during duty. Every now and then, we would see someone with very severe pneumonia — even young people in their 20s and 30s — succumb to the virus. All this took a toll on our mental health,” the healthcare worker said. At the ESI hospital, a healthcare worker who tended to patients during the first wave of Covid-19 last year, said they worked continuously and continue to do so while fearing the second wave. “It is physically exhausting to take care of patients in PPE suits for long hours. Staying in isolation away from family is traumatising. We live with the constant fear of contracting Covid-19, infecting our loved ones if we go home, and also of dying,” the staffer said. “Ours is the only institute where all doctors and nurses worked continuously during the Covid-19 pandemic and are still working. In other hospitals, there has been a rotation of one week in a Covid area followed by one week in a non-Covid area. We haven’t gotten any off days or rotations. We have families too,” the healthcare worker said. Frontline medical staff have found that people are taking the pandemic lightly compared to last year. “Last year, all people wore masks — with some even donning two — and maintaining social distance. Now, that fear has gone. Just because they got through the first wave, doesn’t mean the second wave will be a walk in the park. They need to be on guard,” a GMC doctor said. “The onus is now on each of us not to contribute to being a part of the second wave. I’ve been through enough last year. It was a long and tiring journey. I’m scared and don’t want to go back there again. We will require tremendous mental, not forgetting physical, strength to get through the second wave,” the doctor said. GMC interns have also been demoralised after not getting their permanent registration as doctors and being forced to continue with their internship after already completing 365 days with a monthly pay of Rs 20,000. “We were the frontline doctors in Covid wards and had all our leaves, including sick leaves, cancelled. Unfortunately, we were rewarded with a three-month extension of our internship on the last day,” an intern at the GMC said. “The situation was so bad last year that I handled almost 60 patients alone during Covid duty. The wards were overflowing. Patients were on the floor but everyone was an urgent case and had to be attended to and monitored. We couldn’t take off our PPE at any point as it would mean direct exposure with a positive patient. Some of my colleagues felt breathless even after four months of recovering from Covid. We deserve permanent registration after completing our 365 days of internship,” the intern said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/healthcare-workers-begin-to-feel-the-pressure-as-covid-wards-fill-up/articleshow/81958739.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The state generated Rs 70,289 crore against the expected Rs 94,070 crore announced in the last year’s budget. The actual gap in revenue receipts has come to Rs 23,781 crore against the projected Rs 15,374 crore. The state’s excise and finance departments have termed the collection “impressive”, considering that the business and commercial activities had stalled during the lockdown. The receipts are computed minus the state’s borrowings, which are projected to reach Rs 2.29 lakh crore by the fiscal-end. This has raised eyebrows. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who also looks after finance, accepted that there will be more borrowings. He said the unspent amount from the lockdown’s development-freeze phase will now bridge the revenue gap. The state earned Rs 59,230 crore from tax revenue and it includes Rs 6,438 crore as central share. Out of the 52,792 crore actual tax revenue, Rs 29,330 crore came from the goods and services tax (GST), Rs 5,148 crore from stamp duty, Rs 6,792 crore from excise, Rs 8,852 crore from VAT, and Rs 2,396 crore from the transport tax. Out of the non-tax receipts, Rs 1,970 crore came from the urban local bodies, Rs 1,022 crore from the mining fee, and Rs 585 crore from the transport department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-revenue-gap-exceeds-projection/articleshow/81957697.cms||Manvir Saini

The attack took place after the technician saw the accused sitting in his office and objected to it. Based on technician Ramesh Vaghela’s complaint, Shaherkotda police have registered an FIR against accused Prakash Solanki, a resident of Saraspur. Vaghela told police that when he entered his office on Wednesday, he saw a stranger sitting there. Vaghela told him to vacate the office as it was meant only for staff members. “Solanki said he had come to the hospital to donate blood and he could sit there as his mother and brother worked as sanitation workers there. When Vaghela insisted that Solanki cannot sit in the office, Solanki began abusing and screaming him. He went out of the lab technician’s office, found a bottle of acid and began threatening to throw it on Vaghela. Vaghela came out of his office and grabbed Solanki’s hand on seeing the bottle. However, Solanki managed to get free and threw acid on Vaghela,” the FIR states. Other staff members rushed Vaghela for treatment. Doctors said that Vaghela was fortunate to get away with just 5% burns on his hand and face. A team of FSL was also called on the spot. The opined that prima facie, the acid was diluted with water to clean the hospitla toilets as a result Vaghela did not suffer any life-threatening injuries. Shaherkotda police registered a complaint of causing grievous hurt against Solanki and began an investigation. Solanki is on the run after the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/asked-to-leave-office-man-throws-acid-at-hospital-staffer/articleshow/81957698.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra in midst of a severe blood shortage||PUNE: Maharashtra has recorded a severe drop in the number of blood donations, a crisis being made worse by its rising Covid caseload, a flurry of curbs and post-vaccination protocol. Data from the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) showed the state currently has a reserve of 25,179 units of blood, compared to the 46,469 it had on March 10. The reserves may last just five to seven days, but state officials said they are confident of getting more donations. Maharashtra's daily requirement of blood is 3,000 to 5,000 units. Dr Arun Thorat, director of the SBTC, said the districts worst affected by the shortage are Pune, Mumbai and Nashik. He said, “Every year, during April, May, June, October and November, we see a drop in blood donation camps mainly due to high summer temperatures and school holidays. But this year, the shortage has been more severe, due to the pandemic’s caseload as well as the vaccination protocol.” Post-vaccination guidelines state recipients cannot donate blood from the day of the first jab and not until 28 days after the second dose. As for the impact of curfews, another SBTC official said the weekend restrictions have been particularly problematic. “Most of the blood donation camps are held on Saturdays and Sundays,” the official said. Dr Thorat said the SBTC has now asked all donation centres as well as social, religious and political groups to help avert a shortage during the key months of April, May and June. “Certain rare blood types are also in short supply. Available reserves may last five to seven days, but that does not mean we’ll be completely out after that. Efforts are on to organise more donation camps and there will be regular addition to the stock,” he said. An official source said Pune is seriously short on red cells too, which is given to patients with anemia, trauma and during some surgeries. “Last year, we used to have 500 to 1,000 red-cell bags at each blood centre at any given time. These days, the figure is not more than 100 at any centre,” the source said. Dr Purnima Rao, senior consultant with Sahyadri Hospitals and secretary of the Indian Society of Blood Transfusion and Immunohaematology (ISBTI), Maharashtra Chapter, said, “It was a difficult task to collect blood during the pandemic’s peak in 2020. This can be gauged from the fact that collection in 2020 stood at 2.04 lakh units as against 2.2 lakh units in 2018 and 2.34 lakh units in 2019 in Pune district. The shortage is being felt this year too, especially after the rise in Covid cases. But many social organisations and other groups are coming forward in these difficult times to organise camps at regular intervals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-in-midst-of-a-severe-blood-shortage/articleshow/81957700.cms||Neha Madaan

While 138 people were cured over the last 24 hours, the recovery rate which was 96 to 97% last month, has been dropping and it was 94% on Wednesday. The centre that witnessed a big leap in infections over the last 24 hours in North Goa was Porvorim. Its caseload went up from 190 to 273 on Wednesday. Margao urban health centre’s caseload rose to 295 with an addition of over 40 new cases. Panaji urban health added 28 cases and its caseload increased to 244. Most of the cases reported in the capital were of hotel staff. Candolim primary health centre saw its tally going up 238 with an addition of over 35 new cases. Ponda also witnessed a rapid rise and the caseload has crossed the 200-mark. Vasco, Cortalim, Mapusa and Siolim each have over 100 cases. Though the rate of infections reported from Sakhali, Bicholim, Chinchinim, Cansualim, and Curchorem is low, a health officer said he is worried that these places too may see faster growth in the next two weeks as people are not yet serious about following a Covid-19 protocol. “You must only look at bus stands, markets, and other public spaces to see how people behave,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-527-new-infections-positivity-rate-rises-to-20/articleshow/81958775.cms||---

Talking to TOI on Wednesday, Yadwinder Kaur, wife of Balraj Singh, said she had spoken to her husband before he went on “night duty” on Friday. “Normally, he returns the next day by 8am, but I didn’t hear from him. Around 8.30pm, I received a call from my husband, who told me that he had a bullet injury and it scared all of us,” she said, adding that her husband later informed how he stopped a fellow soldier from bleeding by tying his turban on his feet while he himself was injured Family of Balraj Singh who used his turban to bandage wounded soldierA trooper of CRPF’s elite Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) wing, Balraj had taken off his turban to tie the wound of fellow soldier Abhishek Pandey during the encounter with Maoists in Bijapur’s Tekulguda village on Saturday. The only brother of three sisters, Balraj Singh, has become a hero for people, said Harjit Kaur, Balraj’s mother. She said since childhood, her son wanted to be a soldier . She said due to her poor health, family members didn’t tell her about Balraj’s encounter with Maoists . “But I am proud of my son. He has made us proud and kept the dignity and honour of his turban,” she said. As tears welled up in her eyes, Harjit said her son had set an example for others. Turban (dastar) is an integral part of Sikhs’ religious identity and represents honour, self-respect, courage, and equality. Baptized Sikhs keep five Ks of faith, and wear the turban to cover their kesh, or hair. Capt Surjit Singh (retd), who is president of the gurdwara of Balraj’s village and a member of village panchayat, said everyone was proud of Balraj. “A Sikh never let anyone remove his turban and can give his life if anyone attempts to do so, but Balraj, despite being injured, did a selfless act,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chhattisgarh-ambush-cobra-commando-who-took-bullet-helped-fellow-soldier-hailed-a-hero/articleshow/81958743.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The MLA from Bithri Chainpur, Rajesh Agarwal alias Pappu Bhartaul, has alleged that the official was giving nod to land mafias to take up construction work at the BDA’s Ramganga Nagar colony without following the legal procedures. The official has trashed the charges. BDA VC Jogendra Singh said, “E-tendering process is being followed. We have our registered contractors who are looking after the developmental projects. The works are being done according to rules and regulations and these are all mere allegations.” The MLA also alleged that the official instructed to demolish houses and shops of BJP workers illegally. “The official is taking undue advantage of his power and position. It has come to light that he deliberately gave orders to demolish houses and shops of a few BJP workers, stating those were illegal, even though there was no need for a demolition. He has been causing delays in official processes such as not passing out building layout plans which are sent to him for approval. Besides, construction works are being carried out in the BDA’s Ramganga Nagar residential yojana without following the guidelines. He is giving the nod to the illegal land mafias whom he personally knows.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/bjp-mla-alleges-bdas-vc-is-corrupt-official-trashes-charges/articleshow/81956654.cms||Maria Khan

The court has now listed the case for further hearing on April 27 and has asked the state government to file its response then. The Dehradun Chief Judicial Magistrate had directed Negi to deposit his DNA sample after a woman accused him of rape. She added that Negi is the biological father of her child. However, the HC stayed the order. Now, it has extended the stay. As earlier reported by TOI, the woman, a resident of Uttar Pradesh, had filed a police complaint last year alleging that Negi raped her and her marriage was also ruined after her husband got to know that he wasn’t the biological father of her child. Negi and his family have, however, denied the allegations and even filed a police complaint against the woman accusing her of extortion.

Senior officials told the Union home secretary that bifurcation of non-cadre superintendents of police (SPs), additional SPs and DSPs were not yet resolved. Similarly, division of assets and debts of corporations listed in the Schedule IX of AP Reorganisation Act and Singareni Collieries were also left unresolved. Officials told Bhalla that provisions to levy taxes as per Sections 51,51 and 56 of the Reorganisation Act are also pending resolution. AP chief secretary Adityanath Das urged Bhalla to prevail upon Telangana to clear AP’s power supply dues to the tune of Rs 7,000 crore, pointing out that Telangana has to pay the amount to AP Genco for supply of power after bifurcation of the state.

Though the incident reportedly happened about a week back, it came to light on Tuesday. Chittoor SP S Senthil Kumar formed three special teams to investigate the case, who interacted with locals and temple priests before zeroing in on the suspect. The woman, identified as Jyothi, used to loiter around the temple. Senthil Kumar said she confessed that she visited the temple after consuming toddy and after desecrating the idols, abandoned them at an isolated place. “The temple located in a isolated place atop a hillock. The priests go there only once in a week. The priests and locals told us that they suspected Jyothi. When we questioned her, she confessed to her act. In fact she had gone around the village screaming that she had killed ‘Murugan’ but locals took her lightly because of her mental state. The vandalism act came to light when the priests went to the temple on Tuesday,” the Chittoor SP said, adding that the woman would be referred to a psychiatrist for medical care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/mentally-ill-woman-held-for-vandalising-idols/articleshow/81956635.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation sees Rs 100 crore revenue loss for 2nd yr in a row||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) has suffered revenue losses to the tune of nearly Rs 100 crore in the 2020-21 financial year. The civic body could realise only Rs 285 crore out of its targeted Rs 384 crore collectible property tax demand, including vacant land tax. Only in zone-V did collections touch nearly 90%, the highest among all zones of the city. The quantum of collections for household water tap charges were much poorer compared to property tax collections. The civic body realised only Rs 23.5 crore out of the collectible demand of Rs 80 crore. On the whole, the GVMC collected nearly Rs 185 crore water tax, including semi-bulk and bulk water connections in FY 2020-21. The Covid-19 pandemic had first affected revenue flows of the GVMC in the 2019-20 fiscal before continuing to eat into the revenues of the civic body last fiscal as well. The GVMC, which usually earns about Rs 100 crore in the form of taxes in March alone, had ended up with only Rs 11 crore collection in March 2020. According to GVMC officials, the lockdown, travel bans and other restrictions led to a subdued response from taxpayers for the next several months before collections picked up steam in the third quarter of 2020. The GVMC was also mostly limited to Covid-19 containment and surveillance measures in the city in the first few months of the outbreak. In a bid to improve tax collections, the civic body had to extend the 5% tax rebate till June-end in 2020, which would otherwise have ended in April. In the 2018-19 financial year, the GVMC had for the first time in its history realised more than Rs 300 crore tax revenue, about Rs 50 crore higher compared to 2017-18. But the civic body could not continue the momentum in 2019-20 with the pandemic taking a toll on tax collection flow. As per budgetary proposals for the 2021-22 financial year, the GVMC has projected Rs 450 crore collectible property tax demand. However, it is still not clear whether property taxes would be revised or not based on the new tax regime brought in by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-sees-rs-100-cr-revenue-loss-for-2nd-yr-in-a-row/articleshow/81956500.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Delhi||Scholarship not paid, university students protest||NEW DELHI: The first-year masters and PhD students at South Asian University have been on a protest since March 28 demanding immediate disbursal of scholarships and freeships with arrears from October 26, 2020. While the university stated that physical verification was required for granting scholarship, the students who were admitted in March 2020 said it was not possible as they were yet to visit the campus and those from abroad were not being granted visas owing to the pandemic. They are currently being taught online. TimesViewIn the past one year, many organisations devised methods to counter the extraordinary Covid-19 situation with creative use of technology. Authorities at the South Asian University too should find ways to ensure proper verification without the physical presence of the student. Student scholarships should not be held back.A statement issued by the students mentioned, “The first-year students were forced to decide on a class boycott after the university’s uncaring and unresponsive attitude towards our emails demanding what was promised in our admission offer letters. The university administration issued an ambiguous notice on March 19 mandating physical registration of students to disburse scholarships without clarifying when such verification would occur.” “Why are we not being given permission like students of other years? If the university wants, it can easily do e-verification, but they are not listening to us. How will they do physical verification of foreign students when visas are not being granted?” asked a student on anonymity. For foreign students, the administration has sent mails to the high commissions of SAARC countries requesting them to provide visas to first-year students only after a decision is taken on restarting physical classes. The students have also been demanding the monthly living allowance, which is a part of the scholarship. However, the university stated, “Since the students are not physically present on the campus, paying living allowance to those attending classes from their homes makes little sense.” Asked about the scholarship, a university official said, “Considering the situation, it doesn’t make sense to ask the first semester students to come to the campus. It was categorically communicated to each student at the time of admission that they could come to the campus only after the situation guaranteed physical classes.” “Moreover, disbursement of scholarship to all first-year students is not feasible at this point as all of them do not have accounts in the banks that the university deals with or any other bank in India. There are challenges in sending money to bank accounts in many SAARC member states,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/scholarship-not-paid-university-students-protest/articleshow/81958839.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Justice Gill takes oath as Punjab chief vigilance commissioner||Chandigarh: Justice Mehtab Singh Gill, former acting chief justice of the Punjab and Haryana high court, took oath as the first Punjab chief vigilance commissioner on Wednesday. He was administered the oath by governor V P Singh Badnore through video conferencing. The state government had invited applications for this post through an advertisement on March 4 to which five retired judges of the high court and three IAS officers had applied. After Justice Gill’s name was recommended by a committee comprising the chief minister, the legislative assembly speaker and the senior most minister as per theVigilance Commission Act, 2020, the governor made the final selection. The Punjab legislative assembly had on October 21, 2020, passed the Punjab State Vigilance Commission Bill, 2020, aimed at establishing the multi-member commission to bring in more transparency and check corruption among public servants. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh in his earlier stint had steered the constitution of a similar commission in 2006, which was later scrapped by the SAD-BJP government in 2007. The commission is an independent body to exercise more effective superintendence over the functioning of the existing vigilance bureau and all departments of the state government. Justice Gill was earlier heading the commission mandated to look into politically motivated and false cases registered during 10 years of the SAD-BJP rule in Punjab. The commission had decided over 4,000 complaints and recommended cancellation of FIRs in many cases with action against erring police officials and recovery of compensation to be paid to the victims from the pockets of erring cops. Box : Preneet’s secy appointed information commissioner The governor also administered the oath of state information commissioner to Amrit Partap Singh Sekhon, who was personal secretary to Congress MP from Patiala, Preneet Kaur and officer on special duty (OSD) to chief minister Amarinder Singh. The Patiala MP was also present during the oath taking ceremony. Leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema had last month put a dissenting note about the selection of Sekhon since he was the only candidate whose name was discussed during a selection meeting attended by Cheema, the chief minister and legislative assembly Speaker Rana KP Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/justice-gill-takes-oath-as-punjab-chief-vigilance-commissioner/articleshow/81958763.cms||---

---||India||US will facilitate access to green tech: John Kerry||NEW DELHI: The US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry on Wednesday called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and promised US support to India’s climate plans by facilitating affordable access to green technologies. The Prime Minister and Kerry discussed issues relating to the upcoming virtual leaders’ summit, which is to be held on April 22-23, to galvanise global support towards ‘net-zero’ emission goals in the run up to the 26th session of the UN climate conference. Modi, during the meeting, noted that India is committed to meeting its nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement and that it was among the few countries on track to meet these commitments. “The Prime Minister agreed that cooperation between India and the US particularly on financing innovation and faster deployment of green technologies would have a positive demonstration effect on other countries,” said a statement from the PMO. Discussions centred on forthcoming climate leaders’ summit as well as climate issues in the context of COP26,” tweeted MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi on the Modi-Kerry meeting. Kerry had on Tuesday held separate meetings with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and environment minister Prakash Javadekar with a focus on raising climate ambition by revising country-specific climate action targets under the Paris deal. After concluding his first day of meeting with Indian leaders, Kerry made a strong pitch for bringing India on board for higher mitigation ambition through a tweet saying, “We must raise ambition together, or we’ll fail together.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-will-facilitate-access-to-green-tech-john-kerry/articleshow/81960849.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Infections in big clusters commonly seen in second wave||MUMBAI: Cluster infections appear to be playing a significant role in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. City doctors say rapid spread of the infection in much bigger groups and failure to prevent entire families from getting infected despite isolating index cases are emerging as key factors in the ongoing transmission. Some of the city’s major hospitals bear testimony to that. In the past three weeks, Goregaon’s Nesco jumbo hospital has treated three big clusters. The first group was of 49 construction workers from a Metro site; the second was of 13 labourers who picked up the infection while renovating a Mahalaxm flat. It emerged that a family member of the household was carrying the symptoms. Everyone from the family too was infected, said Nesco dean Dr Neelam Andrade. The third major cluster was a family of 16 that had picked up the infection following a wedding celebration. “We did see one or two members from the same family or co-workers getting infected together, but never in such big groups,” said Dr Andrade, adding fortunately all were detected and treated on time. Byculla’s Richardson and Cruddas Covid facility managed by BMC recently treated 11 students from Government Dental College in CSMT. The facility’s dean, Dr Mayura Phulpagar, said all had tested positive at the same time. “They share a mess, common areas and washrooms, which could have possibly led to the spread,” she said, adding all were mildly symptomatic and discharged three days ago. At SevenHills Hospital in Andheri, 40% of the cases fall in the cluster category. Dean Dr Deepak Adsul confirmed of the 1,650-odd beds occupied, more than 600 would be family members, contacts or people from the same workplace. A judge, his wife and children are among those admitted. “Family clusters are definitely on the top, but there are many with a history of religious and social gatherings,” he said. The hospital has been sending weekly samples of mild, moderate and severe patients for genome sequencing. “But no mutations or variants of concern have been found that could explain this. The disease appears to be more transmissible now,” he added. Genome sequencing of 223 samples from Mumbai has found the presence of the UK strain in 22 so far. Civic officials have made another vital observation. Previously, taking away the index case from a household could limit the spread. That no longer seems to be the case, said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. “We have seen that with one of our own staffers. We hospitalised her as soon as she tested positive, but her husband tested positive after five days regardless. Their daughter tested positive three days after the father. It could be that asymptomatic carriers and pre-symptomatic people are infecting,” he said. A state official said cluster infections are seen in every district. Dr Milind Kamble, dean, Government Medical College in Yavatmal, said at any given point, they have six-seven infected families, which was uncommon in the first wave. Weddings and gatherings are the source in most big clusters, said Dr Deepa Shriyan, dean of the Dahisar jumbo facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-infections-in-big-clusters-commonly-seen-in-second-wave/articleshow/81958829.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Chandigarh||SAD (D) opposes hike in electricity, oil prices, property tax||Chandigarh: Condemning the Punjab government for the recent hike in property taxes, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) on Wednesday said the hiked prices should immediately be rolled back. The party also demanded withdrawal of the hike in electricity and oil prices too. SAD (Democratic) leader and Lehra-Gaga MLA Parminder Singh Dhindsa said before the 2017 elections, Capt Amarinder Singh had made promises of reducing power prices and not imposing additional tax burden. He said in the last budget session, the Congress government in Punjab had promised people of the state that no new tax would be imposed in this financial year. However, just a month after the budget session, the government has started levying hidden taxes by increasing property tax by 5%, he added. “It is unfortunate to see how CM Capt Amarinder Singh-led Punjab government, instead of providing relief to people, is overburdening them by increasing power tariff, oil prices continuously and now by hiking property tax too,” said former finance minister Dhindsa. He added Punjab was among the states which purchased cheapest power in the country and sold power at much higher rates as compared to other states. He also opposed the hike in petrol and diesel prices in the state, stating that many states of the country had reduced taxes on petrol and diesel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-d-opposes-hike-in-electricity-oil-prices-property-tax/articleshow/81958811.cms||---

The man was suffering from chronic tuberculosis and vomited blood, and passed away. District immunization officer Dr RN Singh said that the "family didn’t have any complaint against the vaccine". The elderly man was a resident of Jhaunagla locality. He was suffering from comorbidities. On Tuesday morning, he went to a community health centre in Majhgawan for vaccination. After the jab, he remained under observation for 30 minutes and returned home. He fell ill in the afternoon and his condition soon worsened. He was rushed to a Bareilly hospital by his family. He vomited blood in the ambulance and died on the way. A team of doctors visited his house to collect the details. When contacted, Dr RN Singh told TOI, “The elderly man was suffering from tuberculosis. The family said that he was already unwell. They didn't want to do an autopsy. The vaccine was given to over 6,400 people on that day and others are all well.” This is the third such case in western UP in a week. A woman, 58, from Bijnor had died a few hours after getting first jab on Monday. She had also vomited blood. She started campaigning for this month's state panchayat elections - hours after the jab. A farmer, aged 62, had died in Agra on April 2, a day after vaccination. He was administered the first dose and developed high fever. Later, he lost his speech and appetite and passed away. The autopsy report stated that he "died of cardiac arrest". Agra CMO Dr RC Pandey ruled out the possibility of any vaccine side effects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/elderly-man-dies-hours-after-covid-vaccination-in-bareilly/articleshow/81956703.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Goa||Restricted entry at GMC, appts for OPD reintroduced||Panaji: Goa Medical College (GMC) will reintroduce telephonic service to make appointments for out patient departments (OPD) as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in the state. The entry of patients to the wards will also be restricted. Decisions were taken after health minister Vishwajit Rane met heads of departments of the GMC to review Covid protocols and management of the hospital on Wednesday morning. “We have collectively decided to resume the telephone service for booking OPD appointments. It has been decided to strictly implement the SOPs in GMC,” said Rane in the press statement. The state-run hospital sees about 2,000 OPD patients on regular days. Also, patients from neighbouring districts of Karnataka and Maharashtra visit the state’s tertiary care facility, and its OPDs start teeming with patients as early as 7am. GMC first introduced the telephonic service a few months into the pandemic last year to reduce crowding in OPDs when regular services resumed after the pandemic had slowed down. The system was subsequently discontinued and patients could get consultation without a prior appointment. Several patients complained that it was difficult to book appointments by telephone as the lines normally remain engaged for long durations. It was also decided at the meeting that pandals be erected at the hospital premises to facilitate social distancing. The pandals installed in the first phase of the pandemic were dismantled after cases had declined post-November 2020. Currently, in the absence of pandals and sitting arrangements, patients seeking consultation have to stand for hours outside the main OPD block. To help maintain social distance, the entry of patients to the wards will also be restricted henceforth. While only one patient attendant can be allowed into the ward to be with his patient, most times two or more relatives walk into the ward leading to crowding and inconvenience to other patients.  “Covid or no covid this practice should not be discouraged. Sometimes patients’ relatives prove to be a nuisance,” a GMC doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/restricted-entry-at-gmc-appts-for-opd-reintroduced/articleshow/81958899.cms||---
---||Agra||Mercury remains above normal in West UP||Agra: Heatwaves continue to swelter western Uttar Pradesh districts and with the mercury rising several notches above normal, agriculture department officials fear the adverse weather condition may hit the production of pulses, vegetables, and fruits. The above normal temperature will reduce the germination of the pulses and the size of vegetables and fruits will also be affected, say agriculture officers. Agra district, meanwhile, recorded the maximum temperature at 40.1 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal, on Wednesday, while the minimum stayed around 21.4 degrees, two notches above the normal. According to weathermen, the temperature is likely to increase in the district later this week. “This year, the temperature has been staying above normal since February 15. The average temperature in March this year was higher than the past five years for the corresponding month. The high temperature accompanied by westerly winds is harmful to the pulses. The vegetables and fruits yield is also likely to reduce. Controlled irrigation is required to protect the crops from the adverse weather conditions,” said Agra district agriculture officer Rampravesh Verma. With the temperature staying several notches above the normal for several days, the growth of capsicum — cultivated in 4,200 hectares in the district this season — is affected severely and the yield is likely to drop by over 30%, according to farmers. High humidity and above-normal minimum and maximum temperatures were recorded across the UP on Tuesday. As compared to Agra, the temperature remained slightly lower in Aligarh, Bareilly and Meerut. The maximum temperature in Aligarh was recorded at 36.8 degrees Celsius, 37.7 degrees in Bareilly and 36.9 degrees in Meerut. In Lucknow, the maximum was recorded at 39.4 degrees Celsius and 40.4 degrees in Varanasi. According to the metrological department, the mercury in the Agra region is likely to soar up to 43 degrees Celsius and 23 degrees on the minimum scale in the next five days as the heatwave will intensify. The IMD has, meanwhile, predicted similar weather conditions for Bareilly with maximum and minimum temperatures hovering around 37 and 20 degrees Celsius, respectively, with mainly clear sky till April 13. Hot weather and high humidity have made it difficult for people to step out of their homes and with the increase in temperature, the market is seeing an upsurge in the sale of air conditioners, coolers and earthen pots. “This year, the summer has arrived early. With the temperature soaring above 40 degrees, customers of air conditioners and coolers have started visiting shops early,” said a Sadar Bazaar-based dealer. Chief medical officer of Agra district Dr RC Pandey said, “The number of patients suffering from fever, stomachache and headache has increased at government hospitals. Changing weather conditions require some basic precautions to stay fit. People must stick to a balanced diet and remain hydrated.

---||Chandigarh||Now, SAD says lockdown in Punjab to curb its rallies||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday said the Punjab government’s decision to ban all political gatherings till April 30 was a direct fallout of the success of the party’s Punjab Mangda Jawab rallies and that the government had resorted to this step to prevent public angst from boiling over. SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said the ban on public meetings had more to do with the discomfiture of the Congress and chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, than with the Covid pandemic. “In rally after rally, SAD exposed the chief minister as well as the false oath taken by the latter in the name of the Gutka Sahib and the Dashmesh Pitah. This has upset the plans of Prashant Kishor, who has given the suggestion to ban public rallies to contain the damage being caused to the Congress party,” said the SAD leader. Cheema said the Congress did not only want to ban rallies by the opposition but also its own employees who had come out on the roads against the government. “It is clear that the government wanted to control the outburst of public angst against its policies through such autocratic decisions,” he added. The party spokesperson also attacked the chief minister for imposing lockdowns without any scientific basis, which he said had already caused economic devastation in Punjab. He said the Congress government had allowed holding of municipal elections earlier. “Assembly elections are also taking place in five states in the country. The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) elections have also been announced. Similarly, the ‘Kumbh’ mela also took place recently which involved a congregation of lakhs of people,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/now-sad-says-lockdown-in-punjab-to-curb-its-rallies/articleshow/81958805.cms||---
---||Patna||Prime accused among 6 more held for Madhubani killings||PATNA: Police arrested six more persons, including prime accused Praveen Jha (27) and Bhola Singh (25), on Wednesday for the five killings over a fishing dispute in Madhubani district on Holi. Earlier, police had arrested 10 people, including nine named accused, in connections with the killings. The incident, which took place over a fishing dispute at a pond between Muhammadur and Gebipur villages under the Benipatti police station, created a massive uproar in the state with political party leaders arriving at Muhammadpur to express their grief with the affected families. Environment, forest and climate change department minister Neeraj Kumar Singh and the leader of the opposition, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, have termed the killings as a massacre. Tejashwi, who had gone to Muhammadpur on Tuesday and met the grieving family, held a press conference in Patna on Wednesday and alleged that the killings took place at the behest of a former BJP minister. He said police must investigate the call records of accused persons to ascertain whether they were in touch with the former minister. Madhubani SP Satya Prakash said besides Praveen and Bhola, other arrested accused are Mukesh Safi (26), Chandan Jha (27), Kamlesh Singh (28) and Prahlad Mahto (45). The SP said five were arrested from Raghauli village under the Bisfi police station area of Madhubani. “Raghauli is located just on the border with Darbhanga district. They had taken shelter inside an empty house after the March 29 incident. Prahlad, a non-FIR accused had sheltered them,” he said. Prakash said overall 14 named and two non-FIR accused have been arrested so far, adding, raids are on to nab the rest 19 of the 35 named accused in the case. Benipatti police station SHO-cum-DSP (probation) Rakesh Kumar Ranjan said Praveen and Mukesh are from Gebipur, Chandan from Tiaunt, Bhola from Pauwam and Kamlesh from Muhammadpur village. He said the 10 accused arrested earlier include Sonu Choudhary (25), Prashant Jha (30), Ghanshyam Jha (55), Sunaina Devi (50), Shobhakant Mehta (55), Nikhil Kumar (26), Rishikesh Kumar alias Raja (28), Rajeev Thakur alias Devendra Thakur (30) and Rajesh Kumar Jha (45). Ranjan said police have moved the court for procuring proclamation notice against all those who are evading arrest so that steps to attach their property could be taken. “Earlier, the court had issued proclamation notices against 10 named accused. Of those, police attached the properties of Bhola and brothers Praveen and Naveen, who is evading arrest,” he said. BSF assistant sub-inspector Rana Pratap Singh and his nephew Ranvijay Singh were shot dead at Muhammadpur on March 29. Ranvijay’s two brothers Birendra Singh and Amrendra Singh and their cousin Rudra Narayan Singh died one after another during treatment. Ranvijay’s cousin Manoj Singh is in critical condition and is under treatment at a private hospital in Patna. All of them were from Muhammadpur and were shot multiple times and attacked with sharp-edged weapons over the fishing dispute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/prime-accused-among-6-more-held-for-madhubani-killings/articleshow/81957725.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Nagpur||Next pandemic after Covid will be due to air pollution: Doctors||NAGPUR: The next major pandemic after Covid-19 will be due to air pollution, warn medical experts, highlighting that it kills around seven million people worldwide annually. Senior medical practitioners from Nagpur, Mumbai, Pune and other cities participated in an online convention organized by Mumbai’s Waatavaran Foundation on World Health Day on Wednesday. The idea was to discuss impact of air pollution on health and its link with Covid-19. Among several alarming submissions by the medical fraternity, doctors expressed fears that very soon prescriptions issued to patients would be recommending ‘access to clean air’. Stating that a majority of people believe the source of problem is outdoors and ignore indoor air pollution, Dr Sundeep Salvi, director of Pulmocare Research and Education, Pune, said, “It would be a mistake to ignore indoor air pollution. Burning of mosquito coil inside a house causes the same amount of hazardous pollutants as it does when we smoke about 100 cigarettes. An incense stick burnt in house is equivalent to the smoke coming from 500 cigarettes, causing dangerously high pollution levels indoors.” Like Covid-19, air pollution has been observed as a major cause of lung disease, also responsible for affecting the overall immune system. Explained Dr Sameer Arbat, interventional pulmonologist at KRIMS Hospital, Nagpur, “Today, the Covid-19 pandemic has gripped the entire world. Although the direct link between air pollution and Covid is not clear yet, it cannot be ignored that the next major pandemic after Covid will be due to air pollution. Therefore, it is important to control this threat.” Air pollution has not spared children too. Dr Aditi Shah, paediatrician at Mumbai’s Nanavati Hospital, said infants and children are the worst affected since their lungs are not fully developed. “If they are constantly exposed to polluted air, they may end up suffering from chronic lung diseases. Polluted air also interferes with the brain development of children and as a result, they can have memory problems.” Adding that there has been rise in incidences of such diseases in the last 10 years, Dr Shah said, “Cold, flu, and coughs are more common in children. However, in view of the rising air pollution, it is time to prescribe clean and pure air for all as a mandate.” Dr Amita Athavale, professor and head of chest medicine at KEM Hospital, Mumbai, said apart from children, women and the elderly are most exposed to the health hazards associated with indoor air pollution. “Indoor air pollution is becoming a major cause for concern and we are ignoring it. It needs to be studied and addressed parallelly with outdoor sources,” she added. Dr Salvi pointed out that one of the main causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in rural areas was use of stoves for cooking. “It would be wrong to assume that air pollution is caused by only vehicles and industries,” he said. During the discussion, it was also highlighted that Maharashtra, with highest number (19) of non-attainment cities, is the second largest state in the country after Uttar Pradesh to have seen one lakh deaths due to air pollution between 2017 and 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/next-pandemic-after-covid-will-be-due-to-air-pollution-doctors/articleshow/81957803.cms||Manka Behl
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Fear mutant at play, want reports from Centre, says Rajesh Tope||MUMBAI: With Covid-19 cases ballooning across Maharashtra, health minister Rajesh Tope has again raised the issue of a mutant SARS-CoV-2 strain in circulation in the state. Tope said the pattern of Covid cases seems to have changed in Maharashtra. “We have had cases where patients who are in home isolation and doing absolutely fine suddenly deteriorating,” said the minister, adding that he suspected a new strain or mutation in the virus. Tope told newspersons here he had again asked for detailed reports of the tests conducted by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on swab samples picked up from across the state. These would help ascertain if there is a new mutant strain of the virus in the state. Last month, the central health ministry had announced that it had found a “double mutant” strain in over 200 samples from Maharashtra, but added it is not the cause for the second wave. The double mutant variant, with mutations E484Q and L452R, is specific to India. Tope said if the NCDC reports are made available, the state public health officials could work on changing the treatment protocols in those areas from where the strains were collected. The second wave sweeping across Maharashtra has so far been characterised by asymptomatic and mild cases. “Most cases wouldn’t have been detected if they were not tested as part of the contact tracing programme,” said a public health department doctor. State health officials said the issue of sharing detailed sequencing reports had been raised in meetings earlier with the Union health secretary, but there has been no response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-fear-mutant-at-play-want-reports-from-centre-says-tope/articleshow/81958912.cms||Bhavika Jain

According to a release issued by Pakistan high commission on Thursday, these visas have been issued as a “special gesture” by the government of Pakistan in view of the importance of Baisakhi for Punjabis and Sikhs marking the start of their new year. “Pakistan high commission extends special felicitations to all those celebrating this auspicious occasion and wishes visiting pilgrims a fulfilling yatra,” read the release. Under the framework of the Pakistan-India Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines of 1974, a large number of Sikh yatrees from India visit Pakistan to observe religious festivals and occasions every year. The release reads that the issuance of pilgrimage visas was a part of the Pakistan government’s efforts to facilitate visits to religious shrines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/baisakhi-across-border-pakistan-issues-1100-visas-to-sikh-pilgrims/articleshow/81958894.cms||---

The 25-year-old software professional has been accused of sexually assaulting his 20-year-old cousin. Kothagudem II Town police said the survivor lodged a complaint on Tuesday evening stating that since her childhood, she was sexually abused by her brother and her cousin, who returned from London last year. She also alleged that her mother, aunt and her uncle were accomplices in the crime as they supported the alleged rapists. “I am a student. My own brother and my cousin sexually abused me on several occasions. They also tortured me. Since I do not have a father, they took it as an advantage and tortured me. Though my mother, aunt and my uncle are aware that my bother and cousin sexually abused and tortured me on several occasions, they in fact encouraged it,” the girl told media personnel in Kothagudem. At 9 am on Wednesday, the survivor’s cousin, an accused in the alleged sexual exploitation case, committed suicide at his house. He was a software engineer, who returned from the United Kingdom during lockdown and stayed back. He did not leave any suicide note, but police suspect that since his cousin lodged a complaint, due to humiliation, he might have committed suicide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rape-accused-techie-kills-self-in-kothagudem/articleshow/81957775.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Travel across Mumbai in water taxis, ferries from December||NEW DELHI: Water taxis and RoPax ferries will soon be a part of Mumbai’s public transportation system. The shipping and waterway ministry on Wednesday said that water taxis would be introduced on 12 routes and RoPax ferry services would be launched on four routes by December. The ministry said that these services will help reduce traffic congestion on roads. The 12 water taxi routes include eight links from the domestic cruise terminal to Nerul, Belapur, Airoli, Vashi, Rewas, Karanja, Dharamtar and Kanhoji Angre Island. The other four routes are Belapur to Thane and Gateway of India, and Vashi to Thane and Gateway of India. The ministery said that three new RoPax services will be from Ferry Wharf to Nerul, Mora and Rewas, and one from Karanja to Rewas. Currently, roll-on and roll-off passenger (RoPax) service from Bhaucha Dhakka (Ferry Wharf) to Mandwa (Alibaug) is operational and this has reduced the 110km road travel to about 18 km by using waterways. The ministry said using the RoPax services, people can cover this stretch in just one hour, instead of the earlier 3-4 hours. “After the huge benefits being reaped of this ferry service, similar services are planned to be made operational at various other routes in Mumbai,” the ministry said. Ministry officials said after the recent success of Hazira to Goga Ropax ferry service in Gujarat, there is an increased focus on this segment of accelerating inland waterway and coastal ferry services to transport passengers and vehicles. The announcements from the ministry came after shipping minister Mansukh Mandaviya chaired a review meeting on the urban water transportation projects for Mumbai with officials, including chief of Mumbai Port and officials of Maharashtra Maritime Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/from-dec-travel-across-mumbai-city-in-water-taxis-4-new-ropax-ferries/articleshow/81959019.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Four from Bangladesh held for committing robberies||NEW DELHI: Four criminals from Bangladesh allegedly involved in over 100 crimes across the country have been arrested by Delhi Police’s Crime Branch. The accused have been identified as Rafiq Lashkar, Mohammed Salim, Ajizul Rehman and Razzak. According to DCP (crime) Bhisham Singh, the accused were arrested by a special task force team, which had been trailing this syndicate for around six months while investigating cases of heist in Delhi and other NCR areas.  The gang was into committing house robberies and burglaries and moved from one city to another at quick intervals. On April 5, ACP Pankaj Singh’s team received a tip-off about the gang’s movements in south Delhi and laid a trap around Siri Fort. The accused were spotted by the informer near a park after which the team moved in to arrest them. Seeing the police, one of the criminals whipped out a pistol and tried to escape by threatening to open fire. The cops, however, overpowered and unarmed the accused. A pistol, two push-button knives, cartridges and house breaking instruments were recovered from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/four-from-bangladesh-held-for-committing-robberies/articleshow/81959016.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Nearly 60,000 test positive in Maharashtra and over 10,000 in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The galloping Covid-19 second wave in Maharashtra stopped short of crossing the 60,000 mark for new cases on Wednesday, ending the day at 59,907 positive detections. It was the highest number of cases added so far in a single day. The state has over five lakh patients with active Covid-19 infection, accounting for the 56.17% of the total active caseload of the country. Mumbai added 10,442 cases and the number of active cases climbed to 83,185. Fatalities reported by the state crossed the 300 mark to reach 322, thehighest in nearly six months. With this, the total caseload of the state stood at 31.7 lakh and the fatalities rose to 56,652. The number of deaths in the city dropped to 24 from 32 a day before. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region’s total caseload crossed 10 lakh cases, with the addition of over 19,000 cases on Wednesday. Ahead of the visit of the 30 central teams, which is likely to begin on Thursday, the Centre sent forth a mathematical projection that showed that Maharashtra could exceed 11 lakh active cases by April 30 if people did not observe the recently imposed restrictions. Grim statistics were rolled out: 80% of isolation beds, 61% of the ICU beds and 64% of the ventilators are currently occupied in the state. The oxygen supply could last for less than a week. Additional municipal municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the situation was in control in Mumbai. “We are increasing the number of beds, and have noted that most patients require a hospital bed for about five days. Only those coming late with complications stay longer,” Kakani said. The central team is scheduled to arrive in Mumbai on Thursday. “The team is likely to visit some hospitals and sealed buildings, as slums have few cases.,” Kakani said. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state had directed all local self-government bodies to increase their bed capacity. Nearly 2,000 more beds are being added in Mumbai in the next few days. He also said that with the increase in cases, the requirement for oxygen will be higher and the state had sought help from the Centre to ask neighbouring states to assist the state with oxygen supply. The Mumbai region reported 19,952 cases and 71 deaths on Wednesday, taking the case tally to 10 lakh and the death toll to 20,808. The Kalyan-Dombivli belt on Wednesday recorded 1,728 Covid-19 cases and three deaths, taking the case tally to 88,534 and death toll to 1,278. In Navi Mumbai, there were 1,416 positive cases and four deaths, taking the total Covid count to 73,866 and toll to 1,202. Panvel reported 544 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, the highest in a single day in the city so far, taking the total caseload to 38,970.

---||Kolkata||Celebrities lock horns with veteran politicians in fight for Behala E & W||Kolkata: Stars have descended on the political battlefield of Behala like never before. And they have not only added glamour to the fight in this congested, bustling part of the city, but have also changed equations in the keenly fought elections. For the first time in Behala, Tollywood celebrities have been pitched against political heavyweights. While actor Srabanti Chatterjee is contesting for BJP against Trinamool minister Partha Chatterjee in Behala West, her colleague from the film fraternity, Paayel Sarkar of the BJP, is taking on Trinamool’s Ratna Chatterjee, estranged wife of former mayor Sovan Chatterjee. Both the constituencies were once a Left stronghold. While Behala West voters elected Partha in 2001, Sovan Chatterjee had won from Behala East from 2011. The two assembly segments, comprising 6 lakh-odd voters, have witnessed significant development over the past couple of years, including refurbishment of Vidyasagar State General Hospital and foundation of Kanyashree Government College as well as the second campus of BEd University. However, it was the reopening of the Majerhat Bridge in November 2020 that brought residents the much-needed infrastructure the collapse of which had crippled their commute. “As the bridge collapsed in 2018, a huge section of Behala had been cut off from the rest of the city. If we wanted to travel to Esplanade, the detour was taking us an hour or more. But, after reconstructing the bridge and expanding it to four lanes, it is now a breeze to reach the central business hub. My commuting time has significantly reduced. Anger among voters may have found a reflection in the 2019 general elections,” said Mithun Das, a local, who runs a grocery store in Behala. Building on the developments of Partha, if elected, Srabanti aims to “improve” the facilities in Behala West. “Waterlogging is a major issue in Behala every monsoon. Stagnant water spreads diseases. There have been several occasions when the residents of the locality had to protest on the streets to draw attention to the problem. I shall work to bring better civic amenities,” the BJP candidate said. Though combining the 1- KMC wards of Behala West and 11 KMC wards in Behala East, the Trinamool had a lead of around 16,000 votes in Kolkata South constituency in the 2019 Parliament elections, the current party now needs to make up for the lost ground in the six wards, where they trailed. Tarak Singh, the councillor of Ward 118, said the focus of the electorates this time would be different from that in 2019. “In the general elections, the voters found Narendra Modi to be a credible face, more than Rahul Gandhi. Thus, many had voted for the BJP. After finding out that my party trailed by 424 votes in my ward, I meticulously studied every segment of voters. Our concern is mainly a section of the high-rise residential complexes and another group of Bengali-speaking voters, who have been residing on S N Roy Road for generations,” Singh pointed out. After booth-wise analyzing the results, Singh has addressed the grievances. “During the pandemic, I have steadfastly stood by the people of my ward. Ensuring the distribution of ration, all the infants up to 6 months of age were allotted a kilo of baby food every month. After cyclone Amphan, electricity was restored at the earliest. MLA Partha Chatterjee visited the residential complexes and spoke to voters,” Singh said. Several councillors in the wards, from which Trinamool had slumped, pointed out that while the Lok Sabha elections were contested on different issues, in the upcoming assembly election the aim was to ensure Mamata Banerjee won a third term. As Partha interacted with the Sikh community members of his constituency at a Behala Gurdwara, he said Trinamool promoted unity among all communities. “We have reached out to all sections of voters and explained that in Bengal, people from every religion lives in harmony,” he said. In Behala East, the expansion of B L Saha Road and constructing a connector with Anwar Shah Road have reduced traffic on the otherwise-chocked lanes of Muchipara, Motilal Gupta Road. After taking up the mantle, Trinamool’s Ratna, while campaigning, is reaching out to every voter with ease. “She is very cordial,” said Bapi Das, a tea-stall owner. As Ratna walked down the lanes of Behala, several women came out of their homes to catch a glimpse of their candidate. “I am highlighting the safety of women during Mamata Banerjee’s tenure. We will not allow the state to be lawless as the other BJP-run states,” Ratna said. Aware of the star tag, Paayel said, “My biggest challenge is to make voters feel comfortable. Now, they have gradually started to accept that I will be beside them even after the election is over. I have promised that my voters will regularly receive all the services they are entitled to if I win the seat.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/celebrities-lock-horns-with-veteran-politicians-in-fight-for-behala-e-w/articleshow/81957813.cms||Somdatta Basu

Patel’s comments came after Congress leaders, Arjun Modhwadia and Shaktisinh Gohil, criticised the state government alleging mismanagement of the increasing spread of Covid-19 in Ahmedabad with unavailability of beds in government hospitals and inadequate stock of remdesivir injections. “Congress is misleading people. The state government has been making consistent efforts in curbing the spread of Covid-19. In these trying times, we have personally visited hospitals and met people. Even the high court is satisfied with the way our government has been operating,” said Patel. Over Modhwadia’s allegations of underreporting case numbers, he further said, “Cases are sure going up. However, government does not intend to hide any numbers. On a daily basis, some 40,000 RT-PCR tests and 60,000 antigen tests are being conducted. All those who test positive are being treated well and their contact-tracing is done as well.” “The recovery rate ,which was at 98% is now 94% in Gujarat because the cases are higher since the past fortnight and according to Union government guidelines, 14 days of isolation of positive patients is to be taken into account. In the coming fortnight, the recovery rate will further improve. The mortality rate is also 0.4%,” said Patel. “As on date, 55,549 beds are available and in days to come more beds will be made available across the state in both government as well as private hospitals. We’re also making efforts to make remdesivir injections available on no-profit-no-loss basis at all districts. In fact, we’ve ordered 3 lakh vials of the injection,” Patel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/oppns-allegations-baseless-figment-of-imagination-dycm/articleshow/81957903.cms||---

Citing survival issues, the traders, in a memorandum submitted to the government, has demanded that either they be given a relief package or the permission to commit mass suicide.“Despite the pandemic situation, the government and local authorities are collecting different taxes from us. At the same time, they are also enforcing more stringent measures on us,” traders’ body president Jagannath Kale said.Demanding a relief package for the traders, Kale said the community will not be able to shoulder the different financial responsibilities and liabilities due to the stringent curbs. “The government should either declare a financial package for us or allow us to end our lives,” secretary of the traders’ body Laxminarayan Rathi said.Stating that it had no problem with the earlier restrictions — night curfew and weekend lockdown — to contain the spread of Covid-19, the traders’ body demanded a rollback of the fresh curbs announced.When contacted, senior officials in the Aurangabad district administration said the fresh curbs were part of the state-level policy decision. “We had announced a lockdown at our level, but had withdrawn it immediately to make way for the uniform guidelines as a part of the ‘Break the Chain’ mission. The traders should have patience and cooperate with us in battling the second wave of Covid-19,” they said. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan could not be reached for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-trading-community-give-relief-or-allow-us-to-commit-mass-suicide/articleshow/81955306.cms||---

---||Goa||Doctors: Even after vaccine, senior citizens must not drop their guard||PANAJI: Doctors have cautioned senior citizens, including those who have taken one or both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, not to throw caution to the wind, especially during the ongoing second wave of the pandemic. From March 1 onwards, senior citizens and persons aged between 45 and 59 years with specific comorbidities were allowed to take the vaccination against the virus. The inoculation drive was expanded further from April 1, making anyone above 45 years of age eligible. Listing the benefits of the vaccination programme, state immunisation office Dr Rajendra Borkar said hospitalisations and mortalities owing to Covid-19 will be substantially lesser among those who have received the vaccine. He, however, warned that nobody shouldn’t let their guard down even after taking the vaccine. “There is still a possibility that vaccine beneficiaries could get Covid-19 and transmit it to others who are not vaccinated. All those vaccinated must continue to follow all SOPs to protect themselves as well as those around them,” he said. Nodal officer for vaccination at Hospicio, Dr Ira Almeida, added that seniors must continue to take precautions as no vaccine is 100 per cent effective. “The vaccination will prevent them from getting severely sick or dying from Covid, but we must remember that the immune systems of seniors are also ageing so we are unsure of how good their response to the vaccine is,” she said. The GMC’s nodal officer for vaccination, Dr Jagdish Kakodkar, advised seniors — especially those with comorbidities — against going outdoors unnecessarily even if they are vaccinated. “First dose vaccine recipients cannot assume protection. The first dose primarily primes our immune system, like the primer on a wall before it is painted. The second dose is like the coat of paint on a wall having primer on it. It’s only two weeks after the second dose that vaccination begins to offer protection from Covid severity,” he said. “This too may not protect from mild Covid infection or transmission. Vaccination may not protect from other newly emerging strains like the South African strain. Therefore even after vaccinated seniors and other vaccine beneficiaries cannot let their guard down,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/docs-even-after-vaccine-senior-citizens-must-not-drop-their-guard/articleshow/81959062.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Delhi||NE riots: HC seeks statements in sealed cover||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed the trial court concerned to place before it unredacted statements of protected witnesses in a sealed cover in a case related to Delhi riots in which Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha is facing prosecution. A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani said the statements be placed before April 14, the next date of hearing, after Delhi Police submitted that it did not possess the statements where names and personal details of protected witnesses had been redacted. The high court, which had on March 18 reserved its order on Tanha’s plea seeking bail, had asked police to file written submissions, unredacted copies of witnesses’ statements and other relevant documents. When the court asked how it was possible that the prosecution did not have copies of statements of its witnesses, special public prosecutor Rajat Nair, representing police, said these were protected witnesses and the unredacted copies were with the trial court only. He said, when the investigating officer had applied for protection of witnesses, the statements were signed and sealed by the trial court judge and redacted copies were given to the IO. Tanha was arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in May last year for allegedly being part of a “premeditated conspiracy” in the riots. In the high court, his bail plea was opposed by police on the grounds that the riots were premeditated, and a conspiracy was hatched, of which Tanha was a part. The counsel for police had said the accused should not be granted bail as there were statements of protected witnesses, which clearly showed the alleged role of Tanha in the conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-riots-hc-seeks-statements-in-sealed-cover/articleshow/81957815.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The man was suffering from chronic tuberculosis and vomited blood, and passed away. District immunization officer Dr RN Singh said that the "family didn’t have any complaint against the vaccine".

---||Meerut||UP cops fire at car carrying BJP man, relatives||MEERUT: A group of policemen in plain clothes surrounded a car in UP's Shamli with a BJP functionary and four of his relatives inside, allegedly opening fire that left one of the men with a bullet wound. The incident, caught on a CCTV camera, shows a car pulling up in the middle of a road with its left indicator blinking and a bunch of men, who turned out to be cops, swiftly surrounding it. The car then speeds away, almost hitting two cops of the special operation group. Senior police officers, caught off guard by the shoot-out involving their men, have ordered an inquiry. Superintendent of police (SP) Shamli, Sukriti Madhav, said, “A probe has been ordered. We are trying to verify if the firing was intentional or unintentional. Looking at the video, we can see the car stopping in the middle of the road. Its glasses are tinted, making it difficult to see who is sitting inside. Then the vehicle speeds off. That must have prompted the cops to open fire. But all these things are a matter of investigation.” Satyender Tomar, BJP district president, said, "The video exhibits very clearly that it is 100% the fault of the police. We have registered our protest with the police brass. They have asked for two days to bring out the truth and take action against the culprits." The BJP worker, Ashwin Panwar, 41, said that had he not fled, the policemen would have shot him dead on Tuesday night. He alleged that they were “hired” by his political rivals to get him killed. Ashwin’s father was killed in 2005 when he was the sitting chairman of a nagar panchayat in Shamli. Panwar claimed that the policemen followed him home, in Ellum village. “Then they picked me up and took me to a police station where I was treated badly and told I'd be killed like (Kanpur-based) gangster Vikas Dubey. I was let off in the morning when other BJP leaders and villagers reached there," he said. He further alleged that his political rival and former SP MLA Ratan Pal was behind the attack. Pal’s daughter, Deepa Pawar, is the incumbent chairperson of Ellum nagar panchayat of Shamli. In 2005, when Panwar's father Rajbir Panwar was shot dead, four persons of Pal’s family were named in an FIR. After his father’s death, Panwar fought the nagar panchayat election against Pal’s family members but lost, twice. “This family has always been against me. In September last year, I had written a letter to police saying that my life is in danger,” Panwar said. The charges were rebutted by Pal’s family. Chairperson Deepa told TOI, “These are baseless accusations. Ashwin is a man of criminal antecedents. A murder case is also pending against him for which non-bailable warrants have been issued several times. He had named four members of my family in the murder of his father, who also had criminal record. But nothing could be proven as they were not involved in the murder. A habitual troublemaker, he used to brandish weapons. After I wrote to senior authorities, his weapons were confiscated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-cops-open-fire-at-car-with-bjp-neta-four-kin-inside/articleshow/81956779.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Agra||Mulayam’s niece Sandhya to fight zila panchayat polls on BJP ticket from Mainpuri||AGRA: Sandhya Yadav, niece of former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and sister of former Badaun MP Dharmendra Yadav, is all set to fight the zila panchayat election on a BJP ticket from Mainpuri, a stronghold of Samajwadi Party. Sandhya is the incumbent chairperson of Mainpuri district panchayat, and has filed the nomination papers from ward 18 (Ghiror III) on Wednesday. She had contested the previous election on a SP ticket. The polling is scheduled on April 19. In 2017, a no-confidence motion was moved against Sandhya just after a week when her husband, Anujesh Yadav -- who was member of the Firozabad zila panchayat and was close to Shivpal Yadav -- was expelled from the party for signing a motion against the local zila panchayat president, Vijay Pratap, a close associate of Ram Gopal Yadav. Later, the motion was withdrawn after 11 members submitted an affidavit disassociating themselves from the decision. Two years ago, in 2019, Anujesh joined BJP. Anujesh told TOI, “If SP members could move a no-confidence motion against my wife (Sandhya), why can’t she fight the elections on a BJP ticket.” Anujesh claimed that his wife would win this election comfortably, adding that their family has a stronghold in Mainpuri. “My mother, Urmila Yadav, had been MLA twice from Ghiror -- in 1993 and 1996,” said Anujesh. Former Samajwadi MP from Mainpuri, Tej Paratap Yadav, who is a nephew of Sandhya Yadav, said the party will treat her as an opponent. “We have our own candidate and we will work for his victory,” Yadav said. BJP district president Pradeep Chauhan said, “Mulayam Singh Yadav himself had praised PM Narendra Modi in Parliament, and if the former’s niece is contesting as our party candidate, it means that she also supports the development agenda of the BJP. There is nothing wrong in it.” Everyone has a right to choose one's path, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mulayams-niece-sandhya-to-fight-zila-panchayat-polls-on-bjp-ticket-from-mainpuri/articleshow/81956769.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Kolkata||Babul Supriyo BJP’s bet to topple Aroop’s hold on tinsel town turf in Tollygunge||Kolkata: For junior Union minister Babul Supriyo, it is a two-layered battle in Tollygunge against state PWD minister and three-time Trinamool MLA Aroop Biswas. Besides a contest for Nabanna, Babul is also aiming at breaking the Aroop Biswas-Swarup Biswas monopoly over Tollywood. Tollygunge’s identity as a Left bastion till the early 90s has undergone a sea change, both socio-economically and politically. Old colonies on the two sides of the Tolly’s Nullah are only a reminder of the bygone days, when refugee leaders, such as CPM’s Prasanta Sur, used to dominate Tollygunge politics. The gulmohars of Moore Avenue have given way to high-rises, which now dot the flanks of entire NSC Bose Road. Refugee colonies at Netajinagar and Bansdroni—where residents of East Pakistan settled down after Partition—are also disappearing. The MSME clusters on Khanpur Road have shifted across Tolly’s Nullah and residential buildings have come up there. It was in the 2006 assembly elections when Biswas took on the baton from Trinamool’s Pankaj Banerjee who had been winning the Tollygunge seat since 1996. But for Biswas, this long stint has been a story of diminishing returns. Though his winning margin has been falling, the adept organizer made up by polling huge votes from wards 112, 113, 114 across the Tolly’s Nullah. The minister widened the bridges across the nullah, giving a boost to development in these areas and that gave him a premium in ’16 polls. The challenge for Biswas now is to match the soaring aspirations — better water supply and solving waterlogging in the newer settlements across the canal. While Biswas has been harping on what the government has done the past 10 years, Babul has been pointing out what has not been done. “Almost everyone in Tollygunge knows what the Biswas brothers (Aroop and Swarup) have been doing all these years. We want to end this misrule everywhere in Bengal,” he said. On Sunday, Babul visited a tea stall at Bikramgarh market, close to the Jadavpur telephone exchange, aware that the owner was a Trinamool supporter. The BJP candidate had his breakfast there during a roadshow and also sang a popular Kishore Kumar number for those who had gathered around. BJP organisers have also been making the rounds of the refugee colonies at Netajinagar, Bikramgarh, Lakshminarayn Colony, Aurobindanagar. A lot of temples, particularly Hanuman temples, have also also been coming up in the area. To counter Babul, Biswas has been playing the party’s “outsider” card, banking on people’s “faith in Tollygunge’s legacy”. Biswas also has a long list of state government beneficiaries there. “I don’t take Babul’s comment seriously. He is an outsider and knows nothing about my constituency,” he said. Actor-turned-CPM candidate Debdut Ghosh is walking the extra mile to protect the Left votes and score an extra. “Many people I met are disgusted with the two governments. They have failed to address the livelihood problems. They were nowhere when people were reeling from the Corona lockdown,” said Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/babul-supriyo-bjps-bet-to-topple-aroops-hold-on-tinsel-town-turf-in-tollygunge/articleshow/81957850.cms||Saikat Ray

Dr Priyamvada Tomar, a resident of UP’s Shamli district, said, “For the last 131 days farmers are sitting on ‘dharna’ in which more than 300 of them have lost their lives. I am very hurt by the government’s insensitivity towards the farmer.” She also cited "rampant corruption" in the state as a reason for the step.

---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Crucial plan to revive ‘invisible’ Finn’s Weaver hits Covid wall||MEERUT: The bright yellow plumage, massive bill and dark cheek patch are striking. The Finn’s Weaver is anything but inconspicuous. Yet, it is nearly “invisible” now. And plans to revive the fast-dwindling population of the weaver bird species have hit a wall again this year. The Finn’s Weaver, locally called ‘pahari baya’ and ‘bada baya’, is endemic to the marshes of the Terai region of northern India and Nepal. It is considered critically endangered in Nepal and has been protected in India under Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act since 1991. The IUCN has marked it as a vulnerable species since 1994. Just about 1,000 of the birds are still around, of which some 500 are in India. To stem the rapid decline in numbers, the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) in collaboration with UP’s forest department had taken up a conservation project in Meerut’s Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. The Finn’s Weaver Breeding Project was going to take off in April 2020. Funding of Rs 25 lakh had been sanctioned, a source said, for the three-year project in which 12-16 birds would be released into a large aviary. But Covid-19 hit and the plan had to be delayed for a year, TOI had reported. But a year on, just when it’s time for the project to kick off, it has been stalled again. “We lost a year to Covid-19. Because of the resurgence of the virus, there are a lot of restrictions in UP and Uttarakhand now. There is also the risk involved for our staff,” said BNHS director Bivash Pandav. The window is crucial. “It is in April, May and June that these birds breed. If this period passes by, we will have lost another year.” When breeding season comes, a flock of males chooses a tree and tears away leaves off of twigs to build a nest easily visible to a potential mate, which “tests” the nest while it is half-way through and then decides on a partner. All of this happens within the summer months. It’s a race against time. The spaces the Finn's Weaver can live and breed in, meanwhile, are shrinking. “The population has been declining because of vanishing grasslands which are its primary habitat,” said Dr Rajat Bhargava, senior scientist at BNHS. The IUCN adds that the grasslands are disappearing because of conversion to agriculture and overgrazing. Bhargava had led a team which spotted the bird at the new site of Sherkot last year, TOI had reported, besides the known sites at Harewali and Bhagwanpur Raini in Uttar Pradesh, and, in Uttarakhand, at Rudrapur and near Haripura and Baur dams. “It is a difficult task,” said Meerut divisional forest officer Rajesh Kumar. “But we really need to get things started. Breeding season has begun."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/crucial-plan-to-revive-invisible-finns-weaver-hits-covid-wall/articleshow/81956770.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Delhi||Cabinet nod to reimplement law on fighting NCR’s bad air||New Delhi: The Union cabinet on Wednesday approved the re-promulgation of ordinance on air quality management in National Capital Region (NCR) and adjoining areas spread over four states — Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh — with important changes that seek to assuage farm unions opposed to the new agriculture laws. The re-promulgated legislation has been tweaked to take care of the concerns of farmers who had objected to its substantially high penalty provision for stubble burning in neighbouring states. The multi-member statutory commission will now also have representation from farmers, industry and construction sectors. Penalty provisions for erring industry or other sectors remain intact with jail term up to five years or with fine up to Rs 1 crore or with both for any non-compliance or contravention of any provision or rules and order or direction of the panel. The ordinance, promulgated initially in October 2020, lapsed last month as the Centre could not bring the required bill to replace it due to curtailment of the budget session. “The Cabinet approves its re-promulgation and decided to replace it with an Act after introducing a required Bill in Monsoon session of the Parliament,” environment secretary, R P Gupta, told TOI. Asked about the penalty provision, he said, “That aspect on stubble burning issue will be taken care of through rules. Representative of farmers (agriculture sector) will now also find place in the expanded commission on air quality management (CAQM). Other aspects of different provisions under the ordinance will more or less be the same.” Once the commission stopped working after lapse of the ordinance last month, the environment ministry had entrusted the task of air quality management with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Once the ordinance is re-promulgated in couple of days, the statutory commission will again be reconstituted. It is expected that most of the members in the commission will be retained. The CAQM will have power to strictly enforce mitigation measures under enhanced penalty provisions, better coordination, and through research, identification and resolution of problems surrounding air quality index of the region referred as an ‘airshed’. The commission had replaced the Supreme Court-backed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority — EPCA — which had been taking care of the issues of air pollution in the NCR for last 22 years. The EPCA had successfully implemented certain measures such as relocation of polluting industries, switching over of public transport buses from diesel to CNG and restriction of entry of polluting trucks in the Capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cabinet-nod-to-reimplement-law-on-fighting-ncrs-bad-air/articleshow/81958026.cms||Vishwa Mohan

CII has recommended that private medical facilities should be roped in to vaccinate people and has also offered logistical support to the state government with the vaccination drives. In a letter to the state government, CII stated that in order to avoid a fresh lockdown, the state government needs to speed up the inoculation exercise through effective rollout of the vaccines. “A faster rollout will provide confidence to workers at the workplace,” said CII, as it also urged the government to permit business enterprises to vaccinate their employees and their immediate family. CII has said that all workers, employees and those directly or indirectly working in the tourism sector and logistics sector should also be given vaccines on priority. The private sector can supplement and contribute to the government’s vaccination programme with appropriate checks and balances, CII stated. A high-level taskforce on vaccines has already been constituted by CII to ensure that the industry supports the Centre’s vaccine distribution and inoculation efforts. While pointing out that Goa may face the second wave of the Covid infection, CII stated that in order to prevent another lockdown, the state needs to rope in private hospitals, industry players and other stakeholders. In its recommendation letter, CII suggested that “private providers, with appropriate checks and balances, should be allowed to vaccinate and support the government to both utilise the available vaccines as well as amplify the number of vaccinations with all necessary norms and compliances”.

All the rescued people have been sent home to Bihar’s Nawada on Tuesday. In March, one of the labourers had even lodged an FIR for alleged sexual assault of a minor girl by the brick kiln owner’s relative. Though the suspect was arrested and remanded in judicial custody, the labourers were not ready to stay back as they said they were being abused and, hence, were feeling unsafe, said officials.Confirming the sexual assault incident, circle officer Iglas Mohsin Khan told TOI that the incident was reported on the day of Holi and police had arrested the 20-year-old man accused for committing the crime. Sub-divisional magistrate (Iglas) Kuldev Singh told TOI that a 3-member committee was formed by the district magistrate to inquire about the issue, and during inquiry, it was found that the labourers wanted to go back to their homes in Bihar and, hence, a bus was arranged for them. According to officials, each labourer was being paid Rs 400 per thousand bricks he/she made, and usually made about 2000 bricks in a day. The committee members told TOI that the labourers had taken an advance of Rs 25,000 each before coming to work here. Talking to TOI, labour inspector Manoj Kumar, who was also part of the 3-member committee, said that the owner of Sri Radhe Eit Udyog, Munni Devi, and her son Jitendra Singh have been booked under sections 16, 17 of the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976 and can be punished up to 3 years of imprisonment, along with Rs 2000 fine, by the sub-divisional magistrate. The owner will also be booked for violation of non-maintenance of records of bonded labourers. In addition, there was also violation of inter-state migrant workmen Act, 1979, under which a licence is required for employing more than five workers from other states. Kumar added that the labour department of Bihar will be communicated for the rehabilitation of the rescued people after completing the summary trial in the SDM court, so that relief of Rs 1 lakh per man and Rs 2 lakh for each woman rescued can be given.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/127-bonded-labourers-rescued-from-aligarh-brick-kiln/articleshow/81956786.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Hyderabad||IRDAI issues guidelines for trade credit insurance products||Hyderabad: Insurance regulator, Insurance Regulatory & Development Authority of India (IRDAI), on Wednesday issued draft guidelines for general insurance companies to come up with trade credit insurance products with customised covers for SMEs and MSMEs. The latest guidelines will also enable general insurers to offer trade credit insurance covers to licensed banks and other financial institutions. These covers will help companies and financial institutions manage their risks overseas, open up access to new markets and manage non-payment risks associated with trade financing portfolio. Trade credit insurance protects businesses against the risk of non-payment for goods and services by buyers. As per IRDAI’s Trade Credit Insurance Guidelines 2021, the trade credit insurance can cover commercial as well as political risks, among others. The political risk cover will be available only to buyers outside India and countries agreed upon at the proposal stage. The commercial risks covered would include risk of insolvency or protracted default of a buyer or bank responsible for payment in case of letter of credit transactions, among others. A trade credit policy can grant an indemnity of maximum 60% of trade receivables from each buyer for all banks, financial institutions or factoring companies. As per the guidelines, insurers can offer an indemnity of 90% of the trade receivables from each buyer for all policyholders other than banks, financial institutions and factoring companies. But for MSMEs, the policy can cover 95% in case of political risks. Sanjay Datta, chief-underwriting, claims and reinsurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, said, “The new draft guidelines on trade credit insurance issued by IRDA today envisage allowing banks, factoring companies and other financial institutions to buy credit insurance protection for their receivable financing programs. This will open up opportunities to offer credit insurance-backed financing solutions to MSMEs and large corporates. Other changes like enhanced indemnity of 90%, single buyer coverage for MSMEs and pre-shipment risk coverage will make the credit insurance product more comprehensive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/irdai-issues-guidelines-for-trade-credit-insurance-products/articleshow/81957867.cms||Swati Rathor

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Centre should match supply to vaccination speed, says Tope||MUMBAI: Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has sought 40 lakh vaccine doses per week to meet the desired target of vaccinating nearly 6 lakh people every day. The state was currently vaccinating 4.5 lakh people every day and so a stock of 12-13lakh doses will last only three days. “We have accepted the challenge that Union minister Prakash Javdekar had given to us: to scale up testing and vaccinating 6 lakh people a day. But the Centre should now match their supply pace to our vaccination speed,” said Tope. Some other states like Odisha, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh too have said vaccine stocks are running low. Ironically, the vaccination slowdown has come on a day Mumbai clocked its highest single day coverage of 61,896 vaccinations. On Wednesday evening, Panvel corporation issued a notice saying the vaccination drive has been stopped for now. Gondia district in Vidarbha region couldn’t carry out any inoculation as they had just 20 doses in the kitty. The district vaccinates at least 5,000 daily. Officials from Amravati division that includes Yavatmal, Akola, Buldhana and Washim districts said they had to reduce the number of vaccination centres due to the shortage. Nagpur rural too was left with stocks only for a day. Tope confirmed many vaccination centres in the state had to shut due to lack of the vaccine. “There is an increased demand for Covaxin, but that too is inadequate,” said Tope. “Most of those infected now are in the age group of 25 to 40 years and the Centre should universalise vaccination, especially in Maharashtra,” he added. Principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said the state was provided 1.02crore doses, of which over 90 lakh have been used. The wastage at 3% in the state was half of the national average. “Every day we are vaccinating 4.6lakh, which can be stretched to 6lakh but since doses are not available, we are unable to ramp up,” he said, adding that Maharashtra has administered 85.64lakh doses, the highest in the country. With stocks running out, there is panic on the ground. Mumbai’s central vaccine depot in Parel’s F-south ward office was left with zero vials on Wednesday. Kakani said the norm is to have at least seven days’ stock for such a mammoth drive. Another civic official said centres that have stocked-out will not have a drive, while those with some stocks will take appointments accordingly. “We are trying to mobilise stocks for some of the big public vaccination centres in order to avoid chaos,” the official said. Among private hospitals, L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, has said they had stocks only for two days. “If supply of vaccine is not done by government on time, we may have to send people back on Friday,” said the hospital spokesperson. Dr Santosh Shetty, CEO of Kokilaben Hospital, said they had less than a day’s stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-centre-should-match-supply-to-vaccination-speed-says-tope/articleshow/81959204.cms||Bhavika Jain

Marri Nehemiah is one among the many independents in the fray in the Nagarjuna Sagar assembly bypoll in Telangana. Like in all the 13 previous elections that he has contested, Nehemaiah is positive that the outcome of the polling on April 17 will be in his favour. It is another matter that this eternal optimist has not won an  so far. “What rules me out from winning the seat?” Nehemaiah asks. In a sense, Nehemaiah is a ‘compulsive contestant’. The 66-year-old has been contesting Lok Sabha and assembly elections since 1984, fighting electoral battles for the last 37 years. He has contested for the Lok Sabha elections at least 10 times. This includes seven times from the Miryalaguda Lok Sabha constituency. Miryalaguda was a Lok Sabha constituency of Andhra Pradesh till 2008. After that, he contested from Nalgonda Lok Sabha seat for three times. That’s not all, he contested at least three times in the assembly polls from Huzurnagar, Tungaturthi and Nakrekal. This time, he is in the fray from Nagarjuna Sagar and is as excited about the contest as he ever was before. Sporting a handlebar moustache, Nehemaiah is nonchalant even while campaigning. “This time, my election symbol is ‘bangles’. That is something that I can campaign with and it can connect with women voters well,” the resident of Suryapet, said. Ask Nehemaiah how many votes he polled in his previous elections, he says that is of no consequence. But in the 2014 LS elections when Gutta Sukhender Reddy of the Congress won, Nehemaiah secured 56,259 votes. He stood fourth behind Congress, TDP and TRS candidates. In the 2018 assembly elections, he polled 380 votes from Suryapet constituency from where minister Jagadish Reddy won. In the 2019 LS polls from Nalgonda, the battle-hardened Nehemaiah got 1,046 votes (0.09 per cent of the total votes). The winner was N Uttam Kumar Reddy. “My family does not get involved in my political campaign . I also do not expect them to canvass for me,” Nehemiah says. Having discontinued his B Com degree course, he says he was earning by taking tuition classes. The ‘serial contestant’ does not worry about not having a sure group of supporters “I am very strong in my spirit,” he says as he begins to plough a lonely furrow in this election too. He is sure of springing a surprise this time round.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hope-never-fades-ts-serial-contestant-fights-14th-election/articleshow/81959198.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

However, he refused to increase the fine amount. Sawant said night curfew and a lockdown in the state are not the solutions, as economic activities will come to a standstill. “We don’t want to disturb the economy by going in for lockdown,” he said. “We have issued instructions to the police and collectors regarding issuing fines to a person more than once a day if found the face mask norm in public places,” he said. He added that the fines will not imposed on those in private places. “We have asked that the percentage of fines collected be increased, and every police station in the state has been told to issue a minimum of 500 challans,” he said. Sawant pointed out that of the 380 new Covid-19 cases reported on Tuesday, only 16 persons were either tourists or those who have come from outside the state. While stating that cases are increasing across the country, the chief minister said his “government has not committed any mistake” in tackling the spread of the virus. Tourists should come to Goa after getting vaccinated, he added. Reacting to MGP’s demand for a mini lockdown, Sawant said, “Right now, our economy has revived, and lockdown will not bring any solution.” He also clarified that there are no travel restrictions in the state. Sawant, however, said the “the public should not unnecessarily come out of their houses”. People should move out of their homes only if required. They should avoid crowded places and should not go more than once to the market,” he said. The chief minister said that the state government has issued an advisory to government employees, people working in industrial and tourism sectors, and has also asked those who have completed 45 years of age, to take the vaccine. “If all those who have completed 45 years take the vaccine, then we will cover 50 per cent of the population, and the remaining 50 per cent in the 18-45 age group will be completed fast. I appeal to the people to take the vaccine,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/flout-face-mask-norm-get-fined-multiple-times-in-a-day/articleshow/81959200.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Jaipur||Jaipur Municipal Corporation-Greater mayor, top official tussle over working panels again||JAIPUR: It seems there is no end to tussle between Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) Greater mayor Somya Gurjar and commissioner Yagya Mitra Singhdev. Recently, Singhdev had sent a list of 10 working committees to the state government and asked to allocate specific work to them. The working committees since their formation in JMC-Greater have been in controversies. At first state government dismissed the working committees before the Rajasthan High Court stayed the order and now commissioner has sent to the state government to allocate work to these committees. According to Singhdev, whatever he has done is according to the Rajasthan Municipality Act 2009. “According to the Act, seven committees are mentioned that will be formed but the work will be divided according to the state government’s directives. We are following steps given in law,” said commissioner. Building planning committee, sanitation committee, slum dweller development committee, finance committee, executive committee and two others are mentioned in the act, for rest – work is said to be allocated by the state government. Gurjar said that this is just another tactic to interfere in the working of the JMC-Greater by the state government. “State government had given the power to form these committees and divide the work to previous general body boards by an order which has not been withdrawn till now. Hence, we still have the power to form 21 committees and divide their work,” said Gurjar. Countering this argument commissioner said that order was issued for the previous board and once the board is dissolved the order no longer stands active. But, mayor said that in that order it was nowhere mentioned that every time when the board is constituted a special permission has to be taken from the government. “The order still stands valid and this is unfair on the part of the commissioner and state government to create hurdles in functioning of the committees every time,” said Gurjar. These kinds of tussle between mayor and commissioner are directly impacting the functioning of the corporation with sanitation work, road construction, street lights and other work being sidelined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mayor-top-official-tussle-over-working-panels-again/articleshow/81957869.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Tourism industry seeks bailout package||Aurangabad: Stating that the travel, tourism and hospitality industry has been worst hit due to Covid-related restrictions, the stakeholders have demanded a bailout package from the government to overcome the financial losses. Jaswant Singh, president of Aurangabad Tourism Development Foundation (ATDF), on Wednesday said neither the state government nor the Centre has paid heed to the woes of the industry. “The travel, tourism and hospitality industry has come to a screeching halt due to lockdown since March 2020 leading to massive loss of revenue and jobs. The cash-flow across online and offline modes among stakeholders has been frozen, leading to survival issues,” he said. The heritage sites in Aurangabad district, including Ajanta and Ellora caves, are already closed since March 11 — much before such restrictions were announced for other sectors. Earlier, these tourist places remained closed since outbreak of Covid-19 last year till first half of December. Umesh Jadhav, president of Aurangabad Tourist Guides Welfare Association, said the government should offer financial aid to tourist guides. “The tourist guides are backbone of the tourism industry. These key elements are being ditched by the government badly during the outbreak of Covid-19. The government should dole out special package to us, failing to which an irrevocable loss is imminent to the tourism industry if guides choose other professions on a permanent note,” he said. The ATDF, in its memorandum, has said that neighbouring countries have already given an official boost to their travel, tourism and hospitality industry during the current pandemic. “In our country and state, no steps have been taken to revive the industry. The neighbouring countries are already ahead of us in these measures and as and when inbound tourism starts we will go down further in the wish list of travellers due to official apathy,” the ATDF has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/tourism-industry-seeks-bailout-package/articleshow/81955325.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Pre-monsoon showers may hit Telangana from Friday: IMD||HYDERABAD: After steady rise in mercury levels, Telangana is likely to receive pre-monsoon showers over the next few days as India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad, has issued thunderstorm warning for several districts between April 9 and 11. According to IMD, Hyderabad, the maximum temperature had touched 40-43 degree Celsius in several districts in the last few days. However, pre-monsoon showers were likely to occur over many parts of Telangana, giving relief from the sweltering heat. “There has been a rise in moisture levels that will result in rain-bearing clouds. Whenever it will rain, a drop of three to five degree Celsius can be expected in the maximum temperature. Rest of the times, the maximum temperature will be around normal for this time of the season,” IMD, Hyderabad, in-charge director Naga Ratna said. IMD, Hyderabad, has forecast thunderstorm accompanied with lightning and gusty winds (30-40 kmph) for districts such as Adilabad, Komaram Bheem, Nirmal, Jagtial, Mancherial, Karimnagar, Peddapalli, Rajanna-Sircilla, Warangan (Urban and Rural), Khammam and Bhadadri Kothagudem. Subsequently, even Hyderabad is expected to witness rain or thunderstorm on April 12-13. The thunderstorm activity is being attributed to a cyclonic circulation persisting over Chhattisgarh and neighbouring states associated with a north-south trough running from north interior Karnataka to interior Tamil Nadu. As per Telangana State Development Planning Society, Sarvaipet in Jayashankar Bhupalpally recorded the highest rainfall of 37 mm followed by Kannaigudem in Mulugu 18.8 mm and Medaram in Mulugu 6.8 mm in the last 48 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pre-monsoon-showers-may-hit-state-from-friday-imd/articleshow/81957875.cms||---

Since it is do or die situation for the parties, apart from roping in all senior leaders from different parts of the state, local and middle-level cadre have been asked to cover almost all villages in the assembly constituency by visiting every household. In view of rising temperatures and increasing number of Covid-19 cases, parties are reducing road shows and public meetings and focusing on small gatherings and house-to-house campaign. The ruling TRS has already deployed ministers like G Jagadish Reddy, Talasani Srinivas Yadav, Mohd Mahmood Ali and half-a-dozen MLAs, who started campaigning for the past two weeks, while Congress and BJP too have roped in senior leaders for campaigning. Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy were among senior leaders apart from party candidate K Jana Reddy touring the constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parties-step-up-campaign-for-bypoll/articleshow/81959202.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Goa||Calangute belt moves from tourist hub to Covid hotspot||Panaji: The Calangute-Candolim belt, which has been inundated by domestic tourists amid the pandemic, has slowly been turning into a Covid-19 hotspot. The area’s caseload has doubled in barely a week, with the Candolim primary health centre (PHC) recording as many as 238 active cases on Wednesday, the third highest in North Goa after Porvorim and Panaji. Until 12 days ago, the PHC’s case tally remained below 100, but the past week has witnessed a marked spurt in infections. The centre — whose jurisdiction extends across the Candolim, Calangute, Arpora-Nagoa, Saligao, Sangolda, Pilerne, Reis Magos and Nerul village panchayats — reported 141 infections last Thursday and has been witnessing a steady rise since. It collects 100 or more swab samples per day, of which around 25% test positive for the virus. Health officer Dr Roshan Nazareth said that although the PHC has detected cases from all the coastal villages under its jurisdiction, the proportion of infections reported from Calangute and Candolim are considerably high. He pointed out that over 90% of the people who have been tested so far — a mix of local residents, staff employed by tourist establishments and a few travellers — come in to give their samples almost five to seven days after contracting the virus, thus infecting others during that timespan. “When we test the family of a Covid-positive patient, most turn out to be positive unlike last year, when one or two members at the most would have contracted the virus. That’s how our numbers are growing rapidly,” Nazareth said. Local residents said tourists flouting SOPs was also probably why more infections were being reported. “If you ask them (tourists) to wear a mask, they say they are fed up with the pandemic. They say they have come to Goa to enjoy and that we should let them be,” said John Lobo, secretary of the Shack Owners Welfare Society (SOWS), while insisting that the government at least enforce the existing SOPs strictly. A domestic tourist stays for an average of three to four days. “Calangute beach is always crowded with tourists rarely wearing face masks. We do not know for sure if it is tourists who are responsible for spreading infections, but we see them flouting Covid-19 protocol everywhere. The panchayat hasn’t done anything to contain the situation,” said Calangute Constituency Forum president, Premanand Diukar. Citing an instance of neglect, a shack owner at Candolim said that when the manager of a neighbouring shack tested positive on Tuesday, the operator placed the manager in isolation, but the other staff who were in contact with the manager continued to work on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-belt-moves-from-tourist-hub-to-covid-hotspot/articleshow/81959208.cms||Bindiya Chari

While the state government’s order mandates all non-essential shops to stay shut till April 30, the traders want it rolled back.Sanjay Shete, the president of the Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said, “We submitted a petition to the district authorities on Wednesday. We will wait till Thursday evening for a resolution. If the government continues to ban shops from opening, we will defy the order and open the shops from Friday onwards, irrespective of the weekend lockdown. If the administration orders coercive action against us, we will shut all shops, including those providing essential items such as medicines and milk.”Shete said the apex traders’ bodies are in talks with the state government. He said a meeting was held between the traders’ representatives, CM Uddhav Thackeray and chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Wednesday afternoon. “We have learnt that the CM is going to call a cabinet meeting on Thursday to find a way out of this deadlock. We have not proposed any alternatives (like the odd-even formula) this time. No trader is in a mood to shut shops on any day,” Shete said.

His statement comes in the wake of the demand by tourist taxi drivers’ unions to scrap GoaMiles. “They cannot ask us to throw GoaMiles in the sea. This is an impractical demand. They cannot hold a gun to our head and say, ‘Do this or we will block the roads’,” he said. “This is not the behaviour I expect of the taxi union leaders. They have to be more responsible because they are the real ambassadors of the tourism industry. They are answerable for their behaviour,” he said. TOI had earlier reported about clashes between tourist taxi operators and GoaMiles drivers, especially owing to operations at the Goa airport. He further said that “nobody can take law in their hands” and “dictate to the government what is to be done” and reminded how app-based taxis like Ola and Uber were not allowed in Goa only because the taxi operators were against it. Godinho said that within a week’s time, he will be calling all the taxi unions and stakeholders to take them into confidence prior to the installation of digital meters and take their views on how to streamline the taxis to be run at the airport. “The tourism counter which was being operated at the airport must be handed over by the tourism department to the airport authorities and they can hand it over to the transport department,” Godinho said. “The government will streamline the running of the taxis at the airport in a manner that is satisfactory and acceptable by all the stakeholders in the taxi trade. But demands like ‘scrap GoaMiles’ will neither help the taxi operators nor their cause,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goamiles-will-not-be-scrapped-godinho/articleshow/81959210.cms||Nida Sayed

The team is now investigating with the smugglers as to from where they brought these threatened species of turtles. The arrested traders have been identified as Kajod Prasad and Ramswroop. Forest Ranger, Janeshwar Singh said, “The forest department team contacted the smugglers to buy these turtles. The deal was closed at Rs 2 lakh for seven turtles. The smugglers brought the species in a carton and after they showed them, the team nabbed them.” Experts said, the Indian softshell turtle (Nilssonia Gangetica) or Ganges softshell turtle is a species of softshell turtle found in South Asia in rivers such as the Ganges, Indus and Mahanadi. This vulnerable turtle reaches a carapace length of up to 94cm (37 in). It feeds mostly on fish, amphibians, carrion and other animal matter, but also takes aquatic plants. These turtles are protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, the same protection status enjoyed by the tiger. The possession of animals listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 may attract imprisonment of three to seven years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-held-for-selling-endangered-species-of-7-turtles-in-bagru/articleshow/81957905.cms||---

---||Pune||Small & medium hospitals reel from remdesivir shortage in Pune||PUNE: Small and medium-sized private hospitals treating Covid patients in the city have run out of remdesivir stock and are now bending over backward to procure it due to the FDA’s “failure to sensitize people” about the drug’s correct procurement methods. According to the state government’s diktat, hospitals providing Covid-19 treatment and their attached medical stores will get the intravenous drug either directly from the pharma firm or through notified drug distributors. “Hetero healthcare, the major supplier of remdesivir in Pune, has asked hospitals to generate a code with the company. Unless a hospital has this code, the company or its supplier won’t give the vials. Besides, the small/medium-sized hospitals in Pune are not trying distributors of other pharma firms like Zydus, Cipla, and Mylan where they do not have to generate the mandatory code but only need to show that they have the permission to treat Covid patients,” said Pune FDA joint commissioner SB Patil. Medical expert Siddharth Dhende, who runs a small hospital at Nagpur Chawl in Yerawada, said, “Unlike last year, many small/medium-sized hospitals in Pune have started treating Covid patients now. Most do not have an in-house medical store. So, they are completely clueless about how to procure the vials.” Medical expert Dhananjay Mulay, who runs Sharad Hospital on Sinhagad Road, said, “Mine is a 10-bed hospital and six Covid patients are currently admitted with me. I could get only six vials on Wednesday, though I needed more.” Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, said, “FDA officials should sensitize them about procurement methods.” Activist Sanjay Dabhade said, “FDA officials should use mass media tools like newspapers, radio and television to sensitize people about the correct procurement methods.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/small-medium-hosps-reel-from-remdesivir-shortage/articleshow/81957909.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Nagpur||Garbage, leaf litter being burnt over 3kms on Wardha Road||NAGPUR: Large-scale open burning of garbage and leaf litter is not just causing significant toxicity in the city’s air but also damaging existing green cover. Such incidences are regularly coming to the fore. After Ajni Van, illegal burning has been spotted at over a 3-kilometre stretch on Wardha Road. In the last two days, environment activists spotted large-scale burning ahead of Panjra toll at Wardha Road. According to them, burning of dried leaf litter and other waste materials is spreading like forest fire, thus destroying age-old existing trees. “At these spots, fire has damaged teak and other trees,” said activist Kunal Mourya. On the same stretch, open burning is taking place at different locations. “The fire is spreading so fast that it is covering a 2-km patch. We tried to find out the culprits but could not,” added Mourya. TOI recently reported about open burning of garbage at Ajni Van by the contractors of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Despite repeated complaints, no action was taken by any authority. Open burning of garbage is a contempt of court. In December 2016, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) imposed a complete ban on burning of waste in open spaces, and announced a fine of Rs 25,000 on each incidence. Taking serious cognizance of air pollution, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court had also prohibited the activity. Once again, the illegal activity has gone on the rise. In the loco shed area at Ajni, toxic fumes from open burning of garbage posed a serious health threat to nearby residents. “The authorities have completely turned a blind eye to all our issues. No FIR has been filed against illegal tree felling at Ajni Van, no action is being taken against open garbage burning despite strict rules in place,” said environment activist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani. TOI could not contact NMC officials but sources said that the civic body has received various complaints in the last one month. Based on complaints posted on Twitter, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) directed NMC to take urgent action into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/garbage-leaf-litter-being-burnt-over-3kms-on-wardha-road/articleshow/81957918.cms||Manka Behl

---||Kolkata||Tiwary pads up for second innings on a turning track||Kolkata: If ‘khela hobe’ is the buzz word of this Assembly election in Bengal, then Manoj Tiwary fits into it perfectly. The former Bengal cricket captain has found himself in a new field as he took a plunge into politics as a Trinamool candidate. “Yes khela hobe, but in politics, it's not always played according to the rules and laws of the game,” Tiwary told TOI during one of his campaign trails in the Shibpur constituency on Wednesday. His indication is loud and clear towards the opposition camp. “While developmental issues are our idea of play, they (rivals) are playing the game at polling booths only,” Tiwary added. Although the 35-year-old will be defending this seat for Trinamool, Tiwary finds himself in a volatile field. While his main challenger this time is old Trinamool worker Rathin Chakraborty, shadows of Jatu Lahiri, the winning Trinamool candidate in 2016 Assembly polls, hovering over the constituency too. Both the old warhorses have joined the BJP camp this time. But perhaps going by the saying that a known enemy is better than an unknown one, Tiwary did not seem to be too bothered. “See they have not done anything in the area. And I am not saying this, but it’s the local people who have given me this impression,” he said. “The two have left for their own good. People are fuming against them. In spite of being the ex-mayor of Howrah municipality, Chakraborty has done nothing for people. I came to know he used to be in the office for one-and-a-half hours only,” Tiwary said. Talking about his campaign, Tiwary said the last one month has been hectic. “I leave home at 7am and retire only at 11pm,” he said. It’s the family that he misses the most now. “My four-year-old son Yuvan often falls asleep by the time I am back home and he is still in the bed by the time I leave,” Tiwary stated. Once on the road, the former Kolkata Knight Riders player is trying to reach as many people as possible. “We have some 2.4 lakh voters in this constituency and am trying to interact with them all. I have already covered my wards two-three times. It’s heartening to see people, from eight to eighty, coming forward to meet me,” he said while obliging a group of youngsters with selfies. Planning to set up an office in every ward, Tiwary vows to build a hospital or a health z centre in Shibpur along with cleaning up the local drainage system, beautification of the canal side and infrastructure development of all government-run schools in the area. Although a new entrant in active politics, Tiwary was, however, quite vocal about social issues always. He was one of the first to demand inquiry into the mysterious death of Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput on social media, spoke about the farmers’ issue, rising prices of daily needs of people and others. Like a true sportsman, he is not worried about results. “I have joined the party at a time when you can say it was against the tide. So I am here to play a long innings, irrespective of the results on May 2,” he signed off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tiwary-pads-up-for-second-innings-on-a-turning-track/articleshow/81956963.cms||---

Kolhapur district collector Daulat Desai has instructed the hospital authorities to reserve all 450-beds for treatment of Covid patients. He also suggested to open the Seva Hospital in Line Bazaar area for treatment and consultation of other patients and has advised to perform critical surgeries at private hospitals. “In the wake of new cases we need to have a dedicated hospital for treatment of Covid patients.

I stood in the queue for four hours in front of the Chemist Association of Pune District at Shukrawar Peth hoping to get some injections. I have been searching for the drug for the last two days,” Petkar said. Like her, relatives of several Covid patients, who are hypoxic and admitted to small and medium hospitals, are facing hardships in getting the vials in Pune. FDA officials clarified that retail chemist shops were not allowed to store and sell the drug. S B Patil, joint commissioner (drugs), FDA, Pune, said, “Only hospitals and their pharmacies can procure remdesivir by contacting the distributors. Hence, patients’ relatives should not be compelled to procure the drug.” Hadapsar’s Narayan Potdar said “Doctors have prescribed six doses of remdesivir to my father. I am searching from Tuesday..” Ranjit Shinde of Nasrapur in Bhor taluka said, “ I have been trying to get the injections for the last two days for my aunt. I came to the Shukrawar Peth chemists’ association office to get remdesivir on Wednesday morning.” TOI on Wednesday attempted to speak with a man running the counter to sell remdesivir, but he was too busy to answer the questions. Anil Belkar and Rahul Karpe of Chemists Association Pune District could not be contacted for their comments despite repeated contacts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/patients-kin-face-hardships-in-procuring-anti-viral-drug/articleshow/81957914.cms||Gitesh Shelke

Police have recovered 10 bikes along with spare parts of other two-wheelers. They are being also being questioned for their involvement in other crimes in the city. The arrested are Ravi Singh, Shankar Sharma, Lokesh Bairwa, Rakesh Sharma and Ajit Kumar. During interrogation, they accepted to be behind the theft of two-wheelers in at least two dozen cases.

Police have seized two bike engines. Prime facie investigation revealed that they had stolen bikes from Muhana, Sanganer, Bagru and Pratapnagar areas. “Our teams are also trying to figure out that they were selling the bikes to whom,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bike-lifters-gang-busted-10-vehicles-recovered/articleshow/81957912.cms||---

He was speaking at a presentation on the hiked penalties in the amended act to be implemented from May 1 onwards. “We want people to get used to the Act,” he said. “We don’t want to give them a shock. We have to be considerate since we are still in the pandemic period and there is a tendency for people to rush to the hospital without helmet. I am requesting officers and the police to be a little humane while implementing the new act for at least three months,” he said.  Godinho said that it was never the intention of the government to penalize citizens with steep fines, but the existing were very old and not serving as a deterrent to motorists. He, however, cited the example of a youngster who obstructed an ambulance to be denied a licence till the age of 25 years, setting it as an example of consequences of breaking violations.  He further said that Kadamba will hire private buses on two routes – Ponda to Panaji and Canacona to Margao – and work out an arrangement to operate together. “We have had long negotiations with both the associations and they have agreed on how to practically arrive at a solution. By this, we will be combining the synergies to Kadamba as well as private buses. The conductor might by KTC’s, but the driver and maintenance will be handled by the private operator,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cops-to-go-easy-in-early-days-of-new-mv-act/articleshow/81959216.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: No stand for saline, King Koti hospital forced to turn away Covid-hit patients||HYDERABAD: King Koti hospital, one of the three state-run Covid-19 centres designated to tackle the heavy rush of patients in Hyderabad, does not have enough saline stands in isolation wards. Authorities said they are now forced to re-direct critically ill patients due to lack of adequate Infrastructure. On Wednesday, IV drips could be seen hung on windows and beds and attendants of patients watching over it. Dr Marri Mallikarjun, nodal officer (Covid-19 isolation ward) King Koti hospital, admitted to the shortage of IV stands and said that a request has been made for urgent procurement. At the moment, there are over 150 Covid-19 patients in the 150 ICU and 200 oxygen bed hospital. But many beds lack oxygen flowmeters, so they cannot be used to treat Covid-19 patients. “Oxygen flowmeters are essential for regulating the oxygen supply and in its absence, the supply will completely stop,” said a senior doctor. As a result, the hospital which is meant to treat mild to moderate coronavirus cases, is forced to turn away some patients. On Tuesday, a patient who was sent from Gandhi Hospital to the King Koti hospital was redirected back to Gandhi, Telangana’s main Covid-19 hospital. By the time the patient reached the hospital, the oxygen saturation level had dropped severely, one official said. “Since we do not have super speciality facilities, we are also forced to send back patients who require gynaecology, paediatrics or cardiology super speciality, but we have been treating majority of the cases. We can easily handle patients with oxygen saturation levels of up to 83-95%, but we are also getting some patients with 70-73% saturation levels being redirected to us,” Dr Mallikarjun said. On the other hand, authorities at Gandhi denied redirecting any critical patient. “We are even admitting co-morbid patients with 93% saturation. Only in cases, where the patients may not require an ICU set up, we are redirecting them. If there is a patient whose condition is likely to deteriorate quickly, we do not send them away,” said Dr M Raja Rao, superintendent of Gandhi hospital. Gandhi sources said some of the patients referred to King Koti return, saying there is a shortage of beds. “Since there is a protocol that only critical cases should be admitted at Gandhi hospital, some of the non-critical ones are being sent to TIMS. In the whole process, it is the patients who are suffering,” added a senior resident from Gandhi hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-stand-for-saline-king-koti-hospital-forced-to-turn-away-covid-hit-patients/articleshow/81959219.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Goa||As rich buy lux cars outside Goa, state to cut tax on them||PANAJI: Highly aspirational cars from companies such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, better referred to as luxury cars, are purchased in other states by the people from Goa in a bid to evade the high taxes in the state. “It is has come to our notice that due to the high taxes in Goa, people are going to neighbouring states to purchase luxury vehicles. We are in the process of evaluating the same and considering lowering the taxes so that we don’t lose business to other states,” transport minister Mauvin Godinho told TOI. The luxury tax is calculated based on the vehicle type and its selling price. For some vehicles, Goa charges up to 12% tax on the total amount of the vehicle, while a state like Pudducherry charges only 1%. Which means, if a vehicle costs Rs 1 crore in Goa, you pay Rs 12 lakh tax, whereas in Pudducherry you can purchase the same vehicle by paying only Rs 1 lakh in tax. Godinho didn’t specify by how much it will be reduced but said that they are considering bringing it down and evaluation is required for the same. Following the state transport department’s crackdown on vehicles with outstation registration in 2019, it was found that most were registered in Maharashtra and Karnataka. The list also featured vehicles registered in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among others, besides Puducherry. In 2015, the BJP-led coalition government headed by then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar hiked road tax on high-end cars to increase revenue. Following the decision, several businessmen purchased and registered their cars outside Goa. The state directorate of transport issued a notice in September 2018 making it compulsory for vehicles with outstation registration, but plying in Goa for over 12 months, to re-register in the state. “We had started a drive against them (outstation-registered vehicle owners) and now we will restart it. They have to re-register the vehicle in Goa, if these cars are running in the state,” Godinho said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-likely-to-cut-tax-on-luxury-vehicles/articleshow/81959212.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Kolkata||Bagan’s gritty left winger tries to dribble past right-wing opponent||Kolkata: At a programme in Uluberia’s Panchla ground on March 31, CM Mamata Banerjee requested the Uluberia East candidate on stage to kick a football into the crowd. The shot from the stocky man proved a tad too powerful and the ball sailed over the crowd. That was expected of the man on stage: Bidesh Bose, the mercurial left winger who during his heydays outpaced everyone else on the field and made the opponents bite grass with exquisite goals. Thirty-four years after he hung up his boots, Bose has returned to play a different game. “In football, your team had to beat other clubs. Here, our team has to defeat other parties,” says Bose, explaining his task in footballing parlance. The challenge though is tougher one than he would have encountered in a game against arch rival East Bengal or Mohammedan Sporting. The former captain of Mohun Bagan, who set the field on fire with his electrifying sprints, is facing a stiff challenge from both BJP and ISF in this polarized election. In a constituency where Muslims comprise nearly 34% of the electorate, Abbasuddin Khan of ISF is going all out to woo the Muslim vote while BJP’s Pratyush Mondal is targeting a lion’s share of the rest 66%. Bose’s task is cut out. He must appeal to both sections and get enough votes to pip his rivals to the post. “I believe people’s memories of footballer Bidesh Bose who played his heart out on the field will come in handy. From where I am contesting, I believe 60% are MB fans who will value my loyalty to the club throughout my career,” he said. While PK Banerjee was his coach and guru during his days as a footballer, Bose says it is now party chief Mamata Banerjee who is the head coach and Howrah district Trinamool president Pulak Roy the assistant coach. Of course, there is another PK who has given him a useful tip. TMC-appointed strategist Prashant Kishor has urged him to stick to the development plank and avoid contentious political issues. “In this game, Didi is our coach-cum-goalkeeper. During my campaign, people have asked me how shall we play with an injured goalkeeper? I tell them, Pulak Roy is our stopper, the party workers are the mid-fielders, and I, the striker. We will control the ball between us and ensure that Didi does not have to parry any shot.” BJP and ISF though seem determined not to let Trinamool control the game. In this three-cornered contest, BJP’s Mondal has upped the ante against appeasement politics while ISF’s Khan is questioning how much the incumbent government has done for the minority community. Deputy chairman of Uluberia municipality till recently, Khan who has considerable clout in the belt, quit Trinamool to join ISF after the party decided not to field him. Normally, the Muslim vote should have gone to Trinamool en bloc. But with Khan now in fray, that’s no longer given. Bose hopes people will weigh his loyalty over Khan’s betrayal. “He (Khan) quit the party, something I would never have done. Loyalty has been my hallmark and I think the people who voted for Trinamool in the past will value the trait,” he said. Though offered a blank cheque by East Bengal to switch to red-and-gold, Bose had declined the offer. MB had signed Bose in 1976 as a backup for the ageing Narayanswami Ulaganathan. That year, MB won the Kolkata league after seven years. In the 12 years he donned the green-and-maroon jersey, Bose helped the club lift 37 trophies. Now, he hopes to add another feather to his cap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bagans-gritty-left-winger-tries-to-dribble-past-right-wing-opponent/articleshow/81956910.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||India||Number of workers in agri dipped in 30 years: Report||NEW DELHI: In a reflection of the changing socio-economic dynamics, the report on “Women and Men In India 2020” shows that while share of male and female workers in agriculture has shown a steady decline from 1987-88 till 201819, there is an increasing trend for both in trade, hotel and restaurant sectors. The report released by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation draws upon available nationally representative data sources to give an insight into the gender dynamics and shifts across sectors ranging from employment, education, health and decision-making. The report also dedicates a chapter to the impediments in the way of empowerment. In the chapter on education, data from NSS 75th round (2017-18) shows that among ever enrolled persons in the age group 3-35 years, 30.2% of females were not pursuing education due to domestic activities. In case of men, 36.9% of ever enrolled males in the 3- 35 years’ age group were not attending education due to engagement in economic activities. Among the never enrolled persons of 3-35 years age group, 13.6% females and 14.9% males were never enrolled in education due to fi nancial constraints, whereas 11.7% females and 1.5% males were never enrolled due to their engagement in domestic activities. As far as employment goes, in the chapter on employment a data sheet on the broad-based industry-wise classification of workers presents data from NSS 43rd round in 1987-88 to Periodic Labour Force Participation 2018-19 to indicate the trends. In agriculture in rural India, it turns out that in 1987-88 share of women workers was 84.7% which as per PLF survey 2018-19 is 73.2%. The share of male workers in agriculture was 74.5% in 1987-88 and was recorded at 55% in 201819. On the other hand, the per centage of men in trade, hotels and restaurants grew from 5.1% in 1987-88 to 9.2% in rural areas in 2018-19. In urban the percentage rose from 21.5% to 24.5%. In case of women workers too there is an increase from 2.1% to 4% in rural and 9.8% to 13% in urban areas. The labour force survey 2018-19 data is cited in the report to highlight that on the whole results indicate that in the rural sector, the workerpopulation ratio (WPR) was 19.0 for females and 52.1 for males. In urban sector, the ratio is 14.5 for females and 52.7 for males. In both rural and urban areas, WPRs for females were considerably lower than WPRs for males. WPR in 2018-19 vis-à-vis 2017-18 has risen except for urban males. As per PLFS (2018-19), majority of the females (59.6%) and males (57.4%) workers were self-employed in rural areas. In the urban sector, 54.7% females and 47.2% males were regular wage/salaried employees. Casual labour among the female workers and male workers was higher in rural area as compared to urban.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/number-of-workers-in-agri-dipped-in-30-years-report/articleshow/81960855.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Coimbatore||Western TN breaks state average in polling||Coimbatore: The western region has recorded higher voter turnout than the state average in the assembly polls held on Tuesday. However, urbanised Coimbatore district had the lowest turnout of 68.7% in western Tamil Nadu, while rural Dharmapuri recorded a turnout of 82.35%. While the backward Palacode constituency in Dharmapuri, from where education minister K P Anbalagan had won four times and contested this time too, registered the voter turnout of 87.3%, Edappadi constituency in Salem, which saw chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami crossing sword with DMK’s Sampath Kumar, came second with 85% polling. Veerapandi in Salem and Pennagaram in Dharmapuri also saw more than 80% polling. “Dharmapuri historically records higher voter turnout than other districts in the region. This is primarily because the entire district comprises of rural areas, where people take voting seriously,” said an election officer, who didn’t want to be named. Several Dharmapuri residents, who were working as daily wagers in Karnataka and Kerala, had returned home to vote on April 6, he said. Even in Salem, rural voters made a beeline to the poll booths right from the morning and returned home with their fingers inked. “Political parties were also pro-active in this region to ensure 100% voting,’’ the officer said. In several villages, cadres of political parties knew the voters by their name. “In small villages, they would know who has voted and who is yet to step out of their houses on each street. So, they would approach those households and persuade the residents to vote,” said another officer. On the other hand, urbanised Coimbatore had the lowest voter turnout in the western region. Three constituencies, which had the lowest turnout in the region, were in Coimbatore city - Coimbatore North, Coimbatore South and Singanallur. These three were followed by two segments each in Tirupur and Erode. Some of the constituencies such as Mettupalayam and Kinathukadavu recorded a higher poll percentage than the previous elections, but many recorded lesser votes than the past. Election officials said they had conducted awareness programmes to increase voter turnout and attributed the poor response to factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic situation and extreme heat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/western-tn-breaks-state-average-in-polling/articleshow/81957941.cms||Mayilvaganan
---||Hyderabad||T, Centre caught in legal row over Singareni CMD extension||Hyderabad: Singareni Collieries Company Ltd CMD N Sridhar’s extension without seeking the consent of the Centre is now embroiled in a legal wrangle. The Telangana government has extended the tenure of Sridhar as CMD for the seventh consecutive year. The Centre has filed an affidavit in the Telangana high court responding to a PIL, saying that extension cannot be given without its consent and contended that it was a violation of the tripartite agreement. Singareni Collieries is a Telangana government and government of India joint sector company with an equity holding in the ratio of 51:49. The company comes under the Union ministry of coal and energy department in the state government. Clause 4 of the tripartite agreement among the SCCL, GoI and Telangana government states that the state government would appoint the CMD with the prior concurrence of the Centre for an initial term of three years extendable by another two years by mutual consent. On January 8, 2021, Union coal secretary Anil Kumar Jain in a letter to state chief secretary Somesh Kumar said: “The appointment of CMD of SCCL is to be done by the Telangana government after seeking concurrence of the GoI. A resolution passed in respect of extension of CMD’ term in December 2020 is invalid and void as there is no concurrence of the Union government.” The coal secretary had even asked the CS to immediately terminate the extension given to Sridhar as CMD of SCCL and sought a fresh proposal. The petitioner, GK Sampath Kumar, said the tripartite agreement and articles of association were binding on the state government. In a counter-affidavit in the high court, Sridhar said: “The petitioner is a dismissed employee of SCCL in 2019. His prayer is an indirect method of seeking nullification of the dismissal order. This cannot be a PIL as there are personal motives.” He further said in the counter-affidavit, “As per the deputation rules, I belong to Telangana and there is no requirement of central government’s concurrence or consent to place a cadre officer on deputation within corporation control by the same state government. There is no restriction placed on the tenure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-centre-caught-in-legal-row-over-singareni-cmd-extension/articleshow/81959226.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Scores of beneficiaries turned away after several hubs run out of shots||PUNE: District authorities will now have to wait a few more days to again aim for one lakh daily vaccinations. On Wednesday, a serious shortage of doses forced many vaccination centres in the region to call off their sessions earlier than expected.  In Satara, officials had to halt all vaccinations due to the shortage. In a press statement later, the Satara zilla parishad said the drives will resume once it has enough stock of doses. So far, nearly 2.56 lakh people have been vaccinated in Satara. Other sites of Pune circle, which includes Pune, Satara and Solapur districts, there was a massive rush of beneficiaries who were worried about the depleting reserves. Many had to be turned away.  Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said the district currently has around 1.23 lakh doses in the reserves and more are expected. “Unless we have enough stock available, we cannot hit the daily vaccination target of one lakh beneficiaries. We are hoping to get a fresh supply by the weekend,” he said. Deshmukh said the Pune circle usually gets around five lakh doses within four to five days. But this time, he said, only about 1.5 lakh doses have landed for Pune, Satara and Solapur districts. He added that many industries in the region have also come forward to join the vaccination drive. “We have received requests and proposals for on-site vaccination centres from at least 25 companies. Sites will be activated once we receive more doses.” In housing societies, the Amanora Township in Hadapsar has started a site for residents and locals in the area. On Wednesday, overall coverage was steady, but unimpressive. In Pune rural, 22,269 people received the jabs. The number in PMC limits was 21,212. In PCMC limits, 12,058 people were given the shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/scores-of-beneficiaries-turned-away-after-several-hubs-run-out-of-shots/articleshow/81957926.cms||Piyush Bhusari

He also urged people to take precaution and remain safe in light of the steep rise in infections in Goa over the past three days. As of Wednesday, 1,45,784 doses were administered across the state, with a daily average of 3,000-3,500 doses. The immunisation drive, however, is yet to pick up pace even as the state health department aims at administering 5,000 doses a day to meet its target of vaccinating three lakh people who are over 45 years old, by the end of May. It was only after the vaccination programme was thrown open for people above 45 years of age that the pace of vaccination has increased from a daily average of fewer than 3,000 doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ayush-minister-gets-jab-urges-people-to-stay-safe/articleshow/81959224.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Mercury levels dip in district, to increase again in 48 hours||Coimbatore: The slight dip in temperature is expected to continue in the district for another 48 hours, weather experts said on Wednesday. They attributed the drop in the mercury levels to the easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal and a slight trough extending to the southern tip of the country from south Maharashtra. However, the temperature is expected to touch anywhere between 37C and 38C by Friday, as the trough is weak enough to bring any sudden showers. On Wednesday, the district recorded a maximum temperature of 36.3C, at least 1.7C lower than the 38C in the last week. Weather experts said the dog days would return by the weekend. Santhosh Krishnan, a weather blogger, said, “The drop in temperature is due to the extremely brief rainfall that the district received on Sunday and Monday and easterly winds to the district from the Bay of Bengal. We will see a slight and permanent drop in temperature after mid-April, when westerly winds from the Arabian Sea start blowing in.” Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet Weather Services, attributed the dip in mercury levels to the trough that extends from Maharashtra till Comoran area, through interior TN and Kerala. “However, we don’t expect much weather activity and the temperature will soar to the previous high in less than 48 hours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mercury-levels-dip-in-district-to-increase-again-in-48-hours/articleshow/81957946.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Last 2 TDP MLAs join TRS, pink party at 101||HYDERABAD: The two remaining Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MLAs in Telangana, Mecha Nageshwara Rao and Sandra Venkata Veeraiah joined the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) on Wednesday. The duo gave a letter to speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy merging the TDP into TRS. Before submitting the letter to the speaker, both Nageshwara Rao and Venkata Veeraiah met TRS supremo and CM K Chandrasekhar Rao at Pragati Bhavan. In 2018 assembly elections, Nageshwara Rao (Ashwaraopet constituency) and Venkata Veeraiah (Sathupally) had won on TDP tickets. Both seats are in Khammam. Venkata Veeraiah aligned with the TRS in March 2019 itself though he technically continued as a TDP MLA as per assembly records. Nageshwara Rao too had not been participating in TDP activities for the past two years. With this merger, TRS now has 101 MLAs in a house of 119. The TRS had won 88 seats in the 2018 assembly elections. Later, 12 of 18 Congress MLAs joined TRS, taking the number to 100. However, its Nagarjuna Sagar MLA Nomula Narasimhaiah passed away in December, taking TRS’s seat tally to 99. With the two new joinings, TRS numbers have for the first time crossed 100. In a swift development in the wake of Nagarjuna Sagar by-election on April 17, where the TDP fielded Muvva Arun Kumar as its candidate, the TDP MLAs officially joined TRS, weakening an already weakened TDP further. On Wednesday evening, assembly speaker Srinivas Reddy issued a bulletin acceding the request of two TDP MLAs to merge them with TRS. “The TRS leader has communicated to the speaker that the TRS party has agreed the request for the merger of the two members into TRS legislature party in the assembly and requested to take necessary action,” the bulletin said. This is not the first time that TDP MLAs have switched loyalties and joined the pink party. In the 2014-2018 assembly, 12 of the 15 TDP MLAs joined TRS in similar fashion. Interestingly, Sandra Veeraiah was a TDP MLA then as well but had chosed not to jump ship. The other two MLAs, A Revanth Reddy and R Krishnaiah, are not members of the present house. One of the 12 Congress MLAs, who defected to the TRS, Sabita Indra Reddy, is a minister in the KCR cabinet. With the defections, Congress lost the main opposition party status in the assembly and later moved Telangana high court against the speaker’s merger order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/last-2-tdp-mlas-join-trs-pink-party-at-101/articleshow/81959245.cms||Koride Mahesh

Around 15 days ago, hailstorm from Pakistan damaged 80% of the crops of farmers worth crores of rupees in the district. Now, another storm destroyed the remaining crops. On Tuesday evening, a dust storm reached Jaisalmer city. The storm blew at a speed of 30kmph due to which vehicle drivers could not see anything and had to switch on headlights, but visibility was very poor. Normal life at Ramgarh, Pokhran, Nachna, Mohangarh, Lathi and Chandhan was thrown out of gear. The sandstorm was due to western disturbance. BSF jawans too faced a lot of problems due to storm on the border as they were not able to see more than a few feet. In many areas, harvested crop was blown away with the winds. With increase in temperature, there was a light storm for the last 2-3 days, but Tuesday’s sandstorm engulfed entire Jaisalmer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/frequent-hail-sandstorms-damage-crops-in-jaisalmer/articleshow/81957947.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Why are we ‘special’ on govt’s lockdown menu?||This is the question restaurant and hotel owners are asking. While manufacturing industries are allowed to remain open, stakeholders in the hospitality sector are questioning the state government order to keep restaurants closed for dining citing Covid-19 spread. In what they call as unilateral decision-making, the owners say it will push them to the brink. At this month’s TOI Debate, they explain how shutting down will lead to irrecoverable losses for themNagpur: The hospitality industry needs government support to stay afloat. Explaining that it has a high break-even point, Dilip Kamdar, co-founder of Naivedyam Group of Hotels, said the upfront cost is very high and different from other sectors. “The sector is heavily dependent on manpower. We need to take care of them. We did that so far, but with no support from government, we have exhausted all our options,” said Kamdar. It’s a permanent loss for hotels providing lodging and boarding facility, said Tejinder Singh Renu, president of Nagpur Residential Hotels’ Association. “With business down and not many people coming to Nagpur from other states/cities due to Covid-19 fear, there is zero occupancy,” he said. There are different dynamics involved in running a restaurant. Angadh Singh Arora, director of Centre Point Hospitality, stresses the authorities have failed to acknowledge that the hospitality sector thrives on providing an enriching experience to the customers. “If restaurants are closed at 6pm, people won’t be able to experience it,” he said. In November last year, state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray had confirmed that the cabinet has approved industry status for hotels. Then why this new restrictions on hotels when other industries are allowed to remain open, asked Gaurav Chouksey, director of Olive Resorts. Citing some facts, Chouksey said there are many young entrepreneurs who have forayed into hotel business which employs thousands. “Now, they are sitting on a pile of inventory,” he said. According to Mandeep Singh Padam, director of Sanjha Chullah, the perishable items go waste if not used on time. Also, customers look at the whole experience when they visit a restaurant. “To maintain it requires a lot of investment. We have to pay taxes, water and electricity bills on time to ensure there are no disruptions. The government decision is unfortunate and will kill our business,” he said. The panellists don’t see much business from home deliveries through online portals. “A big percentage of the order money goes to these portals. Moreover, most of the business is between 8pm and 11pm when we are not allowed to operate,” said Mandeep and added that they have to pay trained staff like chefs, who demand high salaries. Ordering food online doesn’t give the feel of dining out and enjoying a unique experience. “It is not even 20% of total business,” said Kamdar. For someone like Nitin Gopalani, director of Ramesons, who runs a hotel wedding destination, it’s a total loss of business because there is no online delivery. Renu sought to know when portals are allowed to deliver food to homes, why not hotels? “Moreover, we are an organized sector. There are many delivering food in the unorganized sector,” he said. Kamdar termed the restriction of 50 people at weddings as a “shame” and questioned the various restrictions put in place. “For example, RT-PCR not older than 15 days is mandatory for those serving at food counters. But how can one tell if a person will not turn positive a day after obtaining a negative certificate,” he said. “If wedding are cancelled, a lot many people suffer. Those who framed these rules lack vision,” said Kamdar. Mandeep was perplexed at the decision to close restaurants when train, bus and bus travel is allowed. “See it this way, hardly 2% of the population visits restaurants,” he said. He expressed concern that conditions like mandatory RT-PCR and vaccination will be misinterpreted by authorities and lead to harassment of restaurant owners. Arora demanded that authorities show them any study that proves that Covid-19 infection is spreading mainly due to weddings and restaurants. “There is curfew in the night but not in the day when there is crowd on roads. People visit markets where they can get infected. Also, people are travelling to other places for weddings,” he said. Supporting Arora, Vinod Kanakdande, treasurer, Nagpur Lawns and Halls Association, claimed that the government is harassing this sector. “Wedding ceremonies are providing livelihood to so many people engaged in organizing them,” he said and termed the permission for just 50 people as way to target the hall owners. He also sought to know why Covid-19 is spreading when weddings are not happening in halls. Kamdar wanted to know why the government is not supporting the hospitality sector like in US. “Here, the authorities should consult stakeholders as they are responsible people and concerned about health of all,” he said. Kanakdande demanded that permission should be given for 200 persons at a wedding. “This will at least help us survive the lockdown,” he said. Adding to this, Gopalani said permission should be given as per size of the venue. In a lighter vein, Arora said authorities have only one solution: “Lockdown karo”. “People are coming from other states even when there is lockdown,” said Chouksey and questioned how Covid spread can be stopped just by shutting restaurants. Citing various studies, Renu explained that there is no cure for RNA based viruses. “In this scenario, we need government support but nothing has come so far. If the government doesn’t maintain a balance between health and economy, there will be protests,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/why-are-we-special-on-govts-lockdown-menu/articleshow/81958061.cms||---

However, he was rescued by the constables and currently in hospital in unconscious state, SHO Kunhari police station Ganga Sahay Sharma said. Sharma is likely to recommend both names for to senior officers for certificate. The initial investigation revealed the man on suicide bid was cash-strapped and hit by unemployment that led him to end his life, the SHO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kota-cop-jumps-into-chambal-saves-man-who-tried-to-end-life/articleshow/81957942.cms||---

According to the data provided by the civic administration, the city had 882 critical patients in the city on March 17, but the number increased to 2,612 patients on Wednesday. During the same period, the number of active patients has doubled from 8,173 on March 17 to 19,256 on Wednesday. Of the 2,612 critical patients on Wednesday, 1,629 patients are on oxygen support, 595 patients are in intensive care units and 388 patients are on ventilators. Rajendra Trimbake, the acting medical superintendent of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), said there had been a spike in per day cases in the city. Moreover, people are not immediately taking treatment or approaching doctors. “Delay in treatment is one of the reasons for the rise in the number of critical patients,” said Trimbake. He added that a section of people is still not following the Covid safety protocols like wearing masks and maintaining social distance. The health department of the NMC has also increased the number of oxygen, ICU beds and ventilators to treat the critical patients. Around three weeks back, the city had a total of 2,046 beds for critical patients, which has been increased to 3,371 beds for critical patients. The city now has 2,150 oxygen beds, 727 ICU beds and 508 ventilators in civic and private hospitals. NMC has two Covid hospitals — New Bytco and Zakir Hussain hospital. While the New Bytco hospital has 205 oxygen beds and 33 ventilators, there are 94 oxygen beds, 13 ICU beds and 14 ventilators in Zakir Hussain hospital of the civic body.

After declaration of lockdown across Maharashtra by the government to contain the Covid-19, Bobde is also believed to have cancelled his April 10 visit to the city. He was also supposed to inaugurate National Law University’s (NLU) new academic block at Waranga on Wardha Road on Sunday. “We are now trying to get his dates on April 14, when he would be travelling to the city. From April 15 onwards, the Chief Justice of India would be busy with completion of work before superannuating. It will be the last chance we will be having,” vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari told TOI. He added Nagpur University was waiting for the confirmation from CJI’s office in Delhi. “We are in touch with his office. Once confirmed, we need to take the chancellor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s permission for fixing the new dates,” he said. Chaudhari confirmed that NU had also deferred its convocation for awarding degrees to 2019-20 batch students scheduled for April 23.  “We haven’t notified the date of this convocation. Now with the curbs in place, it is impossible to arrange it. Even if we conduct an online ceremony, the students would rush to the Examination Section for receiving degrees later. It was thought better to defer the event to some other date when the situation is better,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-curbs-force-nu-to-defer-april-11-and-23-convocations/articleshow/81957951.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: 300 years old Sati stone unearthed in Tirupur||COIMBATORE: Construction workers have stumbled upon a Sati stone, which is believed to be at least 300 years old, while digging a trench to lay electric cable on old market street in Tirupur city recently. The stone was found barely a metre beneath the ground. Shortly after the stone was found, the public cleaned it, decorated it with neem leaves and applied turmeric on it. When alerted, a team from Virarajendran Archaeological and Historical Research centre in the city turned up to study the stone, which is 75cm high and 45cm wide. S Ravikumar, director of the centre, said, “The stone depicts the images of a man and woman. The man is holding a gun in his left hand and sword in the right hand. The woman’s right hand is raised and is holding a mirror, while holding the man’s hand with her left hand. Clad in a neat dress, the woman has ornaments and pinned flowers to her hair.” The man, Ravikumar said, was a soldier who had died fighting for a kingdom or community, or while safeguarding or rescuing cattle, and was considered a hero. “The woman’s ornaments, flowers and the mirror indicate nothing but she was the hero’s wife and was ready to commit Sati.” Sati was the practice of women immolating themselves their husbands pyres. Such women were venerated in earlier times.Sati was declared illegal and the practice was completely banned in British India in 1829. Referring to the gun in the man’s hand, Ravikumar said the guns became freely available a century after the arrival of the Portugues. “So, the Sati stone is expected to be at least 300 years old. No scripts were inscribed on the stone, which was handed over to the revenue department.” T Satyamurthy, retired ASI superintending archaeologist, confirmed it was a Sati stone. “It should be 250 years to 300 years old and belonging to the Nayaka period when Sati was very prevalent in the region.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/300-years-old-sati-stone-unearthed-in-tirupur/articleshow/81957959.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Kolkata||Park Street, Bypass bars & liquor shops to stay shut for 96 hours||Kolkata: Bars and off-shops on the iconic food street of the city will be closed for 96 hours in April following the new notification issued by the excise department. Bars of most of the heritage clubs and off-shops along EM Bypass, Southern Avenue, Sarat Bose Road and Chowringhee area will also remain closed for four days. In Park Street, bars will not be allowed to serve liquor from the evening of April 24 to the evening of April 26 for elections in Bhowanipur and other south Kolkata constituencies. They will again be closed from April 27 evening to April 29 evening for elections in north Kolkata constituencies, including Chowringhee. Bars of some premier clubs will be closed in two phases — from April 7 evening to April 10 evening and again from April 24 evening to April 27 evening — as either the constituency where these clubs are located or the constituency adjacent to them are going to polls. As per the election commission directive, liquor on-shops (bar) and off-shops should remain closed in a constituency where the election is being held. Forty eight hours is calculated from the end of the polls at a particular constituency. Like, if the poll date is April 10, then bars and liquor shops in that constituency would be closed from 6pm/6.30pm of April 8. Apart from bars and off-shops in the constituency where the poll is being held, the EC this time has also advised the excise department that liquor shops and bars will remain closed for 48 hours in adjacent locations depending on the sensitivity of the area. “During the election in East Midnapore, liquor sales were closed for 48 hours in some areas of East Midnapore as well. But this depends on the area. The election commission order only talks about shops falling under the same constituency. The adjacent area shops fall under the advisory of the commission,” a state excise official said. Incidentally, Covid-scare, financial year-ending and the elections have led to a major drop in sales for bars in the last fortnight. All eyes were on Poila Baisakh for recovery in sales. Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) president Sudesh Poddar felt that this order would lead to almost six days of closure in Park Street and some other areas. “If you see the closure time of 6pm-6.30 on a day to begin with, it means you lose almost 80% of that day’s business. Next day will be fully closed and on the election day, bars will be allowed to open from 7pm. So we will lose the majority of the customers that day as well,” he explained. Pradip Rozario, owner of KK’s Fusion and Mio Amore, said his bar will be closed in two tranches. “I heard that our bar would be closed from April 15 evening till the end of polling on April 17 and then from April 27 to April 29 ,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/park-street-bypass-bars-liquor-shops-to-stay-shut-for-96-hours/articleshow/81956969.cms||---

Accordingly, more than 400 patients have been shifted to schools in their respective villages, where covid care centres have been set up.“The number of cases is rising rapidly and it is observed that home isolation in rural areas does not seem to be effective due to lack of proper isolation in homes. Hence we have decided to lodge them in local schools, where care centres have been set up by the zilla parishad,” said Sharma. The officer said in the rural areas, where patients are in home isolations, there are many cases of violation of the norms, including appropriate facilities like separate toilets, isolation in separate rooms and giving food through disposable material. This is leading to more members of the family getting infected. Besides, it is a bit difficult to monitor the health of every patient, for which health officials are required to visit the house of patients’ to monitor their health. Also being reluctant to be admitted, some times patients avoid revealing their actual health issues. He said in the CCCs the patients will get home-cooked food served in disposables.There are healthcare personnel appointed at these schools, who will look after the health parameters .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/patients-moved-to-ccc-in-malegaon/articleshow/81955385.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: As plastic ban looms, manufacturers root for ramping up of recycling infrastructure||HYDERABAD: Even as the Centre has been pushing for a ban on single-use plastics, manufacturers of plastics in the state feel it will be difficult to impose this ban as the demand for such items is very high. Instead the government should focus on strengthening plastic recycling norms as well as infrastructure to ensure to protect the environment and the lakhs of jobs that are dependent on this sector in the state. As per Telangana government data, the total number of plastic units in the state is around 3,000 that employ over 2.5 to 3 lakh people. However, industry players feel these numbers could be much higher. Anil Reddy Vennam, vice-president (south), All India Plastic Manufacturers Association (AIPMA), said the government generally takes into consideration organised players, but there could be close to 25,000 unorganised players in the state. While the organised players are concentrated largely in areas like Kattedan, Jeedimetla and Balanagar, the small scale and micro units are scattered all across the city. “Around 80-90% of the industry falls within the small-scale industries category and they are the ones who manufacture single use plastics as there is a huge demand from eateries, kirana stores and food delivery services providers, among others,” he added. An SSI plastics maker based in the Old City area pointed out that though the government has been gunning for a ban on single use plastics, it has been only targeting the small manufacturing units and small business entities that use it while ignoring the big consumers of plastics. “Even the chips, biscuits, shampoos and now even the sanitiser sachets sold by MNC players come in plastic, which is barely recycled, but they are never targeted. However, if such a ban is imposed, small entrepreneurs such as tiffin centres, vegetable vendors and kirana shops get impacted,” he said. He pointed out that a consumer does not mind paying Rs 10-20 extra in malls for fancy shopping bags but won’t shell out an extra rupee at kirana stores or small vendors for the same, forcing them to opt for cheaper plastic bags that are generally less than 100 microns in density. Even SK Gupta, CMD, Vijayneha Polymers, one of the larger organised players in the state, said banning is not the right solution. Instead, the government should set up adequate recycling units and make the concept of recycling a part of school curriculum because the habits of segregation and responsible disposal of plastic needs to be inculcated early in life. Already, some of the large consumers of plastics like food delivery services provider Swiggy are working on sustainable packaging solutions.

Police commissioner Deepak Pandey has written to the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) commissioner requesting to conduct the tests for people, who come into contact with many people every day. “As per ‘Break the Chain’ directives, people falling in this category need to have RT-PCR negative test report valid for 15 days or at least have to take the vaccine. Since they can’t afford the tests, the police commissioner has requested the NMC to arrange for the same,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Sanjay Barkund. As per the government orders post-April 10, workers working on construction sites, domestic help, the transporters – either on the government or private buses or the taxis and autorickshaws fall in this category. In the case of vaccination, they need to produce the certificate presented by the government. “At check points, these people will be checked and failure of any such documents will result in penalizing them of Rs 1,000. Currently, vaccination is only for a restricted age group and many might not be able to conduct the tests given the cost involved. Hence, the request to the NMC,” Barkund said. When pointed out that it will be a huge task to get all these people tested, estimated to be more than 10,000 people getting tested in a short time and the reports might not be available soon as it takes more than 48 hours , the officer said, “We have, therefore, requested the NMC to carry out the tests on priority basis and also free of cost.” Meanwhile, the police fined 240 citizens for not wearing masks and collected a fine of Rs 1.22 lakh. At the same time, 23 people were penalised for not maintaining social distancing and a fine of Rs 52,500 was collected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/police-facilitate-rt-pcr-tests-of-autorickshaw-drivers-workers/articleshow/81955377.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Goa: Congress, GFP form Margao civic alliance for MMC polls||MARGAO: Opposition leader Digambar Kamat and president of GFP Vijai Sardesai on Wednesday announced the formation of Margao Civic Alliance between the Kamat-backed Model Margao and Sardesai-backed Fatorda Forward for the upcoming Margao Municipal Council (MMC) polls. Congress Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco is also a part of the alliance as two wards from Curtorim constituency are part of the MMC. At a joint press conference held by the three MLAs, Kamat said that the alliance was formed with a view to defeat the BJP-backed panel in the election. As per the terms of the alliance, GFP hasn’t fielded its candidates in the wards coming under Margao constituency, and Congress has done likewise in Fatorda. “The coming together of both Congress and GFP will inspire confidence among the people. There are agitations against the government across the state over various issues. Goa has turned into an “agitation state”. We will be the voice of the people, not only inside the assembly, but elsewhere, too,” Kamat said. Alleging that councillors were being pressurised by BJP MLAs to join the ruling panel in Curchorem Cacora and Canacona municipalities, Kamat said people were unhappy about BJP-rule. He advised government officers not to do anything that violates the law on the verbal orders of the politicians. Sardesai, addressing reporters, said that the formation of the alliance was driven by “public sentiment that the current anti-Goa BJP government needs to be sent home”. “Respecting this public sentiment we are repeating the experiment we did in the last elections of forming the Margao civic alliance, which had turned successful. This is the first sign of Team Goa, the only formula to “save Goa now”. If this formula turns out successful, it can be replicated across the country as well,” he said. Kamat, however, was at pains in explaining how some Congress workers had filed nominations in Fatorda when both the parties had come together in an alliance for the polls. “I will take up the matter with the president of the party,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-gfp-form-margao-civic-alliance-for-mmc-polls/articleshow/81959234.cms||---

The drug was not available in his town. However, he managed to contact Rajendra Dhamane, the chief of the Nashik city chemist and drugist association, who arranged for the drug for him. Like him, families of several Covid patients in the region have been frantically searching for the drug. The four districts of North Maharashtra — Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar — have been facing shortage of the drug for the past few days. FDA authorities said the production of the drug in the pharma companies had reduced after the drop in Covid cases. Now, since the scenario has changed, the firms are ramping up the production. FDA assistant commissioner (Nashik division) Madhuri Pawar told TOI that remdesivir is available with most government hospitals. Even many private hospitals have the stock. “The problem is with the drug stores, where the supply is inadequate. I have spoken with the companies based in Hyderabad and Bangalore manufacturing remdesivir to boost the production since the demand has gone up,” she told TOI. Long queues were seen in front of the drug stores in Nashik city too. Nashik district collector Suraj Mandhare on Wednesday went to some drug stores and examined the prescriptions that people had to buy the drug. In Nashik, the critical patients needing the drug stood at 5,741 on April 3 and it increased to 6,456 on April 5. Pawar was confident that the drug would be steady within the next few days, while a fresh consignment of 4,500 vials will be reaching Nashik by Wednesday tonight. With the guidance from Mandhare, the Nashik FDA authorities have been working overtime to coordinate with hospitals to ensure they don’t run out of either oxygen or remdesivir. Jalgaon district collector Abhijit Raut, “Some of the doctors treating Covid patients are prescribing remdesivir indiscriminately. We have told the medical practitioners that they should prescribe remdesivir based on ICMR guidelines.” Mandhare too has issued orders to the drug stores not to sell the drug unless the hospital issues a prescription with the treating doctor’s signature and the drug is unavailable at the store attached to the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/amid-case-surge-scramble-for-remdesivir-in-north-maha/articleshow/81955406.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Coimbatore||Thomas Park to become a memory soon||Coimbatore: A section of Race Course residents are disappointed with the city corporation for demolishing Thomas Park to facilitate a badminton or volleyball court in the locality. Despite its small size, the park has been a landmark since the 1890s. While destroying the greenery is one grouse, residents are also upset over the lack of information regarding the amenities coming up in their area. The residents said the civic body had begun the work to raze down the park more than a fortnight ago. “We initially thought they were planning to renovate the park. It never crossed our mind that the city corporation would remove the green cover completely, said Shantha Sundar, a resident. He said the civic body had started construction of a big structure next to the park. “We are in the dark about what the structure will house – an amphitheatre or a sports court?” Another resident, Ram Mohan, said any such facility in the area would narrow down the road further. “If it’s a sports court or amphitheatre, people from across the city will use the facility and there needs to be a parking lot. Why can’t they beautify the large vacant space that earlier housed a dilapidated government housing unit and create a Miyawaki forest and these amenities there?” Gradual reduction in the greenery in the area is also a bone of contention. “There is a rule that development projects should not affect the green cover. But the civic body has removed the entire park and uprooted many trees. Now, there is no shade. They are concretizing the area fully by just leaving some space for the water to percolate down. They can do what they want without taking our opinion, but why can’t they inform us about what is happening in our neighbourhood?” asked Ananya Mukund, another resident. Corporation commissioner Kumaravel Pandian promised to look into their grievances. Rajkumar, chief executive officer, smart city, met a few residents in the area on Wednesday and promised to discuss further plans and amenities for the area with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/thomas-park-to-become-a-memory-soon/articleshow/81957989.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Residents put off mass leave protest, medical colleges say issue resolved||Nagpur: Resident doctors on Wednesday put off their mass leave agitation till noon on Thursday following assurances from the district collector over some of their demands. On Tuesday, the residents at IGGMCH had issued an ultimatum to the administration of going on mass leave if their demands were not met. On Wednesday, GMCH residents too threatened to stop Covid duties from 6pm but later withdrew the agitation. Authorities of both the medical colleges said the issues were resolved and none of the residents went on leave. The district collector provided additional residents from Government Ayurveda College for Covid duties. Beside manpower, the residents demanded fee wavier for the academic year, exemption from PG thesis submission and diverting patients not requiring tertiary care treatment to civic-run isolation facilities among others. The agitation was planned in solidarity with resident doctors from across the state, especially those at Nair Medical College in Mumbai. Under the aegis of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), the residents had put up different demands before their colleges. IGGMCH’s MARD vice-president Dr Asif Patel said, “We have extended our mass leave till noon on Thursday. The collector had called us last night and assured us to provide additional medical officers from Ayurveda college. But we are waiting for similar assurance from Nair Medical College as our counterparts are bearing the brunt of Mumbai Covid situation,” he said. Dr Patel added that the MARD’s purpose is not to hamper services. “Our demands are legitimate and long-pending. We will ensure Covid patients are not affected but, at the same time, our demands must be fulfilled. We haven’t got any academic exposure due to Covid load,” he said. IGGMCH officials too said the matter was resolved. “MARD members had a discussion with DMER too. Staff has been provided. Total 51 community health officer and and resident Ayurveda doctors have joined. We have got 100 resident doctors,” they said. GMCH MARD president Dr Arpit Dhakate said our specialization were getting affected due to non-stop Covid duties. “Because of Covid other patients are not turning up. Where are the surgical patients, chronic illnesses, malignant cases going? Half of our tenure has gone in Covid only,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/residents-put-off-mass-leave-protest-medical-colleges-say-issue-resolved/articleshow/81958021.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Collector told to serve orphans for contempt||HYDERABAD: Telangana high court on Wednesday allowed Nalgonda collector Prashant J Patil to escape six weeks in jail in a contempt case after he agreed to work with children in an orphanage every weekend. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy accepted his proposal to serve at the orphanage in Nalgonda. “Spend two hours every weekend with the students for the next six months. Your service will be certified by our principal district judge there,” the bench told the IAS officer who was present before the virtual court hearing his appeal against the conviction. Patil, who was Warangal joint collector earlier, along with P Sandhya Rani, then district supply officer, were dragged to court by an aggrieved rice miller. Following some discrepancies found at the mill, civil supplies officials had booked a case against the miller and stopped his supply of paddy. The miller had approached the high court, which had instructed the officials to restart paddy supply. The two officials were later charged with ignoring and trying to subvert the court order. A single judge had convicted them in the case and awarded them a Rs 2,000 penalty. If they failed to pay the fine, they were ordered to undergo simple imprisonment of six weeks. Rani then retired but the contempt case continued. The bench last month asked the two if they were willing to do some social service in place of the jail term. They agreed and the bench directed them to come to court with some ideas and areas where they would propose to serve. When the court resumed the hearing on Wednesday, A Sanjeev Kumar, state’s special counsel, informed the bench that the collector would enrol 600 girls in schools at Miryalaguda where there was a drastic drop in the enrolment of girls. The bench said it was part of his duty as district collector of Nalgonda and Miryalaguda falls under his jurisdiction. Instead, it asked him to identify an orphanage in Nalgonda. The special counsel said there was an orphanage in the district with 40 students. While accepting the unconditional apology of the duo, the bench directed the collector to quote this order in the future whenever he faces a fresh contempt case. Rani was asked to identify an orphanage within a 5 km radius of her Domalguda residence in Hyderabad and serve two sumptuous lunches to the inmates on the coming Ugadi and Srirama Navami festival days. The in-charge of the orphanage has to certify her service. The punishment awarded to the two officers was set aside with a warning that any failure to comply with their service option would land them before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/collector-told-to-serve-orphans-for-contempt/articleshow/81959282.cms||---

There are "micro containment zones" in areas on the outskirts of the city under the jurisdiction of SDM, Huzur and SDM, Berasia. According to list of 51 "micro containment zones'' , areas under the charge of SDM, Bairagarh, have six "containment zones'', areas under the charge of SDM, Govindpura, 8, areas under the jurisdiction of SDM, Kolar, 9, areas under the charge of SDM, M P Nagar, 4, areas under SDM, T T Nagar, 5, areas under SDM, Huzur, 3 areas under SDM, Berasia, 7 and SDM Bhopal (city), 9. "Micro containment zones" can be only a house, where most of the family members may have contracted coronavirus to a building, where there are patients in all the houses in the building to a floor of an apartment, where there are coronavirus patients in all the houses on the floor. An official of the district administration. however, said that the number of "micro containment zones" may not necessarily give an idea of more coronavirus infected areas as a house or a cluster of houses with five or more patients are being declared "micro containment zones" . "You may get an idea that a particular house or a floor of an apartment or an entire building has more patients but not the whole area", he said. District collector, Avinash Lavania, said, "micro containment zones" are essentially meant to monitor persons in "home quarantine" and ensure that they are properly looked after medically and remain confined to their respective homes. There is no family among "micro containment zones'', which has no coronavirus patient and is yet facing containment zone restrictions, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-now-has-51-micro-containment-zones/articleshow/81956995.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

He said such studies would provide more information on how much immunity the vaccine can provide. Thackeray’s wife Rashmi had tested positive 12 days after taking Covaxin. The CM, however, said that people shouldn’t be in two minds about immunization despite the infections since vaccination reduces the severity of the disease. “In the UK, the first doses were given to save lives. They also extended the gap between doses so inoculate more,” the CM said. “Even if you get Covid after vaccination, it could be a milder bout. It’s possible that a vaccine can protect us against the third wave too,” Thackeray said in an interaction with media and senior state officials.Thackeray said during an online interaction with shopkeepers and traders, they had urged him to allow the businesses to run normally. “I have told them that I am not trying to stop anybody’s income, but simply trying to stop unnecessary crowding,” he said, adding that the challenge in front of the state was to stop the Covid surge. The CM also asked the public health and civic officials to remain receptive to feedback from people. “Issues like Covid centres having Indian toilets should be resolved if people are inconvenienced,” Thackeray said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-maintain-data-of-no-of-vax-takers-who-got-infected-says-cm/articleshow/81959292.cms||---

About 15 women employees, including assistant engineer, have been deputed in the office. “Only women employees will work in the substation and this is the first electricity substation in Rajasthan where only women work,” said VS Bhati, managing director of AVVNL. Bhati on the occasion of international women’s day had announced to make the first women’s substation. He added that even the accountant, secretary, lineman, engineers and even peons are women at this substation. AVVNL is confident that this pilot project will be successful and prove that women can perform better in hard skills sector like electricity. Directions are given to all senior engineers to prepare women’s stations in every division of AVVNL. AVVNL is working in 16 districts of the state.

Of the 1,19,368 applications, 86,909 were rejected and 12,068 cleared, with the rest pending. A day earlier, of the over 73,000 applications for e-passes, 34,759 were rejected, 1,271 cleared and the remainder was pending. Dilip Ghosh, who works in a private firm engaged in essential service, got his curfew pass issued within an hour. “I applied using my office identity card and provided the address of my office. I got the pass soon after,” said Ghosh. However, people whose applications were rejected were at their wit’s end. “I had provided my office identity card and the address of my Delhi residence. My application was pending for more than 24 hours and was finally rejected by the central district administration,” said Anil Sharma, a flour mill employee. Santosh Singh, who works in a medical equipment manufacturing unit in Sahibabad Industrial Area, said his application was rejected twice. “I uploaded the office identity card in which my address is shown in Ghaziabad, not Delhi,” he said. A district official said the rejections all had valid reasons. “Many people upload only the front side of their identity cards, which then becomes an incomplete document. In many cases, people provide office identity cards but do not upload any document supporting the address of their residence which leads to rejection,” explained the official. Rejections have also been made for uploading expired office identity cards, mismatch in the spelling of the name of the applicant and the spelling given in the identity proof uploaded by the applicant and for applying for night passes without valid reasons. Some applications were found to be for non-essential purposes. Over 200 duplicate applications were received from people who had already been issued night movement passes. The e-pass is being issued for those who are engaged in providing essential services, but do not have a government ID. Government officials are exempted from the night curbs on production of a valid government ID. For getting an e-pass people can visit www.delhi.gov.in and click on the newly created link for night curfew e-pass (prominently displayed) or click on https://epass.jantasamvad.org/epass/relief/english/. Those who are eligible to get the pass include those in services like shops dealing with food and essential items, home delivery of food, banks, insurance offices and ATMs, print & electronic media, telecommunications, Internet services, broadcasting and cable services, IT and IT-enabled services, transport of essential goods, including food, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment through e-commerce, petrol pumps, LPG, CNG, petroleum and gas retail and storage outlets, power generation, transmission and distribution units and services, cold storage and warehousing services, private security services, manufacturing units of essential commodities, production units and services that require continuous processing. People going for night-hour Covid vaccination can also avail the pass. Each district has constituted teams comprising four-six people for issuing e-passes. They work in shifts throughout the night and function from the control room established in all the offices of district magistrates. An official said the teams were working on a war-footing to go through the high volume of applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pendency-dips-but-just-12k-of-1-2l-pass-applications-cleared/articleshow/81976848.cms||AlokKNMishra

The protestors handed over petitions to the local administration and the Malegaon Municipal Corporation.“Although my party is part of the government, I am opposed to the decision on complete closure of non-essential shops in the textile town. Majority of the traders here are engaged in small businesses and sustain themselves on the daily earnings. It will be impossible for them to sustain without business till April 30. The state government should have looked into the woes of the small traders before announcing this decision,” said Rashid.Rashid questioned whether the Covid numbers will come down by shutting the non-essential shops. “We have to live with Covid. Shutting down businesses for some days would serve no purpose. Instead, the government should come up with alternative plans like keeping shops open on one side of the road every alternate day. Enforcing strict Covid appropriate behaviour would have been more realistic,” he said.The AIMIM also submitted a memorandum to Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare. Party’s MLA Mufti Mohammad Ismail and corporator Khalid Pervez said the month of Ramzan is approaching and Eid will follow. “The order puts the traders under financial stress before the festival. The closure of the shops can lead to law and order problems,” warned Pervez.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/malegaon-politicians-bat-for-traders/articleshow/81955392.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Nagpur||Safelkar’s police custody extended till April 12||Nagpur: Judicial magistrate first class MD Joshi on Wednesday extended police custody of notorious goon Ranjit Safelkar till April 12. Safelkar is key conspirator in Manish Shriwas and Eknath Nimgade murder cases. Fearing encounter, he had surrendered before the police on March 31. The Nagpur city police crime branch produced Safelkar before the JMFC and demanded an extension of custody citing seizure of 3 vehicles and weapons used by the goon. The investigation team informed the court that Safelkar had burnt his clothes at the crime spot and also disclosed about a smartphone, which he had hid in a village in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. The cops urged for the custody extension saying they want to recover the mobile, which may throw more light on the modus operandi of the goon as well as his other accomplices. Defence counsels Prakash Jaiswal, Ashish Nayak, Avinash Balpande, Raunak Sharma and Rohit Jaiswal argued before court that there exists no such mobile phone as claimed by the police and the investigators are trying to keep their client into their custody. “All recoveries have already been done by the police and hence there is no need for PCR,” they said. After hearing both sides, the court granted extension of Safelkar’s police custody till April 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/safelkars-police-custody-extended-till-april-12/articleshow/81958042.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The woman, an advocate living in Salatwad locality of Delhi Darwaza, told police that accused Aamez Lokhandwala, a resident of Melbourne in Australia, befriended her on Facebook in April 2020. “We got chatting. He said he was 34 years old and in search of a life partner. He also sent his birth certificate as proof. I believed him and agreed to get married. A couple of months later, a woman called me up and said that Lokhandwala was married to her. She said he was 48 years old and even had a 17-year-old daughter,” she told police. When the complainant confronted Lokhandwala, he allegedly said that the woman was his elder brother’s wife and sent a marriage picture of the woman sitting with his elder brother. However, when the complainant revealed this to the woman, she made WhatsApp video call. Lokhandwala who was reportedly sitting next to the woman had to admit that the woman was his wife. He also allegedly confessed to the rest of his lies. After that incident, the complainant cut off ties with Lokhandwala. However, in an effort to get her to talk to him, Lokhandwala threatened her with dire consequences. When she still refused to budge, he uploaded obscene photographs of her on social media sites, with the message that she is a sex worker. So, the advocate approached Karanj police and filed a complaint of criminal intimidation along with charges under IT act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nri-cheats-advocate-uploads-her-obscene-pics/articleshow/81959300.cms||---

The journalist was not injured in the incident. “It has caused me a lot of mental agony. He did this to me, despite telling him that I was a media person. I had taken videos of him several times during the election campaign. It is only now - after the election - he seems to have an issue with me,” the journalist said. When contacted, an MNM public relations officer said, “Kamal had undergone a knee surgery recently and has been walking with the help of a stick. As he was struggling to walk, one of us dropped him near his car on a two-wheeler. When he was walking towards the car, the journalist came too close to him to take video and obstructed his way. Kamal had requested him not to block his way. We also did the same. When the journalist refused to listen, Kamal just raised the stick in an attempt to create enough room for him to place his foot. He did not assault or hit the journalist.” Congress candidate from Coimbatore South Mayura Jayakumar, BJP candidate Vanathi Srinivasan and DMK MLA N Karthik have condemned the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/kamal-tries-to-shove-off-journalist/articleshow/81958036.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Centre seeks more time from Delhi HC to convey decision on razing of mosque||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday sought more time to inform Delhi High Court if it proposes to raze a mosque on Lodhi Road on a disputed land to which a paramilitary force has also staked claim. Additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma, while seeking time to get clarity on the issue, assured justice Sanjeev Sachdeva that the government won’t take any action till the next date of hearing to alter the status of the structure. The high court then gave time till April 29 to the Centre and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) to respond to the plea claiming an imminent threat to the mosque called Lal Masjid. Meanwhile, Delhi Waqf Board also submitted before the court that the mosque is its property and a dispute on the land in question is pending before the waqf tribunal. During the short hearing, the court added that it expects Delhi government will move “expeditiously” to fill vacancies in the tribunal due to which it is not able to function properly and decide disputes. The plea before the high court claimed that on March 31 the local police station in-charge came to the mosque and said it is going to be demolished to make way for expansion of CRPF barracks. It argued that despite informing the SHO that the land dispute is pending before the tribunal, the imam was asked to prepare to vacate the building. The waqf board urged the court to intervene and said the mosque, along with the adjoining land, has been in use since “time immemorial”. It also said that the dispute has been pending before the tribunal, which remains dysfunctional due to vacancies that are not being filled by Delhi government, leading to the dispute not being adjudicated. On Tuesday, the court had sought the stand of the Centre and CRPF while making it clear that they won’t take any steps to change the situation on the ground till it is hearing the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-seeks-more-time-from-hc-to-convey-decision-on-razing-of-mosque/articleshow/81958057.cms||---

---||Kochi||Voter turnout, minus postal ballots, at 74.04%||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state registered a voter turnout of 74.04% at the close of election on Tuesday, excluding the postal ballots that were polled. As per the final figures submitted to the Election Commission of India (ECI) for approval, the state’s final voter turnout is 74.04%, in which eight constituencies registered a voter turnout more than 80%. These include Taliparamba (80.94%), Dharmadom (80.22%), Kuttiady (81.28%), Kunnamangalam (81.55%), Koduvally (80.04%), Aroor (80.42%), Cherthala (80.74%) and Kunnathunadu (80.99%). In 19 constituencies, the voting percentage was below 70% and among the lot, Thiruvananthapuram (61.92%), Thiruvalla (63.34%), Ranni (63.82%), Vattiyoorkavu (64.16%) and Aranmula (65.45%) registered the lowest voter turnout. BJP’s inability to field candidates and the subsequent confusion among its cadres did not seem to have affected the polls in Thalassery where the turnout was 73.93%, while it was low in Guruvayur (68.46%). Interestingly, the northern districts of Kasaragod, Kannur, Wayanad and Kozhikode did well in terms of voter turnout, as none of the constituencies in these districts registered a figure below 70%. Also, five out of the eight constituencies that registered a voter turnout of more than 80% belong to Kannur and Kozhikode. The voting pattern did not show a common trend for all constituencies where intense triangular contest between UDF, LDF and the BJP was predicted. While constituencies like Manjeswaram (76.82%) and Malampuzha (75.03%) showed a better voter turnout, those like Konni (71.42%), Kazhakkoottam (69.63%), Vattiyoorkavu (64.16%), and Nemom (69.8%) witnessed a comparatively-lesser turnout, despite all three fronts taking out intensive campaigns. Voting pattern also showed that polling in cities were generally low compared to rural areas, which is evident from the figures for Kozhikode North (73.85%), Kozhikode South (74.25%), Kochi (69.84%), Ernakulam (65.9%), Thrikkakara (69.27%), Kazhakkoottam (69.63%), Vattiyoorkavu (64.16%), Thiruvananthapuram (61.92%) and Nemom (69.8%). The final list of constituencies was scrutinized and tallied on Wednesday, before sending it to ECI for final approval. But, the figures do not include postal votes as postal votes could be received a day before the counting of votes. The polling percentage registered for 2021 assembly elections is 3.31% less when compared to the overall voter turnout for assembly elections in 2016, which was 77.35%. Election commission sources attribute this reduction to the prevailing Covid-19 situation. Once postal votes are counted, the final figures would see an improvement. Meanwhile LDF convener A Vijayaraghavan expressed confidence and said that the front would win more seats this time. Jose K Mani will win Pala seat and LDF will retain power, he added. Tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran claimed Left front secured more votes than it expected in Thiruvananthapuram and once results are declared, it will be clear that people favoured development and welfare. Surendran claimed the BJP will lose its only seat in the assembly, Nemom, where it had fielded Kummanam Rajasekharan. Meanwhile, UDF leaders affirmed that the front will bag enough seats to win the polls as people voted against LDF’s faulty policies.

---||Mumbai||Dubai, Delhi are still top stops for flyers from Mumbai||MUMBAI: Over a year after the pandemic struck the world and consequent travel restrictions roiled the order among the top international routes, Dubai continues to be the top international destination for Mumbai airport, where the total passenger traffic, including domestic, in January-March was half of what was in the first three months of 2020, while the flight traffic was a little over two-thirds. Within India, Delhi continued to be the most popular destination for the city airport, where the traffic has been on a steady rise. As for CSMIA, it handled about 51 lakh passengers and 49,000 flights in the period from January to March, said Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL). Of this, 7,800 were international flights with over five lakh passengers and 41,000 were domestic flights with over 45 lakh passengers, it added. In the same period in 2020, CSMIA had handled 104 lakh passengers and about 72,000 flights, and in 2019, 116 lakh passengers and over 74,000 flights, according to Airports Authority of India data. The numbers are higher for 2019 than for 2020 because traffic fell to zero in the last week of March 2020 after the coronavirus-induced lockdown was imposed and flights were banned. So, in March 2020, Mumbai airport handled only 21 lakh passengers as opposed to 36 lakh passengers in March 2019. Dubai was the most popular international destination, with over 1.6 lakh passenger traffic, followed by Newark with 54,000 passengers and Male with about 50,000 passengers. Delhi topped in domestic destinations with 6.5 lakh passengers, followed by Goa with 4 lakh fliers and Bengaluru with 3 lakh passengers. Among the new international routes destinations added were Ras Al Khaimah and Batam, and on the domestic front, Jharsuguda, Kishangarh and Agra. While the passenger numbers are low not just for Mumbai airport but for other Indian airports as well this year as compared to the last two years, the Indian domestic air travel market hasn’t fared poorly when compared to other domestic air travel markets across the world. In fact, the Indian domestic traffic was resilient in February and also January, said International Air Transport Association (IATA), in its traffic report for February. “In India, new Covid cases were low in February, and vaccinations had started. But cases increased again in March, and the large economic impact from the crisis will delay a return to the strong growth rates of the recent past,” said the IATA report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dubai-delhi-are-still-top-stops-for-flyers-from-mum/articleshow/81960147.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala’s 10% population vaccinated||KOCHI: Among the south-Indian states, Kerala is leading in the vaccination drive with at least 10% of its population receiving a dose of the vaccine. While in Tamil Nadu 4% of the population received the vaccines, in Andhra Pradesh it is 5%, and Karnataka it is at 6%. However, health experts said that it was not enough and the state needs to fasten the vaccination drive before the second wave hits Kerala. In other words, Kerala has vaccinated 1,04,203 people per million population. Karnataka has so far vaccinated 63,645 people per million population and Andhra Pradesh 53,985 people per million population. Tamil Nadu and Telangana have not been able to achieve even half of what Kerala has achieved. Tamil Nadu vaccinated 39,825 people per million population and Telangana 35,313 people per million population. “A surge is expected in Kerala post-elections, but the situation is not really so bad as many people over the age of 60 have been vaccinated. This is expected to reduce the intensity of the infection and reduce severe complications,” said Dr Ajith Joy, MD, Molecular Cyclotron Private Limited and MD, DDRC-SRL Diagnostics Pvt Ltd. However, health experts said that Covid-inappropriate behaviour can increase the risk of free transmission between non-immunised people at multiple levels, leading to mutation in the virus itself and that can be a cause for worry. To reduce this, Kerala needs to ramp up its vaccination drive to ensure that maximum people are vaccinated before the second Covid wave hits the state. “Vaccination should be our top priority now in India. Even Kerala needs to carry out a massive vaccination drive to cover the majority of people above the age of 45 at the earliest,” said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, lead researcher of IMA-Kochi’s national survey on post-vaccination symptoms and experiences of HCWs in India. However, government doctors said that this is easier said than done. “Many doctors who were appointed on contract as part of Covid Brigade have left. Government should immediately fill up this vacancy and fasten the vaccination drive,” said Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA) president Dr Vijayakrishnan GS. Government also needs to push and promote Covid vaccination, even amongst those who do not have faith in the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. “Besides speeding up the vaccination drive, the administration should firmly deal with Covid-protocol violators, especially for not wearing masks, by imposing higher spot fines,” said Mysore Sanjeev, convener, Project Jeevan Raksha that came out with monthly Covid projections for each state during the initial months of the first Covid wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/states-10-population-vaccinated/articleshow/81957066.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Pune||Stock of 12-13 lakh doses last for 3 days now: Maharashtra health minister||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has sought 40 lakh vaccine doses per week to meet the desired target of vaccinating nearly 6 lakh people every day. The state was currently vaccinating 4.5 lakh people every day and so a stock of 12-13 lakh doses would last for three days. “We have accepted the challenge that Union minister Prakash Javdekar had given to us: to scale up testing and vaccinating 6 lakh people a day. But the Centre should now match their supply pace to our vaccination speed,” said Tope. Tope confirmed many vaccination centres in the state had to shut due to lack of the vaccine. “There is an increased demand for Covaxin, but that too is inadequate,” said Tope. “Most of those infected now are in the age group of 25 to 40 and the Centre should universalise vaccination, especially in Maharashtra,” he said. Maharashtra currently vaccinates nearly 4.5 lakh people every day, but Tope said the target is now being revised to 6 lakh daily. On Tuesday, due to a widespread shortage of doses, the state was able to vaccinate only about 3.88 lakh eligible beneficiaries. “There's a tremendous shortage in some districts. Many sites were forced to send people back without jabs on Tuesday,” the health minister said. State health secretary Pradeep Vyas said he has written to Centre for fresh supply. "We wrote that after April 9, most districts would have run out of vaccines."

On Wednesday, Gautam Budh Nagar recorded 652 active cases and according to the data, these sex sectors account for 50.9% of those. This raises concerns over the actual number of Covid patients in Noida and according to sources, it is likely that there are over 3,000 active cases in the district as of now. There are around 40 highrise societies in 7x sectors, which have a population of around two lakh. These sectors have been planned as high density areas and have several market places and other common facilities. Amit Gupta, president, AOA, Prateek Wisteria, Sector 77, said the society has 46 active cases. “We are surprised with such high numbers. The figure does not include cases from other residential sectors, densely populated areas of Noida Extension other areas of Greater Noida or Jewar. We have asked other societies to collect such data as well,” he said. He added that 219 cases were found in 13 societies from other places in Noida, which is almost equal to the total number of active cases in the district. “We have been informed about the situation and we are taking action. The health and administration officials are in touch with the AOAs there. We are requesting people to inform health officials if they test positive so that we can monitor them,” said district magistrate Suhas LY. Health officials said a sanitisation drive has been started in Prateek Wisteria, Gaur Sportswood and Homes 121. “We have asked the societies to share the reports of those who teted postive, along with the contact deatils of the people. Many societies have not shared these and some people are also unwilling to the give details. We cannot force them to share details and we also cannot initiate any surveillance activities by infringing on people’s privacy unless we have any confirmation,” said Dr Obaid Siddiqui, nodal officer for containment zone in GB Nagar. He added that people are continuously being asked to report positive cases and get tested at authorised labs. However, there are many who are not doing so. With increasing cases that are not being reported, RWAs are worried and are taking steps to control gatherings. RWAs and AOAs are also asking the administration to issue guidelines for societies. “We realised that there are 48 active cases, when we started taking count, but there are some who still don’t report and just stay at home. In these cases, we can’t monitor them or conduct any sanitisation. At our own level, we have increased security and thermal scanning and we don’t allow anyone without mask to enter the society. We may also shut some common areas by tomorrow. But, some guidelines from the administration is definitely required,” said Arun Sharma, AOA president of Supertech Cape Town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/50-covid-cases-in-7x-sectors-points/articleshow/81960117.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Velumani violates model code of conduct, booked||Coimbatore: The city police have registered a first information report (FIR) against municipal administration minister and the AIADMK candidate from Thondamuthur constituency S P Velumani for violating the model code of conduct. On Tuesday, he had visited a polling station at the government higher secondary school at Kuniyamuthur in a car that sported the party flag and wearing a shawl with the colours of the party flag. Based on a complaint lodged by Raja Mohammed, zonal officer of Thondamuthur constituency, the Kuniyamuthur police booked a case against Velumani under sections 130 (2) of the Representation of the People Act (canvassing of votes in or near the polling stations). It is to be noted that candidates and others are not allowed to enter within 100-metre radius of a polling booth carrying party symbols or any items representing their parties. This was the second poll code violation case against the minister in as many days. On Monday, police had registered a case against Velumani and three other AIADMK functionaries for gathering party cadres at the party office at Selvapuram. The city police have also arrested one AIADMK cadre and two DMK workers for distributing cash to the voters on the poll day. Flying squad officials had found the AIADMK men - P Vinod Amal Christoper, 35, of Sowripalayam and K Vellingiri - distributing cash to the voters in the name of verifying their booth slips near a polling station. They nabbed Vinod from the spot and seized Rs2.20 lakh. The Peelamedu police later registered a case against the duo. Vellingiri is still at large. The DMK cadres - B Ravibalu, 46 and S Vellingiri, 59 - were also arrested by the flying squad officials, who were on vehicle check near Gandhi Managar. Officials have seized Rs73,000 from them. All the arrested were released on station bail. The Kuniyamuthur police have also booked the DMK and AIADMK cadres for erecting flex boards with the party symbols and names of their candidate at their party offices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/velumani-violates-model-code-of-conduct-booked/articleshow/81958058.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In his complaint filed on Tuesday, Nikhil Trivedi, 48, said that he had listed his profile on the website. He runs a plywood business. He said that a woman, who identified herself as Elizabeth Keith, contacted him on March 7 and said that she found his profile interesting. She told Trivedi that she was an MD. She said she had two kids, but her husband had died a year ago. She said, therefore, she was searching for a life partner. Trivedi said that they began chatting over the phone and on WhatsApp for about a week. On March 14, she told Trivedi that she was coming to India and sent a picture of her flight ticket to him. “At around 11.45am on March 15, a man who introduced himself as Rakesh Verma and a woman who called herself Meghna Rawat rang me and said they were Mumbai airport officials,” Trivedi said. They told Trivedi that Keith had been caught with about 5 lakh GBP for which she needed to pay a penalty; otherwise, they said, she will be deported. They told him to pay Rs 65,000 through online banking to an account. To get Keith to Ahmedabad, Trivedi paid the money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/40-partner-search-costs-man-rs-60k/articleshow/81959315.cms||---
---||India||Govt scraps appeal tribunal against Censor board steps||NEW DELHI: The film fraternity has expressed disappointment over the government’s decision to disband the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT), an appellate authority that filmmakers approached to challenge decisions taken by the Central Board of Film Certification, more popularly known as the censor board. In an ordinance notified on April 4, the government amended the Cinematograph Act, 1952, to say that filmmakers aggrieved by the decision of the Central Board of Film Certification will now have to approach high courts instead of the FCAT for redressal of their grievances. The FCAT is one of the tribunals abolished by the government through the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021. A bill to abolish tribunals in which the public was not a litigant was moved by MoS fi nance Anurag Thakur during the Budget session this year. Since the bill could not be passed during the session, the government issued an ordinance to bring about the changes proposed in the bill. Among those who expressed concern over the abolition of the FCAT were filmmakers Hansal Mehta, Vishal Bhardwaj and Anurag Kashyap. Mehta, who has made films like ‘Aligarh’ and ‘Shahid’ said abolishing the tribunal and asking filmmakers to take their complaints to the HC would only delay the process of settling disputes. “Do the high courts have a lot of time to address film certification grievances? How many film producers will have the means to approach the courts?” he said on Twitter. Bhardwaj also tweeted. “Such a sad day for cinema. Film Certification Appellate Tribunal Abolished | 6 April, 2021,” he said. The legal fraternity argued that the shift would add to the courts’ already heavy burden. Advocate Apar Gupta of the Internet Freedom foundation, said, “The abolition of FCAT is likely to increase further delay, costs and indeterminacy for filmmakers. ...While there are strong arguments for the abolition of tribunals, but — till film certification is mandatory — the FCAT was largely an imperfect but a functional body...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-scraps-appeal-tribunal-against-censor-board-steps/articleshow/81960859.cms||Swati Mathur
---||Delhi||Ostrich approach works for night-rule violators||New Delhi: From being unaware about the restrictions at night to claiming that they had come out to buy medicines, several people who violated the curbs and were without masks made random excuses when stopped at pickets. In south Delhi, a man stopped for not wearing a mask told police that he was a Covid-19 patient and was rushing to a hospital. Many commuters stated that they were either returning from a wedding or a family outing at a restaurant. On the second day of the curbs, police registered 489 cases and took preventive action against 843 people. Apart from this, 731 challans were issued for violating Covid norms. Policemen deployed at pickets said most people either said they were unaware about the curbs or were returning home from work late after getting caught in traffic. “Many people who were stopped in south Delhi claimed they were returning from a wedding. A man said he was Covid-positive and was rushing to a hospital, but failed to show any documents. Some said they were returning from a friend’s house or a restaurant,” said a senior police officer. In outer Delhi, cops were stunned to hear from people out in nightwear claiming that they were returning from work. “We asked them the address of their office, but they failed to show anything,” said a policeman. In Southeast district, police let off a resident of Faridabad who showed valid proof that he was returning home from his office. “A man who had come from Hapur to distribute his daughter’s wedding invitation cards got late and was stopped at a picket. He was let off after police checked his identity and the wedding cards,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ostrich-approach-works-for-night-rule-violators/articleshow/81976907.cms||---
---||Kochi||BJP alleges vote trade between CPM & Cong||Thiruvananthapuram: The BJP national executive member P K Krishnadas here on Wednesday alleged vote trade between Congress and CPM in several constituencies in the state where NDA candidates had an edge over other opponents. Krishnadas, also the chairman of the state NDA unit, has alleged that the Congress-CPM deal took place with the support and knowledge of CPM central committee and Congress high command. “Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s claim that CPM has made all arrangements to close BJP’s Nemom account and KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran’s remark that CPM had traded votes in Manjeswaram were proves for the pre-poll understanding between these two parties. However, voters have toppled the secret deal of CPM and Congress to a great extent and NDA was hopeful of winning a significant number of seats this time,” he said. The open plea by Ramachandran to CPM for its support to spoil the prospects of BJP in Manjeswaram seat in Kasaragod could be seen as a sign of Congress-CPM camaraderie in Kerala. Krishnadas said the Congress and CPM had got the support of PDP, Jamaat-e-Islami and Popular Front in the election. Both the CPM and Congress were controlled by these elements, he said. Krishnadas also demanded CPM leaders to stop frowning at NSS general secretary G Sukumaran Nair for his remarks on the election day. Pinarayi Vijayan had claimed continuity for his government by banking heavily on bogus and double votes, he said. Meanwhile, Kummanam Rajasekharan said that he was confident of a comfortable win in Nemom seat. “The Congress and CPM had taken suspicious stands. But the feedback from the ground are positive for BJP. We would win with a comfortable margin. A complete picture of the voting pattern would be available in a couple of days,” he said. Rajasekharan also sought to downplay the unsavoury comments of Nemom sitting MLA and senior BJP leader O Rajagopal. “He is such a respectable leader and I have very close connection with him. I don’t think he would make any deliberate comments that could go against me or the party,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bjp-alleges-vote-trade-between-cpm-cong/articleshow/81957103.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

During the ‘Swasthya Agraha’ event at Minto Hall, religious leaders from other parts of the state and the country talked to the CM online. CM requested religious leaders to guide the common man. Swami Chidananda, who joined the discussion from Rishikesh said, if the body is healthy then all is healthy and meaningful. He said, Shivraj Singh Chouhan's efforts for health awareness are commendable. He also said that everyone should follow social distancing, but stay connected with the heart. Chouhan said, Covid control measures can be implemented only with the cooperation of the whole society at a time when this infection is spreading throughout the country. The appeal of religious gurus to follow precautions will prove to be effective. He called upon people to become volunteers in Covid control. CM also said that a help desk is being set up to solve the problems related to infection. Additional chief secretary, health, Mohd. Suleman gave a presentation on the status of coronavirus pandemic in the state. Assembly speaker, Girish Gautam, was also present on the occasion. Swami Shandilya said, all precautions should be taken at this critical time. Bhopal Archbishop, Leo Carnelio, said in India and Madhya Pradesh, this is a war that is being fought bravely, it will be successful. Bhopal Qazi went on to add that leaders are inspiring people to get vaccinated, following government’s instructions is necessary for protection of health. Bohra religious head, Sheikh Tahir Ali, said, CM’s concern to contain the pandemic is appreciable. Sikh guru, Giani Dilip Singh, commented, it is necessary to put on a mask. Buddhist Guru, Shakya Bhante, added, if you are safe, your family is safe, so wear your mask.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cm-knocks-doors-of-spiritual-gurus-in-fight-against-virus/articleshow/81957081.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Just out of hospital, Sharad Pawar gets 2nd vax shot at home in Mumbai||MUMBAI: NCP chief Sharad Pawar received the second dose of the Covid vaccine at his residence in Mumbai on Wednesday. The 80-year-old who underwent a medical procedure for gallbladder stones at Breach Candy Hospital recently had taken his first shot of Covaxin at the state government-run JJ Hospital, Byculla, on March 1. Pawar is scheduled to undergo a gallbladder removal surgery shortly. “Due to the impending surgery and the fact that he had requested the state for his second vaccine, we decided to give him a shot at his residence,” said a senior state government official. The gap between two Covaxin shots can range from 28 to 42 days. A six-member team of doctors and nurses went to Pawar’s residence along with a life-support ambulance. After the vaccination, Pawar tweeted: “Coincidentally, today is World Health Day. On this occasion, I urge all citizens to take active part in the fight against this virus by completing the Covid vaccination process as soon as possible.” The state has been pushing for mobile units to be used to boost vaccination rates and as a benefit to bedridden or elderly people. Public health activist Ravi Duggal said the provision should be extended to everyone and not just the privileged. “This is not surprising that he gets this facility at home. Yes, there would be many bedridden persons who should get domiciliary access but providing such access for vaccination should not be done without provision of emergency care in case there is an adverse reaction like anaphylactic shock or other serious event,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/just-out-of-hosp-pawar-gets-2nd-vax-shot-at-home-in-mumbai/articleshow/81959388.cms||---
---||Kochi||A day after polls, CPM hits back at NSS||Thiruvananthapuram: The day after Kerala’s assembly elections, CPM launched an all-out attack against NSS general secretary G Sukumaran Nair on Wednesday. LDF convener A Vijayaraghavan was the first person who criticized Nair for his remark on polling day. Vijayaraghavan alleged that Nair spoke like a political leader and CPM will expose his political interests behind those remarks. He said even the community represented by Nair will not endorse his statement. “The intention was very clear. The people of the state came to know about his political inclinations. Sukumaran Nair tried to give a political statement on polling day,” he said, referring to Nair’s remark that the people of the state longed for a change in the government. His political statement was aimed at defeating LDF. But, community vote banks are not decided by community leaders. It will become evident when the results are announced. The people will give a fitting reply to the NSS chief. His statement won’t have an impact, added Vijayaraghavan. Law minister A K Balan, who gave a complaint against Nair to the election commission, said, “It was the bomb the opposition leader was talking about all these days.’’ The statement by NSS chief was a conspiracy between him and UDF and the people of the state will reject Nair’s statement, said Balan. Fisheries minister J Mercykutty came down heavily on Nair. “The statement by Sukumaran Nair on polling day was made with an intent to influence voters. NSS always criticized the LDF government and hence people are well aware of his intentions,” she said. Devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran said Sukumaran Nair’s words will benefit LDF as people were aware of the stand taken by the government in issues related to faith. Cong blames CPM: But, former chief minister Oommen Chandy claimed that CPM attacked NSS as it sensed an impending defeat this election. “All social and community leaders have the freedom to air their views and opinions. These leaders have taken such stands openly several times. No one should try to silence them. Now, CPM is coming out against NSS as they fear that the party may face defeat in election,” alleged Chandy. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also slammed CPM for attacking NSS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-day-after-polls-cpm-hits-back-at-nss/articleshow/81957080.cms||---
---||Delhi||Proceedings stayed in riot case related to house burning||New Delhi: A city court on Wednesday stayed the proceedings in a magistrate court, which took cognisance of rioting and other charges against a man, who had filed a complaint of his house being destroyed but his complaint was tagged with another case and he was arrested. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said, “Till the next date of hearing, further proceedings in the matter before the CMM shall remain stayed.” Hashim Ali and his son had challenged an order wherein chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) had taken cognisance of a chargesheet filed against them. Representing the duo, advocate MR Shamshad argued before judge Yadav that despite specific complaints being given to the police on March 1, 2020 by his clients against the perpetrators, no investigation was carried out. Shamshad stressed that his clients were arrested despite the fact that they were complainants in the case. Their complaints were wrongly tagged with a complaint of another person, the advocate said. The petitioners’ counsel further submitted that “the interest of justice would be jeopardised if the interim stay was not granted as the chief metropolitan magistrate would proceed in the matter to commit the case to the sessions court whereas the CMM was required to apply his mind to the facts of the case and the case diaries before committing the case.” The court then directed, “Let reply be filed by the state and the original case file be summoned from the court concerned for the next date of hearing. IO and SHO, Karwal Nagar, shall remain present in court with original case diaries.” In a separate hearing, the court found it “really strange” that the complaint with regard to burning of Ali’s house was clubbed with another complaint, being FIR 72/2020 at Karawal Nagar police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/proceedings-stayed-in-riot-case-related-to-house-burning/articleshow/81958111.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As many as 90 specially-abled cricketers from across the country, including eight from Uttar Pradesh, will display their cricketing skills in Divyang Premier League (DPL) to be organised at Sharjah and Dubai from April 8-15. Founder and secretary of Divyang Cricket Control Board of India (DCCBI), Haroon Rashid, said: “This is the first such event in the history of ‘divyang’ cricket. Six teams will participate in DPL at Sharjah and Dubai stadiums.” The teams are Delhi Challengers, Mumbai Ideals, Kolkata Knight Fighters, Gujarat Hitters, Rajasthan Rajwadas and Chennai Superstars. “We are following all Covid-19 guidelines. All the players will undergo four tests during the tournament,” he said, adding the tournament was scheduled to be held last year but had to be postponed twice due to coronavirus pandemic. The players selected from Uttar Pradesh are Iqlakh Ahmad of Prayagraj and Atul Pratap Singh of Chandauli (Rajasthan Rajwadas), Mubin Khan of Kanpur, Vinay Kumar Pandey of Gorakhpur and Roop Chandra Maurya of Bareilly (Delhi Challengers), Kailash Prasad of Agra (Chennai Superstars), Luv Verma of Sonbhadra (Kolkata Knight Fighters), and Yogendra Yadav of Kanpur (Gujarat Hitters). According to DCCBI officials, plans are afoot to increase the number of teams from existing six to eight from next year. “Each team will have 10 Indian and five foreign players. We also plan to have auction of players on the lines of IPL,” a DCCBI official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/8-up-cricketers-to-play-in-special-dpl-in-uae/articleshow/81959317.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Eateries take dine-in option off menu||Ahmedabad: With curfew restrictions being imposed due to increasing cases of Covid-19, the restaurant business has had to face one blow after another as order volumes and revenue decline. With the curfew being imposed from 8pm onwards, most restaurants have decided to close dine-in services for the evening hours and limit business to takeaways alone. About 85% of restaurants’ business comes from dine-in and orders in the evening hours. Rushabh Purohit, who runs a restaurant offering Gujarati thaali in Ahmedabad, said, “There’s no point running the restaurant for half an hour or forty five minutes. Our staff will also need time to wrap up and get home. We’ve thus begun accepting bookings from 4pm onwards for takeaways, while dine-in will be closed till the 8pm curfew is in place.” Most restaurants have lost a major chunk of their business in revenue and order volumes. “We’ve suspended dine-in services for the time being and are operating on takeaway basis because bearing operating costs isn’t sustainable when revenues are constrained,” said the owner of another restaurant in the city. Takeaway order volumes have declined by more than 50% for the last three weeks, while footfalls have fallen further as the number of Covid-19 cases in the city increases. Once a booming business, with healthy evening footfalls and late-night delivery augmenting revenues, the restaurant trade has come to a standstill for most, particularly over the last fortnight. Restaurateurs are worried about sustaining business because operating costs remain the same. Regina Daga, a partner in an Ahmedabad pizzeria, said, “The greater part of our business takes place in the evening with people walking in or takeaway orders. The weather now is not suitable for customers to walk in during the day and footfalls are thus low. With the 8pm curfew, our situation has gone from bad to worse as we’re struggling to even recoup operating costs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/eateries-take-dine-in-option-off-menu/articleshow/81959351.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Ahmedabad||With 136 new branches, pvt banks expand rapidly||Ahmedabad:At a time when public sector bank branches, particularly those of banks that have recently undergone mergers are shrinking in Gujarat, the number of private bank branches are growing rapidly. Even in the pandemic year, private sector banks added some 136 new branches in Gujarat between December 2019 and December 2020. According to the latest report by State Level Bankers’ committee (SLBC) – Gujarat, some 2,070 new bank branches were added in Gujarat in December 2019 which grew to 2,208 in December 2020. Majority of the new branches are opened by Axis Bank (35), HDFC Bank (23), IDFC First Bank (27), Bandhan Bank (35) and Kotak Mahindra Bank (10). “Private banks have remained bullish on expanding their branches in a bid to increase their network. However, the expansion of bank branches took place mostly in metro and urban areas whereas very few new branches came up in semi-urban or rural areas,” said M M Bansal, convener, SLBC – Gujarat. Banking sector sources confirmed that despite the pandemic, footfalls at bank branches were good particularly in urban areas as well as metros and therefore, branch expansion was only logical for private banks. For instance, private sector lender, HDFC Bank alone operationalised 24 branches in 2020-21 and 32 in 2019-20. “Besides urban areas, the bank is also focusing on expanding its reach in semi-urban and rural areas,” said a source. SLBC sources said that while digitisation will continue, banks are also looking to strengthen their physical presence in various markets so that they can reach out to a wider set of customers. Therefore, they’re bullish on expanding. In contrast, expansion of branches came to a standstill in public sector banks, especially those which underwent a merger because many of them had to rationalize branch operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/with-136-new-branches-pvt-banks-expand-rapidly/articleshow/81959432.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt decides to increase testing and vaccination||Thiruvananthapuram: The Covid-19 core committee meeting decided to intensify the testing and increase the number of vaccinations to face the post-election surge. The meeting observed that there would be a surge in the number of cases in the state. There will be strict monitoring in the state to ensure that Covid protocols are being maintained. Even though the meeting did not decide on imposing any kind of restrictions in the state, health minister K K Shailaja said that the government would be forced to impose restrictions at the local level to check the spreading. The state government has also decided to have an interaction with the Centre and based only on their directive a decision on bringing in any kind of restrictions in the state will be taken. Several states have already started imposing restrictions like night curfew, ban on cinema halls and restaurants, etc, to prevent the second wave of the pandemic. “The people will have to impose their own control and stay away from social gatherings. There is every chance for an increase in the number of cases in the state due to the election campaigning. Even after the local body polls the cases had increased. But we could control it,” said the health minister. She said there was every chance for a spread and the chief minister has given necessary directions to all the departments to intensify the monitoring at the grassroot level. “The health department has decided to increase the testing and also the vaccination in the coming days. At present, over 40 lakh vaccination has been given in the state,” said Rajan N Khobragade, principal secretary (health). The government has also decided to bring back the cluster containment strategies if any spreading is reported from an area. In fact, the state has been the role model for cluster containment strategies and hence we can curb the spreading, if any, through these measures, he added. All district collectors have been instructed to have extra vigil and report immediately whether there is any spread in cases in a particular area. The collectors have also been asked to impose local-level restrictions if the situation is bad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-decides-to-increase-testing-and-vaccination/articleshow/81957155.cms||---
---||Kochi||Congress expects more seats from southern dists||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The low voter turnout has given some jitters to the Congress camp but they believe that the high polling in the coastal wards and a possible minority consolidation will be an advantage to them. The day after the poll, the Congress think tank was engaged in the analysis. Though the Congress is not expecting a massive victory, they are sure that a comfortable victory is on the cards. The three major factors which they expect will work in favour are Sabarimala, anti-government sentiment in the coastal regions and minority consolidation. “The Congress is going to gain in those districts where we had no or a very little representation in the last election. Kollam, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta and Thrissur will be the districts which are going to give the surprises,’’ said KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran. The Congress analysis is that three or more seats can be expected in Kollam. If only Haripad was with the UDF last time, this time UDF expects to get all the seats other than Mavelikkara and Chengannur. In Pathanamthitta also, they are expecting three seats this time. In Thiruvananthapuram they have made sure of seven seats this time. “We will have an impressive show in the southern districts this time. All these seats are going to be a bonus for us,’’ said Ramachandran. However, Congress is not of the view that the polling percentage is bad for them. “Once we count the postal ballots, which is close to ten lakh this time, another two percent hike can be expected in the total turnout. Hence, we cannot say that the voter turnout was really low,’’ said senior leader V D Satheesan. Congress is not sure about the way the Christian vote bank will swing. Hence, they are not sure about the prospects in Kottayam. If at all the UDF loses more seats in the district, UDF is hoping to cover it up from the seats they bag in the southern districts. “Around 32 constituencies come under the coastal region. The massive anti-government sentiment there will work in favour of the UDF. There is no doubt about it,’’ said Satheesan. UDF has high hopes that the minority consolidation will work in favour this time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/congress-expects-more-seats-from-southern-dists/articleshow/81957156.cms||Rajiv G

As a result, no arrest has been made or action taken yet. The student of class 8 was ‘married’ during lockdown to a 32-year-old man who she said had raped and tortured her for a year. Her elder sister had also been married before she turned an adult. Their mother had died a few years ago and the father is a daily wager. Talking to TOI, sub-divisional magistrate (Pokhari) Vaibhav Gupta said, “An FIR was filed by revenue police on Tuesday but in cases of heinous crimes against women, both the Uttarakhand state government as well as the Supreme Court mandate that normal police take up the investigation and responsibility for the charge-sheet. The revenue police’s FIR includes serious sections like juvenile justice and rape. The transfer to Chamoli police has already been initiated and although revenue police have some powers, it will not be able to tackle the case as normal police would.” The girl meanwhile attended school on Wednesday and wrote her exams. Her teachers said she was hesitant to have a case filed against her father but agreed after the school administration assured her full support. “She and her siblings will certainly face problems after their father is arrested but we have asked her to focus on her studies and exams,” said Upen Sati, the teacher to whom the girl had confided in about her plight and who shared her story in a video that has since gone viral. After Sati’s video was widely circulated, the district administration had sent a Child Welfare Committee (CWC) official to investigate the case on Tuesday.

---||Lucknow||‘Jab safe for patients on blood-thinners’||LUCKNOW: If you are on blood-thinners and unsure about taking vaccine shot against Covid-19, here is some good news for you. The new guidelines of the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) have paved way for inoculation of patients who are on blood-thinners like aspirin and clopidogrel. Blood-thinners are generally given to patients who have suffered a stroke, undergone some heart surgery, have coronary heart disease and other heart-related conditions. Data has shown that people in the age group of 45-59 years, who have comorbid conditions, are grappling with confusion over the issue due to which not many are coming forward for vaccination. Initially, both Serum Institute of India (SII) as well as Bharat Biotech (BB) had categorically mentioned that those suffering from bleeding disorder or people who are blood-thinner should avoid vaccination. However, earlier this year, ICMR altered the fact sheet for both Covishield (SII) and Covaxin (BB) and said those on blood-thinners could also opt for vaccine. As per the revised fact-sheet, those on blood-thinners like as aspirin and clopidogrel can take vaccine and those on anticoagulants can also take the jabs but with certain precautions. Experts at KGMU and SGPGI told TOI that with revised guidelines, the formerly ineligible group can now go ahead with Covid-19 vaccination without much of a worry. “Blood-thinners are of two kinds and both prevent blood clotting. The first is anti-platelets such as aspirin and clopidogrel which are not a problem at all,” ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava said. “The second kind comprises of anticoagulants like heparin for patients whose tendency to bleed is much higher. They face risk of developing swelling at the injection site which is but a relative contraindication. In this case, anticoagulants can be stopped a couple of days prior to vaccination after medical advice,” he added. Head of microbiology department at SGPGI Prof Ujjala Ghoshal said, “Those on blood thinners can take vaccine as no serious contraindications have been recorded in such patients. Patients should, however, seek the advice of their physician prior to vaccination.” Head of KGMU’s microbiology department Prof Amita Jain said, “Not much is known about the vaccine’s reaction in patients with blood clotting disorders. I would advise them to wait for more data to come in. Although, if majority of other people get vaccinated, we will contain the virus from spreading to such patients too.” “Since Covid-19 vaccines being used in India are not live virus based vaccines, there are negligible risks involved. Expert advice for individuals suffering from these diseases should also be taken prior to vaccination,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jab-safe-for-patients-on-blood-thinners/articleshow/81959400.cms||Yusra Husain

Singh had been absconding since the past three days. Revenue police had filed a case against him under section 304-A (causing death by negligence), 306 (abetment of suicide) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Speaking to TOI, station in-charge of Ghansali police station, Kuldeep Shah, said that the youth has been sent to judicial custody. Meanwhile, the district magistrate of Tehri Iva Ashish Srivastava has transferred the case from revenue police to regular police. The orders were issued on Wednesday morning. Tehri police are now planning to seek police custody remand of Singh to know what exactly happened on the fateful night when he along with six other friends had gone on the hunting trip. “We are going to submit an application in the court to seek police custody remand of Rajiv Singh,” Shah said. As reported by TOI earlier, the group of seven youths led by Singh had gone hunting in the forest near their village to hunt wild fowl. Singh was carrying a loaded rifle which accidentally got fired when he slipped and fell. The bullet hit Santosh Panwar, 19, who was walking behind Singh and he died on the spot. Seeing their friend dead, the other youths went into a state of panic. Sub-divisional magistrate of Ghansali PR Chauhan had told TOI a day after the incident, “First, they brought back Santosh’s body from the jungle to a cowshed near their village. They were so stricken with grief and a sense of guilt over the incident that they decided to shoot themselves as well but then changed their plan. Three of them —Arjun Singh, 23, Pankaj Singh, 24, and Soban Singh, 23, consumed pesticide whereas Singh fled from the spot. Two other youths who were part of the group returned to the village and told the rest of the villagers all that had happened.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hunting-trip-gone-wrong-main-accused-surrenders-in-court/articleshow/81956124.cms||Gaurav Talwar

He also said that while the positivity rate has crossed 5%, it is still much lower than other states that are witnessing a surge too. “For the last three weeks, Delhi has seen a surge. It used to be lower than 200-300 cases earlier, but now it is more than 5,000. Delhi government is increasing the number of Covid beds in the hospitals,” he said. While 2,098 beds have been added in the last three days, 2,000-2,500 more beds will be increased in the next two to three days, he added. “Going by the pace of the spread, it seems that Covid-19 cases could cross the old record. The positivity rate is above 5% in Delhi, 25% in Maharashtra, 16% in Chhattisgarh and 10% in many other states. We are monitoring the situation very seriously in Delhi,” he said at a press conference. Jain said that night curfew has been imposed between 10pm and 5am because there were reports about parties, which cause unnecessary gatherings. “The night curfew is aimed to avoid this situation because if even one person is positive among 50 people, all 50 test positive,” he said. “We cannot impose night curfew in certain parts, it has to be applied to all of Delhi. However, it has been done for the time being. We will analyse the impact. It is not a harsh decision, it will start from 10 pm in the night and people generally finish their work by then,” he said. When asked about an IPL match scheduled to be held on April 29 in Delhi, Jain said “We are concentrating on the state of Covid-19 now.” “I believe that the condition of the virus is not mellow, so we have to be aware and careful. People talk in extremes, either they are in favour of a complete lockdown or none at all. There has to be a middle ground as well,” Jain said, adding that teething troubles in issuing e-passes will be sorted out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2500-more-covid-beds-to-be-added-in-couple-of-days-jain/articleshow/81958143.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The PIL raises important concerns, said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, with the latter citing how his wheelchair-bound father could not go for vaccination. The CJ said when he had suggested to the BMC chief to turn the HC medical room as a vaccination centre for lawyers and HC staff aged over 45, he said it was not possible as ICUs are required. “Where is the literature for what the BMC chief said for ICU being a must?” the HC asked.

Highest incidents were reported from Garhwal (60), Kumaon (10) and wildlife areas (5) wherein, 81 ha, 8.47 ha and 3.55 ha forest land, respectively, were destroyed. The persistent hazy atmosphere is also causing health issues for the elderlies. Even as the fear of forest fires after brief spells of rain and snow continue to loom in the minds of forest officials, they are now "multiplying their firefighting efforts". Meanwhile, the exercise to nab culprits and lodge cases against those involved in causing forest fires or even uncontrolled burning in their farms continued on Wednesday. An FIR was registered against a Nainital youth on Wednesday for "causing damage to the forests". “A 23-year-old man has been charged under section 26 of Indian Forest Act, 1927, for causing fires in Bhowali motorway of Nainital on Wednesday.

A survey conducted by LocalCircles, country’s leading social media platform, indicated 36% drop in vaccine hesitancy in the last 45 days. The percentage of citizens willing to take the jab went up from 38 at the end of second week of January, 2021, to 40 in the third week. It then rose to 42 in the first week of February and 50 in the second week, followed by 64 in the third week, and is at 77 this week (till April 1). The data till April 1 indicates that the vaccine hesitancy has reduced among the citizens considerably,” says Sachin Taparia, CEO of LocalCircles. The country is now recording over 90,000 cases daily, a peak it had touched in September, 2020. Notably, the kind of rapid surge experienced in India — with daily cases increasing from 16,000 to over 90,000 in 2 weeks — also hints at different strains of the virus may be virulent than the 2020’s SARS-COV2. The survey received over 27,000 responses from citizens located in 299 districts. The last LocalCircles vaccine hesitancy survey conducted on March 1, 2021, indicated that 36% of citizens were hesitating to take Covid-19 vaccine immediately. As more people started to take the jab, including the Prime Minister and other state leaders, the hesitancy continued to decline. The decline was accelerated further after India started seeing a surge of Covid cases starting mid-March with the caseload rising from 16,000 on March 14, 2021, to over 90,000 per day now. This week, only 23% of the respondents were reluctant to take the jab. The survey also revealed that 52% citizens who took the jab did not face any side-effects. People inoculated with vaccines can face mild to moderate side-effects like fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, diarrhoea, and pain at the injection site, say experts. During the survey, people were asked about their vaccine preferences. Taparia says Covaxin currently has slight edge over Covishield. Though citizens aren’t given an option to choose from either Covaxin or Covishield, LocalCircles observed people seeking information about where they could get a particular type of vaccine. “We asked citizens about their preference of vaccine. In response, 25% citizens chose Covishield, and 33% favoured Covaxin. Also, 75% citizens supported opening of vaccination for 18-45 age group in after-hours at private hospitals and labs, for a slightly higher charge, so that regular vaccination drive is not disrupted,” he said.

They stole the money and returned to the servant quarter where Brajmohan was present. “Brajmohan asked the miscreants to tie him and leave him in the room. He later demanded a lion’s share, which his nephew Bahadur and others refused to part with. Later, Bahadur along with the others strangled him to death using an electric wire and slit his throat,” added Abidi.

It is the first geography lab set up in the district under the General Education Protection Mission (Pothuvidyabhyasa Samrakshana Yajnam) The lab features nearly 35 equipment, which would be useful in explaining various concepts in geography. Most equipment are working models on solar system, day and night, lunar phases, globes, rotation and revolution of earth, etc. The lab was inaugurated by Samagra Shiksha Kerala (SSK) district project officer Usha Manattu at a function presided over by school principal P Geetha and attended by headmistress Jolly Sebastian. “The analysis of SSLC results has found that geography is a difficult subject for many students. Learning geography involves a lot of practical knowledge for the students to observe and learn concepts and facts easily. The new lab will facilitate an easy learning of the subject and enhance the comprehension of students,” said Manattu. The lab, set up by SSK, Ernakulam, will benefit students of high school and upper primary sections. It was set up at a cost of Rs 30,000. Around 35 geography teachers in various schools in the 14 sub-districts in Ernakulam were given training by resource person Abdul Shukkoor. “The first geography lab was set up in Malappuram. More labs will be set up in all schools as part of the project. We hope to use the lab efficiently to make the teaching process seamless,” said Geetha. Training was also given to the teachers in creating the learning equipment and working models. Those teachers will be setting up their own labs in the respective schools in the next academic year. SSK plans to set up a social science hub in the district by gathering resource materials available in various subjects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ekms-first-geography-lab-set-up-at-vennala/articleshow/81957195.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Urvi halfway through last leg of E-W Metro tunnelling||Kolkata: Tunnel borer Urvi has now completed half of its journey towards building the final 800m west-bound tunnel of the East-West Metro. On Tuesday, the tunnel boring machine (TBM) crossed the 400m mark and had covered 425m at the end of the day, having made 283 rings in the bargain. TBM S-616, nicknamed Urvi, is currently burrowing the last 800m of the East-West Metro tunnelling. Its final assignment involves building 553 tunnel rings. On Wednesday it finished making 287 rings and had covered 430m from the Sealdah Metro station. It is now 35m from the Bank of India building on BB Ganguly Street. Engineers of Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), implementing agency of the 16km Line 2, hoped the TBM would cross Bank of India in the next few days and complete its job by mid-May. On January 4, Urvi, started its journey from below Sealdah station to bridge the last 800m gap of the westward tunnel. It had to take a month’s break on January 27 to create space to shove its own 75m length inside. Only the main 9m of the machine — comprising cutter-head, front and middle bodies and tailskin — can be lowered below the ground at the initial stage. The rest — “backup gantry” — were added to prepare for the “main” drive. From March 1, tunnelling resumed and the “main” drive started. On October 9 last year, Urvi dug the east-bound tunnel till Sealdah station. It then started filling the last section of the west-bound tunnel that TBM Chundi had left incomplete after hitting an aquifer at Bowbazar on August 31, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/urvi-halfway-through-last-leg-of-e-w-metro-tunnelling/articleshow/81957204.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Several districts, including Mumbai, prepared to slow down the drive on Thursday. Gondia could not give shots on Wednesday, while Amravati division, also in Vidarbha, reduced the numbers. Civic officials said at least 50 private hospitals in Mumbai reported stockouts on Wednesday. By evening, many registered beneficiaries had started getting alerts that their vaccination appointment had been cancelled. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani confirmed that over 20% of the 120 vaccination centres may not operate. Even with 25,000 Covishield and 37,000 Covaxin doses arriving late on Wednesday, Mumbai will be able to sustain the drive only for 1.5 days. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has sought 40 lakh vaccine doses per week to meet the desired target of vaccinating nearly 6 lakh people every day. The state was currently vaccinating 4.5 lakh people every day and so a stock of 12-13lakh doses will last for three days. “We have accepted the challenge that Union minister Prakash Javdekar had given to us: to scale up testing and vaccinating 6 lakh people a day. But the Centre should now match their supply pace to our vaccination speed,” said Tope. Ironically, the vaccination slowdown has come on a day Mumbai clocked its highest single day coverage of 61,896 vaccinations. On Wednesday evening, Panvel corporation issued a notice saying the vaccination drive has been stopped for now. Gondia district in Vidarbha region couldn’t carry out any inoculation as they had just 20 doses in the kitty. The district vaccinates at least 5,000 daily. Officials from Amravati division that includes Yavatmal, Akola, Buldhana and Washim districts said they had to reduce the number of vaccination centres due to the shortage. Nagpur rural too was left with stocks only for a day. Tope confirmed many vaccination centres in the state had to shut due to lack of the vaccine. “There is an increased demand for Covaxin, but that too is inadequate,” said Tope. “Most of those infected now are in the age group of 25 to 40 years and the Centre should universalise vaccination, especially in Maharashtra,” he added. Principal health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said the state was provided 1.02crore doses, of which over 90 lakh have been used. The wastage at 3% in the state was half of the national average. “Every day we are vaccinating 4.6lakh, which can be stretched to 6lakh but since doses are not available, we are unable to ramp up,” he said, adding that Maharashtra has administered 85.64lakh doses, the highest in the country. With stocks running out, there is panic on the ground. Mumbai’s central vaccine depot in Parel’s F-south ward office was left with zero vials on Wednesday. Kakani said the norm is to have at least seven days’ stock for such a mammoth drive. Another civic official said centres that have stocked-out will not have a drive, while those with some stocks will take appointments accordingly. “We are trying to mobilise stocks for some of the big public vaccination centres in order to avoid chaos,” the official said. Among private hospitals, L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, has said they had stocks only for two days. “If supply of vaccine is not done by government on time, we may have to send people back on Friday,” said the hospital spokesperson. Dr Santosh Shetty, CEO of Kokilaben Hospital, said they had less than a day’s stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/have-stocks-for-only-3-4-days-says-maha/articleshow/81960224.cms||Bhavika Jain

The train is scheduled to be virtually flagged off by railway minister Piyush Goyal from New Delhi while Godda MP Nishikant Dubey is due to attend the ceremony in Godda in person. Chief minister Hemant Soren is also expected to join the ceremony online from Ranchi. Malda division’s response to Yadav’s letter was not known till the time of filing the report. Dubey accused the state government of trying to halt the event deliberately. “The flagging-off will take place under any circumstances,” Dubey said. Accusing Soren of contacting the railway minister and trying to shelve the event, Dubey said JMM and its allies did not want Godda’s people to savour the moment. “This is the first time since Independence that a train will chug off from Godda. The chief minister and his father (Shibu Soren) will camp in Madhupur from April 9 and flout all Covid guidelines. What about that?” Dubey asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/godda-dc-asks-rlys-to-scrap-humsafar-exp-flag-off-event/articleshow/81956759.cms||---

At the detention camp, detainees will be put through Covid-19 tests. Dhanbad deputy commissioner Uma Shankar Singh said, “We are forced to take this step as people are not adhering to the Covid guidelines at markets and other public places.” The detention camp has been set up at the JAP-3 camp at Govindpur. Three teams of flying squads have been constituted for the purpose and members of this team will keep moving from 8am to 12pm along with bus and police force on different routes and detain all those found without masks and not maintaining social distance in public places. “A medical team along with an ambulance, necessary medicines and testing facilities will be stationed at the camp. Those detained will be made aware of the side-effects of the virus through audio-video messages and will be released from the camp at 4pm if test reports are negative. Those found positive will be transferred directly to the Covid Care Centres,” Singh said. Meanwhile, Dhanbad SDO Surendra Kumar and Dy SP (law and order) Sarita Murmu launched a mask-checking campaign in Hirapur locality of Dhanbad and warned people not to venture out without masks. The officials also directed shopkeepers not to entertain customers without masks. In yet another development, all gym operators of Dhanbad submitted a memorandum to the Dhanbad deputy commissioner to allow gyms to run with 50% capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/daylong-detention-covid-test-for-people-flouting-norms-in-dhanbad/articleshow/81956823.cms||---
---||Ranchi||‘Shops are soft targets, veggie markets should be under govt radar’||RANCHI: A day after the state government ordered the closure of shops, restaurants and clubs after 8 pm until further orders, the business community in Ranchi on Wednesday claimed that the authorities have set their sights on the soft targets and had no plans to reign in the crowd at vegetable markets. “We are on the same page with the government in its fight against the pandemic. But is closing shops at 8 pm the only solution? Is there any plan to control the crowd at the vegetable markets?” FJCCI president Pravin Kumar Jain (Chabra) told TOI. The small-time traders are miffed since their sales during evening but with the new rules in place, they are staring at losses. “Most of the business happens in the evenings as customers stay indoors due to the afternoon heat. So, there is practically three hours for business now with new rules,” Roshan Agarwal, an Upper Bazar-based apparel store owner, said. Dheeraj Taneja, a city-based businessman and FJCCI’s vice president, said: “It will be effective if the curbs are put in place during the weekends. The government can also take the example of Chhattisgarh and initiate a lockdown like it was announced in Raipur,” he said. Traders are also miffed with the administration’s directive to get the workers of the commercial establishments tested. “We are ready to get our employees tested but what is the use of it? The reports are not being delivered on time as there a backlogs of thousands of samples in the government-run testing facilities,” claimed another city-based businessman. The Jharkhand Rajya Khudra Sharaab Vikreta Sangh, the umbrella organization for licensed retail liquor sellers in the state, wrote to excise secretary Vinay Kumar Choubey, seeking exemptions in taxes citing that new orders to close at 8 pm will hurt them financially. Meanwhile, the new orders will be effective from Thursday, Ranchi deputy commissioner Chavi Ranjan said while speaking to reporters after a meeting. “Besides the main roads, there will be patrolling in by-lanes and back alleys of the city to ensure that people comply with the directives,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/shops-are-soft-targets-veggie-markets-should-be-under-govt-radar/articleshow/81957040.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Steel City traders seek closure time extension by an hour||JAMSHEDPUR: Steel City traders have welcomed the state government’s decision to shut business establishments after 8pm, saying that it will be effective in crowd management amid rising cases of Covid-19. Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) general secretary Vijay Anand Moonka said his organisation is rallying behind the decision. “However, traders will get some relief if they are allowed to keep their establishments open till 9pm,” Moonka added. Jamshedpur Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) president Mohanlal Agarwal said human lives are more important than business. “The traders will incur some losses, but they have to stay fit and keep the virus at bay too,” Agarwal said. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said the second wave has made the traders apprehensive. “If the Covid-19 scenario deteriorates, then the government might initiate stricter curbs. With Ramnavami around the corner and the marriage season scheduled to start later this month, traders across the board are hoping that the situation would come under control soon,” CAIT national secretary Suresh Sonthalia said. Small-time traders, however, were a miffed lot. “Shorter business hours will hit sales. This will hurt GST collections and the officials will keep hounding us,” a garment store owner in Bistupur said. Shopkeepers were also apprehensive about penalties. A mobile store owner in Sakchi was penalised last year for failing to maintain social distancing among customers in his store. “We can only request them to follow the guidelines. But the administration holds us responsible, which is unfair,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/steel-city-traders-seek-closure-time-extension-by-an-hour/articleshow/81956730.cms||---

Mahto, a civilian, lost his leg in the incident. The advisory was issued in March but Gumla police learnt about it last week. Chainpur sub-divisional police officer Siril Marandi said, “The Maoists did not issue any missive or put up posters to drive home their point, but the locals confessed that they were advised not to enter the forests.” The villagers usually venture into the forests to collect firewood and mahua. Police sources said the Maoists have advised the locals to avoid setting fire to forest patches for collecting mahua, which is common at this time of the year. Marandi said while reconnaissance is underway to identify the location of the IEDs and defuse them, locals are picking mahua from the roadsides. “The Maoists are terrorizing the locals so that no one shares any information with the cops,” he added. The district police, through its intelligence network, recently learnt that the ultras have rigged the forest corridor between Sokrahatu-Sivil-Rored village with IEDs. On February 25, a jawan from the CRPF’s 218 battalion was critically injured in an explosion during a search operation near Rored village. Duleshwar Prass, a constable from Small Action Team posted in Lohardaga, lost a leg during a joint search operation of the CRPF and Jharkhand Police on February 16. Prass succumbed to his injuries in hospital the same day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/reds-stay-off-ied-rigged-gumla-forests/articleshow/81957078.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Of the 6,844 active cases in Jharkhand on Tuesday night, Ranchi accounted for more than 53% (3,665). The state capital is witnessing a massive surge in Covid, reporting a positivity rate as high as that in Mumbai, which is getting close to 9,000 new cases a day. In the first six days of this month, a total of 15,952 samples were tested in Ranchi, of which 2,763 returned a positive result. While Jharkhand reported 5.28% positivity rate in the last six days, the same for Ranchi shot up to 18%, the highest among all 24 districts in the state. During the peak of infection between August-September last year, Ranchi’s positivity rate stood between 10-12%. The state capital has so far reported 38,233 Covid cases, of which 34,298 recoveries, 3,264 active cases and 272 deaths. On Tuesday, TOI found that the state health department’s claim on the number of beds at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) does not match with the figures provided by the hospital. In a statement issued by the health department on Tuesday, it was claimed that Rims has a total of 478 beds for Covid-19 patients, including 252 normal beds, 90 oxygen-supported beds, 88 ICU beds and 48 ventilator beds. However, Rims PRO Dr D K Sinha said, “Currently we have a total of 88 normal beds, 47 oxygen-supported beds, 45 ventilator beds which will be increased to 100 normal beds and 107 oxygen-supported beds by today (Wednesday) evening. We will also increase the ventilator beds, but will need time to purchase them.” At sadar hospital, while there are 182 beds on paper, only 122 are functional as the hospital is not being able to operate 60 ventilator beds due to lack of specialist doctors. Central Hospital of Coal India Limited has a capacity of 60 beds and all were found to be occupied on Wednesday. As per the health department records, a total of 710 beds have been created for asymptomatic patients at Khelgaon. However, Ranchi civil surgeon Dr V B Prasad said, “There are no takers as people prefer to be in home isolation if they are asymptomatic.” Meanwhile, leading private hospitals in the city said their Covid-19 wards are running on full occupancy. Private hospitals, including Medica, Orchid, Samford, Raj, Maa Ram Pyaari, Medanta, Sentevita and Seva Sadan didn’t have beds for any new Covid patient. “We have a 50-bedded dedicated Covid-19 ward and all beds are occupied. We are flooded with requests for admission and we are admitting fresh patients only when someone is getting discharged,” said Anand Srivastava, advisor to Medica group of hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/positivity-rate-higher-than-mum-ranchi-in-grip-of-bed-crisis/articleshow/81956990.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The PDKV executive committee headed by vice-chancellor Dr VM Bhale cleared the proposal forwarded by Dr DM Panchbhai, zoo controller & associate dean of College of Agriculture, Nagpur. Bhale confirmed that the council recently passed a resolution and it will help the 127-year-old zoo to tide over the financial crisis and push for its stagnant development. “We have been told that such foundations exist for zoos in Lucknow, Bhilai and Jamshedpur and their expenses are met from the foundation,” says Panchbhai. Bhale said, “We don’t get any special grants from the state government or from the Central agencies for the development of the zoo. All its requirements are fulfilled from the gate fee.” Executive member and MLC Gopikisan Bajoria said, “The zoo was established in 1894 and it needs a complete revamp as per the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) rules and regulations. By setting up a foundation, we can get funds from both central as well as the state governments. We will also be able to accept donations under 80CC.” Zoo officer-in-charge Dr SS Bawaskar says, “We are finalizing the by-laws for the foundation. We will soon put up a proposal with the PDKV to establish a governing council and executive council which will look after the zoo affairs. The councils will have divisional commissioner and district collector in it along with local public representatives and others.” The CZA has already sanctioned the layout plan of Maharajbagh in 2020. However, due to lack of funds, the plan is not being brought into shape. During Covid-19 times, the zoo woes have multiplied with no income and expenses remaining the same. There is no money to pay wages to several daily wagers working for the upkeep of animals and the zoo. Dr Bawaskar said, “The CZA shares 50% of the cost of primary works of enclosures for Schedule-I & II animals and 30% for tertiary development works. Some of the recurring expenses can be met from zoo income and PDKV funds.” THE PLAN * Detailed project report includes Rs 85 crore development plan * To be implemented in five years phase-wise * Another Rs 22 crore needed for recurring expenses HOW MONEY WILL BE SPENT Rs 23 crore | new cages and enclosures of carnivores and herbivores Rs 17 crore | for beautification and landscaping works like hedges, lawns, watering system, garden development Rs 27 crore | for security towers, water conservation, furniture, incinerator, fire system, parking, area development, entrance, drainage system etc Rs 14 crore | for compound wall, shops, ticket counters, amphitheatre, administrative building, staff quarters, amenities, hospitals, post-mortem room etc||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/zoo-sets-up-foundation-takes-1st-step-towards-autonomy/articleshow/81958269.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The notice comes after Serum Institute delayed shipment of vaccines to the UK, and later did not meet its obligations to other countries that are part of the Covax programme. Serum Institute has attributed the delay to the Centre’s decision to halt vaccine exports, while its CEO, Adar Poonawalla, according to media reports, said SII would prioritise domestic needs temporarily. In mid-March, the Centre decided to go slow on vaccine exports amidst a huge surge in Covid-19 cases. Demand for vaccines has also jumped after the government broadened its immunisation drive, relaxing the eligibility criteria for the 45-years-plus age group from April 1. A majority of vaccines being administered in India are Covishield (manufactured by SII); the remainder are Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. Serum has so far supplied around 100 million doses to the Centre, while it has exported 60 million doses.

The deceased have been identified as Rakesh Yuvraj Madavi (40), Rekhchand Gopichand Rane (45) and Sachin Ashok Shrirange (27). The injured, Vijay Tijab Maraskolhe (40) and Raju Shamrao Sayam (30) have been admitted to a private hospital at Nagpur. As these workers were temporary labourers, there is no provision of compensation to them as per rules. However, taking serious note of the issue, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who also holds the forest ministry, has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh each to the next kin of the victims. The expenses of treatment of the injured labourers will also be borne by the state government. Nilesh Gawande, general secretary of the Forest Rangers Association Maharashtra (FRAM) has also announced an ex-gratia of Rs 1 lakh each to the kin of victims, and Rs 50,000 to the family of the injured. According to NNTR field director and conservator of forest M Ramanujam, the fire was noticed in compartment numbers 97, 98, 99, & 100 under Nagzira and Pitezari forest ranges. Over 70 forest workers and employees were engaged in fighting the fires. “By evening the fire was mostly brought under control, but due to strong winds it again spread and the labourers who were atop a small hill got trapped and couldn’t escape even as they tried hard to douse the surface fires with the help of blowers,” said Ramanujam. NNTR and its buffer zone has always been vulnerable to fires owing to tremendous pressure from mahua collectors and tendu traders. Two days ago, in a similar incident, a van majoor was injured while fighting fire on Khairi-Pitezari road. The victim is undergoing treatment at a rural hospital. After learning about the tragedy, Thadezari villagers vent their ire on the forest staff and are said to have manhandled a forest guard. The mob also damaged a forest vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-van-majoors-charred-in-nagzira-forest-fire-cm-announces-rs-5-lakh-to-kin-of-deceased/articleshow/81985430.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The vaccination drive is likely to be withheld till next week when fresh vaccine stock is likely to be delivered, but officials were unsure of the date of delivery. Vaccination drive in Chandrapur had begun on January 16, with 1.48 lakh beneficiaries including frontline workers taking the jab till Wednesday. They include 51,790 persons who have taken both the doses of vaccine. As far as vaccination of common people is concerned, 77,310 senior citizens have received the first dose while 536 have taken the second dose. Also 19,169 citizens with comorbidiites have taken the first dose while 109 have taken the second dose. Around 6,000-8,000 persons are vaccinated per day at the 98 centres. The health department had to close down 33 centres on Thursday following the shortage of vaccine. Only 65 vaccination centers were operational during the day and around 4,800 persons were vaccinated. Many of these centers pulled down their shutters midway after exhausting their vaccine stock. “All the vaccination centres, except two where Covaxin is being given, will be closed from Friday. We have sought 1.30 lakh doses from the government. However, delivery is not likely to come till next week,” civil surgeon Dr Nivrutti Rathod told TOI. In Chandrapur city, six out of eight vaccination centres went out of stock on Thursday. “We have 3,600 doses of Covaxin. Hence, centres at Chandrapur Government Medical College and Hospital and at WCL area hospital at Lalpeth will remain operational till the stock of Covaxin is there,” said Dr Avishkar Kahndre, chief medical officer of Chandrapur Municipal Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-2-vax-centres-open-in-chanda-after-covishield-stock-exhausted/articleshow/81972321.cms||---

The petition sought to remove the facts that “glorify” the Mughals and sought a ban on printing and publishing a substantive part of the history book. The court ordered the respondents to appear either on their own or through their advocate and present their replies, along with documents, by April 19. PC Bhandari has filed a petition against the joint secretary, ministry of education, New Delhi, and director, NCERT, in a civil court in Jaipur, saying Page No. 234 of the Class XII history book “Themes in Indian History Part-2” states that Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb issued grants to repair temples that were demolished during wars. When the petitioner moved the RTI, he was informed that there was no proof to substantiate the printed matter. Bhandari then approached the court seeking the removal of the disputed part from the book. But even two months after receiving the notice, the facts were not removed from the book, said the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/court-notice-to-ncert-edu-min-for-glorification-of-mughals/articleshow/81960936.cms||---

---||Goa||In 2 years, PWD has received nearly 2k complaints of no water supply||Panaji: Over the last two years, between March 2019 and March 2021, itself, the Public Works Department (PWD) has received close to 2,000 complaints, 1,924 to be precise, over unavailability of water supply. The worst affected were Bardez and Pernem talukas from where 560 and 505 complaints were received, respectively, PWD records show. A large part of Pernem taluka falls on the tail-end of the supply chain with only one water treatment plant at Chandel catering to the entire taluka. The shortage has been worsening over the years as the taluka’s coastal belt is seeing an increase in tourists. The situation turns grave every summer, with people left to depend almost entirely on water tankers. Of the 505 complaints received from Pernem taluka, 349 were from Pernem constituency area and 159 from Mandrem constituency area, as per PWD records. Records show that from inland areas like Porascadem, Parsem, Tuem to coastal stretches of Keri, Arambol, Morjim, nearly the entire taluka faced lack of water supply at least once during the last two years. The taluka has been awaiting the new water treatment plant planned at Tuem. In Bardez, of the 560 complaints received, 392 were from the Calangute, Porvorim and Saligao areas. The remaining 168 complaints were received from Mapusa town and surrounding areas of Tivim, Duler, Khorlim, Karaswada and Cunchelim. Calangute also falls on the tail-end of the supply network from the Assonora water treatment plant, which caters to the entire taluka. The chief minister in his budget speech has promised completion of the new water treatment plant at Porvorim this year, which is expected to ease Bardez’s woes. Mormugao with 266 complaints and Valpoi with 256 complaints were the other worst affected talukas after Pernem and Bardez. Breakdown in pipeline network, blockages, work of replacement of old pipelines with new ones are among the reasons stated in the PWD records for break in the water supply. Another 177 complaints from Bicholim taluka, 136 from Salcete taluka, 15 from Quepem, 3 from Dharbandora taluka and two from Canacona taluka were also received from March 2019 onwards. In Canacona too, water is supplied by tankers every summer .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-2-years-pwd-has-received-nearly-2k-complaints-of-no-water-supply/articleshow/81958838.cms||---

The incident, caught on CCTV camera, shows a car pulling up in the middle of a road with its left indicator blinking and a bunch of men swiftly surrounding it. The car then speeds away, almost hitting two cops of the special operation group. Senior police officers, caught off guard by Tuesday’s incident, have ordered an inquiry. Shamli SP Sukriti Madhav said, “We are trying to verify if the firing was intentional or not.” It is 100% the fault of police, says BJP neta Looking at the video, we can see the car has tinted windows, making it difficult to see who is sitting inside. The vehicle speeds off. That must have prompted the cops to open fire. But all these things are a matter of investigation,” Shamli SP Sukriti Madhav said. BJP district president Satyender Tomar said, “The video exhibits very clearly that it is 100% the fault of police. We have registered our protest with the police brass. They have asked for two days to bring out the truth and take action against the culprits.” The BJP member, Ashwin Panwar, 41, said that had he not fled, the cops would have killed him. He alleged that his political rival and former SP MLA Ratan Pal was behind the attack. Pal’s daughter Deepa Pawar refuted the allegations.

---||Goa||‘FIR in Melauli protest case can’t be withdrawn’||PANAJI:The state government has informed the high court of Bombay at Goa that the FIR filed against the anti-IIT protesters at Melauli in Sattari over a violent protest cannot be withdrawn. Additional government advocate Pravin Faldessai told the high court that he is of the opinion that the prosecution cannot be withdrawn by the government as weapons were used in the agitation. He said that “though the people have a right to agitate such a right does not extend to using deadly weapons, particularly against police officials or any other persons”. He submitted that if any of the individual petitioners are found not involved, relief can be considered, but added that it would not be appropriate to either withdraw the prosecution in its entirety or to quash the FIR. The case is being heard by the division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar. Some villagers had approached the high court seeking quashing of the FIR against them as the government had cancelled Melauli as the site for IIT after a violent protest. The court granted the petitioners “liberty to apply for interim reliefs should the occasion therefor arises”. TOI had reported in February that a district court while granting anticipatory bail to anti-IIT protestors at Melauli in Sattari against whom FIRs were filed stated that although attempt to murder has been applied by police, it was not spelt out whom the protesters wanted to murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fir-in-melauli-protest-case-cant-be-withdrawn/articleshow/81958886.cms||---
