As if being stuck at home, struggling with online classes and being stripped of peer company was not enough, they are now contracting the virus, or watching their friends, siblings and parents suffer as well. Parents are naturally worried about what to do if one of them or both test positive. The answer is - “Do not panic,” as actress Sameera Reddy explained on her Insta handle. She wrote that after her children Hans, 5 and Nyra, 2, tested positive, she and her husband, Akshai Varde, also started showing symptoms and are currently under home quarantine. The actress shared that while she panicked at first, she realised the need of the hour was to stay calm and handle the situation smartly. Closer home, actress Subhashree Ganguly (picture above) tested COVID positive on Tuesday and is in home quarantine. Her son is just seven months old and as children of this age need their mothers most, Subhashree is having a tough time dealing with the situation. “My heart breaks when I see Yuvaan playing in his room and I can’t take him in my arms and cuddle him. He is too young to be without his mother. But as per COVID protocols, I have to be in isolation. Even my husband (Raj Chakrabarty) is not in town and I am feeling helpless. My son has nannies to take care of him and I am constantly over the phone instructing them what to do for Yuvaan. That apart, there is a camera in his room. So, I am well aware of what Yuvaan is doing. My son is very intelligent. Now, whenever he sees me on a video call, he is all smiles,” said Subhashree. Communication a must when children are at home with sick parentsActress Jayasree Mukherjee (picture below) who tested positive along with her husband and mother-in-law had to stay away from her four-and-a-half-year old daughter, Aarya, for 14 days during the first half of April. It was emotionally draining for her but she made sure she kept engaging with her child. “I used to cry every day. As a mother, it is heartbreaking, because she is still a kid who needs my attention. During that period, my daughter was with my domestic help. To keep her in a cheerful mood, my husband and I used to enact something and she used to be our audience sitting outside the room. We used to play antakshari the same way. Though I was in isolation I made sure my daughter ate and slept well. I used to tell her that her father and I had fever and she shouldn’t worry,” said Jayasree. Create a positive environment for kids if they are down with COVIDThe challenge is manifold when the child too is Covid positive along with the caregiver. Singer-designer Paroma Banerjee (picture below), who tested positive along with her two sons and husband, says, “The only way to sail through this is by remaining positive. The more parents panic, your children will get disturbed. At first, when my two sons, Nishaad, 17, and Loy, 13, tested positive, both my husband and I were shaken. But slowly, I started telling them that it is a kind of flu, which is not life-threatening and we need not panic. It’s just that we can’t go out and need to be in isolation. I am trying to make the quarantine period happy for them by going through old albums, listening to songs, watching films and eating good and healthy food,” said Paroma. Her approach is similar to Kolkata-based businesswoman Arpita Saha. She found herself in a mess when everyone in her family —her mother-in-law, husband, and nine-year-old daughter, Aaratrika — tested COVID positive. “Adults can self-isolate and can deal with health issues but the challenge was to keep my kid in quarantine for two weeks. Though my daughter had hardly any symptoms, I still couldn’t allow her to go out or let her friends come home to play. I was a little worried when my daughter tested positive but then her school teacher told me not to panic and create a positive environment for her, as there is also a deep-rooted fear of COVID among children. I must admit the way her school teachers supported her is unbelievable.” Support from teachers means a lot to children Schools play an important role when a child tests positive. “Children need empathy and a positive attitude from the teachers to sail through this tough time. Whenever parents inform us of such cases, our teachers extend help. Health is more important than studies in such a situation. We insist that children take leave and join online classes whenever they feel fit. The deadline of projects given to them is extended, so they need not panic,” said Dalbir Kaur Chadda, principal, South Point School. Grandparents can step in when parents are down with COVIDAccording to Anju Chirimar, a student counselor, children getting the attention and care of their grandparents is a blessing, especially when both parents are down with COVID. “Children who have grandparents are blessed. When our kids are sick, they need that personal touch from caregivers which could be parents or grandparents. Of late, anxiety disorder is a common problem among children because of the uncertainties all around. Parents can help them calm down by creating a positive atmosphere. The mental health of a child is very important in these trying times,” explained Anju. What parents can do when COVID strikes1) Be more supportive in every possible way. 2) Regular monitoring of the mental health of your children is important. 3) Keep an eye on the activities of your children, especially if they are adolescents. Their use of the internet has to be monitored. 4) Try to not discuss how many people got affected by the virus in front of your kid. 5) Create a positive atmosphere at home by discussing things your kid enjoys most.  — Soumya Mukherjee, psychologist 'Communicate, get them tested, inculcate healthy habits'1) These days, kids are suffering from stranger anxiety, as they don’t get to see too many people other than their parents and domestic help at home. As a result, they are suffering from inappropriate social responses. So, as parents, you should spend quality time with your children. Remember, communication is very important. 2) Teach your child the benefits of a healthy lifestyle and make them aware of hygiene. Teach them what bad and good habits are and follow them so that they learn from you. 3) Talk to your child over a video call as many times as possible if you are infected by the virus. That will make him/her miss you less. 4) Children are often fast spreaders. Get your child tested before sending them to their grandparents' house when in crisis.  — Amlan Chaudhury, pediatrician||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/how-to-care-for-your-children-when-covid-comes-home/articleshow/82216678.cms||Ruman Ganguly
---||India||‘We, as a collegium, failed to appoint women judges to SC’: CJI Sharad Bobde||NAGPUR: Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde, who demitted office on Friday after a 17-month tenure, said in an exclusive interview to TOI on Friday that freedom of speech was the most abused right at present. He did not elaborate. He also said that like any other judicial instrument, public interest litigation was open to misuse. CJI Bobde was frank enough to admit there was not much progress on having more women judges in the apex court during his tenure. He underlined the need for a better gender balance but stopped short of calling for incentives in the appointment process for the same. He saw online hearing of cases as a positive that improved access to the courts for everybody. “I think the advantages far outweigh the drawbacks. A litigant from any part of the country can be heard through an online proceeding…,” he said. Here's the full interview-Q. What changes have you brought to the judiciary in your tenure? A. The introduction of the artificial intelligence programme SUPACE (SC Portal for Assistance in Court’s Efficiency), shifting proceedings to virtual courts, and the introduction of SUVAS (SC Vidhik Anuvaad Software) app that can be used for translation of Supreme Court judgments into nine vernacular languages. I also laid a lot of emphasis on minimizing the use of paper in order to make the court’s functioning more environmentally conscious. Q. You recently observed that a woman should ascend to the post of CJI. What was the thought behind that? A. We believe it’s time that not only more woman judges are appointed, but also for a woman CJI. We have also held collegium meetings in which names of women were considered as possible candidates for the SC, but those didn’t result in any appointment. We failed as a collegium on this aspect. Q. When taking over as CJI, you had said your priority would be to reduce pendency. Do you think you have been successful? A. The listing and rate of disposal of cases dropped so low due to the Covid pandemic last year that it was not possible to do that. We had asked the bar for consent for physical hearings and only a few members consented to it. Q. Do you think collegium’s decisions on judges’ appointment should be detailed ones and not mere recommendations?A. I don’t think so. As a lot of opinions about a candidate would otherwise find their way into the decision and might unnecessarily mar his/her reputation, as has happened in some cases in the past. Q. Don’t you think collegium should divulge details about transfer of judges?A. No, I don’t think so. Q. Please elaborate on steps taken by you to fill up vacancies in the high courts in your tenure.A. In my tenure 111 judges were appointed to various HCs. Also, we have recently passed two very important judgments that address the way the vacancy in the HCs can be filled in an effective and expeditious manner. We issued guidelines for the invocation of Article 224A for appointment of retired (HC) judges to the high courts, in the case Lok Prahari versus Union of India, to reduce the pendency of cases. Q. What’s your say on criticism of judges and judgments on social media?A. Social media should have the same standards as the print media. They can’t be making derogatory remarks or statements aimed at maligning the reputation of judges. One change I would like to see is that off the cuff answers, exploratory remarks made by judges about the case should not be reported as views of the judge. Q. You once remarked that the Ayodhya verdict was historic. Do you think it was the biggest case handled by the bench, including you?A. Possibly. It was the first time that the Constitution bench sat for five straight days in a week to hear the matter. The hearing lasted 40 days and more than a few thousand documents were part of the record. These documents had to be translated into English from Urdu, Persian and Sanskrit. Q. You once said the Supreme Court would have a five-judge permanent bench to deal with the important issues like Sabarimala. Have any efforts been made in that direction?A. The Sabarimala case itself could not be heard due to the pandemic. However, there have been five-judge benches to hear other important matters such as the recently constituted constitutional bench that heard the Maratha reservation case. Q. You introduced the concept of hearing through video conferencing during the pandemic. You think it’s going to be a permanent feature in future.A. Virtual hearings have some drawbacks like connectivity or feedback or sound which sometimes makes the hearing difficult. The hearing is then disrupted. But there is no reason why these defects can’t be rectified over a period of time. I think the advantages far outweigh the drawbacks… I think and hope it’s likely to stay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/freedom-of-speech-is-most-abused-right-at-present-cji-sharad-bobde/articleshow/82221627.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||World||UK stands ready to help India in Covid-19 fight||LONDON: The UK government says it stands ready to provide assistance to India in its battle against Covid-19 after the country hit a new all-time high of more than 332,000 Covid-19 infections on Friday, with many hospitals saying they were running out of oxygen. A spokesman for the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office told TOI: "No. 10 confirmed at their lobby briefing that we stand ready to provide any assistance India needs." Boris Johnson’s official spokesman added: "We are not aware of any request from the Indian government at the moment. India is a long-standing close partner with the UK and we would consider any request very closely as you would expect." Downing Street said that no video or phone call had been finalised between the Indian and British PM yet in lieu of Johnson’s trip which did not go ahead this weekend owing to the Covid crisis in India. There was no response from the Ministry of External Affairs to the UK’s offer on Friday, but Indian government sources told TOI: "India has put out tenders for liquid oxygen and is trying to handle Covid situation through all means possible." No. 10 made its position clear after a chorus of Indian-origin Labour MPs on Friday called for Britain to step forward and "show real leadership". Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy, the half-Indian daughter of Kolkata-born academic Dipak Nandy and Louise Byers, said: "The UK should offer all feasible assistance and support to the Indian authorities to combat rising infections and treat those suffering from the virus. The UK can offer expertise and capacity in crucial areas like genome sequencing and epidemiology that have already proven vital in mapping and restricting the spread of coronavirus." She said not only would this save lives in India, but it would limit the spread of new variants to Britain. Her comments were echoed by Preet Gill MP, shadow international development secretary, who said the UK could "directly support" India with its request for oxygen and genome sequencing and the UK should share any surplus vaccines with India. "If this disease gets into rural communities, then the death toll will be even higher," she added. "We need to immediately assist with the supply of mobile oxygen generation plants, other necessary items and expertise required. It is imperative that we urgently help India at this time of crisis," said MP Tan Dhesi whilst MP Navendu Mishra called on the UK to provide urgent support to India, including dropping patents for vaccines, medicines and medical "so everyone has fair access". Prof Neil Ferguson, infectious disease modeller at Imperial College London, whose prediction of 500,000 Covid-19 deaths in the UK persuaded the UK government to implement the first UK lockdown, said the Indian crisis was not "unexpected". "It is a tragic situation in India," he said. "It is tragic when people are unable to get healthcare and that drives up mortality rates and hospitals are running out of oxygen now. It is in some sense not unexpected, but tragic nonetheless. The new variant may well be making control much more difficult."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-stands-ready-to-help-india-in-covid-19-fight/articleshow/82222228.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Business||Vijay Mallya says money he owes Indian banks is 'public money' so he cannot be made bankrupt||LONDON: Indebted liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya stepped up his fight against bankruptcy in the UK courts on Friday, claiming that the banks’ amended bankruptcy petition against him did not stand up in law as the banks could not forfeit the security they held over his assets in India because it was against the public interest in India to do so as the money he had borrowed was "public money". A consortium of Indian banks, led by State Bank of India, is seeking to make the Indian businessman bankrupt in Britain in order to appoint a bankruptcy trustee with wide-ranging powers to investigate his worldwide assets and claw back the Rs 11,000 crore he owes them by virtue of a personal guarantee he gave for loans for Kingfisher Airlines before it went out of business. The banks were ordered on April 9, 2020 to submit an amended bankruptcy petition agreeing to waive any security they hold over his assets in India in the event a bankruptcy order is made, in order to adhere to UK insolvency laws. The banks are in the process of appealing that order. But Philip Marshall QC, representing Mallya, told the Insolvency and Companies Court on Friday that under Indian law the banks would not be allowed to give up their security over Mallya’s Indian property, in the event a bankruptcy order is made in the UK, as the money he owes was public money lent by nationalised banks. His argument was that any bankruptcy order made as a result of the amended petition would be thus "made on a false premise". He pointed to various judgments in India relating to Mallya, including the DRT and PLMA judgments, which found that the banks held security over Mallya’s assets above other secured creditors including Diageo, as well as above the Enforcement Directorate, owing to the fact they lent public money. "It is not open to the Indian banks to say before this court there is no public interest in them holding security when they have adopted the opposite position in Indian proceedings," Marshall said. Marshall added that much of the Rs 11,000 crore was "interest to the principle debt" and Mallya was challenging that interest in the Indian courts. "If we look at that and consider the realisation of his assets to meet the petition debt as well as assets of joint debtors then you don’t end up with an amount sufficient to maintain the bankruptcy petition and so the question of security is very significant," he said. He also pointed out that in India there is no recognition of cross-border insolvency. "There is no legislation to enable recognition of an English bankruptcy trustee in India so how can a trustee work effectively to get at the security located in India if it cannot be released?" Marcia Shekerdemian QC , representing the banks, said: "There is no general rule of public policy in India that prevents a bank from giving up security and that is nowhere in the Indian statutes. How can a bank not deal with its security as it wishes?" Chief ICC Judge Briggs reserved judgment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vijay-mallya-says-money-he-owes-indian-banks-is-public-money-so-he-cannot-be-made-bankrupt/articleshow/82222346.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Goa coach Juan Ferrando surprisingly made eight changes to the team that fought, and lost, 1-2 against Persepolis three days ago. But while the decision to rest key players may have been guided by an urge to provide them much-needed rest and then go all out in the remaining two games, his much-changed team did not measure up to the challenge. Goalkeeper Naveen Kumar, who replaced the impressive Dheeraj Singh, was guilty of gifting away two first-half goals. Once the Iranians surged ahead, there was no stopping them. “Lot of players were exhausted. We were forced into these changes,” Ferrando told TOI after the game. “We had a short time to prepare and a short squad. This score is normal because Persepolis are four or five steps ahead of Goa. I am disappointed, of course, and very sad, but the players tried everything they could.” Persepolis, too, made changes with six new faces in the starting line-up. But the visitors never looked weakened. They were miles ahead and made their dominance count. It all started in the 24th minute when Goa gave away the ball in midfield. Mahdi Torabi sensed an opening and sliced open the defence with a through ball which Shahriyar Moghanlou controlled and buried his left-footed attempt past Naveen, who could have done better. The second was in the 43rd minute. Naveen was clearly at fault. The Goa goalkeeper could not hold on to a routine collection and then failed to clear a pass to safety. Instead, he brought down Issa Alkasir, forcing the referee to award a penalty which Mehdi Torabi calmly converted. Alkasir made it 3-0 immediately after the change of ends. Set free by Moghanlou, the Iranian striker danced his way inside the box, beat his markers, and then hammered home. Ferrando didn’t like what he was seeing on the field. This team was set-up to fight, but they were forced into individual errors. Worse still, captain Ivan Gonzalez couldn’t continue with an injury, so the coach made a triple change, introducing the likes of Glan Martins, Mohammad Ali and Jorge Ortiz. Nothing changed. Ali had a horror first touch while defending a corner-kick and Kamal Kamyabinia said ‘thank you very much’ while scoring his team’s fourth goal. It was not even the hour mark and there was still plenty of time left on the clock. There was more defending to do as the Iranian champions looked to add to their tally. Ferrando’s next move was to send on Brandon Fernandes and the young Makan Chothe. Goa did stitch some moves, Chothe even had a header which went wide. That he was never going to win the battle against Iranian centre-back Hossein Kanani was a reflection of what transpired on the field. Croatian goalkeeper Bozidar Radosevic had little to do for 90 minutes. Then Ortiz woke him up with a snap shot from outside the box which he acrobatically parried away for an abortive corner. Goa next face Al Rayyan on Monday. Unlike the Qatar Stars League side, they remain in the hunt for the second spot, but must win both their remaining matches to have any chance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/persepolis-hammer-four-past-fc-goa-as-ferrando-makes-eight-changes/articleshow/82222504.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||Al Wahda knock out nine-man Al Rayyan with solitary goal win in ACL||Margao: Al Wahda kept themselves in the hunt for a place in the next stage of the AFC Champions League after knocking out Al Rayyan with a 1-0 win at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Friday. Omar Khribin’s 70th minute penalty was the difference between the two sides in a game that was evenly matched until Al Rayyan were reduced to nine men. Laurent Blanc’s Qatar Stars League side saw the first red card in added time of the first half after Ahmed Maqsoud was shown a straight red for a foul on Abdulla Anwar. Al Rayyan soldiered on but found themselves on the backfoot when they picked up the second red card in the 68th minute. This time it was time for Franck Kom to be sent off, although the Cameroonian defender had himself to blame for arguing with the referee. Kom was adjudged to have fouled Fares Juma inside the danger zone and the referee pointed at the spot. The defender was first booked for the foul and then got another yellow for dissent to leave Al Rayyan with just nine players on the field. Omar, former Asian player of the year, stepped up to take the penalty and made no mistake to put Al Wahda ahead. With a big numerical advantage, Al Wahda were rarely troubled. The UAE side though had a scare in the five minutes of added time when the experienced Ismaeil Matar was sent off. Al Wahda now have seven points from four matches and are behind leaders Persepolis FC (12 points). Al Rayyan are at the bottom with just a point and even if they win their remaining two matches cannot finish second due to their inferior head-to-head record against the UAE side. According to competition regulations, if two or more participating clubs are equal on points, “higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the participating clubs in question” is applied to determine the ranking. Al Wahda have won both their matches against Al Rayyan. Their first win came three days ago when they fought back from two goals down to win 3-2, thanks to a last-gasp winner from Juma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/al-wahda-knock-out-nine-man-al-rayyan-with-solitary-goal-win-in-acl/articleshow/82222690.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

India has now reported close to a million new cases (9.94 lakh) in just three days, while Friday was also the fourth day in a row in which India reported more than 2,000 deaths in 24 hours. Brazil reported 79,719 cases on Thursday while the respective figures were 62,642 for the US and 54,791 for Turkey. None of the other worst-affected countries are even close to India. Of the total 8.9 lakh fresh cases reported internationally, a significant 37% were reported from India alone. While Mumbai and Delhi have been hogging headlines, Bengaluru has emerged as the district with the highest number of active cases in the country, just under 1.5 lakh as of Thursday. The only other district with over 1 lakh active cases is Pune with under 1.2 lakh. Five of the 10 districts with the highest number of active cases are in Maharashtra – Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur, Thane and Nashik, in that order. However, Hyderabad with over 94,000 has more active cases than any of these districts, data from covid19india.org shows. The other districts in the top 10 include Lucknow, Kamrup Metro (Guwahati) and Ahmedabad. District wise break-up for Delhi was not available and hence not part of this calculation. Delhi as a whole -- it comprises 11 districts -- has just over a lakh active cases.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Bengaluru’s active cases count is higher than all but four states – Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka itself. In fact, Bengaluru alone accounts for close to 70% of the active cases in the entire state, a proportion that is unlikely to be exceeded by any single district for its state. Active cases are a more meaningful parameter than total cases when considering the load on health systems and the level that some of these top 10 districts are reaching is worrying considering their small population sizes compared to Mumbai or Delhi and in many cases significantly fewer healthcare resources than those two cities as well.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); A state-wise analysis shows that Friday saw the highest single-day spike of cases in 15 states and UTs.

---||India||60% of Indian variant samples tested in labs found in Maharshtra||MUMBAI: About 59% of the newly identified and infectious Indian variant of SARS-CoV-2 called B.1.617 have been found in Maharashtra, although the double mutant strain is dominant only in selected districts and cities, not the entire state. Significantly, scientists have also found that both Covaxin and Covishield are able to protect against the strain. Speaking at a webinar on “Genome sequencing of Sars-Cov-19” on Friday, Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control, said a total of 15,133 samples have been sequenced by the 10 INSACOG laboratories, of which 1,196 had the UK variant, 728 had the B.1.617 or Indian mutation, and 29 had the South African variant. Of the 728 samples with the Indian variant, 427 were found in Maharashtra, 124 in West Bengal, 75 in Delhi and 53 in MP, among others. However, nearly 1,200 samples had the UK mutation, of which 543 were in Punjab, followed by 124 in Delhi. Maharashtra had the UK mutation in 29 samples. Virologist Dr Shahid Jameel, who is the chairperson of INSACOG, said that the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, has found through a study of vaccinated individuals that vaccines can protect against the Indian variant. “Sera from Covishield and Covaxin are able to protect against B.1.617. Although more tests have to be done, this is some early good news coming in,” he said.  NCDC’s Dr Singh said that the variants of concern (VOC) were found in 11% of samples that have been subjected to genome sequencing. He said that while the UK variant is the dominant one in Punjab, it is gathering more strength in Delhi. “UK variant that was found in 28% samples in the second week of March has increased to 50% by the last week. B.1.617 has also been found in Delhi,” he said. In Maharashtra, samples from districts in Vidarbha region have mainly seen the mutations. Within the state, the Indian variant B.1.617 was found in 427 of the 1723 samples sequenced.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Singh, however, emphasised that the surge cannot be linked to the mutations. “Disease transmission is not only just about mutants or variants but a large number of factors such as pool of susceptible persons, immunity status of persons who are there in the community not following Covid appropriate behaviour and public health measures,” he said.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Scientists said that the Indian variant was detected in December but it was not flagged as a variant of interest. Anurag Agrawal, director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) said, “The first sequences of B.1.617 were seen in December, but we were in a declining phase. We see hundreds of variants every time we sequence. There was no reason to flag a variant or mutant of an unknown character in a declining phase of an outbreak”. BJ Medical In Pune was among the first ones to spot it, NCDC experts added. Singh, however, emphasised that the surge cannot be linked to mutations alone or yet. “Disease transmission is not just about mutants or variants but a large number of factors such as pool of susceptible persons, immunity status of persons who are there in community, not following Covid appropriate behaviour and public health measures,” he said.  “Although some mutations are known to have immune escape properties, the preventive strategies remain the same. Appropriate masking, social distancing and sanitizing remain the key measures to protect against the variants,” said Dr Jameel. Singh said that studies were also being done to understand if the mutations were impacting the clinical presentation or the severity of the disease in any way. “Sentinel sites have been identified such as labs and hospitals, where we collect samples from moderate to severe patients to study if there is any correlation between the mutations and disease progression,” he said.  Addressing concerns around RT-PCR samples coming negative, Dr Priya Abraham, director of the National Institute of Virology (NIV), said it was still the gold standard test and 98%-99% kits can pick up the disease despite mutations. “RT-PCR negative reports could be mainly because sampling could be inappropriate, individuals may be appearing late for sampling and typically if they come more than 7 days into illness, sampling from nasopharyngeal region may reduce sensitivity of assays leading to a false negative report,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/60-of-indian-variant-samples-tested-in-labs-found-in-maharshtra/articleshow/82223219.cms||Sumitra Debroy

This will be extended to beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and nearly 8 million tonnes of foodgrain will be distributed under this scheme. The scheme, with an additional expenditure of nearly Rs 26,000 crore, is expected to bring relief to NFSA beneficiaries as it will be in addition to the regular entitlement of 5kg highly subsidised foodgrains to each beneficiary at Rs 3, 2 and 1 per kg of rice, wheat and coarse grains. The announcement came amid some states imposing lockdowns to beat the pandemic, which is likely to hit the poor and migrant workers who are returning home. It will be on the lines of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) launched during the first Covid wave last year. Recently, three states – Kerala, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand – and four opposition MPs including NCP chief Sharad Pawar and TMC leader Saugata Roy had urged the Centre to rerun PMGKAY to help the poor. The Centre has a huge stock of foodgrains to meet the requirement. Currently, wheat and rice stock in the central pool is around 69 million tonnes – nearly three times more than the buffer requirement. Unlike the last PMGKAY, this time the Centre has not announced distribution of one kilogram of free pulses to nearly 20 crore beneficiary families per month as it doesn’t have enough buffer stock of the key nutrient. Its stock is hovering around 1.5 million tones – lower than the buffer norm of 2 million tonnes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/80cr-to-get-5kg-of-free-grain-under-nfsa-for-next-2-months/articleshow/82223297.cms||---

As and when the government decides to release the DA and dearness relief for the period starting July 2021, the payment will be made prospectively. Last year the government had decided to freeze the DA and dearness relief for central government employees and pensioners due to the Covid-19 outbreak, although the allowances, paid to cover inflation, for previous period is being paid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/da-relief-for-pensioners-govt-staffers-wont-include-arrears/articleshow/82223600.cms||---

---||India||In Covid-battered NCR, oxygen langar gives a breather||GHAZIABAD: Hundreds of people have been lining up at a gurdwara in Indirapuram since Thursday night because it has been offering what many hospitals are struggling with Oxygen. People’s desperate search for oxygen beds, which hospitals pulverised by the pandemic have run out of, prompted the Gurdwara Sahib to start an ‘oxygen langar’. Through a network of other gurdwaras, it has stocked cylinders and is administering oxygen to anyone with respiratory distress. Just as a langar, it’s open to all. There’s no need for an Aadhaar card or a Covid test report. Gurdwara managers said the langar’s objective was to stabilise people with acute respiratory distress, giving them a breather before they found a hospital bed. #WATCH 'Oxygen Langar' at Sri Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara in Indirapuram, to help COVID19 patients#Ghaziabad https://t.co/L1yITzUchl— ANI (@ANI) 1619232709000Sandeep Pandita was in despair after driving from one hospital to another with his father, whose oxygen saturation levels had dipped to 55. He was directed to the gurdwara by a text message he received from an acquaintance. “The message said the gurdwara was giving free oxygen. It was too good to be true,” Pandita told TOI on Friday. He was skeptical but his father’s condition made him drive down to the house of worship in hope. “To my surprise, I found many people there. Patients were being administered oxygen in cars and on benches,” said Pandita. Pandita said he informed a man in a turban he spotted near the entrance — who turned out to be the president of the gurdwara, Gurpreet Singh — about his father’s condition. Soon, Singh’s associates lugged a cylinder up to the car. “They placed the cylinder next to the car. We stayed there for four hours and left when my father felt better,” said Pandita, who got a little more time to look for a hospital where he could admit his father. Singh told TOI the gurdwara had tied up with some others in west UP to get the oxygen cylinders. “It is everyone’s duty to rise to the occasion and help people who are in so much distress. Just complaining and feeling helpless is not the way. With the help of Khalsa Help International, we got in touch with gurdwaras in Muzaffarnagar and Meerut, which helped us with the oxygen cylinders,” he said. “We started administering oxygen from 11.30pm on Thursday and till 5pm on Friday, over 200 people had availed the service. Since we do not have infrastructure like beds, etc, we got people to take oxygen right in their vehicles and on benches placed near the road. We assured them that till the condition of the patient stabilizes, we will continue to provide oxygen,” added Singh. With the healthcare system in disarray because of the numbers the pandemic has been throwing up, the gurdwara managers are flooded with phone calls for help. “Ever since I shared the phone numbers on social networking sites, the calls haven’t stopped,” said Singh, adding calls had been coming from people abroad, including Canada, to enquire about oxygen for their ailing family members in Delhi-NCR. “We are trying our best to help as many people as we can,” said Singh. The Gurdwara Sahib has sufficient oxygen as of now. “I requested the administration to make available at least 50 cylinders to us, which will be in addition to the cylinders we can lay our hands on and we will keep on serving people,” said Singh. Gautam Arora, an attendant of a patient broke down while thanking the gurdwara managers. “They have shown what is possible to achieve when there is intent. I have no words to thank them and hundreds of people like me are thanking them profusely,” said Arora. The oxygen langar is operational all day if availability of cylinders doesn’t choke the service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-covid-battered-ncr-oxygen-langar-gives-a-breather/articleshow/82223956.cms||Abhijay Jha

---||India||25 Covid deaths at Ganga Ram, hospital doesn’t ‘ascribe them to O2 shortage’||NEW DELHI: As a new day broke over Delhi on Friday, a grim story emerged from one of the capital’s premier hospitals, Sir Ganga Ram. At least 25 Covid-19 patients had died there in the past 24 hours. The chairman (board of management) of the hospital, Dr D S Rana, said they were very sick and rebutted reports that their death had been caused due to lack of oxygen. “I would not ascribe the deaths to oxygen shortage. A large number of patients admitted at our hospital are in a very serious condition and that’s why the high fatality,” Dr Rana told TOI. He, however, added that they were facing a severe oxygen shortage. “There have been occasions when we had to do manual ventilation -- intermittent manual compression of a gas-filled reservoir bag to force the gas into a patient's lungs -- to ensure that patients on ventilator support survive,” he said. The hospital received fresh oxygen supplies thrice on Friday but the quantity was less which, the doctors said, kept them on tenterhooks. “How do we treat patients when the critical supply is not ensured! A patient requiring ventilator support can die in minutes without oxygen,” said a doctor. Many other hospitals were facing the same dilemma. They said they had stopped taking new admissions due to the ongoing crisis of oxygen supply. At Cygnus Hospital in Rohini, where there was an oxygen crisis, two patients died last night. However, the hospital said that the deaths were due to Covid-19.

In this guide, we strive to give you the required information so that you can makeThe administrators of Holy Family, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre (ISIC) and Manipal too red-flagged the issue of oxygen shortage. “We have been waiting for oxygen since last night but no luck so far,” ISIC officials tweeted at 1 pm on Friday, adding that even the oxygen cylinder stock they had was getting depleted. Shortly after that, the hospital received its supply of oxygen. In a statement, the management said: “The hospital has been desperately trying to arrange oxygen cylinders since Friday morning, as a result of which 18 oxygen cylinders were arranged till the evening, which will help us treat the patients for now. However, this was not enough and we would have faced a grave crisis were we to run out of cylinder oxygen.” The hospital then came out with the strategy of making two patients share a cylinder using connectors. “We are also shifting the patients to the hospital’s central supply of oxygen, and again with connectors, sharing one central supply connection with two patients. This should work for the time being. We are in constant touch with the government and our suppliers to ensure availability,” the statement added. Dr Sumit Ray, head of critical care at Holy Family Hospital, said the government was trying to augment upplies. “However, because the requirement is so high and delivery time so stretched that nearly all hospitals are getting the supply just a few hours to a few minutes before their stocks run out completely. It makes everybody anxious and it’s a very stressful situation,” he said. If the oxygen supply stops, those on ventilator can die in minutes, said Dr Ray. This poses a serious challenge for doctors. At 10:30 pm on Friday, Batra Hospital was left with just half-an-hour of oxygen. “We are being told that 1,000 litres of oxygen is being sent. But even that is not sufficient and hence our struggle will continue through the night,” said Dr SCL Gupta, medical director of the hospital. The hospital did not take any new admissions on Friday. “We have 352 patients, out of which 320 are Covid-19 patients. They are all on oxygen support and 38-40 are on ventilator support,” said Dr Gupta. At Aakash Healthcare in Dwarka, only two hours of oxygen supply was left at 11 am. However, when TOI spoke to the hospital at 2:46pm, it said an oxygen tanker had arrived and they will be able to manage for another seven hours. Dr Kousar A Shah, COO, Aakash Healthcare, said he was turning away families of patients seeking admission. “Our senior management went to the office of the supplier in Faridabad but couldn’t procure any oxygen. We received half a tanker after calls to several people, officers and police, but this will last for another 8-10 hours only and the struggle will continue. We are managing the time by refilling our oxygen cylinders from various small vendors in Delhi,” said Shah. The 233-bed hospital currently has 250 Covid patients and is working beyond its capacity with 70 per cent patients requiring oxygen supply. A similar situation was witnessed at the Gupta multi-speciality hospital in Vivek Vihar. “We are sending out our employees to refill cylinders and survive. The supply is erratic,” complained the owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/25-covid-deaths-at-ganga-ram-hospital-doesnt-ascribe-them-to-o2-shortage/articleshow/82224687.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Delhi||Delhi records 24,103 new Covid cases, 357 deaths||NEW DELHI: The number of people dying due to Covid-19 in the national capital in a single day touched 357 on Saturday — the highest till date. Earlier, on Thursday and Friday, the city recorded 306 and 348 deaths, respectively, in 24 hours. In the past 24 days, Delhi has recorded 2,871 deaths, averaging 120 deaths daily. In March, the average death reported daily was around 4. Though the number of new cases being reported daily has not gone up significantly over the past week, the positivity rate remains high. On Saturday, Delhi recorded 24,103 Covid cases, taking the total number to over 10 lakh. As many as 74,702 tests were conducted in the city in the past 24 hours, of which only 42,346 were conducted using RT-PCR, which is considered low. The positivity rate stood at 32.27%. “Testing has reduced significantly over the past few days. The numbers of cases recorded do not represent the real picture of how widespread the disease is,” a senior doctor at AIIMS said. Almost all the hospitals in Delhi are running full capacity. As of 11pm on Saturday, only one ventilator bed was available across the city, while the number of ICU beds without a ventilator stood at 11. Many families have been going to neighbouring states to seek admission for critical care of Covid-19 patients. The disruption in oxygen supply has added to the crisis. Delhi government-run Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital on Saturday reduced the number of Covid beds from 986 to 700 amid the deepening of crisis over the scarcity of oxygen, which is vital to save the critically ill patients.  On Friday, the city government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital had reduced the number of Covid beds from 650 to 350 due to shortage of oxygen. All 350 beds at the hospital are ICU beds. Dr Geetika Sharma, additional medical superintendent of Asian Hospital in Faridabad said the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases over the past three weeks has overwhelmed all the hospitals. “It has led to a mismatch between the supply and the demand. We have tried to increase the beds to reduce the gap, but issues such as oxygen supply remain affected leading to a crisis-like situation,” she said. Dr Sharma, who is the nodal officer for Covid management at the hospital, said she spent16-18 hours daily at the hospital, which is now affecting her mental health. “All healthcare workers are suffering, both physically and mentally. We have no time for our family, which is causing anxiety and other problems among our parents and children,” Dr Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/357-deaths-in-city-highest-so-far/articleshow/82235909.cms||---

The association’s honorary secretary Dr Ajit Saigal said that the state government had asked all private hospitals, clinics and nursing homes to complete the process of registration at the CMO office in December, 2020 and January, 2021. The private medical establishments completed the process of registration, but the period of validity was only till April 30. “As the current wave of Covid-19 has hindered the work of all establishments including government offices and courts, the CMO office is also reeling under massive pressure,” said Saigal. “The association finds that repeating the same formalities will increase more burden on the CMO office and other offices concerned. It will also hamper the functioning of private hospitals and nursing homes, which are not only tackling Covid cases but also attending to non-Covid patients in such difficult times,” he added. Dr Saigal said that in view of these ground realities, the association has appealed to the government to extend the period of registration of private hospitals and nursing homes for a year on the basis of same documents submitted three months ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/assn-of-pvt-hosps-nursing-homes-ask-govt-to-extend-their-registration-period-for-a-year/articleshow/82234823.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Scared 82-year-old mails HC, raises poll-pandemic concerns||Kolkata: An octogenarian Ballygunge resident on Thursday mailed to Calcutta High Court saying an all-pervasive fear of the pandemic may stop many voters like her to step out of their homes to vote, robbing them of their constitutional rights. Namita Roy Chowdhury, 82, in her appeal said she had never missed voting but may not cast her vote this time due to the Covid surge. Questioning the election commission’s statements on implementing Covid guidelines, Roy Chowdhury in a detailed mail asked whether the authorities “really believe that anybody is in control of the coronavirus situation? The epidemic has reeled out of control. In Bengal, cases are doubling every five days.” She argued, “Needless to say, all the control supposedly exercised by the election commission is an illusion. No one has control over this pandemic. The endless meetings, roadshows and canvassing have already taken a huge toll on Bengal. But much more than that, there is a climate of fear surrounding the very process of voting. If people like me or my friends and family members do not feel safe to go out and vote and risk exposure, then I am not being able to exercise my constitutional obligation as a citizen.” Namita wrote: “I have myself never skipped voting but am too afraid to venture out this time amid this pandemic. I am aware that the elderly can cast votes without physically going to the booth, but I am not just writing for myself. In the past few weeks, I have sensed the same fear in whoever I have spoken with, irrespective of age.” She also questioned the legality of “any process” that prevented her from fulfilling her “rights as an Indian in a situation of health emergency”. Namita also argued: “If democracy is ‘for the people’ and ‘of the people’, and elections are ought to be free and fair, then democracy cannot be served well if the ‘people’ cannot freely cast their vote. Holding elections in these circumstances is in violation of our constitutional right.” Calcutta High Court is also hearing several PILs that rigorous implementation of the Covid guidelines. Among the political parties, Trinamool Congress has repeatedly urged the EC to club the last three poll phases, but the EC said given the existing laws and the requirement of officials — including central forces — it wasn’t possible to rejig the poll dates. The EC, however, has brought in several restrictions, limiting public meetings and banning rallies using its plenary powers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/scared-82-year-old-mails-hc-raises-poll-pandemic-concerns/articleshow/82221623.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh issued notice to the Delhi government and sought its stand on the petition, which has sought formulation of a scheme for ensuring proper infrastructure and logistical support for recording of evidence by the local commissioners appointed by the courts. The order came on the plea by a 67-year-old widow who is involved in a civil suit in the lower court and whose evidence has so far been recorded in the Judges’ Library of Patiala House Courts here due to lack of any dedicated room or infrastructure for the same. The woman, represented by advocate Prashant Mendiratta, has claimed that the place of recording evidence is often overcrowded with depositions in various cases being recorded and therefore, witnesses are left “perplexed and overwhelmed”.

Following the incident, junior doctors, along with para-medical staff sat on a dharna inside the hospital demanding immediate action against those involved in the attack. However, the dharna was called off after senior police and administrative officials assured action against the errant attendants. Inspector general of police, Prayagraj range, KP Singh told TOI, “The series of the incident started at 3am when an inspector-rank police official named as Zulfiqar Ali, posted at legal cell department in Pratapgarh district along with his brother had an altercation with a junior doctor following the death of his mother at SRN hospital. The IG added, "Medical and para-medical staff told senior police officials that the inspector’s mother was in a serious condition and following her death, the inspector along with his brother had forcibly entered staff room and thrashed a junior doctor." IG, however, added that the issue took a serious turn when a medical staff started making a video of the altercation between attendants and medical staff even as both the parties were involved in a heated argument. The inspector had raised his voice over the filming of a video and both the parties clashed soon after. The medical and para-medical staff on duty started assembling on the spot and they further sat on a dharna against the errant attendants. Upon being alerted, senior police and administrative officials along with police forces immediately rushed to the spot and pacified the agitating medical and para-medical staff to resume work. The dharna was called off only after senior administrative officials assured action against the errant attendants. The IG said,” The inspector has been placed under suspension”. Senior police and administrative officials have been probing the incident through CCTV footage said that action would soon be initiated. The IG, however, said the entry of the inspector along with his brother was a wrong move on the former's part. He added that a case would be registered once a thorough probe was conducted. Meanwhile, the family members alleged that they had admitted the ailing patient at the hospital on April 18 and her condition started deteriorating on Thursday night. The family members accused medical staff of laxity in the treatment of the patient which they claimed led to her death. When the inspector and his brother went to the staff room to appeal to the doctors to pay heed to the patient, the medical staff on duty allegedly started misbehaving. The inspector was allegedly thrashed and his brother badly injured in the conflict, claimed the family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/chaos-at-srn-after-patients-death/articleshow/82222503.cms||---

He appealed to the chiefs of charitable trusts and temple cross Nashik, Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar districts. Zapate said Covid is wreaking havoc all over the country and a large number of people are dying from the infection. The number of people contracting the infection has also become a concern. While all measures are being taken by the government to control the spread of Covid, the government machinery is under tremendous pressure for providing treatment to the ailing patients.  He said it has become necessary that citizens contribute financially on humanitarian grounds to deal with the pandemic, following which, the appeal has been made to all the charitable and temple trusts to make financial donation wholeheartedly. The financial donation can be made through the district collectors of the respective districts by cheques or demand drafts. Zapate also said that no one should be pressurised to provide financial aid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/donate-to-govt-for-covid-fight-temples-urged/articleshow/82220111.cms||---

The 52-year-old Rai was infected with the virus in July last year when corona was at its peak. He found himself gasping for breath at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) where he was provided with a tiny oxygen cylinder after struggling for hours. He along with his wife then came up with the idea of establishing an oxygen bank free of cost and not let anyone suffer for breath. On July 20, 2020, Rai started the oxygen bank with 13 cylinders and is now operating in 21 districts of the state providing 70 cylinders on a daily basis to needy people. "I was blessed to be surrounded by such good souls who voluntarily donated cylinders for my noble cause. Apart from that, Bihar Foundation approached me in September 2020 and donated 200 cylinders. Without resting for a single day, I worked tirelessly carrying the cylinders in my car and delivering it to patients without a delay. I provided cylinders to 1,103 patients in the first wave of pandemic where 32 casualties happened." Rai added. Rai also praises the power of social media which helped people reach out to him. “I thoroughly believe in working for saving lives not in publicizing it. Mouth-to-mouth publicity has been one of the reasons of expansion of my cause which enabled me to help a large number of people. Apart from that radio channels also circulated my contact details helping me get in touch with more patients,” Rai told this newspaper. But it’s not always a smooth affair for Rai, who often faces difficulties in coping with the deamnd because of lack of enough resources. “The owners of Kumar Enterprises are helping me with re-filling my oxygen cylinders since Day 1 at a cost of ₹100. But I face challenges in finding essentials like flowmeter etc," he said. Rai has chosen not to take a single penny from his patients. He is voluntarily being helped by his colleagues, friends and family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-survivor-turns-oxygen-man-for-patna-helped-save-over-900-lives/articleshow/82221812.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Why remdesivir, O2 scarce? High Court asks Telangana||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Friday gave four days to the state and central governments to list out the reasons behind oxygen supplies and remdesivir injections getting scarce in the state putting Covid-19 patients’ lives at grave risk. The judges wondered why things went wrong in a span of a few days after the public health director had claimed that there was no shortfall in oxygen supplies in the state. Chief Justice Hima Kohli shared her personal experience wherein, despite efforts, she could not help a person who requested her to ensure a remdesivir vial to a patient. She along with Justice B Vijaysen Reddy sought answers from the governments by April 27. The bench also asked health secretary Syed Ali Murtuza Rizvi, who was virtually present before the court, to ensure immediate appointment of a nodal officer to oversee vaccination and Covid-19 related efforts as suggested by the central government. The judges expressed disapproval over permissions being granted for political meetings, roadshows and public rallies. “They have to be thoroughly discouraged. There is no point in trying to enforce Covid-19 norms at huge public meetings after permitting them to be held,” the judges said. The judges went through the report by advocate general B S Prasad and asked him why there was a sudden change in oxygen supply within a few days. “Your director of health in his report a few days ago, had assured us that there is no shortfall of oxygen supply in the state. Now your health minister is projecting an alarming picture that there is a huge shortage of oxygen. Why this sudden change? Where did things go wrong in the last few days,” they sought to know. On remdesivir shortage, the health secretary said the Centre has taken over its supply and is allocating to various states. “Though we have several manufacturing units producing this drug, we cannot use it. We have to wait for the central allocations,” he said and added, “we were given only 21,500 vials this month.” The judges said it was alright to raid and seize drug stocks with the help of police but it is also important to ensure quick shifting of the seized supplies to safe storages with cool temperature facilities. “Otherwise, the effort would be futile,” they said. The judges also directed the government to furnish the minutes of the meetings its experts’ committee has held and the recommendations it made to deal with the pandemic’s second wave. Additional solicitor general T Surya Karan Reddy assured the court that he would ascertain and inform the court about remdesiver, oxygen and other essential supplies. Earlier, the health secretary said he has no idea if restrictions at the borders would result in lesser positivity rate of Covid-19. He also feigned ignorance about Covid-19 care centres in the districts lying vacant despite a sharp surge in positive cases. The judges then told him that people are scared of going there because they are not properly equipped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/why-remdesivir-o2-scarce-hc-asks-t/articleshow/82223239.cms||---

However, he is still awaiting report. Gunjan (35), a schoolteacher started medication for Covid-19 after taking suggestions from a doctor after his condition worsened on Thursday. “The RT-PCR test result is getting delayed due to a huge backlog at the lab,” Gunjan quoted an employee of the private lab as saying. Gunjan is at present in home isolation. His family members are also apprehensive but they are waiting for the RT-PCR test result. “If he is tested positive, we will also go for the test,” said his 30-year-old wife Indu Kumari. Gunjan’s is not an isolated case. Ganga Rai (name changed), a resident of Mahua in Vaishali district, is also awaiting his RT-PCR test report. He had given swab for the test to the collection centre at DIET building near Dighi in Hajipur three days ago. Sources said the swab was sent to the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital in Patna for test. “The process is getting delayed as an employee of the lab at NMCH has tested positive for Covid,” a source said. Vaishali civil surgeon Dr Indradeo Ranjan said, “On Thursday, 3,400 antigen tests were conducted at the collection centre. Since we don’t have an RT-PCR testing facility, the swab is sent to the NMCH in Patna for test. It normally takes three days to get the test reports.” Dr Ranjan, however, clarified that antigen test reports are provided to the people immediately. “The collection centre at the Hajipur town hall was shifted to DIET building as people turning up with Covid infection were seen wandering here and there. Moreover, the town hall was not considered safe due to lack of space. Of the 34,000 tests conducted, about 25% were found positive,” the civil surgeon said. “What to talk of the government hospitals and testing labs, the situation in private labs is no better as far as RT-PCR test is concerned,” said a senior doctor posted at the Guru Govind Singh Hospital in Patna City. Several pathological labs here have stopped collecting swab from home as they are getting frequent calls. “Come to the lab if you want to give a swab for the test. We have stopped home service due to huge rush,” a staff manning a private lab at Kankarbagh told this newspaper. Though several private labs claimed that they provide test results within 48 hours, people have to wait for four to seven days for the reports. “More people are turning up at private labs for the test fearing that they may get infected at government testing facilities,” said B K Singh, a retired professor who had recently tested positive for Covid. Sources in the health department said on an average 40,000 tests are conducted per day in the state despite the high court’s directive to raise it to one lakh a day. Neither the Patna divisional commissioner nor any senior officer of the state health department could be contacted despite repeated attempts by this newspaper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/long-wait-for-covid-19-test-results-leaves-people-anxious-raises-risk/articleshow/82220985.cms||Ramashankar

---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: Woman sets self and daughter ablaze||VIJAYAWADA: A woman killed her five-year-old daughter and herself by setting themselves ablaze at their residence in Nellorepalem centre in Atmakur during the wee hours of Friday. The deceased were identified as Subbulu (27) and her daughter Madhuravani (5). According to Atmakur police, the incident happened at around 4 am when Subbulu planned her suicide, along with killing both her children—her daughter and her son. However, when she doused petrol on both children, her seven-year-old son Mahesh understood what his mother meant to do as she approached him to set him on fire, and fled from the place. He cried out for help to neighbours, nearby shopkeepers and hoteliers. By then, Subbulu and Madhuravani were ablaze. Locals soon managed to control the fire, but by then both victims succumbed to their injuries. Upon information, cops reached the spot and examined the scene and found that both died due to over 70% burn injuries. Preliminary inquiry revealed that they came from Bellary in Karnataka and committed suicide in Atmakur. Cops said that they have informed the family members and an inquiry revealed that her estranged relationship with her husband appears to be the motive behind the extreme step. Cops registered a case under sections 302 of IPC (murder) and 174 of CrPC (unnatural death) at Atmakur police station. Both bodies have been sent to a local government hospital for postmortem. Further investigation is still on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/woman-sets-self-and-daughter-ablaze/articleshow/82220950.cms||---
---||Allahabad||UP: Cycle baraat campaigns for protocols||PRAYAGRAJ: As the dawn struck on Friday, a man in a face shield embarked on a 10km journey from Bojhi to Rajgarh village in the neighbouring Pratapgarh district. This was not to ward off claustrophobia that has come with fresh Covid restrictions but to solemnise his wedding. Searing heat failed to be a deterrent as Vinay Kumar was also accompanied by a group of green activists. The motive behind their arduous journey was to create a message about environment protection and encourage the use of masks to battle the ferocious second wave of coronavirus. Vinay works in a private factory in Pratapgarh and actively participates in environment awareness campaigns. As the groom reached the village on the bicycle along with the limited ‘baraatis’, residents praised their noble gesture. Vinay’s family members said, they took the decision to check unnecessary expenses during the pandemic and create awareness about environment conservation. They invited limited number of guests to adhere to social distancing. Head of Paryawaran Sena, an organisation working for environment protection, Ajay Krantikari, said: “ We have been constantly promoting the concept of ‘green weddings’ in villages, blocks and cities across the country... In the corona period, limited baratis paddled from one village to another to spread the message of social distancing and wearing of masks.” All the baraatis were wearing masks and maintaining adequate distance from each other while paddling from Bojhi village to Rajgarh. Locals were also seen clicking photographs and shooting videos of the unique ‘baraat’. In fact, it was Krantikari, who convinced Vinay and his family members to ride a bicycle to the bride’s home. Krantikari said, more and more people are joining the Harit Viwah campaign across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/man-takes-baraat-on-bicycle-to-spread-covid-awareness/articleshow/82222538.cms||---

The executive council members were told that the state government had taken the decision to defer the exams based on inputs received from the state disaster management authorities. Officials said that as announced by the chief minister and education minister Pramod Sawant, the new dates for the public exams will be declared at least 15 days prior to the start of the tests. The Goa Board has decided to take a ‘wait and watch’ stance at present given the spread of Covid-19 infections in the state. While the Class XII exams were scheduled to begin from April 24, the Class X exams were set to start from May 19. Around 19,200 students have registered for the Class XII exams and over 23,000 students for the Class X exams. The Goa Board has already prepared separate SOPs for this year’s public exams. As per the SOPs, students answering the board exam have to assemble earlier than usual at 8.30am at their exam centre and volunteers deployed by the board will escort the students to their exam hall. The board has recommended double masking with a cloth mask worn over an N95 mask. Invigilators have been instructed to take the attendance of candidates without passing the sheets around. Conductors have been advised to ensure that students extend their hands for thermal scan only after sanitizing their hands. As ‘legal advice’, Goa Board has instructed all sub-centres to ‘maintain photographic record for each paper for each hall at each centre showing candidates maintaining social distancing and wearing masks.’ As ‘legal advice’, Goa Board has instructed all sub-centres to ‘maintain photographic record for each paper for each hall at each centre showing candidates maintaining social distancing and wearing masks||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/board-to-adopt-wait-and-watch-policy-over-exams/articleshow/82223235.cms||---
---||Patna||Nalanda Medical College and hospital junior doctors call off strike after police deployment on campus||PATNA: The junior doctors of NMCH called off their strike on Friday evening following deployment of police force on the hospital premises. NMCH junior doctors’ association (JDA) president Dr Ramchandra Kumar said they resumed work around 10pm, following assurance from Patna SSP Upendra Sharma about deployment of 20 constables each in two shifts at the hospital and one such team was deployed in the evening itself. Earlier in the evening, Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh and SSP Sharma visited NMCH and held talks with the JDA members. Dr Divyanshu Martand from medicine department at NMCH claimed that the DM and SSP were informed about acute shortage of manpower and some medical equipment at the hospital as the number of Covid patients were four times higher than last year. Meanwhile, over 50 ambulances and private vehicles carrying serious Covid patients had to return in distress from the NMCH from Thursday night to Friday evening as about 200 junior doctors of the dedicated Covid hospital were on strike. New admissions of Covid patients had also come to a halt leaving patients and their kin to look for beds in other healthcare facilities. The medicos were demanding security after the attendants of a patient created a ruckus and manhandled a doctor on duty on Thursday alleging delay in issuing the corona death certificate. The situation turned worse when some of the relatives of the patient damaged several ICU beds and instruments needed for treatment of serious patients, manhandled junior doctors and hurled abuses on lady doctors. Narrating the woes due to doctors strike, a resident of Gola Road said he reached the NMCH with a patient on oxygen support by car around 10.30am but the hospital staff refused to admit him due to the strike. Finally, he could find an oxygen bed in a private hospital. Another attendant of a serious patient was seen there begging to the hospital staff for oxygen to her patient gasping due to severity of the infection. “Inki saanse kam ho rahi hai.. kucch to kariye..”. But there was none to take notice of her pains. NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh admitted that the hospital functioning had been badly hit due to the junior doctors’ strike. He also admitted that new admissions of Covid patients could not be made, except a few this morning and about 50 ambulances carrying Covid patients had to return. “We have demanded 60 policemen for duty in three shifts so as to ensure smooth functioning of the hospital,” said Singh. The superintendent further complained of inadequate supply of oxygen, putting the healthcare under pressure. Most of the Covid patients were on oxygen support and the hospital required an additional reserve of 200 cylinders every day. “We panicked Thursday evening after the staff informed that oxygen supply to patients would stop in about 30 minutes, putting the lives of about 200 patients at risk. Our staff ran to different places and arranged a few cylinders which helped save many lives,” he said. Another problem coming in the way of treatment at NMCH is shortage of medical staff. “The hospital administration wrote a letter on April 15 to the government asking for 100 doctors and 100 nurses for the treatment of 500 Covid patients, but nothing has happened till date,” said Dr Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nmch-junior-doctors-call-off-strike-after-police-deployment-on-campus/articleshow/82221017.cms||VK Tripathi

This makes India the most valuable business among the 10 markets in the Asia-Pacific where Citi plans to exit consumer business. These 10 markets are collectively valued between $6.3 billion and $8 billion by Macquarie. According to a report by the Australian bank, going by SBI Card’s valuation, Citi’s 2.7 million cards would imply a figure of $2.7 billion. “This is above the top end of our valuation… To the the extent that a single buyer is able to purchase multiple businesses at once, we would expect some sort of valuation discount in order to expedite Citi’s exit,” the report said. “As the deal does not come with bank licences nor distribution, the sale is likely to take place in fragments. Across the region, there are very few banks who have the requisite footprint to bolt-on all of Citi’s various retail businesses,” the report said. The report identifies DBS, OCBC and StanChart as possible cross-border buyers, but is uncertain about HSBC. Besides the 10 Asia-Pacific markets, Citi announced its plans to exit consumer banking from three other markets — the Philippines, Poland and Russia. A Bloomberg report quoted a Citi official stating that the bank was looking to sell its entire operations in India in one go. “We have always been open to exploring sensible bolt-on opportunities in markets where we have a consumer banking franchise and where we can overlay our digital capabilities to serve our customers better,” a representative for DBS told Bloomberg.

---||Patna||BJP minister demands lockdown in Bihar||PATNA: BJP leader and state revenue and land reforms minister Ram Surat Kumar on Friday demanded imposition of complete lockdown in the state in the wake of rapid rise in Covid-19 cases. Earlier, BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal had demanded weekend lockdown and said night curfew imposed by the state government was not enough to cope with the situation. Talking to a select group of reporters, minister Ram said the situation in the state was very grim and complete lockdown appeared to be the only solution to check the spread of the deadly virus. The minister said he was getting frequent calls from people from his constituency Aurai in Muzaffarpur district and also from some other districts to help them in securing admission either in the government facility or in private hospitals. He admitted that the beds in hospitals were not sufficient to deal with the cases reported in the state every day. “If immediate measures are not taken, the situation may turn for a worse in days to come,” Kumar added. He, however, clarified that the central government has left the option to take preventive measures to the state governments depending on the severity of the Covid crisis. The demand of the two-term BJP MLA from Aurai assumes significance in the wake of recent statement of the state BJP chief, who expressed his displeasure over night curfew imposed by the state government on April 18, inviting sharp reaction from ally JD(U). Upendra Kushwaha, who had recently joined JD(U), advised Dr Jaiswal not to indulge in politics. Even JD(U) MP from Munger Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh reacted to Jaiswal’s statement and said CM Nitish Kumar will do whatever he feels is in the interest of the state. BJP leader and state panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary had defended Jaisawal. “Sanjay Jaiswal ji is a doctor and he can assess the situation in a better way,” Choudhary had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-min-demands-lockdown-in-state/articleshow/82220947.cms||Ramashankar
---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: Plight of homeless with mental illness worsens in second wave||VISAKHAPATNAM: A lack of adequate rehabilitation shelters coupled with legal complexities in hospital admission has worsened the situation of homeless persons with mental illnesses amid the raging second wave of the pandemic. Psychiatrists say there are over 200 such homeless people in Vizag city. Dr Ramanand Satapathy, professor of psychiatry at Government Hospital for Mental Care (GHMC) Visakhapatnam, who has rescued and had many such patients treated, said, “As per the new Mental Health Care Act, 2017, police can directly bring such homeless and mentally unwell persons to the hospital, procure a reception order from the magistrate and get them admitted. Since they do not have any Aadhaar or ID cards and are unable to recall their addresses, it becomes difficult for them to get government pension of Rs 2,000 and benefits of any social welfare schemes. In one case, a patient could not be given hearing aid from a government hospital as she had no Aadhaar card or address proof. Despite reception orders with the police, patients are not admitted after 2 pm at GHMC and often there is delay in getting reception orders from the magistrate.” A number of such patients are often found loitering near the railway station, bus stations and KGH bus stop. Doctors say most of them are either schizophrenic or bipolar and can get improve if proper treatment is administered. “The need of the hour is inter-departmental coordination among police, judiciary, social and disability welfare departments, NGOs and doctors to streamline the admission and treatment process of such patients, setting up rehabilitation shelter for them and ensure they get some ID proofs to avail social welfare schemes and disability pension,” added Dr Satapathy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/plight-of-homeless-with-mental-illness-worsens-in-second-wave/articleshow/82220962.cms||Sulogna Mehta
---||Vijayawada||Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy credits Rs 1,109crore under YSR Sunna Vaddi||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday credited Rs 1,109 crore directly into the accounts of 1.02 crore women belonging to Self-Help Groups (SHGs) as interest reimbursement under the YSR Sunna Vaddi scheme. This is the second consecutive year that the state government has paid the interest share to women on their bank loans. The chief minister said that the state government is committed to women empowerment and has rolled out schemes such as zero interest, Aasara, Cheyutha and Jeva Kranthi to strengthen women in all aspects. He said that the SHG women have been burdened with over Rs 3,000 crore as penal interest by the previous government, believing it would waive their loans as promised during the 2014 polls. Unlike the previous government, the YSRC government had credited Rs 1,400 crore under YSR Sunna Vaddi in the first year benefiting over 87 lakh women, he said, adding that the number of SHGs under the scheme was increased to 9.34 lakh from the earlier 8.71 lakh because of the confidence in the current government. In order to empower women, under YSR Cheyutha Rs 18,750 financial assistance was given for BC, SC, ST and minority community women over the age of 45 years every year at an expenditure of Rs 4,604 crore. Additionally, Rs 6,792 crore was spent on the YSR Aasara scheme and the government also tied up with multinational companies such as ITC, P&G and Amul for providing business opportunities to women. The state government has also taken up prohibition on alcohol in a phased manner to prevent domestic violence and closed over 43,000 illegal shops, 4,380 permit rooms and limited wine shops to only 2,966.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-credits-rs-1109cr-under-ysr-sunna-vaddi/articleshow/82220917.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Patna||Bihar: Demand for oxygen plant in Bhagalpur||BHAGALPUR: Amid reports of crisis of oxygen supply in hospitals and private nursing homes for Covid-19 patients as well as for people in home quarantine, residents of Bhagalpur, including a group of social activists, have demanded immediate establishment of an oxygen plant in the town. Need for three oxygen plants at government hospitals which include Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH), upcoming Super Specialty Hospital at Barari and sadar hospital and as promoting private production units for supplying to private hospitals, nursing homes and for patients in home quarantine has been advocated by various citizens’ groups. Dr Ajay Kuamr Singh, a paediatrician and social activist said maintaining oxygen level is extremely important to save Covid-19 patients, therefore any shortage in oxygen supply or its crisis both in government and private healthcare establishments should be sorted out. Health department sources, however, said med oxygen supply at JLNMCH is done through a pipeline by an outsourcing agency. Two private production plants also supply medical oxygen but the shortfall is due to sudden spike in demand. JLNMCH medical superintendent Dr Kumar Gaurav said, “Oxygen supply in the hospital is done by an outsourcing agency. The demand is definitely more at present due to the surge in Covid patients needing oxygen support. However, we are not facing any shortage," he said. Bhagalpur civil surgeon Dr Umesh Sharma said it would be definitely better if the state government sets up an oxygen plant at any of the government hospitals here. "At present two private oxygen plants supply oxygen in Bhagalpur," he added Meanwhile, the district administration has taken steps to regulate adequate supply of oxygen to JLNMCH and other hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/demand-for-o2-plant-in-bhagalpur/articleshow/82220932.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Patna||Steep rise in demand for medicines and machines||PATNA: Residents are finding it difficult to get several basic medicines and personal medical care equipment amid the massive surge in Covid cases in the state. Pharmacists admit the shortage of several medicines and equipment amid a sudden spike in demand. Not only people with Covid symptoms but those fit and fine are also buying medicines out of fear of shortage and machines to regularly monitor their oxygen saturation level, pulse rate, temperature, blood pressure and sugar levels. Accordingly, the demand for medical equipment, such as pulse oximeter, thermometer, nebulizer, blood pressure, glucometer, portable oxygen cylinders and steam inhalers has increased. Similar has been the surge in demand for several antibiotics, multivitamins and zinc tablets. Rajesh Arya, secretary at Patna Chemist and Druggist Association, said even though the supply of antibiotics and other vitamin tablets was being made daily from the dealers, the demand for the same was still on the higher side. “Similar is the situation with regard to demand for personal medical care equipment, leading to shortage in the market,” he said. When asked about the comparative figures of demand from previous year, Arya said it has increased massively this month. “People are considering oxygen cylinders as an essential because they might require it in case someone in the family is tested positive for Covid. Thus, a tendency of hoarding is also being witnessed,” he said. Deepak Kumar, the owner of a medical shop in Kankarbagh, told this newspaper that the supply of antibiotics is not sufficient as per the current demand. “Multivitamins are easily available in the stores depending on the composition of the supplements, but the sales of other medical products have increased rapidly,” he said. Aryan Sinha, a resident of Mithapur, said: “We couldn’t buy a pulse oximeter and few other medical devices at once. We had to enquire about their availability several times and bought them from different places, including e-commerce websites.” The main concern of Anjali Kumari of Khagaul road is for her parents and kids as they are more sensitive. “Keeping a track of their oxygen level, pulse rate and temperature is mandatory at home,” she said. “Also, the second wave is more risky. So, taking all measures at once is better than roaming around the streets without fear of getting in contact with Covid-19,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/steep-rise-in-demand-for-medicines-and-machines/articleshow/82221004.cms||---
---||Business||Covid: Bankers seek frontline worker sops||MUMBAI: Bankers, particularly those in the public sector, are facing the brunt of the second wave of the pandemic. Most bank jobs are customerfacing and classified as essential services. But the bankers have been denied facilities for frontline workers like vaccination and access to public transport. At the same time, they are under pressure to complete the annual exercises relating to audits, annual accounts, and transfers. In Mumbai, where most of the banks are headquartered, the railway authorities have said that employees of central government public sector undertakings can travel by train. But bankers complain that authorities are restricting them from boarding local trains. Private bank employees, on the other hand, are not allowed to travel at all. “Most of the junior executives are not able to afford the city rentals and travel from distant suburbs. It is punishing for them to travel 30-40kms by road,” said a senior official at a private bank. In February, the Indian Banks Association (IBA) had written to the government, seeking priority vaccination for bank employees. The letter had pointed out that 600 bank employees had died due to the pandemic and that mortality rates of bankers on account of Covid was four times higher than the general population. Another reason why public sector banks are badly hit is the low-level of adoption of digital by their customers. Bank employees, meanwhile, want that some of the annual rituals to be delayed given the situation. Last year, Sebi had extended the time for submission of financial results for the quarter ended March 31 to July 31 because of the lockdown. Bank staff are also under pressure to follow up on collections from small businesses as delinquencies are likely, given that businesses in major cities have been shut for a large part of April. In terms of government guidelines, banks are required to complete all their transfers promotions and postings by June 2021. Employees who are posted in their hometowns are fearful of taking up transfers to metros amid the pandemic. But at the same time, there are a set of employees who have been posted to metros and are waiting to be transferred back after completing their stint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bankers-seek-frontline-worker-sops/articleshow/82222151.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||Mental health key to surviving Covid fear, say psychologists||PATNA: The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is taking a toll on the mental health of people, psychologists and counsellors have warned and suggest that mental health is key to survive this scourge is more important now than ever. Patna University’s psychology department head Md Iftekhar Hussain says people should not allow negative thoughts to linger. "Several people have indeed been infected by the Covid-19 pandemic in the recent past, but it is also true that a vast majority of them have fully recovered. So dwelling only on the negatives is not helpful," he says. Hussain suggests that people should hold onto simpler joys of life and keep in contact with friends and do basic things that will keep them positive. They should read interesting books of their choice and watch movies, especially comedies to keep themselves engaged. “With the overwhelming amount of coverage surrounding this pandemic on social media, TV and the radio, it is pretty easy to pick up on the fear pandemic that runs alongside this virus. It’s very frustrating that there’s no active power from the leading authorities to encourage a more positive approach alongside this challenging time,” Hussain adds. Patna College psychology department’s professor Sheo Sagar Prasad holds that the fear psychosis arising from the pandemic is limited to urban people mostly. Labourers, industry workers and farmers are least concerned about the pandemic and they are leading a carefree life. He feels people should limit their media intake. Being completely absorbed in the media during this time will do them no good. There are very few people that can spend hours and hours in front of negativity without feeling the impact, he says. “Fear will not change the situation, it will only weaken our fight against the situation. We should protect ourselves as much as we can from conversations, environments and technology that engulf us in these negative frequencies,” Prasad adds. Retired civil surgeon and, mental health counsellor, Dr Kumkum Prasad says that instead of reading or watching saddening news, people should focus on positives as much as they can. On social media, they should share posts, captions and comments that are positive. Positive thoughts and emotions are known to boost our immune system, also giving us an increased power in overcoming the virus should it come our way. If people find spare time, they should try to learn a new language online or buy an online cookbook and try some new healthy, immune-boosting recipes. They can also join some online yoga classes or mediation sessions and remain free from all anxieties of the world, Prasad adds. Psychological counsellor R N Chaturvedi suggests that people should take up yogic exercises and meditation besides following their hobbies more vigorously as they have got plenty of free time now. They should always keep themselves busy in some constructive works and never allow any negative thoughts to creep in. They should take not of only positive developments going on both at local and global level and try to stay happy. “Be aesthetic and believe in God,” he adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mental-health-key-to-surviving-covid-fear-say-psychologists/articleshow/82220966.cms||B K Mishra

Ramesh Kumar Mishra, a middle-school teacher in Patna, is one such individual who is providing free meals to those unable to cook or get food as either all or several members in their families are Covid positive. As entire family is getting infected with the virus in many cases in the second wave of the pandemic, Mishra provides home-cooked food to hundreds of such families in the city despite the risk of catching the virus and facing financial stress. “Being a responsible citizen, it is our duty to help those facing crisis. I have seen how relatives and friends avoid helping families infected with Covid. This prompted me to do something for such families. I am reaching out to them with home-cooked food,” he added. Mishra said he was also providing oxygen cylinders and essential medicines to the poor in Kankarbagh locality. “I bear the expenses through my own income as I am not associated with any NGO or residents’ association,” he said. Madhukar Sharma, employee of a private firm, said his father-in-law’s life could be saved only due to timely supply of oxygen cylinder by Mishra. “I found Mishraji’s cellphone number on a social media platform and contacted him. He took prompt action and provided an oxygen cylinder to my father-in-law. Even though we requested him several times to take money, he just refused,” Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/schoolteacher-providing-free-meal-oxygen-to-covid-victims/articleshow/82221044.cms||---

Of the 194 MT of oxygen to be supplied per day to the state, 160 MT will come from Jharkhand and West Bengal, while the remaining 34 MT of oxygen will be available per day from its own resources, SuMo said. In a communique, SuMo said as much as 120 MT of oxygen supply per day will be made from the plants located in Jharkhand, including 70 MT from Bokaro and 50 MT from Jamshedpur. Similarly, as much as 40 MT of oxygen will be supplied per day from the plants at Durgapur and Burnpur in West Bengal. SuMo said Bihar has been included among 19 states whose oxygen quota supply has been fixed at 6,722 MT. He added the crisis of unavailability of oxygen is not due to its scarcity, but the shortage of tankers required for the transportation of oxygen. As to the RT-PCR tests conducted for Covid-19 infection, SuMo said the test report should be supplied in 24 hours, which will help the patients to have timely treatment against the infection, if it happened. In his tweet, SuMo thanked PM Modi for resuming the free of cost foodgrain supply to the poor families under PM Garib Kalyan Yojana due to the economic disruptions caused by the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. As many as Rs26,000 crore has been allotted for the supply of free foodgrain to 80 crore poor persons in the country, which will also benefit 1.75 crore poor in the state. Under the central scheme, every poor person will get 5kg of free foodgrain for five months. During the pandemic last year, the poor were given 40kg of foodgrain in eight months and the benefit was provided even during the festive season in October-November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-to-get-160-mt-of-oxygen-from-jharkhand-bengal-daily/articleshow/82220825.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Violation of safety norms reason for Covid spike in Gaya: Experts||GAYA: Uncontrolled movement of people not following the Covid protocol is one of the biggest reasons behind Gaya reporting a large number of Covid cases in the state after Patna. Experts feel that there is an urgent need for spreading awareness among the people about Covid safety norms and preventive steps. Since Gaya is the transit point in south Bihar, it is considered as an emerging Covid hotspot. The town is well connected by road, rail and air route from other parts of the country and it falls on the grand chord section of railways from where long distance trains of major stations like, Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Indore and others cross. The Grand Trunk (GT) road connecting major cities of the country also crosses Gaya. According to district health society figures, 911 positive cases were reported here on April 16, followed by 849 on April 20, 851 on April 19, 791 on April 22, 709 on April 17, 600 on April 18, 593 on April 21 and 548 on April 15. The number of active cases doubled during the last one week. Active cases on April 15 were 3,041, which increased 7,146 on April 22. Out of 12,84,396 tests conducted, 15,474 have tested positive. While 8,681 recovered, 73 deaths have been reported in the district. Indian Medical Association (IMA) Gaya unit’s former president and eminent physician Ramsewak Singh said, "A large number of people work as daily wage workers outside the state, who came home on Holi. These people did not follow the Covid preventive norms and it might have resulted in surge of positive cases. Now the ratio of mild and the critical cases is 50:50. There is an urgent need to ensure adequate availability of oxygen in the hospitals to control the rising number of deaths", he said. IMA Gaya unit incumbent president Khwaja Ahmad Waseem Jaan too echoed similar views. He said, "People are not following the Covid preventive norms. They need to understand the situation, otherwise it is going to worsen resulting in shortage of beds and the oxygen in hospitals". Ajay Kumar Sinha, retired assistant general manager, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), Bokaro said, "The reason behind surge in cases is clearly visible in markets areas where people can be seen violating Covid prevention norms. During Chaiti Chhath, people thronged the ghats turning a deaf ear to the appeal of the administration to celebrate the festival at home. Still some people can be seen on the roads without mask.” Meanwhile, Gaya Municipal Corporation (GMC) mayor Virendra Kumar and deputy mayor Mohan Shrivastava launched an awareness campaign in the town area on Friday. Various localities of the town were sanitized. They also appealed to the people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour for their safety and cooperate with the administration to break the transmission chain of the deadly virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/violation-of-safety-norms-reason-for-covid-spike-in-gaya-experts/articleshow/82220836.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC seeks data on Corona victims who are smokers, mulls ban on cigarettes||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has directed the State and central governments to give its response and data regarding Covid victims who are addicted to smoking. “If this is an issue which would matter and is fatal to the health of the citizens, we are of the opinion that measures would be required to ban sale of cigarettes and bidis during the pandemic,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni in their order released on Friday. On Thursday, the court while hearing a PIL on the shortage of remdesivir injection, oxygen, bed and delayed tests had wondered if a ban could be put “at least till the Covid crisis is over.” “As it is, we are posed with a national challenge. Covid is a national challenge,” the CJ had remarked. In their order, the judges recorded, “We are equally concerned as to whether the persons affected by Covid and have become critical are persons smoking cigarettes and bidis since it is well known that Covid affects the lungs, and weak lungs are affected more severely.” They noted that while there are studies undertaken on this aspect, “there is no information available in the public domain.” The judges also directed the state to take a decision within a week and grant permissions to more laboratories to undertake RT-PCR rapid antigen tests. The state and Centre are directed to ensure remdesivir is supplied to all affected patients at the hospital/Covid center. “The patient or his relatives shall not be made to run from pillar to post to find out/locate the drug,” they said, adding that a nodal agent must be appointed with 24x7 operational helpline and staff to undertake remdesivir supply. The judges noted, “We would be failing in our duty if we do not appreciate the steps taken by the central and state governments. But our concern is also to the duty of every citizens towards the society, which, in our opinion appears to have been neglected and is one of the reasons for the second wave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-seeks-data-on-corona-victims-who-are-smokers-mulls-ban-on-cigarettes/articleshow/82223244.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Social organisations working on the ground say that the lack of medical care is resulting in many losing their lives, every day. “Hospitals are running out of beds with oxygen facilities. I have been receiving calls 24/7 on the Sakina Foundation’s helpline from those in need of oxygen cylinders,” said Mohammed Asif Hussain Sohail. “The fact that the cost of oxygen cylinders has shot through the roof -- they are now being sold for Rs 30,000 and the cost of refilling has gone up to Rs 2,500 – has only made matters worse,” Sohail said. “I am also receiving calls from hospitals requesting oxygen cylinders. Many of them are turning away patients due to the lack of it,” he added. Sohail says he has already spent more than Rs 10 lakh from his own savings to buy cylinders for the needy. “I have also been counselling people against hoarding them unnecessarily. I am providing the cylinders only after verifying that the requirement is genuine,” he said, urging the government to step forward to help those in need and put an end to the black marketing of critical medical equipment and medicines. Among those who had to bear the brunt of this shortage is the family of Fareed. “One of my relatives was sent back to her house, despite being in critical condition. She needed oxygen but failed to get it on time,” he said.Meanwhile, the All India Majlis-e-Inqualib-e Millat president, Syed Taraq Quadri, has requested that the Asra Hospital be used for Covid treatment in the Old City. He appealed government to take immediate measures to address the poor medical facilities available to patients there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/poor-facilities-lack-of-oxygen-haunts-old-city-residents/articleshow/82222309.cms||---

The family members of Hasan alleged he died due to negligence by the LLR hospital staff. As per the family members, Hasan was unwell since the past two days. "After my father complained of a severe cough followed by breathlessness and dip in his oxygen level on April 21, we admitted him to Lala Lajpat Rai hospital. Initially hospital authorities arranged for oxygen, but after four hours of treatment, they removed the facility saying that now he is doing well and there is no need of oxygen anymore," alleged his elder son Salim Hasan while talking to reporters. Salim, however, said that it was again when his father's condition started deteriorating, he and his other members of the family wandered in the hospital asking doctors to give him oxygen, but in vain. "We went around approaching doctors telling them that Hasan is elder son of Abdul Hamid, hero of the 1965 India-Pakistan War, but all our pleas fell on deaf ears, and in the absence of better treatment and oxygen, he breathed his last at around 3 am," Salim alleged further and added, "After admitting none at the hospital even bothered to test him for Covid." Ali Hasan, elder son of the hero of 1965 India-Pakistan War at the battlefield of Asal Uttar by Company Quarter Master Havaldar Abdul Hamid, who was awarded the Param Vir Chakra (posthumously), used to live with his family in Syed nagar area of the city. He used to work at the Ordnance Equipment factory in the City and retired recently. "We have come to know about the issue, we will look and inquire into the matter soon," said principal GSVM RB Kamal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/war-heros-son-dies-of-alleged-negligence-at-kanpur-hospital/articleshow/82221904.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘CM was right about second wave, but what did he do?’||Mumbai: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had warned of a second Covid wave in the state as early as November 2020. The BJP has now sought accountability from the CM asking him what measures he implemented in the last five months to tackle the second wave. “Thackeray had accurately estimated in November last year that there would be a second wave, and he mentioned it in his address to the state when referring to the second wave in Europe at the time. Again on February 22, he said that we would know in the next 8-10 days if the second wave had arrived in the state,” said BJP leader Madhav Bhandari. If the state government had started installing oxygen plants at all public hospitals then, there would not have been the need to go begging for oxygen from other states now, said Bhandari.  “That remdesivir inje ction is required for the treatment of Covid-19 patients was known in the first wave. The government should have procured these injections over the last five months,” Bhandari added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-was-right-about-second-wave-but-what-did-he-do/articleshow/82223257.cms||---

The oxygen tanker was brought under police escort to save time in transportation. “The tanker driver, on our request, drove non-stop from Bokaro and reached Varanasi in around 12.30 hours instead of 14 hours to save lives of patients,” said district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma. He said that the police escort vehicle was sent by the Varanasi commissioner of police. The team met the tanker near Dehri-on-Sone and escorted it from there. The DM said,” The tanker was taken to Medi Tech plant Ram Nagar for filling the liquid oxygen. The Medi Tech plant was shut after it had run out of stock. The plant immediately started working after liquid oxygen was filled and would fill cylinders of hospitals waiting there.” The DM said that 800 cylinders would be filled on Friday, while another 800 cylinders would be filled on Saturday for hospital supply. “Presently, around 3,800 cylinders are being filled at six oxygen plants situated in Chandauli district per day against the daily increased requirement of 5,000 -6,000 cylinders,” he added. According to the DM, another consignment of liquid medical oxygen is expected to reach Varanasi by Oxygen Express by Friday night. The Oxygen Express run by the Indian Railways to fight against Covid-19 has already left for Bokaro from Lucknow via Varanasi on Thursday to fulfil the requirements of medical oxygen in Uttar Pradesh. For the uninterrupted movement of the train, a green corridor was created between Lucknow and Varanasi. Officials said an oxygen plant will be established at the Shiv Prasad Gupta Divisional Hospital with MLA fund provided by UP Minister Neelkanth Tiwari. The minister said he has issued a letter in this regard. MLC AK Sharma also held a meeting with the authorities of the Trauma Centre of Banaras Hindu University and Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital to increase the number of oxygenated beds for Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/oxygen-tanker-from-bokaro-reaches-city-under-police-escort/articleshow/82222461.cms||---

If not, you can take a lesson from Biplab Chatterjee and Samrat Bhowmik. Both have been friends for more than a decade. Their pre-Covid day roster included a weekly stay at each other’s house, a schedule to which they had returned after the first wave of the pandemic subsided. But, from April onwards, they are back to their routine of holding online calls with friends and sharing an “adda session” on Sunday evenings. Shopping malls and popular street markets have suddenly gone quiet as an eerie silence has gripped even the entertainment pockets, including Salt Lake and Park Street. The bars, pubs and restaurants have reported diminishing footfall over the weekends. With the massive spurt in cases and cry over non-availability of hospital beds, many residents have decided to confine themselves at homes. “We have visited theatres and often caught up on weekend dinners after the Covid crisis improved since November. On usual weekends, we even stayed at each other’s homes. But, from April onwards, we have stopped the get-togethers,” Chatterjee said. His friend Bhowmick added that primarily the decision was to ensure safety for the senior citizen parents at home. day Sarkar, who runs a watch-repairing and selling store in New Market said: “We are closing the shop early since customers are rare in the evening.” Some of the prominent brands in shopping malls have started calling up their customers and assuring them safe home-delivery. “There is no additional cost. We want our patrons to stay safe, but also promise to offer them the best service, sitting at home,” said a sales executive of a luxury Indian cosmetics, skincare and perfume company at South City Mall. The movie theatres have started cancelling shows as well. “After overcoming initial scare, we had decided to watch a film in the theatres this month. But, now, again I am scared to take my child to watch films and have promised her of long movie nights on Fridays on the movie streaming networks,” said Ushashie Sinha, mother of an eight-year old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/many-opt-for-voluntary-lockdown-as-cov-surges/articleshow/82221617.cms||Somdatta Basu

Assistant commissioner of police Govind Nagar Vikas Kumar Pandey said, “We have scanned call detail records of Apoorva's mobile phone number. We have procured six phone numbers of all the people hailing from Varanasi. Now, we are investigating who among these six people is the supplier of 265 Remdesivir injections, and who has been in constant touch with Apoorva. We are also zeroing in on the person who had travelled from Varanasi to Kanpur to handover the vials to Mohan Soni, one among the three persons, who were arrested in Kanpur on April 15." Ramdesivir is a key medicine used in the treatment of coronavirus, and with the spurt in Covid-19 cases in the state, its injections are in high demand. Taking advantage of the shortage, some people have been selling the medication at high prices in the black market. To recall, the Kanpur unit of Special Task Force (STF) had on Thursday arrested three people with 265 Remdesivir injections meant for sale in the black market. DCP (South) Raveena Tyagi had stated that one Prashant Shukla of Naubasta’s Pashupati Nagar and Baktauri Purwa, resident Mohan Soni, were initially arrested. The 265 vials had been wrapped inside a sari packet. On the tip-off provided by the two, the STF sleuths had later arrested Yamuna Nagar resident Sachin Kumar, she added. Police have announced to invoke National Security Act (NSA) against the three persons arrested while carrying 265 Remdesivir injection vials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/remdesivir-injections-seizurepolice-zero-in-on-six-people-hailing-from-varanasi/articleshow/82221846.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Patna||Bihar: ‘Strict curbs, not lockdown, need of hour’||PATNA: As the state fights one of the toughest health battles of recent times, it’s like double whammy for people who are not just hit by Covid pandemic but also financial stress. They are in favour of imposition of strict curbs, not lockdown, to break the Covid chain. Unlike neighbouring Jharkhand or New Delhi, lockdown has not been enforced in Bihar. However, certain fresh curbs were announced by the state government last Sunday and subsequent orders issued by authorities in different districts have led to curtailed commercial and business activities. Several districts, including Patna, are allowing shops to open in a staggered manner. President of Bihar Industry Association (BIA) Ram Lal Khaitan said the state was not in a position to face another lockdown. “The government should deal with the current scenario more cautiously. Constant check is required for availability of essential medicines and beds in hospitals for serious Covid patients,” Khaitan said, adding vaccination is the only solution to the prevailing situation. Advocate Somali Acharya said while curbs were need of the hour, the government should also look after the financial well-being of people. “I don’t believe total lockdown is a solution to everything. The government should come up with strong mechanism to curb the spread of virus without burdening people with financial stress,” she said. “Lockdown does help in breaking the chain of the virus, but awareness about Covid-appropriate behaviour is equally essential. Awareness drives should be carried out effectively to convince people to take vaccine jabs and follow Covid protocols,” said a shopkeeper at Ram Nagari Colony wishing anonymity. Mary Alphonsa, principal of Don Bosco Academy, said the government should ensure strict implementation of restrictions. “Norms are still being flouted by many people. The administration should take action against such people,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/strict-curbs-not-lockdown-need-of-hour/articleshow/82221076.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||VMRDA plot auction may set benchmark in land price||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) is currently inviting applications for the auction of 30 plots in its Fortune Hills Layout in Dakamarri and another 12 odd-shaped plots in various other layouts. For two bits in Madhurawada, the development agency has fixed an exorbitant upset price of Rs 96,000 per square yard. While the private commercial bits are being sold at about Rs 70,000 to Rs 80,000 per square yard, the regular plots fetch about Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000 in Madhurawada area based on the location and permissions. A triangle bit in Madhavadhara Layout would go under the hammer at an upset price of Rs 66,000. Two odd plots in Vizianagaram would have a base price of Rs 12,000 per square yard. A number of plots in Kapuluppada, Pedagantyada, Rushikonda, Anakapalli, etc. would also be auctioned. The urban development authority set an upset price of Rs 17,000 per square yard for the Dakamarri plots, when the private developers are currently selling the plots in the vicinity at about Rs 10,000 to Rs 13,000. When VMRDA had auctioned plots in the same layout with an upset price of Rs 10,000 about four years ago, several plots were sold at a premium price of Rs 13,000 to Rs 15,000. Even now, based on the same estimates, the prices in Dakamarri layout may go beyond Rs 20,000 per square yard. This may set a new benchmark in land prices on the north side of the city, which is expected to get the key offices of the executive capital once it is shifted to Visakhapatnam. Speaking to TOI, joint secretary, Credai-Andhra Pradesh chapter, P Koteswara Rao, said that the plots in the nearby layouts of Fortune Hills are sold at some Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000. “As the upset price was fixed at Rs 17,000, the prices may go beyond that in the auction,” said Koteswara Rao. Even in 2019, when the VMRDA had auctioned several plots, scattered in parts of Vizag city and suburbs, fetched an unexpected and record revenue. Several land bits, particularly those located northeastwards of the city, had seen hectic bidding. A plot located in MVP Colony of the city, measuring 387 square yards, had received the highest bid at Rs 1,08,700 per square yard against the upset price of Rs 56,400 fixed by the VMRDA. Setting a new record of Rs 95,960 per square yard in the Madhurawada area, a 230 square yard land parcel had fetched a record Rs 2 crore to the VMRDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vmrda-plot-auction-may-set-benchmark-in-land-price/articleshow/82220894.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The boy was identified as Nitesh Kumar Naman, the son of Vijay Lal Choudhary, 45, of the slum area at Malahipakdi under Kankarbagh police station area in the state capital. Kankarbagh police station SHO Ravishankar Kumar said Naman’s 12-year-old sister Manvi woke up early Friday morning to find him lying lifeless on the floor and she raised an alarm. He said the accused was arrested from another location in Kankarbagh with the help of locals. SHO Kumar said police found Naman’s limbs tied. “It seems his father thrashed him for several hours until he fell unconscious and died. Probably he received some grievous internal injuries,” he said. He said prima facie police have come to know that Naman had gone out on Thursday night with a friend. “His father was angry with him for roaming around and tied his limbs soon after he returned home and started thrashing his son,” he said. Quoting Manvi and a few neighbours, the SHO said Vijay used to thrash both his children frequently. He said Vijay’s third wife Shanti Devi lodged an FIR against him for killing Naman. The SHO said Manvi and Naman were born from his second wife Mantoshi Devi, who had died eight years ago. “Vijay’s first wife lives separately in Khagaria. The accused works as a daily wager and makes ends meet somehow,” he said. The SHO said the body was handed over to the family and further investigation was going on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-beats-son-to-death-for-roaming-with-friend/articleshow/82220916.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna HC to issue email address to receive complaints from people||PATNA: The Patna high court will put out an email address for people to directly write to the court administration if any Covid-19 patient across the state is denied admission in any government or private hospital on grounds of oxygen shortage or if any hospital is facing oxygen shortage. A division bench while hearing a batch of PILs over the grim Covid-19 situation with oxygen crisis, lack of beds and medicines and other issues on Friday evening, said the high court would generate its own email address, which is expected to be announced by Saturday. The high court administration would process the complaints received on email and contact the DMs concerned or the health department for taking necessary steps. The court also directed the state to develop a grievance redressal platform by Monday for people to complain about issues they are facing. Meanwhile, the high court remained dissatisfied with the data shown by the state government over oxygen availability which gave an overall picture that there was no oxygen crisis at all. The high court, observing its data as confusing, directed the state government to submit a detailed counter affidavit on the daily requirement, generation and supply of oxygen to each and every district across Bihar. The HC also asked the state government about the details of plants in the state which generate medical oxygen from its liquified form. The high court also directed additional solicitor general KN Singh to seek instruction from the Centre on how it plans to fulfil the amount of oxygen required by Bihar every day. Supreme court senior counsel Ranjit Kumar appearing for the state submitted before the bench that a quota of 194 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen per day has been fixed for Bihar but only 60 or 70 metric tonnes are being provided per day by the Centre. The high court also directed the state government to resolve the issue of clearance for land to set up pressure swing absorption (PSA) oxygen plants at Sitamarhi and Aurangabad by the Centre. It directed the Centre to expedite the transport of equipment for setting up one such plant in Araria. The court directed the Centre to expedite the process of setting up nine more PSA plants at different locations in Bihar whose proposal has already been sent by the state. Court also vented its ire at the state saying even after repeated directions, no action has been taken yet to make Covid-19 patients aware of what kind of facilities are available for them and where.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-to-issue-email-address-to-receive-complaints-from-people/articleshow/82221760.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Business||American Express, Diners Club can’t add customers||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday barred American Express Banking Corporation and Diners Club International from issuing new cards. The directive was a penalty for the two networks not adhering to the central bank’s norms on storing data within India. What this means is that American Express and other banks that issue cards under the Amex network can no longer issue these to new customers. Further, new Diners Club cards, which is issued by HDFC Bank, can also not be given. The order added that this will not impact existing customers, which means that cards can be renewed, and lost ones replaced. In April 2018, the RBI had asked all payment system providers to ensure that within six months, all data relating to payment systems operated by them is stored onshore in India. Although the initial deadline was September 2018, the process of ensuring compliance turned out to be a long-drawn one as card companies initially lobbied for relaxation of regulations. The card companies said that by preventing data from being sent outside, banks would be denied fraud prevention analytics, which is obtained by gathering experiences across the world. The RBI subsequently clarified that while data could be sent abroad for processing, the same should be brought back to India within 24 hours and deleted from offshore computers. In India, the card industry consists of issuing bank and the payment networks, which are dominated by RuPay, Visa and Mastercard. While Visa and Mastercard have stated that they are compliant with the norms, RBI’s circular makes it clear that Amex and Diners Club did not comply. “These entities have been found non-compliant with the directions on Storage of Payment System Data,” the RBI said. It clarified that both these entities are being penalised in their role as payment system operators authorised to operate card networks in the country under the Payments and Systems Settlements Act, 2007. Amex, besides being a network operator, also has a bank licence in India. However, it uses the bank licence only to issue credit cards. These networks will have to now report compliance to the RBI and submit a board-approved system audit report (SAR) conducted by a CERT-In empanelled auditor within the timelines specified therein. An Amex spokesperson said, “We have been in regular dialogue with the Reserve Bank of India about data localisation requirements and have demonstrated our progress towards complying with the regulation. While we’re disappointed that the RBI has taken this course of action, we are working with them to resolve their concerns as quickly as possible. This does not impact the services that we offer to our existing customers in India, and our customers can continue to use and accept our cards as normal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/amex-diners-club-cant-add-customers/articleshow/82222135.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Former AP Minister Alapati Rajendra Prasad booked for criminal intimidation||VIJAYAWADA: Former minister Alapati Rajendra Prasad has been booked at Mangalagiri Rural Police Station in Guntur district on Friday for allegedly intimidating NRI Medical College chairman Nimmagadda Upendra. According to Mangalagiri Rural police, the TDP leader had a dispute with the NRI Medical College chairman after his brother Ravi was sacked as the director, citing differences. Claiming the decision to be arbitrary and unfair, Rajendra Prasad filed a petition in court where hearing on the matter is still going on. However, NRI Medical College sources said that Rajendra Prasad had in 2019 allegedly threatened and even broken furniture in the hospital before leaving the premises. Nimmagadda Upendra had lodged a complaint with Mangalagiri police on Wednesday night. After a brief investigation, a case has been registered against Rajendra Prasad under sections 506, 558, 170 of IPC at Mangalagiri Rural police station. Meanwhile, reacting to the case, Rajendra Prasad criticised chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, claiming that so far six arrests have taken place against TDP leaders. He also referred to the earlier arrest of Dhulipala Narendra by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) as a case in point.

---||Goa||Goa varsity calls meet with college principals on Monday||PANAJI: The state government on April 21 declared that schools and colleges in Goa will remain shut for students upto April 30, to control the spread of Covid-19 infection. To discuss the various academic issues that have arisen due to the curbs, Goa University has summoned a meeting on Monday afternoon with principals of all general stream graduate colleges in Goa. Students of first and second year of BA, BSc, BCom, BBA, BCA programmes are unlikely to be affected by the restrictions as it was already decided that all classes and assessments for these years will be conducted online. However, practicals for final year science students were in progress when the state government announced the restrictions, based on the advice of the disaster management authorities. “It was earlier decided that practicals should be held physically for final year students, because how can they graduate without having handled the lab apparatus for the entire third year? Classes were also presently on for some subjects like mathematics wherever required by maintaining social distancing. But as Covid-19 cases are rising, it may be too early to chalk out our future course of action,” a college official said. The assessment for final year students’ project work was also scheduled to begin from May 5 onwards. All these issues are likely to be discussed at the meeting to be chaired by GU vice-chancellor Varun Sahni on Monday. “The exams of final year students are scheduled in July in the offline mode, which is a long time away and situation may normalise by then. But one of their internal semester assessments (ISA) were to take place in the physical mode, which some colleges have completed and others were yet to conduct. This has led to some disparities, which need to be sorted out now,” said a source. It had been the insistence of college principals that at least one of the four ISAs for final year students should be conducted offline, as these students have gone through their third year without attending college regularly at all during 2020 and 2021. “The final year students are above the age of 18. Many of them will now be eligible for their vaccines and hopefully at least part of the assessments for the year can be held in the offline mode, so colleges can be sure of the quality of students that are graduating. If the Class X and XII exams are set to take place in the offline mode, surely final year students are in a better position to answer some assessments physically,” said a college head.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/varsity-calls-meet-with-college-principals-on-mon/articleshow/82223238.cms||---

A majority of patients (over 72%) in the PMR are in home isolation.Recoveries in the PMR stood at 67% in the first week of this month (April 1-7), rose to 82% in the April 8-14 period and further shot up by 12% to touch 94% in April 15-21 week, data released by the district health office (DHO) has revealed.According to the data, as many as 72,377 patients recovered in PMR between April 15 and 21 while 77,339 fresh cases were added. From April 1 to 7, as many as 46,500 patients had recovered in the region as compared to around 69,600 fresh cases, while in the subsequent week (April 8-14), the number of recoveries increased to 58,700 as against the addition of 71,900 cases, the data showed.In fact, for the last three consecutive days, PMR has recorded higher number of recoveries than fresh infections. Most of these recoveries have been reported from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. A rise in discharges has pushed PMR’s overall recovery rate to 85%, which was around 82% 10 days ago.Health officials said the PMR recoveries could rise further if the Pimpri Chinchwad and rural areas also showed more discharges. Sanjeev Wavre, deputy health chief in the PMC’s health department, said they were expecting the PMC areas to record more discharges. “For the last three days, the city has reported over 6,000 discharges, while the new cases have been around 5,000-5,500. The period of three days is too short to reach to any conclusion, but we are looking forward to more recoveries, especially among those in home isolation,” Wavre said. The PMR has also reported a drop in positivity rate, which was around 31.5% in the first week of April and dropped to 24.6% in the second week, but slightly increased to 26.6% in the third week.

The high court asked the respondents to file a reply and posted the hearing on May 13. The petitioner, Delhi Rozi-Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, through its advocate Prasanna S, contended that owing to the raging pandemic, and with fresh restrictions being announced, the petitioner organisation had written to Delhi government urging to provide free hot-cooked meals to homeless shelters and dedicated relief centres and ensure no person desirous of obtaining food is turned away from these centres. It sought implementation of the scheme of providing dry ration under the Mukhya Mantri Corona Sahayta Yojna (MMCSY) scheme, or any other scheme designed for that purpose to all those who applied for e-coupons for availing rations under the said scheme and other poor and needy persons who require ration to ensure that they don’t go hungry.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Plan to convert sole civic-run eye hospital into Covid centre opposed||MUMBAI: Politicians and medical practitioners have opposed BMC’s move to convert the city’s only dedicated civic-run eye hospital into a Covid centre with 30 beds. Murli Deora Eye Hospital located on Grant Road’s Maulana Shaukat Ali Marg caters to poor patients who need ophthalmology treatment. Local corporator Javed Juneja from Congress has written to additional municipal commissioner (health) Suresh Kakani urging him to stall the plan. “The BMC will get only 30 beds if they convert Murli Deora Eye Hospital into a Covid centre, but hundreds of citizens who need urgent ophthalmology treatment will suffer,” Juneja said. “Every day, the eye hospital sees around 200 patients in the outpatient department. Then there are also paediatric procedures.” TimesViewThere is a need to increase beds for Covid patients but the Murli Deora Eye Hospital is the only dedicated eye hospital run by the BMC. It serves the poorest of the poor. If the BMC can set up only 30 regular beds at this hospital, it must only use it as a last resort and for now add beds in other Covid jumbo centres. Patients' eye treatment must not be hit.Pointing out that last year the eye hospital had been converted into a Covid centre till there was a drop in the number of cases, additional municipal commissioner (city) Sanjeev Jaiswal said the BMC is yet to take a final call to set up 30 beds there again. But Congress MLA Amin said the BMC already has a lot of space at Byculla’s Richardson and Cruddas Covid centre and can restart other centres in the area. “The BMC had dismantled the Covid centre set up in Najum Baug after cases subsided. Even the beds in the Richardson & Cruddas centre are lying unused. The BMC must make use of these centres first,” he said. “For just 30 Covid beds, hundreds of patients with eye problems will suffer. This is not advisable.” Eye surgeon Dr Mona Patel, who is an honorary doctor at the hospital, said, “We support the government in its initiative to give adequate Covid care, but this hospital serves the poorest of the poor. We are still doing 15-20 surgeries a week. There is no space for creating separate entry and exit for Covid patients. This hospital should be used as a Covid centre as a last resort...But BMC can keep the premises ready so that it can be converted into a Covid centre overnight if needed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-plan-to-convert-sole-civic-run-eye-hosp-into-covid-centre-opposed/articleshow/82223259.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Nashik city police commissioner Deepak Pandey said, “In view of the shortage of medical oxygen, there is a possibility that such tankers could be looted on the roads and some other untoward incidents cannot be ruled out. Hence, it has been decided that there will be an escort team for every oxygen tanker moving from the supplier to the hospitals.” The number of personnel to be deployed for the oxygen tankers is being decided. Superintendent of police Sachin Patil of the rural police said, “One of our personnel would be deployed at the special cell set up at the district collectorate from where the supply of medical oxygen tankers from the manufacturers is made. He would get in touch with the control room to get information about escorting the tankers.” Patil said that they have also sought 10 vehicles from the district administration for the purpose of escorting the tankers so that there is no unnecessary pressure on vans of the rural police. Both the top cops said that it was a matter of time that the system of escorting the oxygen tankers from the suppliers to hospitals in their respective jurisdiction is taken up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/police-to-escort-all-oxygen-tankers/articleshow/82220132.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Delhi||Delhi: Weeklong lockdown to be extended? Final call today||NEW DELHI: Delhi government may extend the weeklong lockdown, which is currently in force till Monday 5am. The lockdown was imposed from 10pm of April 19 onwards after the number of Covid cases rose alarmingly leaving the government with no option other than going for strict curbs to break the chain of the coronavirus transmission. The government has taken various measures, including increasing the coverage of vaccination, strengthening the healthcare infrastructure and imposing the weekend curfew and weeklong lockdown to tackle the fourth wave of the pandemic. A highly placed source said the government was likely to extend the lockdown because the positivity rate and the number of daily cases were still going up in the capital. A final decision on it is likely to be taken and announced on Sunday. The government is reviewing the impact of the weeklong lockdown in Delhi. Since it was imposed, it is largely being obeyed by people and the number of vehicles on the roads is also few. Due to exempted activities like government offices, essential business activities and plying of the public transport system, some people were seen on a few key roads. The markets, however, have remained largely deserted. Delhi Police personnel have been ensuring people do not violate the lockdown guidelines. This weeklong lockdown is very liberal compared with the one imposed last year and public transport services and travel to catch flight, train or bus are allowed.  Home delivery from restaurants is also permitted. Many categories of individuals are exempted from the lockdown to ensure uninterrupted delivery of public services and essential services. People moving for getting health services, Covid tests and vaccination are also exempted. The lockdown has hit the traders in the city hard but many of them are in favour of its extension because of the prevailing Covid situation. Chamber of Trade & Industry has stated that the traders are in favour of extension of the lockdown so that the spread of the viral infection can be checked. “Now that the lockdown period is coming to an end, we conducted a survey in which more than 700 traders participated out of which 70% traders favoured extension of the lockdown so that the chain of coronavirus transmission can be broken,” said CTI chairman Brijesh Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/weeklong-lockdown-to-be-extended-final-call-today/articleshow/82235942.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||India||SC says Dave misinforming people about its order on Covid-19; Salve quits as amicus||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday accused senior advocate Dushyant Dave of spreading misinformation that the apex court was transferring Covid management proceedings pending before six high courts to itself, and asked him whether there was even a whisper about the SC seeking to shift the cases to itself. A bench of CJI S A Bobde and Justices L N Rao and S Ravindra Bhat on Thursday took suo motu cognisance of the health emergency caused by Covid-19 and decided to address issues of nationwide ramifications like equitable distribution and transportation of oxygen, medical equipment, essential medicines and vaccines on the ground that state-oriented approach of HCs on this issue could lead to confusion and disruption of supply to other states. But Dave and other senior advocates strongly criticised the SC on the basis of the false impression that the SC was going to transfer proceedings from HCs to itself. Dave had also insinuated on Thursday that senior advocate Harish Salve's appointment as amicus curiae had to do with him being a friend of the CJI from their school days. Importantly, Salve recused himself from the matter by citing Dave's accusation. The bench on Friday confronted Dave, "Is there a single word in our order yesterday on transferring HC proceedings to the SC? You went about giving your comments even before the order was uploaded on the website and did not bother to even read the order. Such narratives from senior advocates, who should be protecting the institution, will destroy the institution. You (Dave) said we are the people who are stopping HCs from going ahead with hearing Covid-related matters. You are imputing the motive that we are going to stop the HCs." Dave said it was his genuine perception that the SC was going to transfer cases from HCs to itself and he felt that it was wrong. He also said his perception arose from similar acts of the SC in the past. A generally calm and soft-spoken Justice Bhat too appeared disturbed. He said, "We never said a word and, in fact, told the solicitor general to report to the HCs about the action plan. The HCs had gone ahead and heard the matter yesterday. We never stalled HC proceedings. We do not know what perception you had of the proceedings before us yesterday." The bench told Dave, "Please do not comment on the institution like this." At the beginning, Salve sought the court's permission to recuse as amicus curiae. He said, "It is a matter of great sensitivity (the Covid management issue). The country is going through a very difficult time and states are divided and accusing each other. At this time, I do not want the CJI to retire with an accusation that he had appointed me because of our friendship from our school days. Unlike in the US where lawyers are divided as counsel for plaintiffs and defendants, in India, lawyers are divided as those appearing for industries and others." The bench said, "We are not happy with what the senior advocates have said. But we will allow you to recuse." Solicitor general Tushar Mehta stepped in and said he did not want the CJI’s last day in the SC to be a slanging match between members of the bar. He said there was a maligning competition hosted by the media, especially digital media which dished out abuse for the judiciary. The judiciary must take cognisance some day, he added. Mehta also said once Salve recused, there would be pressure on the next amicus to function in a certain manner. "No counsel will be able to function and discharge duties to the court independently," he added. However, he sought two days to present the Centre's affidavit on the issues raised by the court on Covid management. The court adjourned the hearing to Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-says-dave-misinforming-people-about-its-order-on-covid-19-salve-quits-as-amicus/articleshow/82224783.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Alive man cremated’ video was of man who died last June, says family||MUMBAI: In a strange twist, a day after BMC proactively filed a complaint against BJP spokesperson Suresh Nakhua for allegedly tarnishing its image by tweeting a video about an alive man being cremated, a family from Chembur came forward to state that the video was of their father, Ramsaran Gupta (75), who died last June due to Covid-19. Puzzled after watching the viral video, the Guptas wrote to Bandra police on Wednesday demanding a probe into the matter. The letter was submitted a day after Nakhua tweeted the video, which claimed, “A living man taken to the cremation centre by BMC. I think there might be some target from the cremation centres Maha vasuli Aghadi government.” Nakhua now says the matter is sub judice. Radhyeshyam, the son-in-law, said, “My father-in-law was admitted to a Chembur hospital but was later transferred to Bandra Bhabha hospital, when we found out he had Covid. When he died on June 29, we were not allowed to see his body, as it was sealed. My wife doubted then, as she said her father was healthier compared to the wrapped body, which appeared fragile.” The family suspects the man cremated by authorities last year was not Ramsaran. If it was a case of mistaken identity, and Ramsaran is alive, the family wants police to find out his whereabouts. They also doubted if Ramsaran was cremated alive. “During the 2020 lockdown, if a Covid positive patient was admitted to a civic hospital and died there, the civic authorities handled the cremation as per protocol. The viral video surfaced almost a year later, and since the body has been cremated, we can no longer verify who the individual was. But we will conduct a probe and go through records with the hospital and civic body,” said a senior police officer. BMC officials said Ramsaran died as per records in June, and their complaint was on the video being circulated without verification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-alive-man-cremated-video-was-of-man-who-died-last-june-says-family/articleshow/82223266.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Hyderabad||As Covid 2nd wave sweeps, families shun their dead||Hyderabad: It's back to square. Many relatives are now abandoning the bodies of Covid-19 patients, forcing volunteers to conduct the funeral rites. Volunteers of at least three social service organisations in the city have conducted the funeral of 30 Covid-19 patients thus far in the second wave. The volunteers told TOI that they have been witnessing a spurt in cases of relatives refusing to participate in the last rites of their dear ones. Things are fast returning to the initial phase of Covid-19 during March-July 2020 when relatives refused to take bodies for burial or cremation due to social stigma or fear of contraction of the pandemic virus. When Telangana’s first Covid-19 patient died on March 31, 2020 in Hyderabad, none of his relatives or friends attended the funeral. It was a lonely send-off with just one neighbour in attendance, the volunteers recall adding that such instances are on the rise again. Requests are pouring in from the US, Saudi Arabia and UAE for funeral rites of relatives back home in Hyderabad. “Families turning away from their loved ones who have died is a very disturbing trend now common in Hyderabad,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari, managing trustee of Helping Hand Foundation (HHF). As many as 50 HHF volunteers are not only taking care of Covid-19 patients in home quarantine, but also conducting free funeral rites. With the rise in Covid-19 cases and fatalities, the request for funeral services has increased two-fold as compared to that of last year. “Voluntary organisations are literally burning the midnight oil to provide hearse services irrespective of caste, creed and religion in this hour of crisis,” said Syed Jalaluddin Zafar, president of Youth Welfare Telangana, and NGO providing free funeral services for Covid-19 patients in the last 14 months. “On April 20 while crossing a hospital at Dilsukhnagar I saw a woman standing outside and crying inconsolably. When enquired, she said her mother-in-law had succumbed to Covid-19 and she had no one to help her out. I immediately arranged an ambulance and the body was cremated at Puranapul crematorium. Our four volunteers performed the last rites,” Zafar told TOI. In another case, the volunteers received a call from Visakhapatnam that a 49-year-old man from the Port City, who was in Hyderabad for work, died at Gandhi Hospital due to Covid-19. There was none in Hyderabad to perform the last rites as per Christian traditions, said Fareed Faheem, incharge of funerals and logistics, HHF. None of the relatives or friends came forward to bury the body. “The documentation with local police station took a while and we got the body released from Gandhi on April 22 at 5 pm. By then we made arrangements for burial as per the wishes of the family. The body was laid to rest as per Christian traditions,” Fareed told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-covid-2nd-wave-sweeps-families-shun-their-dead/articleshow/82223268.cms||Syed Akbar

The distributor had received 60 refilled oxygen cylinders late on Thursday night.Malegaon police said tension ran high as the doctors were in no mood to allow Mehta to give cylinders to the two government establishments.Malegaon additional superintendent of police Chandrakant Khandvi told TOI that police teams had to be sent to the godown as a precautionary measure. “There was no untoward incident. The issue was resolved after over two hours of parleys.”Prakash Shimpi, the nodal officer of the civic body for oxygen, also went to the godown and reasoned with the agitating doctors and their staff how there is a need for all stakeholders to ensure coordination and cooperation in these trying times. His efforts helped in defusing the tension.Mehta said that both the Malegaon general hospital and MMC authorities directed him to provide 30 cylinders and 20 cylinders respectively.“Since the owners of some private hospitals were anxiously waiting for the cylinders, I informed them that he would be able to supply just 10 cylinders since other 50 would have to be given to government facilites,” he said.Mehta said he provided 10 cylinders to the MMC and the remaining 50 were distributed among the private hospitals. “I appeal to the civic body and private hospitals to have a better understanding about the distribution of oxygen cylinders since the demand is huge.” Nodal officer Shimpi said both MMC and the private hospitals have reached un understanding and that it will be ensure that private hospitals get as many cylinders a day as possible. The IMA, Malegaon, questioned why the government and civic hospitals are taking cylinders from distributors when these hospitals get it directly from the manufacturing plant. “When the MMC has allowed the 37 hospitals to run as Covid facilities, it has to ensure that they get oxygen to treat patients. Many of the hospitals have already stopped admitting Covid patients due to the erratic supply of oxygen,” said IMA president Jayant Pawar.Immediate past president of Malegaon IMA, Mayur Shah, said doctors and their staff were forced to agitate since the private hospitals are reeling under severe shortage of oxygen. “The situation for private hospitals is desperate in Malegaon as far as oxygen is concerned,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/private-doctors-protest-againstoxygen-shortage-in-malegaon/articleshow/82220149.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Kochi||Kochi: Hospitals in district face shortage of trained nurses||KOCHI: With the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in its second wave, health authorities are attempting to ramp up health infrastructure in the district. Amid all these challenges, they stare at a new crisis – shortage of nursing staff. As more first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) are being opened and more beds are being arranged for Covid patients at hospitals, the need for nursing staff also increases. Now, many hospitals do not get nurses who can manage critical conditions. Authorities had hired hundreds of nurses, doctors and other employees last year when the first wave struck Ernakulam. Once the caseload in hospitals declined, made home treatment for Category A patients and FLTCs closed, they were relieved from these facilities and landed in new jobs. With the large-scale recruitment in hospitals abroad following the pandemic, many of them went abroad leaving a big vacuum in the medical sector during emergency situations like the one Ernakulam currently faces. The health department recruited 100 nurses on Tuesday and Wednesday. The district requires 500 more nurses in both the private and government sector in tune with an increase in Covid cases and bed capacities. “Staff shortage is high in both the government and private sectors with Covid patients started seeking treatment additionally. We are finding it difficult to run ventilators and oxygen beds that were started for Covid patients due to staff shortage. Though there is a shortage of doctors, scarcity of nurses is severe. Many private hospitals told us they are ready to increase bed capacity. Hospitals can manage with existing doctors. But we need nurses to take care of patients. We recruit as many nurses as possible. The problem is that many trained nurses went to the Gulf countries, following the Covid,” said a health official in the district. Private hospital authorities said they need four times higher the number of nursing staff in Covid blocks comprising ICUs and ventilators when compared to treatment of normal patients. “Currently, nurses are not available. With better jobs in the Gulf, many left Kerala. Instead of three nurses for eight beds in normal wards, it will be four for eight beds in Covid section for six hours. There are four shifts every 24 hours. In ICUs, each nurse is required for every Covid patient. Despite starting recruitment, we do not get skilled nurses. We have to train them again. By the time training gets over and they are ready to meet any emergency situation, they leave the job and move abroad,” said an official in a private hospital in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hospitals-in-district-face-shortage-of-trained-nurses/articleshow/82220803.cms||T C Sreemol

Call helpline nos||PANAJI: People who have undergone the Covid-19 test, but haven’t received an SMS with the result can call the coronavirus health helpline number 104 or Whatsapp number 9607909559, a health official said. “Once a person gets through the helpline or Whatsapp number, they are sent a link where they have to fill their details and contact number on a Google doc form. This information is sent to Goa Electronics Limited (GEL) for them to trigger the RTPCR message,” the health official said. The online ‘form for providing test result details’ asks for the person’s name, mobile number, place and date of testing and whether they have received an SMS. TOI had reported that in several instances people had not received the SMS with results of the RTPCR test. Many of these had got their results unofficially, from contacts within the health services. “People who have Do Not Disturb (DND) activated on their phones are not receiving the SMS. This is a huge issue,” the official stated. “Also, in case a person is out of network coverage area for long, I’m not sure how long the message remains in the network.” Those who tested at health centres or at the Asilo hospital, who did not receive the SMSes of their results of the crucial RTPCR test, however, received a message stating that their sample has been collected for testing, and advising them to isolate till the sample is tested and test report available. This SMS contains the date and time of testing as well as the crucial testing ID number. However, a citizen who tested at GMC, and is awaiting her results even after 48 hours, said she did not receive any SMS with an ID number or any confirmation that she tested. “GMC didn’t issue me any SMS or any slip. I have no evidence that my swab sample has been taken. If GMC doesn’t have a facility to generate an SMS, they should at least give us some slip with our ID number,” the woman told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/didnt-get-test-result-call-helpline-nos/articleshow/82223263.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Bar Council writes to Allahabad HC's acting CJ, seeks bail for undertrials, convicts||PRAYAGRAJ: The Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh, the apex body of the lawyers of the state, has written a letter to the newly appointed Acting Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court, Justice Sanjay Yadav, seeking interim bail/ parole for under-trial prisoners/ convicts in view of the havoc created by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The print media and the electronic media is full of reports indicating doubling of infection during the last two weeks on account of overcrowding in jails across the Uttar Pradesh state. Scores of inmates have tested positive for the virus majorly due to flouting of social distancing norms occurring on account of congestion in jails,” Bar Council chairman Rohitashwa Kumar Agarwal wrote in his letter on April 20. “The only available solution to help the congestion and to avoid the spread of virus appears to be decongesting the prisons so that social distancing is maintained,” he added. “The need of the hour in such unprecedented circumstance of the pandemic calls for consideration of interim bail/ parole for the under trial/ convict, not based upon legal considerations arising out of statutory right for bail, but more in the nature of human right to safeguard the life and health of the prisoners,” Agarwal added in his letter. Stating that the present letter is written with the concurrence of the majority of the members of the Bar Council, he said that Chief Justice is the guardian of fundamental rights and human rights of every citizen of the state, as such it is humbly prayed that judicial notice may be taken of the alarming situation on account of the second wave of the pandemic of Covid-19 due to which the inmates/ prisoners who are languishing in jail are suffering irreparably, firstly on account of spread of virus due to overcrowding of prisons. Secondly, for not having access to speedy justice, apart from such prevailing conditions in jail which are not fit and proper for human life and safety due to the current scenario. “It is therefore humbly prayed that appropriate orders may be passed for releasing the under trial prisoners/ convicted persons who are facing trial or convicted to the maximum punishment of seven year or less, with or without fine, on interim bail/ parole, to help decongestion of jails so as to contain the virus which in its second wave has divested the humanity or such further directions/ orders may be passed by the high court as expedient in the interest of justice, especially under the prevailing circumstances,” he wrote. “Or in the alternative the earlier directions passed by this high court in the light of the policy decision and recommendations of the state government may yet again be enforced, so as to safeguard the basic human rights, life and liberty of the inmates/ prisoners who are languishing in jail across the state of Uttar Pradesh,” the letter added. The chairman relied on decision taken during the last corona wave when a high powered committee was constituted by the state government and a policy decision was taken to release the under trial prisoners/ convicts for the offences for which prescribed punishment was up to seven years or less which led to decongestion of jails across Uttar Pradesh thereby breaking the chain of virus and saving the lives of thousands of prisoners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bar-council-writes-to-hc-acting-cj-seeks-bail-for-undertrials-convicts/articleshow/82222518.cms||---

In the wake of the second wave of Covid, there is a massive crisis of oxygen cylinders. Many hospitals including government and private both are finding it difficult to cater to the demand of oxygen cylinders to the patients. To help Covid patients, battling low oxygen saturation levels and respiratory infections, one Sadakat-Ullah Khan, of Munshi Purwa in Babupurwa, and his group of seven friends, is providing free oxygen cylinders. Sadakat along with his group, is running a social organisation, “Insaniyat Abhi Zinda Hai” (humanity is still alive), in Babupurwa. This organisation has been working for the past four years. They started with food and medicine distribution to poor at footpaths, temple, mosques and ashrams. They also distributed food and water to the migrants during the first wave of Covid last year. He started distributing oxygen cylinders for free, after two of his friend’s family members lost their lives due to shortage of oxygen at the city hospitals recently. Sadakat, 25, who pursued mass communication course from Lucknow, with the help of his friends with a meagre amount of Rs 63,500 initially started helping Covid patients with five oxygen cylinders which later got increased up to 13 cylinders. “We stand in queues outside gas agencies and wait for hours to procure oxygen cylinders. After procuring a cylinder, we deliver that to whosoever is in need for free irrespective of religion, caste or creed. We have arranged these cylinders from some of our friends, besides purchasing against security deposit from gas agencies,” said Sadakat while talking to TOI. He added, also there are times when they are not able to help because of shortage and high demands. “This is our collective fight against the pandemic and we thought of doing our bit to help the poor and needy,” said Sadakat further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/group-of-youths-distribute-free-oxygen-cylinders/articleshow/82234836.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Keeping the market shut on weekends will at least cut the chain and slow down the spread of the virus. Many of our members have tested positive in the past few weeks so we do not want to take any chances. On weekdays the market will shut by 5.30 pm. We will review the decision after two weekends,” said Rita Mitra, president, Calcutta Motor Dealers’ Association. The association has also applied to the health department for permission to carry out a vaccination camp. “Traders, employees and workers will be vaccinate as soon as we receive the permission,”said Mitra. The Confederation of West Bengal Trade Association, an umbrella body, has written to its member committees to organise vaccination camps for their staff and labourers. “Workforce of thousands of people are associated with markets which includes labourers, drivers, helpers and van rickshaw drivers. We have proposed that the association and the CWBTA can split the cost of vaccination. But we need to start vaccinating soon so that this rapid spread of the virus can be halted,” said Sushil Poddar, president of CWBTA. A week ago, CWBTA had sent a list of precautionary measures to all member committees. “Wearing of masks by everybody should be a must. Market committees should also ensure that there is enough space for social distancing,’ said Poddar. There has been a dip in foot falls in the markets after the recent surge in cases. “The compliance has gone up. People are wearing mask and avoiding spending much time at one place. Previously we had a tough time telling people to wear masks,” said Rakesh Singh, a trader in Nandaram Market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/motor-parts-market-shut-for-2-weekends/articleshow/82221658.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The corporation had planned to add 350 beds to the existing 250 by the weekend. “But, we will make sufficient arrangements first and then increase the number of beds,” he added. The hospital is also facing high demand for ICU and ventilator beds. It has only 10 ICU beds and health workers are requesting people to take patients somewhere else for the ICU facility. “We have been receiving requests for shifting patients to ICU wards due to decrease in oxygen levels and other complexities, but we are also helpless and can’t go beyond our capacity,” said Jai Prakash. A helpline, 1800-200-8701, has been started for giving information and registering complaints regarding all Covid-related activities being undertaken by the corporation, North corporation commissioner Sanjay Goel said. The issues include availability of hospital beds, vaccination and testing centres, biomedical waste disposal for home quarantined patients, cremation facilities and sanitisation of public places. Taking note of the increasing footfall, the civic body has set up another waiting area in an open space on the hospital premises with a sitting capacity for 300 attendants. Goel said the area had been “created with the help of CSR funds, and 300 chairs, 10 water dispensers, an LED TV and a public announcement system have been placed for the benefit of attendants”. The mayor said the civic body had been distributing kadha with the help of an NGO among health workers, attendants and even patients to build immunity. Motivational lectures are also being played to help attendants, in addition to yoga classes, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hindu-rao-arranges-oxygen-for-5-6-days-but-no-extra-bed-for-now/articleshow/82223269.cms||Vibha Sharma

In view of the rising number of Covid cases and to facilitate the treatment of the patients, the Brahma Kumaris have offered the facility to the Sirohi district administration. The Brahma Kumaris had earlier given two other buildings, in Taleti, to the local authorities for use as Covid centres, but with the increasing number of patients, the larger Mansarovar campus has been made available for the purpose. Currently, 74 patients are receiving treatment at the campus, with 50 of them on an oxygen support system. A team of four doctors and 26 paramedical staff is working round the clock in shifts at the Covid centre to take care of the patients. The six-storey building at the campus can accommodate 800 beds and is equipped with all the necessary furniture and sanitary facilities required for the patients. The Brahma Kumaris are providing three meals a day to the patients and the medical staff at the campus, while the medical facilities, including medicines and oxygen, are being provided by the district administration. Sirohi collector Bhagwati Prasad, Mount Abu Sub-divisional officer Abhishek Surana and the Abu Road Tehsildar had inspected the Mansarovar campus a few days ago to see the facilities available there. The Mansarovar campus has already been used as a Covid treatment centre for nearly a year, starting in March 2020, and a large number of Covid patients have stayed at the campus, which had a patient recovery rate of 99 per cent last year. Ramswarup Johar, Tehsildar of Abu Road, said: “This is an excellent place for treatment of Covid patients. Last year too, the Brahma Kumaris had given it to us. The institution has again offered it to us at a critical time at our request.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/brahma-kumaris-dedicate-500-bed-covid-centre-at-abu-road/articleshow/82222342.cms||---

Gehlot was expressing his views in a meeting held on Friday with the chief ministers of states under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Covid management. He said that in the present circumstances, many heart-breaking scenes are being seen. In such a situation, there is a need to increase the confidence of the common man and all efforts should be made that no person should die due to lack of oxygen and medicines. He said, all states should be allocated oxygen and Remdesivir on the basis of active cases. “On April 21, Rajasthan was allocated only 26,500 Remdesivir injections in the immediate allocation, while Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh were allotted 1,63,000 and 92,200 injections, respectively, despite having less active cases than Rajasthan.” Similarly, the proportion of active cases was not taken into account in the allocation of oxygen. He said that their supply should be done rationally in future so that no state will face any problem on treatment to Covid patients. Gehlot said that during the treatment of Covid patients, helpful tests like IL-6, d-dimer, ferritin test etc. kits have also started decrease gradually. The central government should also plan to ensure adequate availability of these kits, so that they could be supplied smoothly to the states in time. He emphasized that the central government should also provide free vaccination to the people above 18 years of age. The central government should adopt the same policy for the age group of above 60 years, 45 years and now more than 18 years. The same medical staff will apply the vaccine to all age groups in the states. It would not be appropriate to take money from the youth and the rest should be given free vaccine. Gehlot said that the Government of India has also made a provision of 35,000 crore rupees in the budget for free vaccine, in view of this, the states have not kept any such provision in the budget. Now, if the states have to bear the financial burden of the vaccine, they will have to cut the budget fixed for social security and development works. He said that different vaccine rates in the country are also not appropriate. The Central Government should consider this and provide free vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ensure-equitable-allocation-of-resources-to-states-cm-to-pm/articleshow/82222338.cms||---

Committee who is going to brief the health minister and other concerned on it on Friday stated that things like following Covid appropriate behaviour and enhancing healthcare infrastructure are needed as third and four waves of Covid-19 are likely. Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller of the SMS Medical College who is also heading the core team, has studied the pattern of the Spanish Flu and suggested that even after the completion of the second wave people can’t be complacent. “It is seen that the first wave of both Spanish Flu and Covid-19 last for more than two and a half months, but had lesser fatalities. But second wave has been bringing more mortalities. As far as second wave is concerned, unlike Spanish flu, this time social negligence is more responsible. As during those days, Spanish Flu became severe due to lack of facilities and poor health infrastructure. But this time, social negligence is mainly responsible,” said Bhandari on Friday. The core team has also predicted that after a gap of one month there could be third wave in June that may last till September. “I think with following Covid appropriate behaviour including masks, social distancing and sanitisation, we can save ourselves,” he claimed. Drawing a comparison, Dr Bhandari, said, “It was seen that Spanish Flu was more active in winters, but Covid is active as long as people are careless.” He added that the ongoing pattern has suggested that the second wave is too fast that it has affected people much before the vaccination. “I must repeat that Remdesivir etc are not needed in majority of the cases during the Covid-19 second wave,” he added. The core team is going to brief the government on this study and will suggest the measures to be taken. “Covid appropriate behaviour, enhancing of health infrastructure and stringent measures are the key to curb the impact of second wave and other possible waves of Covid-19. Also it is seen that like Spanish flu, the Covid-19 won’t last for more than two years,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/striking-similarities-between-spanish-flu-and-covid/articleshow/82222351.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Hyderabad||Three bizmen launder Rs 1,500 cr to China, Hong Kong||HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a prosecution complaint against three businessmen for laundering Rs 1,500 crore fraudulently to companies in China and Hong Kong. The ED initiated a probe into Deepak Agarwal, Ayush Goyal and Pramod Agarwal based on an FIR registered by Andhra Pradesh police after the income tax department filed a complaint against the trio. A money laundering probe by the ED has revealed that one of the prime accused, Vaddi Mahesh, had floated several firms and shell companies and opened several bank accounts. “Mahesh had remitted huge funds to the tune of Rs 1,500 crore to various companies in Singapore, Hong Kong and China,” the ED alleged. “In the guise of outward remittances for import of non-existent ‘customised software’ by submitting fake and fabricated documents to the banks, he laundered money,” the Enforcement Directorate said. The ED had filed its first prosecution complaint against Mahesh, hawala operator Bhimendra Kumar Goyal and others in October 2020 in a PMLA special court in Visakhapatnam. The ED alleged that a largescale trade-based money laundering scam has been detected subsequently in which Mahesh had received funds into the bank accounts of his firms through Ayush Goyal and Pramod Agarwal and remitted those funds outside India on the instructions of Ayush and Pramod. “Deepak Agarwal acted as authorised signatory for the bank account of United Hill China Limited, Hong Kong, which received proceeds of crime worth Rs 300 crore from the shell companies of Mahesh,” it said. Deepak was also actively involved in money laundering by way of assisting his uncle BK Goyal by providing the bank account of his company, Bhav Technology China Limited, for laundering the proceeds of crime, the ED charged. The ED arrested BK Goyal, kingpin of the scam, on September 3 last year. Subsequently, Deepak and Ayush were also arrested on February 22 and February 27 this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/three-bizmen-launder-rs-1-5k-cr-to-china-hk/articleshow/82223285.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Neha Reddy, a yoga teacher from Taleigao said that it’s amazing to see that a people’s movement of sorts has been created to fight the pandemic. “There is no official person or number of people that can be reached out to, but with the help of volunteers, who are running errands and delivering food, the burden on patients is lesser,” she said. Mackenzie Pereira, a resident of Merces, is reaching out to people who need essentials and is also willing to guide others that are stepping out to help. “While essentials are important, people also need to donate plasma right now,” he said. Some others are offering to compile data and coordinate with patients and pharmacies from home to ensure that their needs are met. “There are a lot of requests for oxygen cylinders for people under home isolation. The best we can do is verify the data of vendors and forward people the numbers. We are also reaching out to pharmacies to check if the medicines prescribed are available. The idea is to build this network and put out more information for those in need,” Neshwin Almeida, a resident of Margao, said. Similarly, Sneha Phalle from Sangolda has also offered to coordinate online to help patients meet their requirements. “Seeing all the suffering around us, we have a moral obligation to help in whatever little way we can with whatever resources we have,” said Ashish Kapur, owner of Antares restaurant, who has offered free meals to Covid patients. “There are Covid patients and senior citizens that are unfortunately stuck at home with no ability to cook and if we can do our little bit in helping them get to recovery and easing their pain, then we will,” he said. “There are still others that don’t have access to restaurants or hygienic food in their residential areas, which is where we come in,” said Saira Khan, who runs the cloud kitchen called Potluck in Panaji, and is also offering free food to Covid patients. Vilas Kulkarni, a Porvorim resident and volunteer, said that more volunteers should step forwards so that there is a point of contact in each area wherein volunteers can take turns to handle the deliveries to those in need. “In the second wave, people are bound to find it difficult to move out for daily essentials, grocery items and their medical needs. Last year, people had no contacts to reach out to but this time, we are ready to help,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lot-of-requests-for-oxygen-cylinders-for-home-isolated/articleshow/82223272.cms||---

Gujarat tops the chart, at 8.48 cubic metre. “Of the205 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen, 80 MT has been allocated to the state by the government of India from the manufacturer (INOX oxygen plant in Bhiwadi). The rest 125 MTs of oxygen is being manufactured by the state’s MSME oxygen producers (24 air separation units or ASUs),” said an official. The state government has constituted an Oxygen Management Group at Udyog Bhawan for management of oxygen supply in the state. “Out of 120 metric tonnes of oxygen produced by INOX Bhiwadi, 80 MT (per day) has been allocated to Rajasthan and the rest has been allocated to Delhi and Haryana. Hence, the state has become an exporter of oxygen despite having very limited amount of oxygen,” the official added. “Therefore, per patient allocation of oxygen in the state is just 0.64 cubic metre, which is the lowest in the country,” he added. While the production capacity of the state is 277 metric tonnes of oxygen (from all sources), 243 MTs of oxygen is being used per day (an increase from 160 metric tonnes in the previous week). “We anticipate that by April 30, the requirement will cross 343 metric tonnes of oxygen. The district administration has taken over all the 24 ASUs for uninterrupted supply of oxygen and they are functioning at full capacity. So, we have also requested the hospitals and medical experts to ensure rational use of oxygen.” “The number of oxygen supply tankers (both nitrogen and argon tankers) deployed in medical services has been increased from 6 to 23. Use of GPS and police escort is being made to ensure smooth and fast transportation of oxygen through tankers. We are also in the process of acquiring more tankers. We have hired additional drivers to ensure 24X7 functioning of the tankers. We are also ensuring that these tankers have a green corridor,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-at-bottom-of-states-in-terms-of-getting-oxygen-supplies-per-patient-shows-data-compiled-by-govt/articleshow/82222345.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

Besides the government hospitals and hospitals associated with the SN Medical College, bed count has also been increased in private hospitals. According to district collector Indrajit Singh, of the total 2,925 beds available in government hospitals and other health centres, 1,374 have been completely earmarked for Covid patients apart from additional 400 beds in Covid Care Centre, Boranada. Taking a major step towards solving the beds’ issue in the city, a major addition of beds was exercised by the district administration on Friday, which also included AIIMS. AIIMS, which had started with 160 beds dedicated to Covid patients, introduced two expansions taking total count first to 250 and now 310. Two major government hospitals, MG and MDM Hospitals also added more beds on Friday taking the tally to 534 and 492 beds respectively. MDM Hospital saw an addition of 192 beds on Friday, highest in any hospital in a single day. It may be noted that MG Hospital has already been converted into a Covid hospital with no other patient in wards, a major part of the MDM Hospital has also been dedicated for Covid cases. With these existing facilities, the administration is also turning to other smaller hospitals like satellite as well as district and private hospitals for working out additional bed capacity, though, in a marginal manner. Like KN Chest Hospital dedicated 30 beds and Paota Satellite Hospital dedicated eight beds for Covid patients on Friday. Meanwhile, Jodhpur reported 1,711 positive cases on Friday, about 200 lower than the highest one day spike on the previous day, while 14 lost their lives to the deadly virus. Though, in a major relief, 688 people were discharged on Friday, which is the highest ever discharge in a single day in April, but the active cases in Jodhpur hover at 14,820.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/over-1-3k-beds-reserved-for-covid-patients-in-jodhpur-govt-hospitals/articleshow/82225580.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kochi: Illicit arrack brewers thrive amid pandemic||KOCHI: Last week, the excise officials in Kothamangalam intercepted a car in which four persons were travelling and seized around 30 litres of illicit arrack. On interrogation, it was found that they brewed the arrack at one of the accused’s house and was transporting it to be delivered to a wedding party at Kothamangalam. On further investigation they found brewing equipment from the accused’s house. Excise officials said that the cases of illicit arrack brewing are increasing in many parts of the district as there are many takers for the arrack. The officials found that many people now prefer illicit arrack in such gatherings and there are people who are brewing arrack specifically to cater to the needs of such parties. Excise sources said that those people make huge profits from illicit brewing of arrack by selling small quantities to private parties. “Earlier, most of the seizures we made were of large-scale brewing, which happened in remote places in the eastern side of the district. But now more cases are being registered involving people who set up their small breweries at home either for personal consumption or to sell it to friends. A few days ago one person was arrested with 40 litres of arrack from Angamaly by the special squad. It is hard to find such people as their area of supply is very narrow,” said an excise officer. Deputy excise commissioner, Ernakulam, T A Ashok Kumar said the arrack is sold for up to Rs 1,000 per litre and yet people are ready to buy it. Kumar said that frequent raids are being held in remote and forest areas with the help of forest department. Also, excise intelligence officers are now trying to get tips-off from people to nab the local brewers who sell arrack to only selected groups of customers. “These people cannot be nabbed through random raid but could be intercepted based on specific leads from the customers. We are now trying to gather such information. Illicit brewing is a non-bailable offence with punishment up to 10 years of imprisonment and Rs 1lakh fine,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/illicit-arrack-brewers-thrive-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82220822.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No school books, no photocopies with stationery shops shut||MUMBAI: Sakshi Jha has lost count of the number of stationery stores she has tried to call up over the past few weeks to enquire about class X textbooks for her daughter. With extra classes having begun for the new academic year, Jha’s stress levels have gone through the roof. “Even basic supplies like pens and notebooks are not available online,” she says. Teachers have started sharing scanned images for students to start studying from. The Bombay Booksellers and Publishers Association has written to the chief minister, demanding that books be included in the essential commodity list, giving an example of Kerala that has done it. But it’s not just students who have been affected with stationery shops downing shutters. At city courts, lawyers are having a tough time functioning without photocopy shops. “Whether it’s an application or a writ petition, photocopies of documents have to be served to the other side. Some law firms do have printers with copiers, but they too depend on photocopy stores when it comes to copying hundreds of documents,” said advocate M A Khan. “Stationery shop owners have suffered badly in the 2020 lockdown. With a second lockdown, 30% to 40% shops may never reopen,’’ said Kishore Kenia, secretary, Federation of Maharashtra Stationery Manufacturers and Traders. He added that many shops had stocked exam supplies which will be rendered useless with exams being cancelled and schools continuing online classes. At Borivli, a photocopier has been getting enquiries on phone from patients seeking urgent copies of medical reports for insurance claims. “Patients are required to submit original reports and bills to insurance companies and retain photocopies for record. We have had people enquiring with us for printing out vaccination certificates as well. But we haven’t been able to help,” said Sanjay Maru, owner of Maru Xerox Centre. Motorists have been hounding stationery dealers for red, green and yellow stickers to be affixed on vehicles in keeping with the police commissioner’s directions. A few shops have been discreetly doing business through their rear entrances, and charging twice the rates. Kenia said shop owners understand that protecting themselves and their customers from Covid-19 is important and are requesting the government to permit shops to operate for four to six hours every day. An art teacher from Thane, Rujuta Chitre, is set to postpone her virtual art workshop for kids. Summer vacation has begun and kids, being grounded, are eager to get their hands on art and craft supplies. “But I’m unable to send them to any of my 20 students nor can they buy any locally,” Chitre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-school-books-no-photocopies-with-stationery-shops-shut/articleshow/82223277.cms||Nitasha Natu

It has been found that the TPR has gone beyond 25% from April 19 to 22 in Aruvikkara, Amboori, Karode, Perumkadavila, Kattakada, Andoorkanam, Kollayil, Uzhamalackal, Kunnathukal and Aryankode panchayats. As per the order “the station house officers (SHOs) shall take stringent actions to enforce restrictions and take all steps and precautions necessary to bring down the number of cases. Local self-governments (LSGs) will continue to have these restriction till the TPR falls below 20% (weekly average)’’. As per the order, public gatherings, including places of worship, are limited to a maximum of five people. Total number of attendees in marriages and other social gatherings shall be restricted to 25 people.

Other than the permitted gatherings, all other gatherings shall be strictly avoided. Hotels shall permit in-house dining till 7.30pm and can provide takeaway or parcels till 9pm. All shops and commercial establishments should operate strictly adhering to Covid-19 protocol. Any violations shall immediately lead to closing down of shops for at least two days or more depending on the severity of the violation. The district administration has observed that there is a severe surge of Covid-19 cases in Thiruvananthapuram over the past couple of days. TPR in the district has increased from 9.97% (April 13 to 17) to 13.16% (April18 to 22) in just one week, which demonstrates the severity of the surge. TPR at present is over 15.4%. The district disaster management authority has been declaring containment and micro-containment zones in various parts of the district to ensure strict containment. However, the evolving situation warrants special measures to bring the virus spread under control. “The district authority has examined the matter in detail and found that the enforcement of social distancing should be extended further to bring down the number of active cases and is convinced that the requirement of enforcement of 144 CrPC is essential to manage the pandemic situation in certain parts of the district where TPR is high,’’ said Navjot Khosa, district collector who is also the district magistrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/section-144-invoked-in-10-panchayats-as-tpr-hits-25/articleshow/82220838.cms||---

Rajasthan University of Health Sciences (RUHS) and other Covid-19 dedicated hospitals are getting infants, children and teenagers every day with the infection. Doctors and the core team of Covid-19 care and management said that second wave active in the state since March 16 has shown that nobody is safe and immune to this variant and its spread. TOI on Friday spoke to the physicians and doctors to know how they are responding to the need of newborns, infants, children, teenager and youngsters. “We have three cases so far, including newborns of three days, seven days and 11 days. They are showing mild symptoms and we are treating them with medicines including paracetamol, multi-vitamins and antibiotics,” said Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent of RUHS. “The new variant in the second wave of Covid-19 has shown that if anybody feels that his immunity is strong and has had Covid-19 earlier can do away with the infection, he is totally wrong. The second wave has shown that negligent behaviour can be dangerous and can get you Covid-19 infection,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College and head of the core team of the SMS Medical College. So far newborns and children have not shown any deterioration in their lungs. However, teenagers and youngsters are facing severe to very severe symptoms. “We have patients including teenagers and youngsters aged from 14 years to 26 years and they have all the symptoms. So, second wave has shown that nobody is safe if he or she is negligent. Hospitals are full so it is better to take all the precautions and minimum roaming around,” Bhandari added. Likewise, senior doctors have also asked the gynaecologists for the pregnant woman to go for their Covid-19 tests especially the mothers who are expecting within a week or a fortnight. “Many pregnant mothers are showing symptoms and are getting tested Covid-19 positive,” said a gynaecologist at the Janana Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/second-wave-affects-kids-teens/articleshow/82222352.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Chandigarh||Unexpected snowfall damages crops, blocks roads||Manali: The resident of Manali on Friday woke up to thick snowflakes falling from the sky — a rare view in late April. The snowfall lasted for more than five hours and 10cm of snow accumulated on the ground. The unexpected heavy snowfall, rain, and hailstorms lashing the Himachal Pradesh for the last few days have thrown life out of gear, damaged crops worth crores of rupees, blocked over a hundred roads, and forced people to remain indoors. Shimla, Kinnaur, Kullu, Mandi, and Lahaul-Spiti districts have witnessed such heavy snowfall and rains in April after over two decades. Not just high hills, but even the mid-hills, including Manali town, have been covered with a white blanket and the temperature has plunged suddenly. Lahaul-Spiti district has been getting snow for four days now. Farmers had started cultivating vegetables, which are now buried in snow and poly houses in fields damaged. Many parts of the district have had no electricity for the last two days. Kinnaur’s blooming apple orchards have been damaged by snow. The situation is the same in the upper parts of Shimla and Mandi’s Seraj area. Wheat and barley fields have also been flattened in many areas. Hailstorms have also wreaked havoc in many areas. According to an elderly resident of Manali, the township has witnessed such a sight after more than two decades. While snowfall has thrilled hoteliers, who expect tourists in the next few days, it has made hearts of fruit growers throbbing fasters. Fruit grower Hemraj Bisht said, “Apple, plum, and other orchards which have small fruits now are under snow now. This is not a good sign. The covid-19 pandemic has already damaged our economy. If fruit crop is damaged, it will break us severely.” Many green trees have fallen due to the weight of snow. Apple trees in higher areas of Kullu, Mandi, Kinnaur, and parts of Lahaul, which are in bloom, are covered with snow. Growers fear that untimely snow and cold may damage the crop. A multi-storey building in Shimla’s Sanjauli area collapsed while nearly three dozen sheep and cattle were buried alive after a landslide in the Bharmaur region of Chamba district. Narkanda, Kharapathar, parts of Rohru in Shimla district, received snow. Most parts of Kinnaur and the entire Lahaul district have received 30cm to 90cm of snow. Seraj area and upper parts of Mandi district, Pangi and upper parts of Chamba district, Manali, Jalori and upper parts of Kullu district and high hills of Kangra district have experienced snowfall. The lower parts of Himachal have been lashed by rain. Rolling stones have made driving on the Manali-Chandigarh national highway dangerous. The Manali-Leh highway has been blocked completely beyond Solang valley. It will take at least one more week for Border Roads Organisation to reopen the highway, which has been buried under 30cm to 150cm deep snow. Farmers and farmers’ associations are now looking at the government for financial help to compensate for the expected losses. Progress Growers Association president Lokinder Singh Bisht said the unprecedented hailstorms and snowfall have caused immense damage to fruit crops in Himachal, particularly in areas above 7,000ft. “It has wiped away about one crore apple boxes in the state. The trees have also suffered serious damages. The state government and the Centre should recognise this as a natural disaster and should assess the damages so that financial assistant to the fruit growers could be given as early as possible,” he said. “Chances of our canceling Manali trip after various restrictions were very high but we took decided to continue our trip to Manali at the last moment as we had paid all amount in advance. Now we are happy with our decision. We had never even dreamed of watching snowfall in Manali. We were upset on Thursday when we were not allowed to go to the Atal tunnel to see snow. This snowfall is worth all the money that we spent on the entire trip,” said Abhishek Jain, a tourist from Delhi. BOX Himachal 10 degrees colder than normal The cold wave has returned to Himachal with mercury remaining many notches below the normal, following heavy rains and snowfall in the last 72 hours. According to the meteorological department in Shimla, the day temperature has been 9 to 10 degrees Celsius below normal and the minimum temperature was 4 to 5 degrees Celsius below normal. At minus 1.4 degrees Celsius, Keylong was the coldest in Himachal, followed by Kalpa at minus 0.5 degrees Celsius. Rains lashed the lower parts of the state. Kotkhai recorded 63mm rain, Palampur 48mm, Manali and Bhuntar 47mm each, Kangra and Dalhousie 43mm each, Kumarsen 40mm, Rampur 39mm, Jogindernagar 39mm, Karsog 35mm, Dharamshala 33mm, and Shimla 32mm in the last 24 hours. BOX Avalanche blocks river flow A massive avalanche near Khangsar village of Lahaul blocked the flow of the Chandra, a tributary of Chenab, for nearly three hours on Friday. No damage was reported due to the avalanche, but residents dread such incidents as it leads to dam formation. The snow debris had formed a small dam which burst after some time without causing damage. Another avalanche was reported in Lahaul’s Shiti nullah. As the district has received heavy snow in the last three days, a large number of avalanches are being reported from different areas. District administration has alerted people and has advised them not to go to isolated and avalanche prone areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/unexpected-snowfall-damages-crops-blocks-roads/articleshow/82223279.cms||---

Any violations shall immediately lead to closing down of shops for at least two days or more depending on the severity of the violation. The district administration has observed that there is a severe surge of Covid-19 cases in Thiruvananthapuram over the past couple of days. TPR in the district has increased from 9.97% (April 13 to 17) to 13.16% (April18 to 22) in just one week, which demonstrates the severity of the surge. TPR at present is over 15.4%. The district disaster management authority has been declaring containment and micro-containment zones in various parts of the district to ensure strict containment. However, the evolving situation warrants special measures to bring the virus spread under control. “The district authority has examined the matter in detail and found that the enforcement of social distancing should be extended further to bring down the number of active cases and is convinced that the requirement of enforcement of 144 CrPC is essential to manage the pandemic situation in certain parts of the district where TPR is high,’’ said Navjot Khosa, district collector who is also the district magistrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/section-144-invoked-in-10-panchayats-as-tpr-hits-25/articleshow/82225339.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Khar murder case accused to appear for exams from jail||Mumbai: A magistrate court in Bandra on Friday passed an order permitting Shree Jogdhankar (22), prime accused in the Jhanvi Kukreja murder case, to appear for his term-end exams online from prison over three months. Jogdhankar has to appear for 26 exam papers, including 14 he had failed in and will be reappearing. He is studying for a BSc in Hospitality and Hotel Administration. Kukreja (19) had attended a New Year’s Eve party on the terrace of Bhagwati Heights in Khar with her neighbour, Diya Padalkar (18) and close friend, Jogdhankar. They left the event around 1.45am by the staircase, where they allegedly had a fight. Jogdhankar and Padalkar are accused of assaulting Kukreja and dragging her down from the fifth floor to the second floor. “The defence lawyer submitted that to save his (Jogdhankar’s) academic year and for a better future, he may be permitted for online exams by making appropriate arrangements in jail. Considering the submission, the age of the accused and his future, the application is allowed,” metropolitan magistrate Jaydeo Ghule ordered. Jogdhankar has to appear for the exams between April 26 and July 1 in his college uniform. Notes and his uniform have been provided to him in prison. Jodhankar’s medical reports, post the incident, stated he had three rib fractures besides lacerations on the back of his head, multiple abrasions on his back, swelling on his right wrist and abrasions on right elbow and right leg. “Jogdhankar has not been provided medical treatment in prison and is unable to sleep properly. Given the severity of injuries, he needs to be examined by a specialist,” his lawyer Mahesh Vaswani said. “Jogdhankar was produced in the sessions court during his bail hearing, without a production warrant, and appeared fit and healthy enough to visit the court,” said advocate Trivan Karnani, who is representing Kukreja’s mother. Karnani said the family has moved an intervention application opposing the fresh bail plea by Padalkar, the co-accused. Padalkar is lodged at Byculla Jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-khar-murder-case-accused-to-appear-for-exams-from-jail/articleshow/82223304.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Goa||Goa: MGP to challenge disqualification order in high court||PANAJI: MGP on Friday decided to approach the high court to challenge the dismissal of the disqualification petition against deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar by speaker Rajesh Patnekar. Patnekar had ruled that when two-third of MGP legislature party members joined BJP, the MLAs could not be disqualified as they merged with a political party as per the anti-defection law. “MGP has decided to challenge the speaker’s order and it will approach the high court next week,” MGP’s Ramkrishna Dhavalikar, the petitioner in the case, told TOI. He said that it is wrong of the speaker to hold that it is a deemed merger. Dhavalikar said that he had provided the party’s constitution to the speaker, but it wasn’t taken on record. The speaker also did not take on record the order of the high court in the disqualification petition, which was submitted, he said. Dhavalikar, who represents Marcaim constituency in the assembly, said that since 2002 he is fighting against defections. “I will continue to fight against the defection as it affects democracy,” he said. The petitioner said that as per the anti-defection act, MLAs are barred from contesting elections for six years. While dismissing the disqualification petition filed against former MGP MLAs for joining BJP in 2019, the speaker observed, “In the present case, admittedly, two out of three members of MGP Legislature Party decided/agreed to merge with the BJP. Two out of three constitute two-third. Consequently, merger as contemplated under the Xth Schedule is complete.” The speaker had rejected MGP’s argument that, in order to constitute a valid merger, besides two-thirds of the party’s MLAs taking the decision to merge, the party also should also decide to merge. While noting that the Xth Schedule of the Constitution also provides that the balance one-third members of the legislature party can continue to exist as an independent group, the speaker added that this also suggests that despite the merger under the Xth Schedule, the original political party can still continue along with the other members of the legislative party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mgp-to-challenge-disqualification-order-in-high-court/articleshow/82223306.cms||---

He said when doctors and scientists of the country had warned about the resurgence of Covid pandemic in the country, the Union and the state governments did not provide any necessary medical services to save the people. The government could not manage oxygen gas, the most important thing in the pandemic, and today every hospital in the country was suffering, he added. Mann said that about eight months ago, the health ministry had issued tenders worth about Rs 200 crore to set up 150 oxygen plants in the country, but even six months later not a single plant of the Centre has been commissioned. “Out of 162 PSA oxygen plants allotted by the government, only 33 have been set up,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/modi-capt-failed-during-covid-pandemic-mann/articleshow/82223300.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||There was delay in taking police firing case to logical end: Min||Bathinda: Punjab cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa conceded to delay on the part of the Congress government in Punjab to take the Kotkapura police firing case to its logical conclusion. He also slammed former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu for not raising the issue while in Cabinet and taking on his own party’s government. Randhawa defended the Congress government in cases of sacrilege saying that it succeeded in getting the cases back from the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI). Even as Navjot Singh Sidhu kept up a volley of scathing attacks, albeit without naming anyone, ministers of Capt Amarinder Singh government were not defending the chief minister. Randhawa, who had gone to Bhinder Khurd village in Moga to open a branch of the cooperative bank, told media persons, “our government got late in taking the Kotkapura police firing case to its logical conclusion.” Later, he told TOI, “No doubt our government delayed against the aspirations of the people and we will have to face them for it but we did our best in getting three cases of sacrilege, including theft of Bir of Guru Granth Sahib from Gurdwara Burj Jawahar Singh Wala, putting up derogatory posters on September 25 and sacrilege at Bargari on October 12, 2015, back from CBI.” He also alleged that the allegations being levelled by Navjot Singh Sidhu were politically motivated. “Navjot Singh Sidhu had been part of the government for over two years and did not effectively raise the issue like he is doing now, for reasons best known to him. We confess that the cases got delayed in concluding but how can Sidhu escape responsibility being part of the government? He should restrain himself in raising the matter the way he is doing, which seems politically motivated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/there-was-delay-in-taking-police-firing-case-to-logical-end-min/articleshow/82222409.cms||Neel Kamal

One of the city’s largest hospitals, Artemis, sent out an SOS in the morning, similar to the ones from Fortis on Thursday afternoon. “Artemis Hospital Gurugram is in its last leg of oxygen. Last night’s commitment of oxygen replenishment remained unfulfilled … Only three hours to go. Please help us urgently,” tweeted Artemis managing director Dr Devlina Chakravarty at 10.22am on Friday. The flurry of appeals prompted the Gurugram administration to contact hospitals to share their consumption and demand for an ‘oxygen assessment plan’. It also assured hospitals that the situation will improve within the next two days as Gurugram will get an additional 20 MT oxygen from Bhiwadi in Rajasthan. The Haryana government is planning to set up an oxygen helpline for hospitals. Artemis was provided with oxygen cylinders by the district administration around 12.30pm. Other hospitals in Gurugram also said they are facing issues in filling up their cylinders as the oxygen demand has increased rapidly in the past three-four days. Meanwhile, the district administration said the situation will improve within two days. “ The district is drafting an oxygen assessment plan and has asked all hospitals to share their oxygen consumption and demand, on the basis of which the plan can be made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gurgaon-to-draft-o2-plan-as-hosps-run-out-of-lifeline/articleshow/82223302.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Delhi||Delhi govt to create buffer stock of oxygen cylinders||NEW DELHI: Amid the oxygen crisis confronting city hospitals, Delhi government has decided to maintain a buffer stock of oxygen cylinders and liquid medical oxygen for use in extremely critical situations. The supply from this buffer stock will be made when the hospitals have just three hours of oxygen left. Meanwhile, the health department has asked all medical facilities to depute officers as in-charges of the gas, pointing out that some institutions were using oxygen in excess of the central government guidelines of a flow of 10 litres/minute for non-ICU and 24 litres/minute for ICU patients. The hospitals have been asked to urgently carry out an audit and identify the cause of excess use and devise a strategy to bring down to compliant levels. They have also been asked to maintain a log of consumption and make them accessible to nodal officers deputed by the state government. “Hospitals have been requested to maintain their supply through normal channels through assigned vendors and request for allocation from the buffer stock should be made only when the supply of oxygen is alarmingly low at three hours or less,” disclosed a government source. Helpline 011-41400400 has been assigned for making replenishment requests in extremely critical situations. The requests must be made on the helpline and in writing endorsed by the nodal officer. The helpline got 24 calls from hospitals till 6pm on Friday. A source disclosed that all the cases were resolved. All hospitals are being assigned a daily quota of oxygen which will be reviewed and revised periodically. The officer said, “The hospitals are not permitted to draw quantities beyond the permitted quota and vendors needs to be strictly comply with this.” All suppliers, vendors and refillers have been asked to submit detailed daily reports. The hospitals have been cautioned that some facilities are using oxygen in excess of the levels prescribed by the central government. Arun Gupta, president, Delhi Medical Council, said the guidelines on usage of oxygen were based on the assumption that non-ICU on oxygen should be given not more than 10 litres per minute. “Patients not maintaining oxygen saturation at this flow are shifted to the ICU where higher flow of oxygen is given,” explained Gupta. The hospitals have been asked to audit and bring down volume of oxygen usage in the shortest possible time and focus on the reducing high-oxygen usage. The officer in charge of oxygen that all hospitals will be the single point of contact for all oxygen-related matters, including data furnishing and request for emergency supplies.

Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said that the state government would bear the expense of Covid-19 vaccination for people in the age group of 18-to-45 years at both private and government facilities. “The decision has been taken to boost the inoculation drive amid a surge in new infections. The entire exercise would roughly cost Rs 400 crore to the state exchequer as the state has 50 lakh people in the age bracket of 18 to 45 years,” the CM said. He added, “All hospitals — government and private — in the state have been asked to reserve 75% of their beds – apart from the ones in the OPD – for Covid cases. In the next few days, I will myself interact with the officials of hospitals in this regard.” Meanwhile, Rawat warned of ‘stringent action’ against those found involved in black-marketing of medicines. “I have asked the health department to take strict action against such people," he added.

He said the state government was also providing health facilities even to all serious patients coming from Delhi to Punjab after failing to get a bed in Covid-care hospitals there. Responding to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) allegations of not doing anything for Covid-19 patients, Sidhu said before raising questions at the Punjab government, the AAP should just take a look at the severe Covid-19 crises in Delhi with open eyes. Sidhu said it is a critical time and instead of shattering the confidence of healthcare and frontline workers, AAP leaders should question their party convener Arvind Kejriwal as to how he failed to tackle the situation in Delhi. They should also ask Kejriwal why people are dying due to non-availability of beds and treatment in hospitals in Delhi, he added. Sidhu said so far, 8,77,146 cases have been reported in Delhi whereas it’s 3,04,660 in Punjab. There are 43,857 cases per million in Delhi and 10,158 cases in Punjab. Similarly, 20-25% positivity rate has been recorded in Delhi in the last few days and 10% in Punjab while 618 deaths per million were registered in Delhi and 266 in Punjab. The health minister asked leader of opposition in Punjab assembly Harpal Singh Cheema that if he is real Punjabi and has sympathy in his heart for Covid-19 patients, then he should encourage the medical fraternity besides other departments concerned in Punjab for their tireless efforts instead of playing petty politics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/health-minister-slams-aap-says-look-at-delhi-before-commenting-on-pb/articleshow/82223312.cms||---

Information on the dashboard developed by the state government is limited to hospital beds. As kin of Covid patients frantically searched for help on social media, few netizens went beyond just hospital beds. Vensy Krishna, a 25-year-old lawyer currently working in tech and education along with her friend Medha K, an education and social work consultant, launched an app titled ‘Hyd Covid Resources’. The app provides verified information on availability of oxygen, Remdesivir, ambulance, plasma, blood banks, meal services and other services including mental health counselling and post death arrangements. “We source the information through social media and a spreadsheet that is updated with Covid-19 resources information. A team of 30 volunteers helps us get this information verified following which we put it up on the app. Verified content has a blue badge,” said Vensy. Within three days of its launch, the app has about 90,000 users. “The availability status of resources is updated every 30 minutes. Our volunteers make calls to the resource providers thrice a day to ensure that the information is verified and updated,” said Vensy. Another dashboard, titled HydCovid.com, works on similar lines wherein it extends information on helplines, hospital bed availability, medicines and ambulance providers etc. “My wife and I got together to develop a dashboard that can help people source information on Covid resources. We circulated a spreadsheet where people could upload resource availability. Now, we have two volunteers who are helping us verify the information,” said Sugandh Rakha, an IT employee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dashboards-provide-verified-info-on-covid-19-resources/articleshow/82222429.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Nashik||New private hospitals in Nashik won’t be allowed O2 beds for now||NASHIK: The prevailing acute shortage of medical oxygen in Nashik has forced the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) to decide against giving approval to any new private hospital to start oxygen beds. At present, there are around 6,000 oxygen beds in private hospitals, including the ones reserved by NMC. NMC’s medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagargoje said that since availability of oxygen has become an issue, it has been decided not to give permissions to any new private hospital to start oxygen beds so that the existing Covid hospitals will get the oxygen supply. “We will also not give permission for oxygen beds to new private hospitals,who want to treat Covid patients, but will give permission for general beds,” said Nagargoje. The private hospitals are facing acute shortage of oxygen. While the daily demand for the medical oxygen is over 130 tonne, the district is getting only 85 tonnes of medical oxygen per day. District collector Suraj Mandhare had said on Thursday that the administration is making arrangements to bring O2 from Nagpur and Aurangabad. In the meantime, the NMC has decided to add 100 more oxygen beds at its Bytco hospital — which presently has 305 oxygen beds. The NMC has set up a large oxygen tanks with a capacity of 19,000 litres of liquid oxygen. Raj Nagarkar, president, private hospital owners’ association, said that all the oxygen beds in the city are fully occupied. The NMC has taken good step in not allowing new oxygen beds for the hospitals in view of the scarcity of the oxygen. “There has been scarcity of oxygen and we need an adequate and regular supply of oxygen to treat the Covid patients. Moreover, the hike in oxygen prices by almost three times in the past few days is another issue. Earlier, we would pay Rs 5,400 per 245 litre oxygen cylinder, now we have been paying Rs 14,500 per cylinder, which also includes 12% GST,” said Nagarkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/new-private-hospitals-in-nashik-wont-be-allowed-o2-beds-for-now/articleshow/82220239.cms||Tushar Pawar

The online event was held as part of the EU Day series and put a spotlight on the joint initiatives with India in the area of climate action, clean energy transition, biodiversity including policy dialogues and the role of innovation. European climate and energy policies, including the EU recovery package Next Generation EU, the European Green Deal, and research and innovation initiatives were also discussed. The EU-India Clean Energy and Climate Partnership was agreed to at the EU-India Summit in 2016 and reiterated during the 15th EU-India Summit in July 2020. It includes cooperation on energy efficiency, renewable energy, smart grids and grid integration, storage, sustainable finance, cooling and the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Delivering the keynote address, Mr Ugo Astuto, the EU Ambassador to India, said, “The first Earth Day took place in 1970. Now, 51 years later, this day is more relevant than ever, as the planet is facing the existential issue of climate change. Today, on international Earth Day, we must remember how fragile our planet is and how important it is to protect its climate and biodiversity. If we want to achieve the objectives set in Paris, the international community needs to act cohesively and consistently. The EU and India can play an important role in shaping the global agenda.” In his opening address, Ajit K Chaturvedi, director of IIT Roorkee, welcomed the EU delegation and gave an overview of the institution. “While there is a consensus among academia for solutions enabling environment protection and promoting clean energy, it is critical to communicate solutions in an effective manner to policy and decision makers. The issues to be addressed by India-EU Clean Energy and Climate Partnership (CECP) project have a strong overlap with the expertise available at IIT Roorkee. Today’s discussions will enable us to strengthen and catapult our collaborations with the EU institutes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/on-earth-day-eu-delegation-at-iit-roorkee-discusses-ways-to-remedy-climate-change/articleshow/82220903.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The SAD (Democratic) leader also said it is really unfortunate to see that even in this hour of crisis, people had to run from pillar to post to get the vaccine. He said due to the shortage of vaccine, the tall claims of the Congress government in Punjab have been exposed as the state government was claiming that people are getting the best health facilities across Punjab, but in actual people have been forced to return without getting the jab. The Lehra MLA said the failure to vaccination target has proved to be a gross negligence on the part of the state government. “The situation in Punjab is such that even in private hospitals, there is a vaccine shortage. Big cities like Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar are also facing acute vaccine shortage,” said Dhindsa. Both the central as well as state governments had a lot of time to contain the spread of this deadly infection, but despite this, the second wave of Covid-19 has already started spreading its deadly wings hence badly exposing the tall claims and promises made by the Centre and Punjab government regarding the health facilities. Expressing serious concern over the acute shortage of oxygen in many states of the country, Dhindsa warned the Punjab government to remain fully prepared to avert the crisis of oxygen shortage in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pb-govt-drastically-failed-to-meet-vaccination-target-parminder/articleshow/82223319.cms||---

For this, an application will be submitted to the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC). A spokesman of Power discom said as per directions of HERC, it is mandatory to keep the ACD amount equal to two average billing cycles based on previous year consumption of consumers of all categories. The ACD is being postponed for one year by the department to provide relief to consumers during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic so that consumers are not financially burdened in this hour of crisis. The spokesman said the Power discom is also committed to ensuring uninterrupted power supply to consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-discoms-to-defer-advance-consumption-deposit/articleshow/82223322.cms||---

The state government and the district administration are doing their best to meet the increased demand of oxygen in the Covid hospitals. To ensure availability of sufficient oxygen, and to plan out local requirements by setting up local oxygen generating plants at all possible places, divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar along with the health department officials, visited Ursula Hospital and Manyavar Kanshiram Hospital and the Trauma Centre. Following the chief minister’s directives, one 500 litre per minute capacity oxygen producing generator has been ordered to be set up in Ursula Hospital. The supply of the equipment has been ensured by the Government of India and the state government. The new oxygen plant will supply sufficient oxygen to Ursula Hospital. Looking into the urgent oxygen requirement in hospitals, the commissioner directed the chief medical officer, chief medical superintendent and director of Ursula Hospital to ensure that the new oxygen generating plant is made functional within next one week. The progress of work will be monitored by the director himself on a daily basis so that the work gets completed in the next one week to ensure proper supply of oxygen, he said. In the Kanshi Ram Hospital, one new 102 litre per minute capacity oxygen plant is required to meet the requirement of the Covid hospital for which the site has been identified and the proposal has been sent to the state government for release of funds. After taking all details into consideration, the commissioner wrote a letter to the additional chief secretary (health) requesting him to look into the issue and sanction the required budget for the new oxygen plant at Kanshiram Covid hospital Kanpur so that oxygen requirement of the hospital could be met by local production. The commissioner has directed the officers of Kanshiram Hospital to monitor the work progress on a regular basis and follow up the proposal sent to the government so that early an approval is given to it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/oxygen-producing-generators-to-be-set-up-in-two-covid-hospitals-of-the-city/articleshow/82221840.cms||---
---||Delhi||Start testing, isolation on campus: JNU teachers||New Delhi: Despite several requests from students and teachers to create quarantine and testing facilities on campus, Jawaharlal Nehru University is yet to issue any orders on the subject. The varsity’s teachers association (JNUTA) has written to the registrar asking for prompt action for the safety of students and staff on campus. Teachers point out that other institutions like IIT Delhi have created facilities, which have helped ease the burden on campus residents. “JNUTA strongly condemns the non-cooperative attitude of the administration in responding to the suggestions made for opening of Covid management facilities on the campus, as per the guidelines for gated residential complexes desirous of setting up a small Covid care facility issued by Delhi government on April 18,” the body said. In a letter to the assistant district magistrate, JNUTA had earlier made a suggestion to use guesthouses located on campus as isolation facilities. “A team headed by the sub-divisional magistrate visited the campus on Friday and found the facilities to be adequate for a quarantine centre,” the body added. Meanwhile, the JNU administration termed the statement by the students and JNUTA as “malicious”. “As far as managing the Covid response on the campus is concerned, each hostel has set up its response team under the guidance of hostel warden to take care of any student with either infection or symptoms. Each hostel has its own designated space where such students can be kept under observation. For those who have tested positive, every help is being arranged by the Covid response team. Food is also being provided to the residents in isolation. University also has an ambulance in case of emergency,” said the statement issued by the VC office. Students have also raised concern over the testing facility. Saket Moon, vice-president of the students union, said, “The closest test facility to JNU (Munirka) is facing a shortage of kits. Students and faculty have to visit the test facility at IIT-D.” The students had also spoken to the local MLA Naresh Yadav on the issue. Yadav tweeted, “If the JNU administration gives permission, then only we can arrange for a quarantine facility in the university. We are ready to provide all facilities on behalf of Delhi government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/start-testing-isolation-on-campus-jnu-teachers/articleshow/82236015.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Goa: ‘Private buses will ply on rotation basis from today’||BICHOLIM: President of the All Goa Bus Owners’ Association Sudip Tamankar said that buses that were off route on Thursday and Friday will ply from Saturday onwards on a rotational basis. He said that of the total 1,460 buses, around 100-125 will ply regularly on a rotational basis. Tamankar added that the state government has not provided them any financial help and that they have taken this decision on their own to facilitate commuters. After the new SOPs were issued by the state government stating that buses can ply at only 50% passenger capacity, Bicholim police had instructed bus owners with vehicles on the Valpoi-Panaji and Ponda-Bicholim route to follow the norms. Following this, many had kept their buses off the route as it would be a loss for them to operate at half capacity. The government had therefore urged the bus owners to restart the buses to avoid inconvenience to commuters. Under Tamankar’s leadership, a delegation of bus owners plying their vehicles on the Valpoi-Panaji and Bicholim-Ponda routes, submitted a memorandum to Bicholim PI Mahesh Gadekar urging the state government to find an amicable solution over the issue as they find it difficult to operate the buses at reduced passenger capacity given the high fuel prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/private-buses-will-ply-on-rotation-basis-from-today/articleshow/82223342.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Job loss, cash crunch return to haunt migrant workers||HYDERABAD: As the second wave of Covid intensifies, migrant workers in Hyderabad are left to bear the brunt of it, all over again. Much like 2020, this time too, many have found themselves at the mercy of their employers, who’ve either withheld salaries — for fear of them leaving town and not returning to work -- or unceremoniously shown them the door, without clearing dues. Strapped for employment and money, some workers say they have no choice but to go back to their hometowns, albeit reluctantly. Though social organisations, working with the migrant workforce on ground, say that there isn’t an exodus just yet, they fear that more and more people might hit the road soon, for fear of being left stranded here. “We did not want to wish to return to our village this year, because there is no work for us there. But now that we have no job or a place to stay — the employer has not even paid our dues — returning home is our only option,” said Arun Kumar from Jharkhand’s Koderma district, who lived through the same experience during last year’s lockdown. While he, along with six others, returned to the city a few months ago, hoping things would be different this time, it hasn’t clearly been the case. “After much negotiation, the manager paid Rs 5,000, which is less than half my salary. It isn’t possible to survive like this,” said the young man, in between scouting for a train ticket to Jharkhand. Caught in a similar crisis and an approaching wedding day — he is set to marry on April 27 — Rama Raj, was forced to leave Hyderabad last week, without any payment. “My owner wasn’t very regular with my salary. And when I told him I had to travel home for my wedding, he refused to settle my dues. I had to leave without the money,” said Raj, from his home in UP’s Faizabad district. His fabrication job in town earned him Rs 12,000 a month. Though, Vicky Kumar, employed at a hardware shop in Ranigunj, is still hopeful of being paid, he says he does not have the resources to continue living in the city. “I am going back to Gaya (Bihar) at the end of this month. My employer said he doesn’t need me anymore. Though he hasn’t paid me yet (Rs 12,000), he has assured to settle it before I leave,” the 22-year-old said. His father, a security guard at a sweet shop, meanwhile, has been asked to either take a pay cut (Rs 400 per day instead from Rs 550) or quit. “The situation is deteriorating again. Though the fear of Covid is not so much among them this time, people are scared of being stuck here with no food, shelter and money — exactly what happened last year,” said Raju Ojha, chairman, Bihar Samaj Seva Sangh, that works closely with migrants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/job-loss-cash-crunch-return-to-haunt-migrant-workers/articleshow/82222444.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Chandigarh||‘Probe kept as political horse to be flogged at right time’||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has observed that even after making effort to find out and establish the allegation of conspiracy against Akali leaders Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhbir Badal and despite mentioning their names in the charge sheet, Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, former IGP, did not array them as accused by filing any charge against them in these two FIRs till now. “This is despite the fact that Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh has been repeatedly highlighting the participation of Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhbir Singh Badal in the conspiracy and in influencing outcome of the investigation. And the fact that Kunwar Vijay Pratap went to the extent of giving an interview to a TV channel during high time of election process, shows only one thing that the present investigation has been kept by him as political horse to be flogged only at an opportune time, whenever the elections are around the corner or when it otherwise suits him,” the HC observed. According to HC, his act seems to have proved the allegations that he was acting with an intention of furthering the political agenda and not carrying out a comprehensive and impartial investigation in the case. In its order, the HC has also recorded that the charge sheet in which the alleged role of the Badal duo has been mentioned by Kunwar Vijay was prepared way back on May 23, 2019. “There is no justification for not filing challan against them despite having recorded in the earlier charge sheet that the allegations of conspiracy against the above said two political entities stand established. The only possible fact which prevents filing charge sheet against these two leaders can be that there is no evidence against both of them. Hence, the conduct of Kunwar Vijay Pratap and methodology adopted for carrying out the investigation by him goes to substantiate the allegations made by the petitioner cops that he (Kunwar Vijay) was acting with an intention to further the political agenda and was not carrying out a comprehensive and impartial investigation,” the court observed. The HC, however, has held that there is not any material collected by Kunwar Vijay to even remotely suggest direct linkage of the then CM, Parkash Singh Badal, to any conspiracy except the call records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/probe-kept-as-political-horse-to-be-flogged-at-right-time/articleshow/82222446.cms||Ajay Sura

The chief of the team and Nashik divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game and around four members went to the hospital on Thursday evening. They remained in the hospital for half an hour and even inspected the oxygen tank. “The divisional commissioner along with other four committee members had a discussion with the hospital authorities about the mishap,” said NMC official. The official added that they also inspected the oxygen tank at the backside of the hospital in the premises. “They also asked for the suggestions to avert such mishap”, said the NMC official. The state government has appointed a seven-member team led by Game and has given it a 15-day deadline to conduct the probe and submit the report. The state government issued a notification about the probe by the seven-member committee on Thursday evening, giving 15 days’ time to conduct the probe. After the notification, the committee immediately started the probe in the Jakir Hussain oxygen tank leakage case in which 22 critical patients died on Wednesday. The Nashik Municipal Corporation run hospital has been treating Covid patients and has more than half of its beds reserved for patients needing oxygen support. Eleven of the patients, who died in the incident on Wednesday, were on ventilator support at that time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-panel-begins-probe-into-oxygen-leakage/articleshow/82220276.cms||Tushar Pawar

After the incident of oxygen tank leakage at a hospital run by the Nashik Municipal Corporation, which claimed 22 lives, Desai has asked all the hospitals to carry out technical audit of the oxygen storage and supply mechanism developed in some of the public and private hospitals, where Covid patients are being treated.  Desai said, “The technical audit of the oxygen storage and supply infrastructure must be done in a day or two. The place, where tanks and generators are placed must not have any inflammable material, any equipment or machinery, which are easily prone to fire and other types of hazard. At every such place, ensure round-the-clock vigilance. The hospitals must set up CCTV cameras so in cases of an hazard, it can be contained at an early stage.” The tanks are directly connected to the oxygen masks put on the critical patients and also to the ventilators, which are used in a very critical stage. Damage or any hazard to the tank can directly affect the patient and in case the supply stops, the patient dies. “I have asked the hospitals to ensure the electrical fittings in the hospitals are done properly and if there are any faults, they must be corrected. The hospitals must set up its fire fighting system,” said Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/ensure-oxygen-tanks-are-safe-from-hazards/articleshow/82220290.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Provide quality PPE, allow quarantine days to limit exposure: Govt doctors||HYDERABAD: Amid the surge in Covid-19 cases and strong evidence that the coronavirus is transmitted through air, doctors working in government hospitals in the city said that the least government could do is provide them with quality PPE kits, install filters in Covid wards, give equal days of quarantine to limit exposure of medical staff to Covid, and immediately recruit more medical employees. Senior resident doctors, treating Covid patients at the Government General and Chest Hospital in Hyderabad, have threatened to boycott duties from Saturday if their demands for safe protective gear and quarantine leave, among others, are not considered. The doctors served the boycott notice to the hospital’s superintendent on Friday. In their notice, the doctors have demanded adequate and safe protective gear at work, as the usage of PPE provided is leading to extreme exhaustion. They added that it is uncomfortable to work in harsh conditions, especially in the high summer temperatures. The second demand is to allow for a quarantine period after work since some of them have already tested positive for coronavirus, leading to a decline in manpower. “Further burdening without quarantine will lead to more losses. Accommodation and transport have not been provided since the past eight months, forcing us to stay with families and increasing the risk to the family members. Parents of some senior resident doctors have been affected and some are critically ill. There is lack of adequate beds and oxygen supply outside to treat or admit family members,” said members of the Telangana Senior Residents Doctors Association. The association demanded reservation of beds for family members and senior residents working at the hospital, and allotment of post-graduate doctors to assist in treatment of patients. Doctors said that having quarantine days is going to help doctors in keeping Covid-19 at bay.  “Earlier, if we had to work for 5 days, we used to get 5 days quarantine. But now, quarantine days are removed, which means we have to continuously work in Covid wards and risk getting Covid,” said Dr Naresh M, pulmonologist, Government General and Chest Hospital. “When it is known that Covid is transmitted through air, why can’t we be given proper equipment especially when the entire hospital is slowly being converted into Covid-19 wards,” he questioned. Doctors said they are exhausted and traumatised as they are working round the clock and added that more than anything, they need manpower. “If there is enough manpower, we can work in shifts. Now, everyone — doctors, nurses, ward boys, aayas, patient care workers, are all tired. In an ICU with 40 patients, there is one patient care worker and a doctor. If the state continues to be oblivious to our problems, the day will come where most of the doctors will get infected and there won’t be many left to treat patients,” said a doctor at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research. Another doctor at District Hospital, King Koti said that if it is not too much of a financial burden on the state, it should procure UV air purifiers to get the hospital premises cleaned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/provide-quality-ppe-allow-quarantine-days-to-limit-exposure-govt-doctors/articleshow/82222514.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

On Friday, 249 people were fined for not wearing masks and a fine of Rs 60,000 were collected.As many as 175 vehicles were confiscated after the police found that the people have stepped out without any valid reasons. Police have also filed cases against 1,215 commuters under various clauses of the Motor Vehicle Act.

---||Delhi||United halts flights to and from Delhi||New Delhi: United has temporarily suspended all its flights between the US and Delhi following confusion over RT-PCR testing requirement of crew members. Its New York (Newark)-Delhi flight UA 801 landed here on Thursday night. A disagreement on testing for crew of this flight, who were not alighting from the Boeing 777 and were to fly back to Newark, saw the airline deciding to take off from here without boarding passengers waiting to do so at IGI Airport. “A government (not aviation) official insisted RT-PCR test be conducted on the crew of UA 801 that was to fly back as UA 802. This despite clear orders from the aviation ministry not to do so for asymptomatic crew of quick turn around (QTA) international flights who do not alight from aircraft and fly out of India. This disagreement saw the United flight leaving for Newark without boarding passengers,” said sources. In a statement, United said: “As we seek clarity regarding Covid-19 travel requirements to India, we have temporarily suspended service to Delhi for April 22 and cancelled the corresponding return flights. We are working to provide alternative options to our customers and plan to resume our scheduled service as soon as possible.” United, the only US carrier that flies to India currently, has nonstop flights between Delhi and Newark, San Francisco and Chicago. Suspension of these flights is a big blow to India-US connectivity during the pandemic as soon-to-be-privatised Air India is the only other airline that has direct flights to US destinations. Apart from the Delhi flights, United only has a Mumbai-Newark connection. The aviation ministry says it has been getting requests from airlines to exempt pilots operating international flights from RT-PCR tests, which is not allowed as per current norms here. However, it made an exception for crew of QTA international flights who do not alight from aircraft. “Considering that cockpit crew remain within aircraft in a sterile environment of the flight deck and the cabin crew are protected by PPE, these crew operating international QTA flights are exempted from RT-PCR test on arrival at Indian airports,” says an order issued by aviation ministry joint secretary Usha Padhee this Tuesday. Despite this, sources said the United crew members—all of whom were to remain inside the aircraft and fly back to New York— were asked to undergo the test. So they decided to fly back without boarding passengers. Sources said stranded passengers were being sent on other flights to Europe on Friday night so that they could fly further to the US. Meanwhile, some foreign airlines operating medium and long haul nonstops to India are leant to be planning to add a stopover on their flights to India closer to the country. The idea is to have a crew change from there to operate the flight to India and then out of India to avoid their crew being exposed to the new virus strain by staying over here. Some international airlines have sought separate fast lanes and exit areas at IGIA for crew to avoid them getting exposure risk in the common arrival hall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/united-halts-flights-to-and-from-delhi/articleshow/82222560.cms||Saurabh Sinha

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Inspector held for being part of Mansukh Hiran murder plot||MUMBAI: The NIA on Friday arrested police inspector Sunil Mane in connection with the planting of explosives in a Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 and the subsequent murder of the vehicle’s owner, Mansukh Hiran. Mane (52) was arrested after NIA questioned him through Thursday night and confronted him with statements of arrested assistant police inspectors Sachin Waze and Riyazuddin Kazi. Officials said Mane was not only involved in the conspiracy meetings, but was present in Thane on March 4 night, when Hiran was killed. He is the fourth cop and fifth person held in the case. Mane called Hiran posing as inspector Tawde: NIAPolice inspector Sunil Mane, arrested in connection with the planting of explosives in a Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 and subsequent murder of the vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran, was produced before the NIA court on Friday. He was remanded in police custody till April 28. Mane’s lawyer Aditya Gor said, “My client has claimed innocence and on my application, the court has allowed me to speak to him for 30 minutes and he should have access to his medical report.’’ Earlier, the NIA had arrested APIs Sachin Waze, Riyazuddin Kazi, convicted constable Vinayak Shinde and Gujarat-based cricket bookie Naresh Gor. Mane, who was previously attached to the crime branch unit XI, was moved to the local arms division in the recent crime branch clean-up drive after Waze’s arrest. Last year, he was abruptly transferred from crime branch unit X to Modus Operandi Branch after an accused alleged that he had extorted money from him. Mane is accused of attending the March 2 and 3 conspiracy meetings held by Waze. The March 2 meeting was at Andheri which was attended by Waze, Mane and a retired cop. Initially, it was decided that Mane would keep Hiren in hiding, but Mane refused. At the March 3 meeting, Mane, along with Waze, called Hiran to the Crime Intelligence Unit office at the police headquarters and pressured him to take the responsibility of the bomb scare case and assured him early bail. When Hiran refused, Waze and others allegedly decided to eliminate him. NIA officials said it was Mane who used the Gujarat SIM card to call Hiran at his Thane residence posing as ‘inspector Tawde’. According to the NIA, on March 4, Waze, Shinde, Mane and three others were in two cars waiting for Hiran. When he arrived, Waze spoke to him for a while and then handed him over to his accomplices, who killed him and dumped his body in Mumbra creek, the agency said. Public prosecutor Prakash Shetty told the NIA court that they needed Mane’s custody to obtain his devices and call records as he had a role in Hiran’s murder. Early this month, the NIA had recorded the statements of former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma and former police commissioner Param Bir Singh as Waze was directly reporting to Singh. Sources said Kazi, who is likely to be made an approver, has disclosed the entire conspiracy and destruction of evidence. A detailed investigation by the NIA and ATS suggests that Waze wanted to take the credit of ‘solving’ the case and restore his image as he had been suspended for 16 years after the custodial death of alleged terror suspect Khwaja Yunus. The initial plan was to kill two suspected criminals outside Ambani’s house in the fake encounter and take credit. Meanwhile, the judicial custody of both Waze and Kazi has been extended to May 5. Waze moved a plea seeking law books, mattress and towels. He also sought medication, carbon papers and postal stamps. The prosecution opposed his plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mane-called-hiran-posing-as-inspector-tawde-in-mumbai-nia/articleshow/82223370.cms||Ahmed Ali

To fill up the quota for women, the commission had only lowered the cut-off marks for women candidates by 10% compared to the cut-off marks fixed for male candidates, and it did not calculate the seats by considering the reservation as horizontal across the caste quota. This resulted in recruitment of 21 less female candidates. When the HC division bench concluded that 21 male candidates were wrongly recruited, though on ad-hoc basis because of ongoing litigation, it ordered for their removal. It asked the government to keep them either on contractual basis or allow them to apply for the job in new recruitment drive, but 21 female candidates who were waiting for their turn were ordered to be hired. Some of those officers who lost their jobs approached the Supreme Court with the argument that they had not been heard by the high court. They were recruited on basis of their merit and had been serving the job for past few years. According to advocate Utkarsh Dave, who appeared for a group of litigants, the apex court issued notice to the state government and the litigants before the HC and posted further hearing eight weeks later. “In the meantime, the persons who have already been appointed and are working shall not be disturbed,” read the order passed by the bench of Justices Navin Sinha and Ajay Rastogi. The HC had criticized the GPSC for calculating seats under women’s quota in wanton manner and not doing it in logical manner, which was ultimately prescribed by a division bench of Gujarat HC last year and upheld by the apex court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/apex-court-stays-sacking-of-21-male-forest-officials/articleshow/82222542.cms||---

The DMK leader apprehended arrest in a case booked against him on the basis of a social media video grab allegedly showing him bribing voters during the assembly election. Justice M Nirmal Kumar granted the relief while allowing a bail application moved by Nehru. It was Nehru’s case that according to the prosecution on April 4 at about 2.30pm the Musiri police in Trichy received a complaint about a video that went viral on social media, showing Nehru distributing money to voters. Therefore, based on the complaint the police registered an FIR under Sections 294(b), 171(E), 171(H), 501(1) of IPC read with section 67 of the Information Technology Act. Denying any such offence, the petitioner contended that the allegations levelled against him are false and the alleged video is being spread in social media only to achieve political gain since no such incident took place. Claiming that he is a law-abiding person, Nehru assured the court that he will not evade due process of law and that he is ready to abide by any condition if bail is granted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/hc-reprieve-to-nehru-in-cash-for-vote-case/articleshow/82222537.cms||---

While permitting the student to take the next supplementary test, Justice N V Anjaria observed that the student’s depression qualifies as a reason for “compelling reason” or serious illness as mentioned in the rule book of the institute for granting an exemption to a student from the exams and giving him another opportunity. Student’s advocate Ronith Joy submitted that the institute did not allow the student to appear in the exam because he had not given intimation to the university that he was not well and under depression. The student had not even informed his parents about his mental health and therefore the college authorities were not communicated about the problem that began since January 2020 and worsened during the lockdown. He could not appear in two semester exams. It was submitted that the institute ought to have taken a human approach keeping in mind the pandemic and the resultant effect it has taken on the student’s mental health. The student even started having suicidal thoughts. However, The Academic Review Committee in September 2020 resolved to remove the him from the course on account that he could not earn 25 credits at the end of second semester. The institute did not budge from its stand even in its order in January this year. This brought the student to seek relief from the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/allow-depressed-student-to-take-exam-hc-to-svnit/articleshow/82222533.cms||---

He was among the 54 fatalities officially reported even as Bihar created yet anotherrecord with 12,672 people testing positive in a day out of 1,0,8147 samples tested. Choudhary, who had also served as Arwal DM, breathed his last at AIIMS-Patna. CM Nitish Kumar and healthminister Mangal Pandey expressed deep condolence over his death. Nitish said Choudhary’s demise was a big loss to the administration and society and prayed for the departed soul and his family. Pandey also prayed for the departed soul and called his death a big loss for the department. On the back of the spiking caseload and rising deaths, Bihar’s Covid positivity rate on Friday also reached 11.71%, which is the highest so far and above the danger mark. Positivity rate is the percentage of people who have tested positive against the total number of tests done. WHO has kept a 5% positivity rate as the threshold and any figure above it indicates danger. As per data shared by the health department, out of the 54 deaths reported in the state, the three highest number of fatalities are 13 from Patna district, seven from Muzaffarpur and five from West Champaran. The state capital also reported the highest number of new cases where 2,801 people tested positive taking the active cases in the district to 16,867. Covid-19 cases reported from other districts are Gaya (816), Aurangabad (748), Muzaffarpur (704), Saran (617) and Begusarai (607). Hence, with the increase in the number of new cases, active ones in Bihar have reached 76418. Meanwhile, 77,466 Covid-19 vaccines were administered on Friday, including both the first and the second doses. While 53,423 beneficiaries got their first shot, another 25,043 got the second shot. So far, a total of 55.37 lakh beneficiaries have got the first dose and another 9.25 lakh have got the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bihar-health-department-secretary-ravi-shankar-choudhary-among-54-dead-covid-caseshit-another-peak/articleshow/82224835.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Chandigarh||Capt evading responsibility in sacrilege case probe: Sidhu||Chandigarh: Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday took an overt swipe at chief minister Amarinder Singh, who holds the home portfolio, over the sacrilege issue by accusing him of “evading responsibility” in the case involving desecration of a religious text. Sidhu’s latest tweet caused a disquiet in the Punjab Congress which has preferred not to react to his repeated jibes. Sidhu tweeted, “Is sacrilege case not the top priority for the Home Minister? Evading of responsibility & making only Advocate General (AG) a scapegoat means Executive Authority has No supervisory control. Who controls the AG ? Legal Team is just a pawn in this game of shifting responsibilities (sic).” After making veiled attacks at his party’s state government with cryptic posts so far, the Amritsar (East) MLA has decided to sharpen his attack, directly targeting the chief minister and fuelling speculations about his political future. In a scenario where the party has been condoning Sidhu’s jibes, most cabinet ministers remain undecided on whether to take him on, especially on the emotive issue of sacrilege, until a clear signal is received from the party high command. Since the detailed court order is still awaited, the party has also not spelt out its stand on the Kotkapura probe. Meanwhile, reacting to Sidhu’s tweet, Congress MLA from Amritsar (West) Raj Kumar Verka said, “Whatever his demand is, he should raise it with the chief minister and the party high command. The issue should be discussed. This is my appeal to Sidhu.” “Where the ruling party is already on the backfoot over quashing of the Kotkapura firing probe report, Sidhu’s repeated jibes are embarrassing the party leaders. Most senior leaders seem to be ‘waiting and watching’ without taking on Sidhu or coming to the CM’s defence. Sidhu could either be on his way out or putting pressure on the party to appoint him as the state president,” said a senior party leader. Sources said there is a growing sentiment among the party MLAs that it was high time that the party intervened to either act against Sidhu or rehabilitate him as he has been pushed to the fringes since his resignation from the cabinet in 2019. “Sidhu’s aggressive posturing is denting the party image. However, with the general perception that he has been in touch with the party high command, most leaders have been wary of openly hitting out at him,” added a Congress MLA. Apart from Sidhu, party’s Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa too has been raising questions on the advocate general office and demanded that AG Atul Nanda should be replaced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-evading-responsibility-in-sacrilege-case-probe-sidhu/articleshow/82222539.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Delhi||CPWD invites bids for office buildings at cost of over Rs 3k cr||New Delhi: The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has invited bids for three new office buildings under the Common Central Secretariat project along Rajpath at a cost of Rs 3,269 crore and another Rs 139 crore has been kept for five years’ maintenance. These buildings will have to be completed in 24 months from the date of start of work. These three buildings will come on the plot where the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts is currently located in the second half of 2023. These buildings will accommodate the offices which are currently in Shastri Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan and Nirman Bhawan. Vacating Shastri Bhawan is a priority as the new convention-cum-conference hall on the lines of Vigyan Bhawan will be built there. Going by the timeline, there is a probability that the entire Common Central Secretariat would be completed only in 2027, sources said, as the government will not demolish all the existing buildings in one go. According to the bid document, the CPWD will hand over the construction site to the contractor within 22 days of the issuance of letter to start work. “The contractor may have to execute the work in three shifts with large manpower of workers, supervisors and professional engineers. Also, adequate numbers of highly skilled artisans are required to work on teak wood doors, stone masonry, carving and furniture,” the document said. Responding to a question whether the CPWD has received a complaint alleging the bid parameters have been tweaked, a senior official said the complaint is “frivolous” and the conditions for bidding have been laid considering the project deadline. The buildings will have white and red stones for cladding, teak wood, carving work, jalis, white and green marble, lakha red and black granite for flooring. Since this is a mega project, the successful bidder in collaboration with CPWD will also have to arrange on-site skill training for at least 30% of unskilled workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cpwd-invites-bids-for-office-buildings-at-cost-of-over-rs-3k-cr/articleshow/82222584.cms||Dipak K Dash

This need will increase to 325MT in a few days and create a 'medical emergency' in view of the surging second Covid-19 wave, submitted the government, alleging discrimination by the Centre which had taken over the supply of oxygen from April 21. The submission followed a letter written by the Rajasthan High Court Bar Association seeking relief for state’s Covid hospitals struggling for oxygen. But the division bench, headed by Chief Justice Indrajit Mohanty, postponed the hearing on the PIL to April 28 as the Supreme Court has already taken suo motu cognisance of the matter. “The court said the petitioner could either join as a party to the petition in the apex court or wait for the SC decision, which we agreed,” said Giriraj Sharma, the general secretary of the bar association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centre-discriminating-in-supply-of-oxygen-state-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/82222556.cms||Joychen Joseph

The tickets for the Delhi-Dubai one-way flights for Saturday were between Rs 46,000 and Rs 1,08,000 against the usual Rs 8,000-10,000. Both UAE and Indian carriers fly between several cities here and four there — Dubai (the biggest international destination for Indians), Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah. “People eligible to go — with a RT-PCR test done from recognised labs within last 48 hours and a negative report — are booking flights to beat the deadline. The fear is that the 10-day ban on entry of travellers from India from April 25 to May 4 may be extended,” said an airline official. The Abu Dhabi-based Etihad has already said this period “may be extended”. Charter flights and private jets are allowed during this period. Charter firm JetSetGo chief executive and founder Kanika Tekriwal said, “There are over applications with the UAE authorities from various operators to bring people from India.” While hiring an Airbus A320/Boeing 737 type aircraft costs around Rs 40 lakh for a Delhi-UAE-Delhi trip, smaller business jets cost Rs 8-10 lakh less, said industry honchos. UAE nationals, diplomatic and official passport holders and those holding an official delegation letter are exempted from the restriction, subject to acceptance and quarantine conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rush-to-reach-uae-before-10-day-ban-fares-cross-rs-1l/articleshow/82222631.cms||Saurabh Sinha

A Haryana police spokesman said that a team of the Crime Investigation Agency acted on a tip-off and nabbed Shakeel, a resident of Shamli in Uttar Pradesh, with 23 packets containing 29.465 kg ganja patti from near a bus stop in Samalkha. During interrogation, Shakeel informed that he, along with an accomplice, brought the consignment from Andhra Pradesh in a canter. They planned to smuggle the drug in small quantities to evade the police. They parked the vehicle at Udyog Vihar in Gurgaon and unloaded four bags of the drug from the canter, of which three bags were taken by his associate while he kept one. He was nabbed by the police when he reached Samalkha. The police team also went to Udyog Vihar, Gurgaon and recovered the canter. They brought the vehicle, in which 296 kg ganja patti was found, back to Panipat. A case has been registered against him under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.

Many hospitals are not admitting new patients, who might need oxygen.Inlaks and Budhrani hospital in Koregaon Park has been trying to shift seven to 10 Covid patients from its intensive care unit (ICU) for the past few days. “More than the oxygen deficit, it is the massive strain on the staffers that has compelled us to shift some patients. But it has become increasingly difficult to secure ICU beds in other hospitals. Our two Oxygen storage tanks would sustain us for three days earlier. But in the current situation, the tanks need to be filled every day,” said the hospital’s chief intensivist, Vilas Gundecha.Sanjeevan Hospital needs 16,000 litre liquid medical oxygen every day. “But we are getting only 70% of our daily requirement,” said a doctor.Manjusha Kulkarni, secretary of the Association of Private Hospitals, Pune, told TOI, “Many hospitals are running short of oxygen. As a result, they are advising the patients to be shifted to other medical facilities where oxygen could be available. But even other hospital beds are full. This situation is distressing for all.” Pramod Kubade, secretary of the Pimpri Chinchwad Private Hospital Owners’ Association, said oxygen supply had not improved much and they were under tremendous pressure while admitting new patients and treating the admitted ones.Both the jumbo facilities in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad are running on barely enough supply of oxygen, said officials from the two facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/only-476-of-14k-beds-vacant-for-patients-needing-oxygen/articleshow/82221890.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The balance sheets of Heera Gold have shown that they manufactured gold jewellery and sold them. The sleuths also found evidence that they outsourced the work of making gold jewellery. “There was one to two per cent tax on gold jewellery production in the central excise regime and it was found that Heera Gold was evading the tax since 2016, which came up to Rs 16 crore. The total gold jewellery manufacturing would be around Rs 1,600 crore,” said a source in the department. The Supreme Court had granted Nowhera bail and allowed her to do business. She was accused of involvement in Rs 5,600 crore scandal. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had earlier filed a prosecution complaint against Nowhera and others in Ponzi scheme fraud case. The ED probe is based on several FIRs registered by Telangana and AP police. The ED had alleged that the accused collected deposits to the tune of Rs 5,600 crore from around 1.7 lakh investors across the country. Nowhera promised high rate of returns—3% per month (36% to 40% per year). It was alleged that the accused diverted the depositors’ money to personal accounts for wrongful gain and amassed huge movable and immovable assets. In 2019, ED attached Nowhera’s assets worth Rs 299 crore, Heera group of companies and others in the case in different states. The Supreme Court had earlier ordered officials to unseal the office of Heera Gold Exim Private Limited, which facilitated the company in running the business. Nowhera was released from a Mumbai jail on interim bail on January 22 after spending two-and-half years in judicial custody. As per the interim bail condition, she was to return the deposits of the complainants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pay-rs-16-crore-gst-for-jewellery-sale-of-rs-1-6k-cr-heera-gold-told/articleshow/82221893.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

District courts were also told to do the same. An order issued by the office of Delhi High Court Registrar General Manoj Jain said, “All the benches of this court shall continue to take up only extremely urgent matters filed in 2021, through video conferencing mode. All the courts of registrars and joint registrars (judicial) shall also continue to take up only urgent cases of their respective courts, through video conferencing mode.” The high court’s office order also said that all other pending routine or non-urgent matters listed between April 26 and May 15 shall stand adjourned en bloc to dates between July 9 and July 31. On April 18, the high court had said that from April 19, it will only take up “extremely urgent matters” filed this year.

---||Pune||Bedside monitoring eyed to control wastage of O2||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has planned a bedside monitoring system for preventing medical oxygen wastage amid Covid-19 second wave. The civic body aims to save around 2 tonnes of medical oxygen every day with the step. “The civic administration will assign the task of checking oxygen wastage due to human error to the nurses and ward working at civic hospitals. The staff will also create awareness on the issue among the admitted patients and their relatives,” said Kunal Khemnar, additional commissioner of PMC. Khemnar said PMC would focus on checking the ‘step up’ and ‘step down’ process of oxygen supply in civic hospitals (see box). Oxygen wastage came to fore during civic officials’ visit to jumbo units at CoEP and in Baner recently. “The patients, who were on oxygen and stable, were not using the facility properly. They were moving from one place to the other and performing their daily tasks on their own,” a senior PMC official said. Elaborating, he said such patients get oxygen from the cylinders through pipes. “A knob is given to control the supply. The users are supposed to switch off the knob when it is not in use. But many patients do not do it,” the official said, adding that while going to the washroom or having food, they remove the nasal cannula (face mask) attached with the supply system, but do not switch off the supply, leading to oxygen wastage. Another civic official said steps like placing information boards and posters on hospital premises would be taken for creating awareness among people. “If any patient forgets to follow the standard practice, s/he will be guided. A nurse or a ward boy will be asked to assist three to four patients in removing the oxygen masks and switching off the knobs,” the official said. PMC will do this monitoring for civil hospitals. The administration will also urge private hospitals to make sure that their staffers are also doing such monitoring.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bedside-monitoring-eyed-to-control-wastage-of-o2/articleshow/82221903.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice A Abhishek Reddy was hearing a public interest petition filed by Yarala Indrasena Reddy from Suryapet district, who questioned the wisdom behind the indiscriminate felling of the trees, which were more than 100 years old. When state’s special counsel A Sanjeev Kumar said the government would take up compensatory afforestation in the ratio of 1:2 trees, the bench said in that case there should have been more than 4,000 trees grown by now as part of this compensatory afforestation. “File an affidavit showing your effort along with photos,” the bench said and posted the case to July 23. Earlier, Lakshmi Narayan Alishetty, counsel for National Highways Authority of India, informed the bench that though this is a national highway, the work was entrusted to the state and the work is being executed by the state R&B department. Sanjeev Kumar told the bench that they are executing the project after obtaining permission from the forest department. Petitioner’s counsel V Venkata Mayur said that they have obtained information under the RTI and said that there are no permissions accorded for felling the trees by the forest department. Sanjeev, however, said the trees had already been felled and added that since the trees are huge, they could not be translocated. “But we agreed to the condition that we will take up compensatory afforestation in the ratio of 1:2 and we have already deposited the money with the forest department for raising the trees and to maintain them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-to-t-4000-trees-should-have-been-in-place-by-now/articleshow/82221898.cms||---
---||Delhi||Unions oppose move to put teachers on mortuary duty||New Delhi: Municipal teachers’ unions have denounced the deployment of teachers at Covid hospitals and mortuaries for monitoring of bodies. Unions say that the teachers have not been trained for this and it will put their lives at risk, citing multiple positive cases and deaths of teachers last week. Municipal Corporation Teachers’ Association (MCTA) has said in a statement that teachers have been asked by the district administration to perform night duties in mortuaries, which can adversely affect their health. MCTA demanded that such deployment be stopped. Vibha Singh, the vice president of Nagar Nigam Shikshak Sangh, said the teachers were not trained for this purpose. Officials, however, argued that the teachers will only be expected to coordinate between families of the deceased, workers in the hospital and hearse van drivers, along with answering phone calls related to management of bodies. Under an order issued by the North East district on Wednesday, some teachers were deployed at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital. “The teachers will, according to their shift, contact the nodal officer of GTB hospital and ensure the Covid guidelines are being followed by authorities in such cases. The teachers will remain in contact with Delhi Disaster Management Authority, North East authority,” the order stated. It adds that teachers will also have to ensure that all calls regarding hearse vans are disposed on time. Kuldeep Khatri, who heads Shikshak Nyay Manch Nagar Nigam, said that three municipal teachers had recently died due to Covid as no ICU beds were made available to them. “Hundreds of teachers have been made to work on airports, fine imposition duties, quarantine centres, vaccination centres, ration distribution and surveys of people with illness. But, all limits have been crossed this time by asking us to work in mortuaries,” he said.

---||Rajkot||Two Covid patients die due to O2 ‘short supply’||RAJKOT: The Covid hospitals in the city are constantly on the edge as demand for oxygen has been outstripping the supply. On Friday early morning, death of two Covid-19 patients in a private hospital sparked a major ruckus, with the relatives alleging that they died because of sudden short supply of oxygen, a charge that was denied by the doctors. The patients died in Kundan Hospital on Gayatrinagar Main Road. On Thursday night, the hospital authorities called the patients’ relatives and asked them to manage oxygen supply saying that they had stock that would last only till Friday morning. However, the patients, one who was on a ventilator and the other on BiPaP, succumbed around 5am. Unruly scenes broke out at the hospital, forcing the authorities to call up police. A PCR van of Bhaktinagar police station reached on the spot and immediately informed the police commissioner Manoj Agarwal about the shortage of oxygen in the hospital and that the patients may have to be shifted if the oxygen supply is not replenished soon. Agarwal said, “I got a call at 5am about the urgent need of oxygen in the hospital and informed the officer deputed at the oxygen filling station at Shapar to do the needful. If required, we will also provide a green corridor to vehicles transporting oxygen.” Dr. Manoj Sida, physician at the hospital said, “These two patients were critical and they did not die for the want of oxygen.” There are 30 patients under treatment in this hospital out whom about a dozen are on oxygen support.” When asked whether the hospital had asked the relatives to arrange for oxygen, Dr Sida said, “We had no option but to do so.”  Meanwhile, Rajkot collector Remya Mohan has ordered an inquiry into the deaths. “I have asked the prant officer to inquire about these deaths. Two government doctors - an associate professor of anaesthesia and one from medicine will provide technical help.” Rajkot needs 110MT oxygen daily The hospitals in Rajkot city require nearly 110 metric tonnes (MT) oxygen per day, but the supply for the last two days has been only 70-80 MT since. Collector Remya Mohan told reporters that the supply of 100MT per day will be restored. However, according to the medical fraternity, this supply will last only a week and the demand is expected to double considering the heavy load of patients. The district administration already asked the state government to provide more supply. Hospitals urge kin to shift patients Not wanting to take chances, private hospitals have started asking relatives of patients to shift them to civil hospitals or manage oxygen on their own. The district administration directed hospitals not to panic and call patients’ kin to shift them. Dr Praful Kamani, president of Rajkot Medical Association (RMA), said, “I had a talk with doctors who say that the hospitals are asking relatives of only those patient’s to manage oxygen who are able to arrange from a private trust or oxygen filling station. We are taking care of all the patients.” Exclusive O2 supply for home quarantined Rajkot district collector had designated Jaydeep Oxygen Agency in Shapar-Veraval near Rajkot to provide oxygen to patients in home isolation exclusively. The relatives of the patients may get oxygen from this agency. The relatives of the patients who were in home isolation were facing problems in getting oxygen because the agency was giving priority to hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/two-covid-patients-die-due-to-o2-short-supply/articleshow/82221023.cms||---

In yet another instance of cops’ humanitarian efforts to provide relief to the needy, an inspector didn’t waste time in officials travesties while providing an 82-year-old helpless Covid-19 patient in Rajkot reach the hospital on time. His timely action not caring about personal safety saved a precious life. According to police, Suresh Kotak, a resident of Bajarangwadi circle on Jamnagar road, who lived all alone was infected with Covid-19. On Thursday, his neighbours found that his condition was deteriorating and called the police control room seeking help. The police control room sent Inspector M A Koradiya of police headquarters to attend the call and help the elderly patient get necessary treatment. When Koradiya reached Kotak’s home, he found that the patient needed immediate hospitalization and so, dialled 108 emergency ambulance services, which, however, did not come. The cop didn’t waste time trying, or waiting. “Koradiya then called the police’s own ambulance to the spot and both he, and the ambulance driver donned PPE kits themselves before personally shifting the octogenarian from his bed to the ambulance and rushing him to Rajkot civil hospital. They got him admitted there for treatment,” police said. When Rajkot police chief Manoj Agrawal came to know about Koradiya’s humanitarian effort to save a senior person’s life, he personally congratulated and honoured Koradiya for his valour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/cop-dons-ppe-suit-to-help-82-yr-old-reach-covid-hospital/articleshow/82221056.cms||---

---||Pune||Grocers want police cooperation to cater to rising delivery orders||Pune: Grocery shop owners and retailers in the city claim that there has been a 20-25% increase in home delivery orders following restrictions imposed on operation timings but they have been facing problems while delivering in some areas even during the day, despite deliveries being allowed till 6pm. The grocers are now planning to approach the local police stations in their respective areas to hand over a list of kirana shops involved in home deliveries. This will prevent unnecessary action against shops and will not affect deliveries, a grocer said. All the shops selling grocery items have been told to keep their doors open till 11am while home deliveries are allowed till 6pm. A shopkeeper from Kasba Peth said many shops are not giving home deliveries after 11am, fearing police action. Our staff cannot go out for deliveries till 11am as they are managing the counters, the shopkeeper added. Sachin Nivangune, president of the Pune District Retailers Association said, “We have received feedback from various parts of the city that despite rise in home delivery orders, shopkeepers are facing hurdles in carrying them out. The shops will have to be opened for some time at least to get the orders packed but the shopkeepers are fearing police action. We are approaching the local police station to seek cooperation.” Nivangune said, “We will assure the police and civic administration that shops will not indulge in retail sale after 11am and only deliveries will take place. We have also told the retailers to take all necessary precautions while delivering the orders. We are suggesting that orders be delivered to the entry gates of societies.” There has been no shortage of any items so far, shopkeepers said. A retailer from Sinhagad Road said, despite curbs the crowd on the roads has not reduced. “The authorities should target those stepping out without reasons, instead of shopkeepers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/grocers-want-police-cooperation-to-cater-to-rising-delivery-orders/articleshow/82221914.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Kolkata||War of hashtags as parties call off rallies||Kolkata: The sharp spike in Covid-19 cases has prompted candidates to cancel their campaign rallies and street corner meetings and take the electoral fight to the virtual world, triggering a war of hashtags and handles. From posting short recorded speeches to reminding voters of the work done by them to their plans for the next five years if elected, the candidates are trying to connect with the voters on social media and convey their messages before they vote in the last two phases. On Thursday, the Election Commission of India banned all roadshows and vehicle rallies in the state due to the rising cases of Covid-19. The candidates can only hold meetings with not more than 500 people. “We are in the most crucial phase of elections for Kolkata and the adjoining areas. But the spike in Covid cases has forced us to change our strategy,” said Shreya Pande, daughter of Maniktala candidate Sadhan Pande of Trinamool Congress. “We are using Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to reach out to the voters and tell them about the work that my father has done for the constituency in the last 10 years,” said Shreya, who handles the social media. Sayoni Ghosh of Trinamool Congress, contesting from Asansol South, has been using all social media platforms since the beginning of her campaign. Many others have also switched to digital campaigning in the last one week. “Social media has emerged as an important platform to campaign due to the rise in Covid-19 cases. I have already stopped organising big rallies. Social media is helping me connect with my voters directly,” said Debasish Kumar, the Trinamool Congress’s candidate from Rashbehari Assembly constituency. Most of the politicians already have their own Twitter handles and Facebook pages. While some of them are not very active while others have an individual dedicated team to look after their social media profiles. Some candidates are banking on their leaders to connect with the voters. “I am using Facebook and Twitter to reach out to the voters with the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the state,” said Meena Devi Purohit, BJP’s candidate from Jorasanko. Social media has democratised campaigning, giving equal space to incumbents as well as challengers. Some candidates do not have enough funds to book big venues, hire vehicles and spend on refreshments of the party workers. “But on social media we do not face those hurdles. I can directly interact with my voters and convey my message. I do not need big fund for it,”said Santosh Pathak , the Sanjukta Morcha candidate from Chowringhee. The candidates and their social media teams are making hashtags of key words and using them in their Facebook and Twitter posts. “All posts that have the same hashtags will show up subsequently on the timeline of the person surfing social media. This leaves no space for other messages that are good for us,” said a member of the social media team of Rudranil Ghosh, BJP’s candidate from Bhwanipore assembly constituency. The shift to digital campaigning has brought some relief to citizens. “Sometimes the negativity was becoming too much and it was everywhere. With social media I have the option to go to the account of my favourite candidate and mute others,” said Akansha Beriwal, a young voter in Entally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/war-of-hashtags-as-parties-call-off-rallies/articleshow/82221908.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Pune||E-pass required to travel out of city limits returns||Pune: Passengers arriving at a railway station or airport in the state and wanting to travel to other locations in Maharashtra can do so by showing their tickets and boarding passes to the police at check posts. Travellers will also have to agree to a mandatory 14-day home quarantine, said state transport minister Anil Parab.The state government on Friday resumed issuing e-passes to those wishing to travel. Parab told TOI that, in case of inter-state travel, people must procure e-passes to prevent any hassles.“Inter-state travel by road has been closed down. Travel can be allowed only in case of a medical emergency, funerals, sickness in the family. A person, who has to go to another state from Maharashtra for an examination, for instance, can travel if he/she has procured an e-pass,” said Parab.Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta clarified that people, who were held up in other states and wanted to return, could do so by getting an e-pass. In all the above scenarios, a two-week-long period of home quarantine is mandatory, authorities said.The police have set up check posts at several places, including at toll plazas and at border areas of Pune district. “Checks have started in coordination with the local police. Those with an e-pass will not be stopped. However, we will be considerate to those rushing for a medical emergency as we understand that they might not have the time to procure an e-pass,” said Sanjay Jadhav, deputy commissioner of police, Highway Safety Patrol.The decision to issue e-passes for travel brought some relief to people but it also became a matter of confusion about whether people would be able to get an e-pass. “The restrictions were announced all of sudden and I am stuck at my in-laws’ place in Kolhapur. I need to return to Pune. The problem is that I don’t have a strong reason, as mentioned by the state government. I need to travel as I have a job in Pune and I might lose it if I don’t report by Monday. I have applied for the e-pass,” said Abhay Jagtap, who had gone to drop his mother-in-law on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/e-pass-required-to-travel-out-of-city-limits-returns/articleshow/82221907.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Goa||Rare fish netted in Zuari sparks interest||PANAJI: A colourful but rarely spotted fish, the scrawled filefish, netted by a Siridao fisherman off Cacra village has whetted the curiosity of fisheries scientists. They say it could have strayed into the Zuari bay from the sea or a reef. Traditional fisherman, Yogesh Santondekar blinked when he saw the fish, with its eye-catching coloration, in his nets. “It was the size of a small ruler - about 10-15 cms - and had teeth jutting out like that of a parrot,” he said While this specimen could be a juvenile, the common size of the fish is between 50-60cm. The biggest one on record was 110cm. Also known as broomtail filefish or scribbled leatherjacket, locally it is called Bannkocho or puffer fish. The shy fish belongs to the family, Monacanthidae, and is found in Indian Ocean and tropical ocean waters such as lagoons and other habitats. Traditional fishermen report rare sightings of it during fishing activity. “I remember seeing it only once during my youth while my father saw it a few times over decades,” Santondekar said. Santondekar, like other fishermen in the area, posts photographs and provides samples to scientists of rare or new fish records. “We have observed this fish at Grande Island. It can be a potential aquarium fish. Juveniles have yellowish brown and dark spots while in adults, blue lines and spots are more conspicuous. There are also scattered small black spots near the snout,” G B Sreekanth, fisheries scientist, Indian council of agricultural research, Old Goa, said. Scrawled filefish, which feeds on small shrimps, algae and other marine food, is known to change colours. “It appeared black in water but its colour changed after it died,” Santondekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rare-fish-netted-in-zuari-sparks-interest/articleshow/82223488.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Hyderabad||Welfare society delivers oxygen cylinders for free||HYDERABAD: At a time when many are struggling to get oxygen cylinders for their friends and family, suffering from Covid-19, the Salala Welfare Society has stepped in to provide these cylinders for free, to those undergoing treatment at home. The society, which has 40 oxygen cylinders, has been offering them to residents of Barkas, Chandrayangutta, Secunderabad, Toli Chowki, among other areas on a rotation basis. It is also providing them with pulse oximeters, nebulisers, mosquito fogging machines, ration kits, and even transportation services for those in need. “On an average, we have been receiving more than 200 phone calls every day for oxygen cylinders. Since many are unable to find a hospital bed, they are seeking our help to get oxygen cylinders to get their family members treated at home,” said Mabrook AlSaari, president of the society. He said that while they helped thousands of people during the first wave, this time they started offering their services from April 4. “Every day, we are helping 40 people with oxygen cylinders. Our team gets the oxygen cylinders filled and delivered to the needy,” he added. A private teacher by profession, AlSaari said that it costs about Rs 2,000 to get a jumbo cylinder filled and that the cost is borne by the society. “My father’s oxygen level dropped to less than 60 and we couldn’t get a hospital bed for him. That’s when we contacted the society for an oxygen cylinder. With their help, we are currently getting him treated at home,” said Abbu Wahlan. The condition of his father, Umar, (60), has marginally improved now. Apart from oxygen, members of Salala Welfare Society are also donating ration kits to those in need as many are struggling to survive without any income during the pandemic. On Thursday, they distributed 150 ration kits to people at Salala, Chandrayangutta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/welfare-society-delivers-oxygen-cylinders-for-free/articleshow/82222708.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Nagpur||‘Oxygen man’ exerts self so patients can breathe easy||Nagpur: Tarique Patel, a businessman dealing in industrial and clinical gases, nowadays spends most of the nights working at his plant in MIDC to ensure that no cylinder is left empty. The unprecedented demand for the gas due to exponential rise in Covid-19 patients has transformed him into the ‘Oxygen man’. TOI witnessed Patel’s hectic routine during a visit to the plant in the wee hours of Friday. With barely an hour left for daybreak, he hustles out of the plant after working around 20-22 hours to reach home at Raj Nagar. He is on Roza (fasting for Ramadan) and returns to the plant after having a meal and sleep not lasting more than a couple of hours. Patel’s plant, on which the district administration is heavily dependent for oxygen, supplies around 1,000 jumbo cylinders daily. Also, he caters to home isolation patients as he is the only one in the city “charging a nominal rate”. In operation without break of late, the plant has twice developed snag in the last 48 hours but Patel makes up for the loss by working round-the-clock. With Patel supervising the refilling along with his operators and technicians, there is an incessant sound of jumbo cylinders getting loaded in a carrier while the empty ones are being offloaded from another in long queues outside his plant. A philanthropic side of Patel is revealed while allowing a harried kin to refill a cylinder for a patient isolated at home. “Sir, please give me one cylinder. My father is unable to breathe. He will die for sure,” said a man from Jaripatka who showed up at 2.15am. At that time, Patel was supervising the refilling and loading of cylinders, and instructing hospital staffers to maintain a queue. He stopped and looked at the man for a moment before asking one of his technicians to spare a cylinder. “I could sense the desperation in his voice and eyes. He is in panic and so I decided to help him without thinking twice. By now, I have learnt to differentiate between a black marketeer and a genuine person in needy,” Patel told TOI. He introduced TOI to Satyanarayanji Verma who has 50 years of experience in handling oxygen compressors and re-filling machines. “We have a combination of 14 machines of air-separation unit, including a compressor which is manned by 23 employees,” said Verma. Verma said he has been trying to appeal to the government to allow health and insurance benefits to all those working at oxygen plants which a high risk job. The cylinders refilled at Patel’s plant, which was started by him around four years ago, are supplied to different parts of eastern Vidarbha, including Gondia’s government hospital. In city, re-filled cylinders are supplied to around 30-35 Covid hospitals. As Patel is busy coordinating with the hospital staffers clamouring for cylinders, he is approached by yet another person at 3am. “Four members of my sister’s family are Covid positive. My brother-in-law is a State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) personnel who took voluntary discharge from hospital to vacate bed for a needy woman. Now, he requires a oxygen cylinder to support breathing,” said Vaibhav Patil. Patel got down to checking the stock and refilling process, but not before sparing a cylinder for Patil who left at 3.30am with a sense of relief and gratitude.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/oxygen-man-exerts-self-so-patients-can-breathe-easy/articleshow/82221925.cms||Soumitra Bose

Police seized property worth Rs 30.5 lakh from the possession of the accused. Acting on specific information, the Special Operations Team (SOT) of LB Nagar raided flat number 105 of Venu Mansion Apartment near TV Tower of Saleem Nagar in Malakpet on Thursday night. Police arrested B Rajesh, 28, a businessman for organising cricket betting and seized Rs 10.16 lakh, five cell phones and 11 debit cards of various banks from his possession. Police also identified his four bank accounts containing Rs 19.89 lakh balance and initiated proceedings to freeze the transactions. A case was registered against the accused under Sections 3 and 4 of TS Gaming Act at Saroornagar police station. Rajesh, a native of Miryalaguda in Nalgonda district completed B.Tech in 2015 and worked for a construction company in Hyderabad while staying for rent at Venu Mansion Apartment. Rajesh, in order to afford a better lifestyle, ventured into cricket betting about three years ago, Rachakonda commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat said. Initially, Rajesh had started as a punter but later became a local bookie for the cricket betting racket organised in the name of ‘Ferrari Line’ through Telegram. “Once the interested people subscribe to the Telegram channel, the organisers send a link to subscribers whenever any cricket league starts. The organisers appoint people like Rajesh who have been punters for a significant amount of time as their local agents in cities,” the commissioner said. “Rajesh would contact people known to him and make them join the betting network. He would collect the money through online and cash mode, transfer the amount to the organisers and collect 10% commission,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-bust-cricket-betting-racket-items-worth-over-rs-30l-seized/articleshow/82221920.cms||---

The HC said that all Election Commission directions to enforce Covid protocols are to be considered as “mandatory command of this court” and no department of institution can “excuse itself from obeying” the EC directives in this regard. A division bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee will hear the matter again on April 26, the day the Phase-VI polls. The HC said it was confident that the EC “is steering its way forward in the proper direction” and the actions taken by the poll body indicated it would act decisively to implement Covid protocols. The HC also urged people to strictly follow and abide by the Covid guidelines. The HC reminded the EC that the Constitution gives it ample authority to deploy personnel to conduct polls. Neither the Centre, nor the state can “override the plenary power of the Election Commission of India to go ahead” and take steps that are necessary for the smooth conduct of the election. On Thursday, the HC had told the EC that its responsibility did not end with merely “issuing circulars” and “holding meetings”. It would step in and “act like T N Seshan”, the HC said, if the EC failed to enforce Covid safety protocols during electioneering in Bengal. “Issuing circulars and holding meetings by themselves do not discharge the onerous responsibility of the EC,” the HC said, adding that it was “unable to reconcile (with) the fact” that the EC was unable to give any “update on action... (and) enforcement” of its own circulars. On Friday, the EC submitted an affidavit informing that court that from 7pm on Thursday it had banned all road shows, padayatra and rallies with vehicles and put a cap of 500 people on all political meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-cov-orders-mandatory-command-of-this-court-hc/articleshow/82221921.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

With oxygen quota for the district being rationalised, the city may not be able to add beds at the existing pace and plans for addition of 250 beds at the GMERS Gotri Hospital have been put on hold. The hint regarding uncertainty over availability of additional oxygen was dropped on Friday when the plans for the temporary dome structure with 250 beds at the Gotri hospital were put on hold. It was said that a call regarding this would be taken after ensuring whether enough Oxygen would be available to support the newly created beds. But a clearer picture emerged in the evening after officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao, district collector Shalini Agarwal, Vadodara superintendent of police Sudhir kumar Desai and others held a meeting to take stock of the situation. After the meeting Rao said that Vadodara has more Covid hospitals, oxygen beds, ICUs and ventilators at present than all other cities of Gujarat. He added that the process of storage, distribution, refilling and bottling of oxygen in the district had been streamlined through various decisions. Rao added that the real challenge now is guaranteed and timely supply of oxygen for which the district was dependent entirely on the state government for sufficient allocation and timely transportation, as decided by the state control room.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-panics-over-availability-of-oxygen-supply/articleshow/82221092.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||City logs record 828 cases; no weekly lockdown: UT||Chandigarh: On a day the city reported its highest-ever Covid-19 cases of 828 since the pandemic broke out last year, the UT administration on Friday decided not to impose weekly lockdown or a lockdown for a longer period in the city. The decision was taken in a review meeting chaired by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore. Covid-19 claimed three lives in Chandigarh, taking the toll to 430. They were a 60-year-old man from Maloya having hypertension, a 45-year-old man from Sector 41 suffering from kidney injury and a 45-year-old woman from Sector 29. A total of 476 patients were discharged, taking the recovery count to 32,180. The confirmed cases are 37,232, including 4,622 active cases. As many as 3,923 cases were reported from April 18, while the tests were 16,048 during this period. A total of 2,700 has been the average daily testing since April 18. As the test positivity rate has been 23% and 21% within these six days, reduced testing will not help, said public health experts. On Friday, out of every five tests, one was found to be positive. Earlier, one out of every 10 was testing positive. “If this is the case, testing cannot slip down and again be ramped out. It has to be consistent,” said a public health expert. PGI director Dr Jagat Ram said, “One must avoid unnecessary going out to crowded places. People should try and stay indoors if possible as this wave is rampant. However, 90% cases are mild to moderate and those patients must stay at home and not burden hospitals.” On Friday, the city received one lakh doses of vaccines. In the review meeting, the administration decided to change the night curfew timings from 10pm to 5am to 9pm to 5am. Badnore reviewed the overall situation and expressed serious concern over the increasing number of cases. He directed municipal corporation commissioner K K Yadav and deputy commissioner Mandip Brar to intensify testing and contact tracing. He also reviewed the status of availability of oxygen in all medical institutions. He expressed satisfaction that due to the commissioning of an oxygen plant, there is no shortage in the city. He directed the health department to monitor the availability of life-saving drugs and ensure that there is no black-marketing. Inspector general of prisons was directed to organise a special camp for testing and vaccination of all eligible inmates in Burail jail. No lockdown for longer period No gathering or non-essential travel will be allowed from 9pm to 5am Sukhna Lake will remain closed on weekend (Saturday and Sunday) Estate, sub-registrar and RLA offices, where several Covid cases have been detected, will remain closed till April 30 Museums, libraries and spas will continue to remain closed Educational institutions told to ensure only those students be allowed to stay where the need is essential and unavoidable Industries will be allowed to operate night shift provided Covid protocol is followed Police told to increase patrolling and challan defaulters The cases might rise for another two or three weeks and then the curve might flatten.

Speaking to reporters in Nallur village in Thiruparankundram panchayat, the collector said that the state government authorities were reviewing the second wave effects of Covid in the district on a daily basis. Oxygen availability and vaccination progress was also reviewed during these meetings. The situation was showing a steady rise in infections in the district with daily infections gradually rising to 275, 325, 475, 495 in the last four days and touched 525 on Friday, he said. It was very important that the methods of prevention, including wearing of masks, frequent hand washing and keeping a safe distance from others are followed during this second wave. Fever camps which were earlier conducted only to detect cases were now also being used to ramp up the vaccinations. The aim of imposing fines was not to enhance the collection, but to ensure that all people wore masks in public, he said. The condition of the patients being affected in this second wave were categorised into three - people with breathlessness who are admitted to the Government Rajaji Hospital in the Covid ward which had a total bed strength of 1,500 of which 50% of these beds have been filled as on date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/no-oxygen-shortage-in-madurai-says-district-collector/articleshow/82222715.cms||---
---||India||MHA coordinating lifting of high-capacity oxygen tankers from Singapore, UAE by IAF transport aircraft||NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Friday said it was coordinating lifting of high-capacity oxygen tankers from countries like Singapore and UAE by Indian Air Force (IAF) transport planes, in order to augment availability of tankers for the movement of oxygen. It has also asked all the states and Union Territories to ensure adequate security of lorries transporting medical oxygen and make provisions for exclusive corridors for such transportation, treating the lorries on par with ambulances. The steps were in line with decisions taken at a meeting chaired by home minister Amit Shah on Friday to review the Covid situation in the country with particular focus on ensuring uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen in the affected states/UTs. As part of measures outlined by Shah, the home ministry on Friday wrote to all the states/UTs to direct district collectors/deputy commissioners to list all the plants situated in their district, in which different types of oxygen is generated, along with their installed capacity. They were also asked to take action to revive those plants which are lying closed. “These efforts will ensure ready availability of oxygen at the district level, besides supply of medical oxygen from usual channels,” the home ministry said in a press release.

In this guide, we strive to give you the required information so that you can makeAs per MHA, an expert group is optimising and rationalising the allocation of oxygen to various states/UTs keeping in view the active cases and to reduce time for movement of medical oxygen. While the supply of oxygen for industrial purposes was prohibited on April 18, barring for a few essential sectors, the ministry on Friday said steps were now being taken to further reduce consumption of industrial oxygen by industries. In its communication to all the state chief secretaries and UT administrators on Friday on security for oxygen-transporting vehicles the MHA cited Thursday’s directions by Delhi High Court order in this regard. It said instances had been reported in some districts of different states/UTs wherein oxygen carrying vehicles were stopped. “Such instances…inhibit the timely supply of medical oxygen to the allocated state/UT and in turn affect treatment of Covid-19 patients,” said the ministry.It particularly drew the states’ attention to the HC direction that non-compliance of MHA order dated April 21 on uninterrupted inter-state and intra-state movement of oxygen, shall invite criminal action under the Disaster Management Act and IPC. Read Also‘No shortage of oxygen at Mohali hospitals’There is no shortage of oxygen in government as well as private hospitals of Mohali. This was stated by deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan. He advised that oxygen must be used after the same is prescribed by a medical practitioner.The home ministry said it is also facilitating movement of medical oxygen across the country as per the approved allocation plan. IAF has started transporting empty tankers after delivery of oxygen to destination state/UT to oxygen-producing locations to reduce movement time. With a view to make available additional tankers for movement of oxygen, MHA is coordinating lifting of high-capacity tankers from countries like Singapore and UAE by IAF transport planes. Further, the railway ministry is running special trains carrying oxygen tankers across the country for faster movement. Ministries of home and health and family welfare are in regular touch with the states and UTs for promoting optimal use of medical oxygen and undertaking periodic audits to rule out wastage of oxygen and essential medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mha-coordinating-lifting-of-high-capacity-oxygen-tankers-from-singapore-uae-by-iaf-transport-aircraft/articleshow/82225036.cms||Bharti Jain
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Sprinklers could have saved lives at 90-bed Virar facility||MUMBAI: Fifteen Covid-19 patients, including six women, were charred to death after a fire broke out in the secondfloor intensive care unit (ICU) of the 90-bed Vijay Vallabh hospital in Virar early on Friday.  Two other ICU patients who were rescued are serious, doctor said. The tragedy came just two days after 22 Covid patients died in a Nashik hospital after an oxygen tank leak. The management of the Virar hospital, doctors and staff were booked by the Arnala coastal police on Friday evening for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under the non-bailable Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code. Other IPC sections applied are 337, 338 (causing hurt by act so rash or negligent as to endanger life) and 34 (common intention), DCP of Mira-Bhayander Vasai -Virar zone 2 Sanjay Patil said. No arrests had been made till the time of going to press. Seventy other Covid patients on the hospital’s first, third and fourth floors rushed out of the building, some helped by the hospital staff. The patients alleged there were only two nurses, two ward boys and one doctor on the night shift. None of them sustained any injuries. The ICU was charred beyond recognition. A blast in the air-conditioner unit of the ICU of the four -storey hospital in Bolinj, Virar (West), is believed to have caused the fire. Sparks fell on the patients’ beds and set these ablaze, fire officials said. The ICU did not have the mandatory sprinkler systems, the officials said. The 90-bed Vijay Vallabh hospital in Virar, that came up six years ago, had renewed its fire licence last month but didn’t have the mandatory sprinklers. Among the dead were a Vasai resident Kumar Doshi (45), whose wife Chandani (42), admitted to a Vasai hospital for Covid, died of cardiac arrest on hearing of her husband’s death. The couple has a 14-year-old daughter. The ICU was operating at full capacity with 17 patients. When firemen reached the ICU at 3.13 am, 13 bodies were already charred. Four patients were rescued, but two of them succumbed to their burns later. While most of the patients in the ICU were critical and died of suffocation and burns, a few who could have escaped were caught in the fire. A fire officer said preliminary investigations suggest that sparks hit the beds and equipment, resulting in the blaze flaring up. The hospital’s fire audit had been carried out last month, and its fire licence was renewed on March 14. Sprinklers which are mandatory, however, were missing at the hospital building. Sources said casualties would have been fewer if the hospital had had sprinklers. Ten fire engines were put into service and the fire was brought under control at around 3.45am. Those charred to death were identified as Uma Kangutkar (63), Nilesh Bhoir (35), Pukraj Vaishnav (68), Rajni Kadu (60), Narendra Shinde (58), Kumar Doshi (45), Janardhan Mhatre (63), Ramesh Upayan (55), Praveen Gowda (65), Shama Mhatre (48), Suvarna Pitale (64), Supriya Deshmukh (43) and Amey Raut (23). Two patients, Shivaji Villar (56) and Nirav Sampat (31), succumbed later. The atmosphere outside the hospital was tense as relatives vented their anger and demanded action against the hospital authorities. All Covid norms were violated as families went around looking for their kin. Many family members were forced to be in close proximity with Covid patients even though the relatives were prevented from entering the building. All 70 patients from the other floors were shifted to various hospitals, including the Dahisar jumbo centre. The Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation announced an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh each to the kin of the victims. The state government announced compensation of Rs 5 lakh each for victims’ kin and Rs 1 lakh each for the injured. PM Narendra Modi announced Rs 2 lakh each for kin of victims and Rs 50,000 each for the injured. To prevent such incidents, state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Friday asked all district administrations to conduct a fire and oxygen audit of all the hospitals across the state, including private hospitals. He also said that tankers carrying oxygen meant for medical use have been given the status of an ‘ambulance’ for uninterrupted transportation and should be given police protection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-sprinklers-absent-could-have-saved-lives/articleshow/82222743.cms||Sandhya Nair

The 57-year-old farmer of Vagaikulam near Nanguneri in Tirunelveli district has demanded that cases be filed against the prison officials as they were equally responsible for the murder. According to Papanasam, it was when news flashed on TV around 4.30 pm that he came to know that Mano was brutally attacked and admitted to Tirunelveli medical college hospital in a critical condition. “By the time I reached there around 6.30 pm, I could see only his lifeless body,” he said. He saw a deep injury on the left side of Mano’s nose and multiple injuries on his face and head. “Blood was all over his head and was covered with binding material. The prison officials are equally responsible for the murder and should also be booked under section 176(1)(A) of the Code of Criminal Procedures and SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act and punished along with the inmates who murdered my son,” he said. The eldest of two sons of Papanasam and Rukmani, 50, Muthu Mano had at least five cases pending before the court including murder, attempt to murder, possession of explosive substances and rioting. He was the youth wing president of Devendra Kula Vellalar Kootamaippu and an ardent supporter of late dalit leader Pasupathipandian. He was arrested and lodged in the Srivaikuntam sub jail in Tuticorin district on April 8 and shifted to the Palayamkottai central prison only on Thursday afternoon. Shortly after he reached the prison he was brutally attacked on his face and head with stones and deadly weapons by some inmates, allegedly of other castes due to previous rivalry. Meanwhile, K R Raja, a prison reforms activist and counsel assisting the family, said the murder took place in the ‘A Block’ of the prison which is an isolation block meant for inmates who are trouble-makers. “They should have been persons who created trouble to other inmates or violated the prison norms,” he said. He wondered how Mano was directly taken to that block. A former psychiatric counsellor of the prison, he said it is impossible for those who murdered Mano to know about his arrival without the connivance of prison staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/book-jail-officials-father-of-murdered-inmate/articleshow/82222722.cms||M K Ananth

The 28th ward in Jalpally civic body has gone in favour of AIMIM, 5th ward in Alampur municipality in favour of ruling TRS, 8th ward in Metpally municipality in favour of an Independent candidate and 30th ward in Bellampally in favour of TRS. On the request of the family members of the sitting ward members whose death necessitated the by-poll, candidates from other parties withdrew their nomination, facilitating unanimous election in four of nine wards. Telangana Congress election committee convenor G Niranjan told TOI that though Congress candidates filed nominations, they withdrew it on humanitarian grounds in the three wards. “We are contesting in the remaining six wards,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/elections-to-four-wards-to-be-unanimous/articleshow/82222745.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Hospitals hunt for ventilators, O2 tanks||AHMEDABAD: Across Ahmedabad, 404 ventilator beds were earmarked for Covid-19 patients in private hospitals and 470-odd in government-run hospitals as of Friday evening. The beds for critically ill patients are getting full as soon as new beds are added due to heavy rush felt by almost all the facilities, making it difficult for the relatives to secure even one. In such a scenario, several private hospitals are attempting to increase their ventilatory capacity to address the tsunami of Covid cases in the past fortnight. But several of these hospitals face the roadblock in purchase or procurement of machines. While some hospitals were rewarded by their long-time connections with vendors who could provide them the life-saving machines in a day or two, for several hospitals placing bulk orders, the time was said to be two weeks or more. “We are getting seven more ventilators for Covid-19 patients. We have been assured delivery by May 10 by the supplier. Several other city-based hospitals have also reported 15- to 20-day window for procurement,” said Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA). “Turnaround time for the ventilator beds is much higher compared to oxygen beds due to severity of Covid infection. Thus, with rise in critical patients, the demand has also increased.” Director of a city-based hospital said that primary reason for the delay is condition in other states. “Apart from the obvious jump in the demand across India, one must also take into consideration the fact that the major suppliers are based in cities like Delhi, Mumbai and to some extent Chennai. All these cities have curbs or lockdowns. The suppliers however are doing their best to adhere to the delivery timeline,” said the doctor. Namisha Gandhi, vice president of Sterling Hospitals, said that the hospital is acquiring over 20 ventilators. “We expect the delivery and installation by May 15. The number of patients requiring ventilatory care has increased – which prompted us to expand our inventory. Likewise, we are also expanding our oxygen capacity by installation of another tank. It might also take 15 to 20 days,” she said. State health department officials said that the central procurement of ventilators for various government hospitals is going on and the state might get 100-odd ventilators by end of next month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hospitals-hunt-for-ventilators-o2-tanks/articleshow/82221961.cms||Parth Shastri

While a triangular contest is on the cards between TRS, Congress and BJP in a majority of the wards in GWMC, candidates from Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena (JSP), M Kodandaram’s Telangana Jana Samithi (TJSP), All India Forward Bloc (AIFB), MCPI (U), Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and independents have entered the electoral fray from many wards. Though it is generally expected that the anti-TRS vote bank would be divided among these smaller parties, political analysts did not rule out the possibility of these candidates eating into the vote bank of even the Congress and BJP. Interestingly, BJP and Jana Sena which formed an alliance in Khammam municipal corporation, are contesting on their own in Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation. AIMIM and YSR Congress party (YSRCP) are not contesting in GWMC. Nearly 500 candidates from various political parties and independents are in fray from 66 wards in GWMC. Warangal district Congress committee president N Rajender Reddy alleged that the ruling TRS was misusing the police and exerting pressure on the Congress candidates not to campaign and remain silent. As a result of which, the Congress has ended up contesting in only 64 of the total 66 wards although party candidates had filed nominations from all the 66 wards, he said. However, panchayat raj minister Errabelli Dayakar appealed to the people not to believe in the propaganda of the opposition. He said the voters should realise Centre’s discrimination against Telangana in supply of oxygen, Remdesivir and vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/greater-warangal-may-witness-a-multi-cornered-contests/articleshow/82222727.cms||Roushan Ali

Confirming the news, Vivek Pandey, spokesperson, ITBP, said, “Although the exact details will come by Saturday morning, we can confirm that no damage was done to the ITBP post and the men posted there. The whole region has been witnessing heavy snowfall since (Friday) morning. The area is covered in almost four-to-five feet snow cover.” Meanwhile, there were unconfirmed reports that water in the Rishiganga river in Chamoli rose by a couple of feet following the incident. Jagdish Singh from the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) control room at Tapovan told TOI, “The water level in the Rishiganga river started increasing in the afternoon due to incessant rainfall in the upstream areas of Chamoli district. The rise in the water level is not an outcome of the glacier burst incident.” To recall, on February 7 this year, flash floods in the Rishiganga and Alaknanda rivershad lead to massive loss of life and property. Almost 80 people had died and 124 others are still missing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/glacier-breaks-in-sumna-in-chamoli-initial-reports-suggest-no-loss-of-life/articleshow/82221087.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Ahmedabad||Shortage of O2 mask kits, flow meters hits Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Adding to the woes of oxygen-dependent Covid patients, the state is now staring at a shortage of oxygen mask kits and oxygen flow meters. Oxygen mask kits are disposable pipes and masks that are attached to the oxygen cylinder and enable oxygen supply to a patient. According to stockists of surgical equipment, the shortage is seen widely in Tier II and Tier III cities and it is impacting patients dependent on oxygen, especially those under home quarantine. “Disposable oxygen masks have been in serious short supply for the past four days. We are not receiving stocks from the wholesaler,” said Jayshil Patel, an Ahmedabad-based surgical equipment retailer. “The demand has gone up multi-fold not just from hospitals and small nursing homes but also from patients who are getting treated under home quarantine. However, we are not getting adequate supply to be able to meet the demands.” Retailers and suppliers of peripheral equipment for oxygen supply are also struggling to meet the growing demand. “For the past 10 days, there has been an acute shortage of all peripheral equipment for the supply of oxygen, right from oxygen flow meters,” said Dhiraj Thakker, the proprietor of an Ahmedabad-based surgical equipment dealership. Thakker added: “Even oxygen concentrator machines are in short supply. We sold about 60 machines in April alone whereas we procured 40 more and gave them on rent to patients.” Thakker went on to say: “Each day, we get about 500 requests for oxygen machines against which we are able to give two or three, which are returned to us after use. It is disheartening to deny patients, most of whom are in dire need.” Industry sources said that increased panic buying coupled with a surge in demand have adversely affected the supply chain. If stocks are replenished by next week and there is sustained supply, a comfortable position may be secured after 2-3 weeks, said another surgical equipment supplier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/shortage-of-o2-mask-kits-flow-meters-hits-abad/articleshow/82221968.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal shares ‘live telecast’ of meeting with PM Narendra Modi, triggers row||NEW DELHI: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s sharing of a “live telecast” of the video conference between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief ministers of high burden states kicked up a controversy on Friday with the Centre accusing Kejriwal of turning serious deliberations into a publicity stunt and the AAP leader’s office later expressing regret. The live sharing, even as the meeting was on, was seen as a breach of norms with government sources pointing out that a similar act by a Trinamool Congress leader during the PM’s interactions with political parties last year had drawn strong condemnation and that participants were well aware that an ongoing meeting was not to be leaked. Kejriwal's office later clarified that the CM’s address was shared live because there was never any instruction, written or verbal, from the Centre that such an interaction could not be shared live. It was claimed that there were multiple occasions of similar interactions where matters of public importance having no confidential information were shared live. However, if any inconvenience was caused, Delhi government highly regretted the matter, the CM’s office said. Central government sources said the live comments took the agency that aired them by surprise as it became evident that the PM was still speaking at the interaction. BJP handles like its IT cell chief Amit Malviya's attacked the AAP leader for hitting a new low while others said Kejriwal had come prepared to play to the gallery rather than address a serious situation. During the meeting, Modi objected to the "leak" and said, "What is happening... this is strictly against tradition, our protocol... that a chief minister is showing a live telecast of an in-house meeting.” When Modi said, “This is not appropriate, we should always exercise restraint”, Kejriwal responded, “Ok sir, we will be careful in future.” Government sources contested points made by Kejriwal saying he spoke of airlifting oxygen, but the decision was already taken. “He spoke about oxygen express but railways says he has not communicated anything about this,” a source said. “All CMs spoke about what they are doing to improve the situation. However, Kejriwal had nothing to speak on what he is doing,” the official said. In his remarks, Kejriwal appealed for Modi’s personal intervention and flagged the worsening oxygen crisis, warning that a “big tragedy” may take place in Delhi if “quick” steps were not taken. Delhi BJP slammed Kejriwal over the development. Leader of opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the CM was doing politics even though Delhi has slipped into a massive crisis. Bidhuri blamed the Delhi government for the oxygen crisis and said when UP, Maharashtra and other states could announce setting up of facilities to produce oxygen, why was the Delhi government watching silently. “The government did not review the availability and storage of oxygen in the last few months,” he added. Government sources said Kejriwal was found yawning and laughing during previous meetings. They said C-17 and IL-76 aircraft of the IAF had started airlifting big oxygen tankers from their place of use to filling stations to speed up distribution of much needed oxygen but the CM seemed unaware of the development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejriwal-shares-live-telecast-of-meeting-with-pm-triggers-row/articleshow/82222761.cms||---

Presently, most of the nurses, technicians and resident doctors are engaged in the emergency and in admitted patient care. At any given time, not more than 300 resident doctors can be spared from the non-Covid-19 areas, while the nurses and technicians are also deputed in the non-Covid-19 areas. The PGI is serving 283 Covid-19 patients in its 300-bedded Nehru Extension Hospital. However, recently, UT advisor to the administrator Manoj Parida had written a letter to the secretary health, Union ministry of health and family welfare, asking for expansion of services at the PGI for 500 Covid-19 patients. “Beds and space is not a problem at the 2,000-bedded hospital. However, we can’t run this extra bedded-Covid-19 hospital without recruiting more manpower,” said a faculty at the PGI. According to the estimates, 500 beds shall need 500 OT technicians, 800 nursing staff and 200 doctors, besides hospital and sanitation attendants. “The Covid-19 staff has to work on a rotational basis. Initially, we were given a week off after the Covid-19 duty, but now we have to join within a day or two due to staff crunch,” said a nursing officer at the PGI. Not only are the nursing and paramedical staff working beyond their duty hours, most of the junior and senior doctors have not taken break. There are 1,300 resident doctors, who are posted at the emergency and trauma care. “For beds with ventilators and oxygen, we need trained staff for each bed so that there is round the clock supervision. At times, the sanitation and hospital attendants refuse to clean patients’ and we have to do that besides bedside care. This is adding extra stress,” said a senior nursing staff. The PGI has total 1,300 resident doctors, 2,400 nursing staff and 1,500 OT technicians. This manpower is engaged in wards, emergency area, dialysis unit, gynecology ward and chemotherapy centre. PGI needs more manpower for Covid-19 care i.e. 200 doctors, 800 nursing staff and 500 OT technicians||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-might-need-1-5k-more-staffers/articleshow/82222750.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Konthagai is thought to be the burial site of the Keeladi civilization. Co-director of the Keeladi excavation, P Baskar said that they had unearthed eight urns in the second phase at Konthagai. Since they had tied up with MKU for the DNA testing of the samples, one of the urns measuring 100cm in height and with a circumference of about 80cm, was opened in the presence of experts. The urn contained a small sword, vessels and terracotta rings. Baskar said that the presence of the sword was indicative that the skeleton may have belonged to a male who would have been a warrior or soldier. Another urn would be opened on Saturday and after conducting CT scans on both the remains, the samples would be sent to the MKU, he said. Head of the department of genetics and chairman of the School of Biological Sciences, MKU, G Kumaresan said that they were in the process of completing the establishment of the ancient DNA testing laboratory. Once completed it would be a nodal centre for archaeological findings and the samples collected would be examined after the completion of the laboratory. The results of the DNA testing which could throw light on the evolutionary pattern of the people of this region could be expected in another six months, if all goes as per plan. Last year, the Tamil Nadu state archaeology department signed up with Harvard University and Madurai Kamaraj University, for extensive research of the ancient artefacts unearthed in the Keeladi cluster. While the Keeladi excavation inaugurated by chief mMinister Edappadi K Palaniswami is in its seventh phase, Konthagai is in its second phase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/remains-of-ancient-warrior-unearthed-at-konthagai/articleshow/82222753.cms||---

The matter came to the fore on Saturday. Sale of liquor has been banned due to Covid-19 restrictions. While officer of Wani police station Vaibhav Jadhav said postmortem of three deceased was conducted, relatives of the remaining four performed the last rites without informing the authorities. The deceased are Ganesh Uttam Shelar (43), a resident of Jaitai Nagar, Sunil Mahadev Dhengale (36), a resident of Deshmukh Wadi, Datta Kavadu Lanjewar (47), a resident of Teli File, Nutan Devrao Patenkar (35), a resident near Rural Hospital, Santosh Mehar (35), a resident of Ekta Nagar, Vijay Bawane (35) and one Balu, both residents of Wani city. “We have so far registered three deaths and the details of the remaining are being collected,” said PI Jadhav. Foreign liquor and country liquor is being sold at Rs.500 and Rs.250 per 250ml respectively, alleged lawyer Dilip Parchake of Wani. According to Parchake, someone told the victims that 30ml of sanitizer can give the effect of 250ml of liquor. Taking the misinformation factually, the youths purchased 5 litres of sanitizer and had a party on Friday night. Later, they started vomiting and even complained of uneasiness after which they were admitted to the Government Rural Hospital in Wani where they succumbed one after another.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/seven-die-after-consuming-sanitizer/articleshow/82230452.cms||---

The Union ministry of social justice and empowerment has tied up with Gokhale Road Bandhan to set up a safe home for abandoned transgender people. A grant of Rs 36.4 lakh has been allotted for 25 homeless people of this community. But the purpose of the project seemed defeated when the members of the NGO went hunting for a place. They ran into transphobic house owners who weren’t ready to let out their property to “different” people. During the lockdown last year, many transgender people fell victims to transphobia. Gokhale Road Bandhan had rented a flat opposite South City Mall for around 10 homeless transgender men and women. On March 12, the National Institute of Social Defence wrote that they have included their “safe home project” under its “Garima Greh or Shelter Home for Transgender Persons” scheme. “When we got the letter, we were overwhelmed. From the very next day, we started looking for a property where 25 transgender people could be accommodated. But over the last one month, setting up a home for the homeless seemed like an impossible mission,” said Ranjita Sinha, secretary of both Gokhale Road Bandhan and Association of Transgender/Hijra in Bengal (ATHB). “After meeting 20-odd house owners, we came across on Thursday one person who has no bias whatsoever,” Sinha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/many-refusals-later-finally-a-safe-home-for-trans-people/articleshow/82221970.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The DG also directed the Intelligence Bureau to keep an eye on oxygen supply and black marketing. The DG stated that 100% of oxygen was meant for medical supply, barring a certain amount needed for essential industries. The order stated that the superintendent of police must ensure adequate protection at the factory, distribution centre, and even storage in their respective areas. He said that where ever required, police protection should be given to ensure that no black marketing is reported. He also stated that, if required, adequate police protection will be given to the vehicles carrying oxygen till the time it reaches its destination. A senior police officer said that the increase in demand could lead to major black-marketing and there could incidents where the vehicles are intercepted on its way and diverted to other hospitals. However, no such incident has been reported so far but the directive to give protection for transportation was in anticipation of some untoward incident. Roping in the IB is an indication of the possibility of such incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dgp-directs-cops-to-ensure-continuous-supply-of-oxygen/articleshow/82221973.cms||---

Shaji, who maintained that the seized cash was part of the election funds collected by the 154 booth committees of IUML in Azhikode constituency, submitted the counterfoil of the receipts used for fund collection to VACB. The interrogation, which began at 10am at the vigilance special cell office at Thondayad, continued for three hours, till 1pm. Shaji had sought a week’s time to submit the documents to prove source of the seized money when he was questioned by VACB on April 16. Apart from counterfoils of fund collection, Shaji also provided documents of land purchases made in Kozhikode, Kannur and Wayanad, other documents about his shareholding in businesses and bank documents. It is learnt that VACB made a video recording of the interrogation proceedings. Shaji, who had contested from Azhikode as IUML candidate, had earlier submitted minutes of the party meeting which had authorized him to collect funds to meet election expenditure in Azhikode. Officials said that they will proceed further in the case, including questioning him again, after verifying the submitted documents. VACB is learnt to have already taken statements from IUML local leaders in Azhikode regarding the collection of election funds. VACB will also seek the help of registration department to ascertain the veracity of the land documents and also record statements of the persons who have said to have made substantial donations to the election fund. VACB is likely to interrogate Shaji’s wife as the house in Kozhikode is in her name. VACB also asked PWD department to measure the area of his houses at Kozhikode and Kannur as part of the exercise to conduct valuation of the houses. VACB had registered a case against the MLA after preliminary inquiry found that Shaji had amassed wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income from 2011 to 2020 by a margin of 166%. The inquiry was made on the basis of a petition filed by advocate MR Harish before the court of enquiry commissioner and special judge, Kozhikode. Meanwhile, Kozhikode vigilance court, on Friday, postponed the hearing of the disproportionate assets case to May 20 to enable VACB to submit its report in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/vacb-questions-mla-shaji-again/articleshow/82221165.cms||---

---||Madurai||Tuticorin: Sterlite offer to produce O2 slammed at public hearing||TUTICORIN: Tense moments prevailed outside the Tuticorin district collectorate on Friday morning following a skirmish between people for and against reopening of the sealed Sterlite copper smelter plant to produce oxygen, ahead of a public hearing organised on the matter. Those opposing Sterlite’s proposal to reopen to produce 1,050 metric tonnes of oxygen every day outnumbered those in favour. The public hearing was organised on the direction of the state government to seek the opinions of a cross-section of the society comprising anti-Sterlite protesters, stakeholders of Sterlite, neutral people and officials.  The meeting chaired by district collector K Senthil Raj started around 8.30 am and saw anti-Sterlite protesters vehemently opposing Vedanta’s proposal. However, those in favour of reopening it considering the oxygen crisis preferred to remain silent. A woman who tried to voice her views in support of oxygen production at Sterlite was physically and verbally abused till she left the collectorate on her two-wheeler after the meeting. Neutral people and representatives of bodies like Indian Medical Association, Rotary and Lions Clubs too remained calm. “We did not want our views to trigger a quarrel,” said one of them. “Towards the end of the meeting, district collector K Senthil Raj agreed to record that the people of Tuticorin do not want Sterlite to reopen. He asked them if they are agreeable to the government operating the oxygen production plant of Sterlite. But the protesters were not ready for that as well,” said an official who was present at the closed door meeting. The clash between the protesters and supporters of Sterlite happened at the entrance of the collectorate. The supporters, who were lesser in number, fled after they were pelted with stones by the opposing members. While only a select group was invited for the hearing to ensure that social distance is maintained at the meeting hall, many opposing Sterlite picked a quarrel with the police asking them to be allowed in to voice their views.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sterlite-offer-to-produce-o2-slammed-at-public-hearing/articleshow/82222763.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Stop civic polls, Uttam urges governor||HYDERABAD: Stating that the municipal elections could become a superspreader, Telangana Congress president and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy on Friday urged governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to immediately stop the election process to the seven urban local bodies going to polls on April 30. In a letter to the governor, he said the election process could be continued after Covid-19 subsides. The health minister and health director have termed the situation as “severe” in Telangana and the Supreme Court has likened the Covid-19 situation, shortage of oxygen and vaccines to a “national emergency,” he said. “Your intervention is sought as the SEC has refused to stop the election process despite senior political leaders urging it to do so. The SEC has discontinued the practice of holding all-party meetings before the local body elections. The SEC also does not meet delegations of opposition parties which want to give representations on election-related issues,” he said in the letter. Uttam later told reporters that the governor had spoken to him over phone and assured him that she would speak to the state election commissioner on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stop-civic-polls-uttam-urges-guv/articleshow/82222757.cms||---

This is the first case registered under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC following the directive issued by DGP Ashish Bhatia to keep an eye on people gathering for marriages. A complaint has been registered at Airport police station by ASI Suresh Laxmanbhai. In his complaint, he stated that he was on patrol near Ambawadi Circle when he saw a marriage procession. He realised there were more than 50 people present there. The complainant stated that, as per government orders, there cannot be more than 50 people in a marriage. Also, permission was needed to take out a marriage procession. Since there no permission had been sought, the guideline issued by the state government had been clearly violated. The police have registered a case against the father of the groom Kishan Solanki (51 years) Jugal Solanki (24), Savji Solanki (53) and Dilip Vaghela (25). The police also took in possession the vehicles, speakers and other equipment used by the disk jockey leading the marriage procession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-booked-for-60-wedding-guests/articleshow/82221976.cms||---
---||Madurai||Demand up for beds in pvt hosps for critical patients||Madurai: The demand for beds in private hospitals in Madurai district is seeing a rapid increase, especially for critically-ill Covid-19 patients requiring intensive care, as cases continued to see a sharp spike with active cases crossing 3,000 on Friday. As per data from the health department, around 670 patients were admitted at various private hospitals in the district on Thursday.In at least six of the major private multi-speciality hospitals in Madurai, all ICU beds are full, with Covid-19 patients from other districts also coming in for treatment. “A number of Covid-19 patients often come to a tertiary care centre like ours only when their condition worsens. Both our Covid-19 ICUs with around 30-40 beds are already full. We can increase capacity of regular beds for Covid-19 but not ICU beds,” said Dr Varun Ramamoorthy, ICU head, Velammal Medical College Hospital and Research Institute (VMCHRI). He added that currently around 120 Covid-19 patients are undergoing treatment and the bed capacity will be increased up to a maximum of 250 by next week.Another major issue for private hospitals is the limited manpower especially when providing both Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 care. Unlike earlier during the lockdown last year, hospitals are offering all medical services and not just emergencies. “80% of beds allotted for Covid-19 patients are full. In the ICU, almost all beds are full barring one or two which are allotted for critical care. We would like to increase bed capacity further but the we have only limited manpower as we have to balance between Covid-19 care and non-Covid-19 care,” said Dr B Kannan, medical administrator, MMHRC. He said that one of the reasons for filling up of ICU beds is that some patients are staying at home while being Covid-19 positive and later reaching the hospital in a critical condition after 4-5 days suffering from severe breathlessness. In Madurai, currently 41 private hospitals are providing Covid-19 care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/demand-up-for-beds-in-pvt-hosps-for-critical-patients/articleshow/82222775.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Nagpur||NMC approves CCCs, collector office yet to give nod for oxygen, Rem||Nagpur: Authorities have failed to open new Covid hospitals, causing death of some patients at homes due to lack of hospital beds. However, the collector office is still not giving approval for distribution of oxygen and Remdesivir to Covid Care Centres (CCCs) developed by private hospitals with approval of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). On Friday, the civic body has proposed to open CCCs in rail coaches and in recreation centre at Symbiosis University’s campus at Wathoda. Active cases in the district increased to 73,349 on Friday from 64,335 registered on April 16. But NMC and collector office have failed to add any beds in last one week despite active cases increasing by 9,014. Kingsway Hospital has developed 150-bed CCC at Centre Point Hotel last week. It is an extension to Kingsway Hospital, where they plan to have up to 200 beds in phased manner. Two beds will have ventilators, 60 beds will be with oxygen, and remaining will be non-oxygen beds. Kingsway Hospital planned to admit mild and moderate patients at CCC, and shift them to its main hospital in case of need for further treatment. Also, the hospital had planned to transfer recovering patients from main hospital to CCC so that beds in hospital are used for critical patients. A letter submitted by hospital director Amit Somani to collector Ravindra Thakare on Friday said the collector office is yet to approve supply of oxygen and medicines, despite application submitted on April 19. “This facility has been developed to support inadequate health infrastructure of the city. We have been following continuously with your office for last four days and regretfully there has been no positive response. It is not possible for us to admit and treat Covid patients at our centre without supply of medicines and oxygen cylinders,” Somani said. Following suggestion from union minister Nitin Gadkari, Viveka Hospital has also developed a CCC at Kusumtai Wankhede Hall. NMC has approved it but it is yet to be considered for oxygen and medicines by the collector office. Intensivist Dr Nikhil Balankhe said, “CCC will have 30 beds with oxygen supply. It is likely to start from Saturday for mild symptomatic patients, who do not require oxygen or need less oxygen. We have facilitated three oxygen concentrators. Patients requiring oxygen and day care will be taken there once oxygen is supplied by the authorities. There are a large number of mild symptomatic patients roaming from one hospital to other for beds in panic. They need treatment and observation, which can be done at CCC. Also, some patients need just oxygen and treatment using Remdesivir, which can be managed at CCC. It will help reserving hospital beds for critical patients and also save lives.” Sources from NMC told TOI four more similar proposals were pending with the collector office. Thakare did not respond to TOI’s call and message. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, “CCC at Symbiosis has been planned with 150 beds with oxygen supply. Covid hospital at KT Nagar will start on Sunday initially with 25 beds and will be increased in phased manner subject to oxygen supply,” he said. KT Nagar Covid Hospital has 130 beds. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi sent a letter to Central Railway asking it to make available 11 coaches at platform no. 8 at main railway station. “HC has given orders to start CCC in rail coaches. CCC can be used for rail passengers testing positive and also for public and employees of railway. NMC will provide NGO to operate the CCC along with required number of staff, oxygen infrastructure, medicines etc,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-approves-cccs-collector-office-yet-to-give-nod-for-oxygen-rem/articleshow/82221980.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

In a letter to PM Narendra Modi, the foundation’s managing trustee Faisal Edhi said, “We are very sorry to hear about the exceptionally heavy impact that the pandemic has had on your country…As a neighbouring friend…we would like to extend our help in the form of a fleet of 50 ambulances along with our services to assist you in addressing, and further circumventing, the current health conditions.” He added he would personally lead the humanitarian works. Faisal, son of Abdul Sattar Edhi, who was called ‘Mother Teresa of Pakistan’, said he doesn’t need anything except permission and support from the local administration, including the police department. Peace activist Jatin Desai said Modi should accept the offer. “If the offer is accepted, it will open a new chapter in the Pakistan-India relationship,” said Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pak-organisation-writes-to-pm-offers-50-ambulances/articleshow/82222834.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Crematoria pushed to limit, over 500 funerals in a day||NEW DELHI: The official daily count of Covid-protocol funerals in the city crossed the 500 mark for the first time on Friday. A municipal official overseeing the Covid funeral management said 539 such funerals had been carried out till 6pm while many more were yet to be conducted. The big facilities like Nigambodh Ghat, Green Park and Punjabi Bagh now operate till midnight, said the official. According to the municipal corporations’ Covid funeral report, 223 bodies were received at 10 cremation and burial grounds under North Delhi Municipal Corporation, 272 at nine centres under South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and 44 at six facilities under East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC). The city breached the daily 400 mark on Tuesday when 410 Covid funerals took place. The count rose to 451 on Wednesday and 483 on Thursday. “In the wake of the continued rise in deaths, two sites have been added to the Covid-protocol funeral centres in Paschim Vihar and Haiderpur,” the official added. Many Delhiites have been complaining about multiple cremation grounds getting overwhelmed, wood shortage and long waiting periods. Multiple facilities are now running beyond the capacity. On Friday, the Panchkuian Road facility cremated 29 Covid bodies as against the capacity of 15, Beri Wala Bagh crematorium 18 bodies as against 12; and Paschim Vihar 19 bodies as against 18. SDMC’s Dwarka Sector 24 Dwaraka facility received 40 bodies while it can cremate only 32. The burial grounds have also been under stress with the Mangolpuri facility getting 12 bodies and ITO Firozshah Kotla getting eight bodies on Friday. The ITO burial ground is fast running out of space, a burial manager said. Alarmingly, senior public health officials say, the non-Covid cremations have also been rising rapidly in key facilities. On Thursday, the Covid protocol funeral at Nigambodh crossed 108 while non-Covid ones also continued to rise. In early April, the city’s biggest crematorium used to carry out 30-40 non-Covid funerals, but the count stands at over 90 since April 18-19. “We suspect that many of them may be dying of Covid at home and have asked the staff to deal with precautions,” north corporation mayor Jai Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/crematoria-pushed-to-limit-over-500-funerals-in-a-day/articleshow/82222791.cms||Paras Singh
---||Kozhikode||Kozhikode: CM’s intervention sought for Kappan’s treatment||KOZHIKODE: Raihanath, wife of Malayali journalist Siddique Kappan, and the Siddique Kappan Solidarity Committee urged chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to immediately intervene to save the life of Kappan who was admitted to a private medical college in UP after testing positive for Covid- 19 while in Mathura jail where he has been lodged since last October. Addressing mediapersons at a press conference here on Friday, Raihanath said that she was very concerned over Kappan’s health as he was highly diabetic and had other health issues. N P Chekkutty, solidarity committee chairperson, said that Kappan’s life was in danger and urged the chief minister to proactively intervene in the matter to ensure proper medical care for him. “Kerala government has the responsibility to provide safety to Malayalis working outside the state and Siddique Kappan also is entitled for that consideration,” he said. Intervention by the state government was necessary as recent reports of the Covid situation in UP has revealed the glaring inadequacies there in providing medical treatment to Covid patients, he added. Kappan was admitted to a private medical college in Mathura on Wednesday after he collapsed in the bathroom of his cell. Kerala Union of Working Journalists on Thursday approached the Supreme Court for urgent hearing of his bail plea along with a request to move Kappan to AIIMS or Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. Kappan and three others were arrested on October 5 last year when they were going to Hathras village to report the alleged gang rape and murder of a Dalit girl. They were booked for sedition and under sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. KUWJ district secretary Rakesh P S, Kappan’s children and brother Hamza were present at the press conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/cms-intervention-sought-for-kappans-treatment/articleshow/82221179.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Arriving today: High-value Tocilizumab enough for 20 patients||Nagpur: Fresh stock of Tocilizumab injections, which are in demand for treatment of Covid patients, is likely to reach the city on Saturday. It was last available here on April 12. However, the expected 500 vials would just be enough to meet the demands of around 20 patients. It’s learnt that the Tocilizumab vials, each costing around Rs 41,700, would reach the Nagpur depot of the company’s carrying and forwarding agent. The stock is meant for entire Vidarbha, Marathwada and Chhattisgarh. According to a highly placed source, Nagpur district’s allotment would be just 20. The sources stated that many people are ready to pay any price over and above the maximum retail price as the drug is known to be the last line of defence against Covid. Though other varieties like Bevacizumab and Infliximab are available, their effectiveness did not reach the popularity of either Tocilizumab or Alzumab. But even Alzumab, costing around Rs 31,500, is in short supply. According to an insider in the pharmaceutical market, fresh stock of the Indian-made Alzumab is expected to arrive only on May 6. Dr Rajesh Atal, critical care specialist and senior consultant at the Orange City Hospital and Research Institute, said Tocilizumab can be used only in the patients who have cytokine storm (aggravated response of the immune system) and no other bacterial infections. “The drug is good enough to destroy the virus but it can also suppress the immune system which in turn can aggravate any other bacterial infections in the body that can again turn fatal. One should use Tocilizumab only after ensuring the patient is suffering from no other infections for which prior tests must be done,” said Dr Atal. Dr Atal said other drugs of the same type like Alzumab, Bevacizumab and so on act on different levels of the inflammation to reduce the cytokine storm. “Tocilizumab was earlier used for other disorders related to abnormal immune system like rheumatoid arthritis but we have extrapolated it’s use to treat Covid complexities,” he said. Dr Nitin Shinde, infection disease specialist, extolled Tocilizumab as a drug but said it has to be administered during a specific ‘window period’ for it to be effective. “It is a good drug to fight mortality if administered at the right time. We are treating a lot of younger patients this time around,” said Dr Shinde who is associated with the Alexis Multispecialty Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/arriving-today-high-value-tocilizumab-enough-for-20-patients/articleshow/82221987.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Cops try to dissuade kin from entering Covid hospital as they rush in to help||Mumbai: Anger ran high as relatives who had isolated themselves mingled with Covid-19 positive family members after the Virar hospital fire.As news of the fire spread, kin of patients, mostly from surrounding villages, rushed to check on family members. “My husband got a bed as his oxygen level was fluctuating. I stayed home, in isolation. Now after spending hours with him, I will get infected,” said Sujata Mhatre. Her husband was among the 70 patients from other floors who were shifted out; he was moved to a civic hospital. Some of the 70 patients from other wards were helped in wheelchairs by hospital staff. They were kept on the ground floor before being moved out. A 45-year-old woman patient on the first floor walked down with support from hospital staff. She was gasping for breath and was put in a wheelchair and moved to a nearby hospital. A 62-year-old patient was wheeled out of the building even as his daughter insisted on accompanying him. Kin gathered outside the building pleading to be let in. Cops were seen dissuading them, saying it was a Covid hospital. Those who could not find their loved ones managed to sneak in on the ground floor.Families were inconsolable. Shama Mhatre (48), who was in the ICU for over 20 days, was to be discharged on Friday. A resident of Nalasopara, she has 3 minor children. A relative said she had spoken to her husband and children and was excited to get back home. In Nala village, the Mhatre family were preparing for their daughter’s wedding on Saturday when they got news of the death of Janardhan Mhatre (63). A relative said he was admitted a few days ago. Meenal Naik, a doctor, had hired a private nurse to look after her mother Suvarna Pitale (65), among the victims. The nurse who stayed outside the ICU ran out in time. She said the 17-bed ICU had only one nurse and there was no doctor in sight in the night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cops-try-to-dissuade-kin-from-entering-covid-hospital-as-they-rush-in-to-help/articleshow/82222837.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Dehradun||Dehradun businessman who distributed free masks last year, looking to supply oxygen this time||Dehradun: Harpal Singh Sethi, a Doon-based businessman, runs a charitable skill development school, where youths in need of employment can enroll and learn skills. When the pandemic broke out last year, the school produced masks and face shields, which were distributed to people and police personnel free of cost. Sethi, who funds the school from his own earnings, also arranged for free meals for affected people through a gurdwara. While assisting people affected by the virus, Sethi himself tested positive in August last year but after recovering, resumed his service. This time, during the second wave, he is gearing up to provide oxygen supply to those in need. “My grandfather Tirath Singh Sethi relocated to Doon from Rawalpindi and started The Army Press in the city. It went on to become a renowned press in the city. After my grandfather, my father and I worked in it. My grandfather used to do charitable works at the local gurdwara, as did my parents. I grew up participating in charitable causes. Last year, I decided to take the legacy forward by opening a skill development school to assist youths looking for employment.” The school, ‘Shri Guru Teg Bahadur Gurmat Kendra’, opened early last year, and trains youngsters in electronic repair work, carpentry, etc free of cost. Till now, over 50 students taught at the school have found employment. A few months after the school was started, the lockdown was imposed. It was then that Sethi decided to produce masks and face shields at the school. The youths were paid a remuneration for the job and the protective gear was distributed among frontline workers. “We made more than 22,000 face shields last year, which were distributed among people serving on the ground — police, doctors and district administration officials. We enhanced our capacity to supply these to several government organisations in need of masks and face shields free of cost,” Sethi said. He added that he tested positive for the virus in August last year. “I was in isolation for 16 days but returned to serve people on the 20th day. We also managed to feed 250 families for the entire year. It brought us a lot of satisfaction,” he said. Sethi credits his family for his success. He said his wife Tarandeep Kaur helped him in his endeavours and his son Bismanjyot, who was studying in Chennai and returned during the pandemic, also assists him. For his work, Sethi has received congratulatory certificates from former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, the Doon district administration as well as the Sri Guru Singh Sabha, Southhall, United Kingdom. Sethi said he is now trying to arrange for medical grade oxygen for senior citizens and the state government, as that is much in demand during this wave of the pandemic. “We are in talks with some suppliers and will start this service very soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doon-businessman-who-distributed-free-masks-last-year-looking-to-supply-oxygen-this-time/articleshow/82221173.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The district currently has as many as 60 containment zones, including 42 under corporation limits. The Madurai district has also ramped up Covid-19 testing and fever camps, especially in the hotspots to identify more fresh infections. Currently, around 5000-6000 samples are being tested per day for Covid-19 in comparison to last week, where only around 3000 samples were being tested per day. Similarly, more than 200 fever camps, including both static and mobile fever camps continue to be held in the district. The positivity rate which was around 5% last week had risen to 8% on Friday. “We are intensifying measures to identify more cases early and ensure the patients treatment. Door-to-door fever surveillance is also being done. However, compliance to Covid-19 safety norms is still poor among the general public. We urge the public to co-operate with local officials and follow wearing masks and maintain social distancing while going out,” said a health official. As per data from district health officials, around 48% of beds in government healthcare facilities and private hospitals are currently occupied. However, officials are to step up bed capacity in Covid-19 care centres if the need arises, in order to lessen the burden on hospitals. As of now, in case of government facilities, 827 beds out of 1561 beds are occupied at Government Rajaji Hospital while in other government hospitals, 127 out of 326 beds are occupied. 269 out of 500 beds are occupied at the Madurai Kamaraj University Covid-19 care centre. As many as 1,111 Covid-19 patients are meanwhile under home isolation. Further, now more number of fresh cases are being reported compared to those recovered, which may lead to increase in occupancy of beds in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-records-over-500-covid-cases-in-a-day-crosses-3000-active-cases/articleshow/82222786.cms||---

The state government is in talks with several experts, educators and other stakeholders to ensure that justice is done to every student seeking admission. An entrance test at this level for admissions is a strong possibility and is being considered by the state education department. The admissions to all these courses is based on the marks scored in Std X board exams. However, all the boards have cancelled the exams and the marks will be allotted to students based on their internal marks which is being decided by the state education department. According to Vaishali Bafna of the System Correcting Movement, an NGO working in education, the seats for FYJC have remained vacant every year despite conducting admission rounds for nearly six months after declaring the results. “In fact, this year, with delayed admissions and supplementary exams, the admission rounds were being conducted right up to March and yet the seats were vacant. The FYJC admissions or the technical courses may not have so much of an issue but there will be fierce competition for admission to popular colleges,” she said. Bafna said without marks, the admission process can go for a toss and can create several problems in the process and to bring the parity in marks for all the boards together is equally difficult. SYSCOM has also submitted suggestions in terms of admissions and stated that the internal marking system must be given only after the CBSE and ICSE boards have given the marks based on their formula so that there is parity.  A multiple choice questionnaire should be prepared for internal marking based on this the admissions to FYJC could be given and the marks of Std IX and X should be clubbed together and average of both the standards should be used as base for the admissions, was among the suggestions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/16l-pupils-for-8-5-lakh-seats-fyjc-entry-test-looms-large/articleshow/82221993.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

If yes, then the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation may soon knock your doors and seal your establishment. As part of an ongoing drive to enforce compliance towards Covid-related protocols, AMC on Friday sealed some 10 shops and offices. Last week, the civic authorities issued a directive that shops, private offices and commercial establishments have to operate at 50% or less staff. Of the 267 shops raided by civic authorities on Friday, those sealed include Star Bazaar and Arsenal Tech Private Limited in Jodhpur, Pure Care Private Limited in Sarkhej, Premvati at Mansi Circle, as well as Care Mobile, Mahadev Mobile, and Vivo Mobile in Naroda.

But, they were able to confirm that the version given by the accused, about the incidents that happened at the apartment on that fateful night, was true to an extent. Sources said that the statement of the accused that he had choked his child by putting his hand around her neck had given rise to a confusion as there was no cartilage break, a typical injury in such an assault. The investigation team hence re-enacted the scene and found out that he had actually applied pressure on her jaw. This seems to have affected her lungs and caused bleeding through her nose; she fell unconscious then, said the police. Earlier, the police had found bloodstains of Vaiga in the apartment. Investigators are now collecting evidence with the accused and the team is now in Goa after taking him to Salem and Bengaluru for evidence collection. He would be taken to casinos that he used to frequent here. On Friday, police collected evidence from the car that was used by the accused to escape after committing the crime. Meanwhile, DCP Aishwarya Dongre, who went to Maharashtra to study the cheating case registered by the economic offences wing against Mohan, is likely to return to the state soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/presence-of-alcohol-still-a-mystery/articleshow/82221230.cms||---

Nehal Rathwa, who was interning at Gotri GMERS Hospital, was admitted to SSG Hospital on April 21 and detected positive for Covid-19. Her death late on Thursday night, sparking outrage among the government physiotherapy college students and interns.  “Rathwa was a student of Neo-Tech Institute and suffered from diabetes. She had informed the authorities. She wasn’t willing to take up Covid duty but the concerned officials didn’t listen to her. She was forced to perform Covid duty despite her condition and this caused her death. Rathwa was interning for the last six months,” alleged Khushboo Jadav, a student of Masters in Physiotherapy.  Jadav further claimed that Rathwa’s death certificate doesn’t even mention that she died due to Covid-19 infection. “We all are under immense pressure and have been working non-stop at SSG and Gotri GMERS Hospital for several months. But the authorities don’t care about our condition. Our stipend is also very low as compared to MBBS interns. We will soon approach the government with our demand,” Jadav added.  The students and interns met SSG Hospital superintendent Dr Ranjan Iyer and made representation. Dr Iyer, however, referred to the paper formalities. Iyer, however, said, “We have the signed consent of Rathwa who had agreed to perform Covid duty. Also, she never informed the authorities that she was a diabetes patient. But we are going to recommend her name for an insurance scheme meant for Covid warriors.” He also appreciated the role played by the physiotherapy students and interns in the battle against Covid.  The physiotherapy students were contemplating whether to join their duties from Saturday, but no decision was taken till late night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/physio-intern-aged-22-dies-of-covid-students-fume/articleshow/82221236.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Hospitals’ old power systems facing a huge load, say experts||MUMBAI: Excessive load on old wires, use of mismatched circuit breakers and poor insulation are among the main causes for short circuits and fires in hospitals, say experts. While big hospitals have full-fledged teams looking into electrical circuits, many small hospitals located in residential colonies tend to hook heavy equipment and gadgets to old wires, experts added. As the load of patients is high due to the pandemic, many of these nursing homes have added new gadgets and work round the clock. TimesViewThe Virar hospital tragedy is the latest in a spate of fires that have engulfed Covid centres in the state and is a warning of the strain on health infrastructure that has been overstretched and burdened due to the pandemic. Electrical systems need to be regularly checked and updated to be able to take the growing load, and firefighting systems need to be tested from time to time to prevent such disasters.It is an established fact that 90% of fires in Mumbai region (fires are more in number during summer as electricity load is high) are due to short circuits. Friday’s fire in a Virar hospital appears to be no different as MSEDCL authorities do not rule out the possibility of fire due to ‘use’ of gadgets on the internal power network. “But while doing so, the need to expand the supply network is ignored. This leads to friction in the networks,” said an expert. Senior expert K K K Nair said the major reason for continued tripping and fire in wires is that the miniature circuit breakers don’t act in time to arrest the current. “This is because electricians fit overrated miniature circuit breakers as against the required current capacity. As a result, these devices fail to cut supply even after a short-circuit. This leads to escalation of fire in the wires,” said Nair, adding he has written to the PM and CM to standardise use of switches and circuit breakers as per load. Another expert Ashok Pendse said overloading of newer gadgets on existing old wire networks leads to friction. “When nursing homes are built in residential areas, more and more ACs and medical equipment are added to the connection meant to take the load of only 2-3 ACs and a heater,” he said. Dr Hemant Joshi, a doctor in Virar, said most ICUs and oxygen beds in nursing homes and hospitals in the area are fully occupied. “This places strain on electrical equipment,” he said. Frequent breakdowns occur,, damaging equipment. “My hospitals as well as others have hired electricians,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hosps-old-power-systems-facing-a-huge-load-says-experts/articleshow/82222872.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Amdavadis form lifeline for plasma seekers||AHMEDABAD: Over the past few weeks, volunteers groups -- citizens from all walks of life -- have launched themselves on social media groups connecting blood plasma donors and relatives of Covid-affected patients. Convalescent plasma treatment may have been put in the back burner, but if volunteer and banker Bhavik Rajpurohit is to be believed some 78 patients have already been connected with plasma donors by a team of volunteers he belongs to, which includes a central government employee Pruthvish Pandya, Prajesh Bharwad and a wildlife photographer Zubin Ashara. “On Thursday alone, I got 110 calls for patients seeking plasma from people who have recovered from Covid. We try connecting the patients with a haematologist and a general physician who make it possible.” Vijay Patel from Naroda, who had been organising blood collection drives for 22 years, receives 90-odd calls a day. He has arranged for plasma from those who have recovered Covid for 105 current patients. “I have given my contact details on Twitter and all social media platforms and I can be contacted 24x7. I feel convalescent plasma is working for people who have just been administered the first dose of remdesivir or a day earlier.” In fact, those who had recovered from Covid can donate their plasma 28 days after they test negative or after their Covid vaccination. Dr Ripal Shah, medical director at Prathama blood bank, says, “We get 50 calls a day for plasma from relatives of Covid-affected patients. There is a huge shortage and we need people who have recovered from Covid to come forward and donate. Plasma from two donors can help 15 patients. If a donor agrees we even arrange for their transportation. Over the last few weeks, we have started appealing to people on social media and even counselling them to donate.” Dr Vishwas Amin, medical director of the Ahmedabad chapter of Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) says, “We receive 60 blood plasma requests daily. We recover 30 to 40 plasma products everyday. We have conducted 15 to 20 plasmapheresis procedures since last month. We invite Covid-recovered patients, and conduct antibody screening. The plasma is generally infused when oxygen demand starts increasing in patients. This therapy works if it is provided early.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amdavadis-form-lifeline-for-plasma-seekers/articleshow/82222022.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi on its knees: 348 Covid-19 deaths new single-day high||NEW DELHI: A record 348 people died in a day due to Covid-19 in Delhi on Friday — the highest since the outbreak began a year ago. On Thursday, the city had seen 306 deaths. In the past 23 days, Delhi has recorded 2,514 deaths, averaging 109 daily. In March, the average daily death was around 4. “There has been an explosion of Covid-19 cases over the past three weeks. The positivity rate is around 32%, meaning every third person being tested is turning out to be positive. Also, we are seeing a lot of young infected persons developing severe symptoms,” said a senior doctor at Lok Nayak Hospital. On Friday, Delhi recorded 24,331 new cases. It came out of 75,037 tests, including 43,711 RT-PCR and 31,326 rapid antigen tests. “We have to do more tests to ensure timely medical intervention. But we are seeing the opposite happening,” said a doctor, adding that most labs were refusing to do tests. Apart from testing, the availability of ICU beds has decreased sharply. As of 11pm on Friday, there were only five ventilator beds available for Covid-19 patients across the city; one at AIIMS Trauma Centre and four at Metro Hospital in Preet Vihar. The latter had complained about delayed oxygen supply. “There is a scarcity of ICU beds for Covid-19 patients not just in Delhi but across NCR. All beds at our hospital are full,” Dr N K Pandey, chairman and managing director of Asian Hospital, Faridabad, said. He added that the issue of oxygen supply were faced by many hospitals. However, with ICUs full in Delhi, many needy patients are still turning to the hospitals in neighbouring areas like Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida. There are more than 20,000 oxygen beds for Covid-19 patients in Delhi. Of these, nearly 19,000 are occupied. The ICU beds without a ventilator is also rarely available. The number of active cases in the city has, meanwhile, reached 92,069. Of them, 48,502 are in home isolation while the rest are under treatment at hospitals, Covid Health Centres and Covid Care Centres, officials said. The doctors say only 15% of the Covid-19 patients require admission to hospitals. The rest, 85%, can be managed at home. “Many people are rushing to hospitals early, when the condition is stable, because they are not sure if they would be able to get proper and timely care once the situation deteriorates. This is also leading to overcrowding,” said Dr Arun Gupta, president of Delhi Medical Council. He added that patients under home isolation should check oxygen saturation at least once in six hours. “If oxygen saturation is staying about 94%, there is nothing to worry about. But, if it is falling, one should consult his or her physician to decide the next course of action,” Dr Gupta added. Covid cases in Gurgaon hit a new daily peak of 4.3k: As many as 4,319 people tested positive for Covid-19 in Gurgaon on Thursday, in what is so far the district’s sharpest single-day spike in cases. The active cases tally breached the 20,000 mark to climb to 20,760, of which 19,667 patients are in home isolation. With this, Gurgaon’s overall Covid tally reached 96,738. According to official data, Friday’s positivity rate stood at a staggering 35%, with a little over 12,000 tests done. The weekly positivity rate is 26%. The chief medical officer said Gurgaon described the situation as an “emergency”. Nine people succumbed to the virus on Friday, taking the toll to 410. At present, the case fatality rate is 0.4%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-on-its-knees-348-deaths-new-single-day-high-positivity-rate-at-32-shortage-of-beds-and-o2-takes-a-toll/articleshow/82222902.cms||---

Another developer said he provided ration and food to his workers, but of 30 of them, 25 had left. “Most workers at the in-situ sites were saying they were leaving for their hometowns because of the fear of a lockdown, no work and the rising Covid-19 cases,” a contractor said. “The government needs to directly address the workers and assure them of work,” he added.Developers added that most workers were not registered with the board and they were not getting incentives and their daily pay was affected. “Many have not been given any such certificates till now. So, the state government’s announcement to transfer Rs 1,500 to construction workers registered with the board is of no benefit for such workers,” a worker at a Kondhwa site said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/realty-sector-hit-as-onsite-construction-workers-leave/articleshow/82222029.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The state had reported 568 deaths on Thursday. Mumbai contributed to less than 10% of the total fatalities in the state. While 72 deaths were reported from Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (excluding Mumbai) reported 108. Daily detections in the rest of MMR were also higher than Mumbai on Friday. While Mumbai added 7,199 cases, the MMR region, which is spread across three districts and eight corporations, added 9,769 cases. State government officials said that smaller cities like Solapur, Yavatmal, Satara were reporting an increased number of deaths. Solapur district on Friday reported 57 deaths, while Yavatmal reported 70 deaths, as per the state health department update. At the state level, Nagpur district reported more cases (7,970) than Mumbai, besides 58 deaths. However, the update from the district reported 82 deaths. So far this month, the state has added over 8,300 deaths and if the fatalities continue to surge at the given rate, it may surpass the 11,900 deaths added in September 2020, known to be the worst month of the Covid-19 pandemic. Officials said the sharp rise in deaths is due to reconciliation of data. Of the total fatalities, 360 have occurred in the last 48 hours, 224 are from last week and the remaining 189 are from the period before last week. Meanwhile, Maharashtra reported a slight dip in daily detections and added 66,836 cases taking the total caseload to 41.6 lakh and the death toll to 63,252. Mumbai’s tally touched 6.1 lakh and the toll rose to 12,655.The case tally in the rest of MMR was 6.7 lakh and 9,709 deaths. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid taskforce, has said cases have plateaued for Mumbai and the mortality seen is from the critical cases that got hospitalised two weeks ago. Of the 72 deaths, 22 were aged 40-60. “However, the struggle for beds, oxygen and medicines is not fully resolved. Spikes are still seen in a less exposed population,” he said. A civic official said the city’s positivity rate has stabilised at around 17% for the past few days. In a positive sign, for the first time in many weeks, the daily discharges were higher than the daily detections. A total of 74,045 people were sent home, taking the total discharges in the state to 34 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/over-35-rise-in-fatalities-as-maharashtra-sees-773-deaths/articleshow/82225169.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Nagpur||Apply to Centre for increasing Remdesivir supply: HC tells state||Nagpur: To tide over the crisis of Remdesivir injections, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Friday directed the Maharashtra government to request the centre to increase its supply. Currently, the state government is receiving 29,911 vials per day, as per centre’s order of April 21. “We direct the government to review Remdesivir requirements in the state. If it’s found that more vials are required, appropriate requests with proper justification be made to the central level committee. We expect the government to place on record it’s response supported by appropriate data and figures,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak said, before adjourning the hearing till April 27. While hearing the suo motu plea based on TOI report on bed shortage, the bench asked the government to ensure that vials are distributed across the state by adopting centre’s April 21 formula. After being summoned by HC, Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) Venugopal Somani virtually attended the hearing and informed that current Remdesivir production capacity of seven manufacturers across India is 38 lakh per month, in view of high demand. “The actual capacity is 21-22 lakh per month. The production depends on various factors, including consistent supply of raw material, electricity, water and availability of sufficient workers, which are variable by their very nature,” he said. The lawyers, including amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar, Bhanudas Kulkarni, Tushar Mandlekar, Rohan Malviya and Sejal Lakhani contended that even with existing Remdesivir production capacity, the quota of over 2.69 lakh vials from April 21-30 for Maharashtra could be increased to tide over the current situation. Earlier, collector Ravindra Thakare informed that they had sent a proposal to WCL to instal oxygen production plants based on air separation technology at GMCH, IGGMCH and AIIMS. “Very shortly, a positive response is expected. As soon as the approval is received, we would try to complete it in six to eight weeks,” he informed. Collect oxygen cylinders from cos, fabrication units & welders: HC The HC directed the collector to take immediate steps to collect empty oxygen cylinders from various industrial houses, fabrication units, railways and welders, and use them for Covid patients. “He may form a team of officers, who would personally visit these establishments, and take cylinders in their custody through proper procedure. If required, the assistance of police stations or SRPF can be taken and appropriate rent would have to be paid to the owners.” The directives came after intervenor Aditya Goyal, VHA’s Dr Anup Marar and lawyers pointed out that even if oxygen supply was regulated, there’s a shortage of empty cylinders patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/apply-to-centre-for-increasing-remdesivir-supply-hc-tells-state/articleshow/82222047.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Their election to the Rajya Sabha was announced by Kerala legislative secretary and returning officer SV Unnikrishnan here on Friday. The election to Rajya Sabha was held after the term of three MPs —Vayalar Ravi, KK Ragesh and Abdul Wahab— expired on April 21. Since there was no clarity on the date on which the election commission is about to hold the election to the seats falling vacant, CPM leader S Sarma and the legislative assembly secretary had approached the high court seeking directions in this regard. Election commission had earlier announced the date of election as April 12, but did not issue the subsequent notification, forcing the incumbent state government to approach the court. Wahab represents IUML in the Upper House and the other two are CPM nominees. The candidature of Brittas, journalist and media adviser to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, has come as a surprise to many in the CPM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/wahab-brittas-and-sivadasan-elected-to-rs-unopposed/articleshow/82221252.cms||---

The man identified as Dhiru Patel (65) was going to be discharged as his condition had improved, but on the morning of April 15, he went out of the hospital and was missing since then. Patel was admitted on April 8 as his health had deteriorated. Hospital authorities told police that Patel had left his bed around 6am to use the washroom. But when he did not return and was not found in the washroom too, his family members and cops were informed. When the family members could also not find him, they lodged a missing person report at Vansda police station. “On Thursday morning, hospital staff went near the wild bushes behind the hospital as stench was emanating from there. When they found the body, they called us,” said sub-inspector V N Vaghela of Vansda police station. Patel’s family members later identified the body in police presence. Police suspect that Patel may have fainted and failed to recuperat. “There does not seem to be any foul play as there were no injury marks on the body,” Vaghela added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/missing-covid-19-man-found-dead-behind-hospital-a-week-later/articleshow/82221253.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Roha-Veer track doubling to reduce travel time to Goa||Navi Mumbai: To improve train services towards Goa and Kerala, work on doubling of tracks is going on between Roha and Veer stations — a 47 km stretch in Raigad district. This will reduce waiting time of trains, cutting down on delay in journeys as it happens on the single track that exists currently. The work is estimated to cost Rs 530 crore, said Konkan Railway officials. Of 11 major bridges, 182 minor ones, and 18 underbridges on the stretch, the longest bridge will be over river Kundalika after track-doubling happens. Konkan Railway officials, however, refused to give details of the longest bridge. Work on cutting of a hill is going on at Chapdi near Roha. “The double track will help reduce waiting time of trains to some extent,” said Girish Karandikar, deputy general manager (public relations) of Konkan Railway Corporation Limited. He said it will help trains to stop over and ease their crossing. A resident of Mahad, Dipak Salunkhe, said that train passengers headed for the Konkan and other parts of the south are compelled to wait due to the single track that exists. “The doubling work will bring relief as this double track will cover a major portion of Raigad district,” said Slunkhe. The 47-km stretch on which the track is being doubled is part of a long stretch where such work had begun in December 2016. This work has been slated for completion by July this year. So far Rs 418 crore has been spent on the railway track doubling work along the entire stretch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-roha-veer-track-doubling-to-reduce-travel-time-to-goa/articleshow/82222950.cms||Umesh K Parida
---||Kochi||HC seeks ED’s views on PMLA case in Lavalin deal||Kochi: SNC Lavalin Engineering India Pvt Ltd has approached the Kerala high court challenging the action being taken by Enforcement Directorate (ED) against it under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Justice K Haripal has asked ED to inform its views on the petition within three weeks. The petitioner company has contended that it is a subsidiary of Canada-based SNC Lavalin Inc (SLI) and that it had no role in the transactions of the parent company between 1995 and 1998. The contracts and the transactions during this period were directly handled by SLI from Canada. The petitioner company was not subjected to investigation by DRI and is not an accused in the chargesheet filed, stated the petition. Pursuant to a report of the auditor general in 2005, a CBI probe was conducted and a chargesheet was filed in 2009. All the allegations against SLI in respect of money laundering relate to the period prior to January 17, 2003, when PMLA came into force, the company argued. Summons issued by ED under PMLA directly violates the fundamental rights, especially when the petitioner company has no role or involvement in the alleged offence or the proceeds of crime, stated the plea. ED’s summons amounts to colourable exercise of the powers vested in the agency and is seemingly with an ulterior motive, the company has contended while seeking to quash the summons issued to its director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-seeks-eds-views-on-pmla-case-in-lavalin-deal/articleshow/82221268.cms||---

Once again, Gondia district is reportedly left with no stock of Covishield for Saturday. As per data of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), vaccination was done at only 75 out of 129 centres on Thursday where 5,193 took the jab. Vaccination was over 7,000 per day in the last week. Inoculation could not happen at 54 centres reportedly due to shortage of doses. Vaccination could not be commenced at many centres in morning from routine time of 9am on Friday. The NMC received 30,000 doses of Covishield from the office of deputy director of health services (DDHS). Then, centres were given doses and inoculation started at 104 centres from 12-1pm onwards. It covered 9,357 people in 45-plus age group, healthcare workers and frontline workers. Prabhat Kumar Shrivastava, 65, an ex-officer of Indian Navy, told TOI, “Earlier, we were not given second dose citing six weeks have not been completed from first dose though Co-Win application had scheduled it. We went to NMC’s KT Nagar UPHC for second dose in Friday morning and did not get jab due to lack of doses.” A couple from Ramdaspeth said, “We booked second dose at a private hospital online on Thursday. But hospital had no doses.” Vaccination was smooth for Covaxin at all four centres in the city — two at Government Medical College and Hospital, NMC’s Mahal Diagnostic Centre and Dr Ambedkar Hospital, Indora — as the NMC had around 2,000 doses. As per data of DDHS, 3,349 persons were administered vaccine in Gondia district on Friday. The data shows the district is left with no doses of Covishield for Saturday. The district is having around 14,000 doses of Covaxin. Wardha district is also running short of doses of Covishield as well as Covaxin. The district was having stock of two vaccines sufficient for only two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaccine-drive-hit-due-to-shortage-of-doses/articleshow/82222054.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The university has been swamped with cases in the past few days — 30 faculty and staff members have tested positive and been admitted to AMU’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, as have 12 consultants, 20 resident doctors and some paramedical staff members of the medical college. AMU officials said noted critic and senior faculty member at the department of Urdu Prof Maula Bakhsh Ansari, 58; faculty member of the Sunni theology section Prof Ehsanullah Fahad, 50, and in-charge of leather and footwear technology section at University Polytechnic AMU Saeed Uzzaman, 51, were serving faculty members who died in the past two days. “Prof Ansari had been admitted to a private hospital and died within a few days on Wednesday (April 21). He had not been tested for Covid-19, but he had symptoms of the disease,” said former director of the Urdu Academy AMU, Rahat Abrar. Ansari had been working on six projects of books on stylistics, critical studies and cultural studies. They are yet to be published. Fahad, meanwhile, had been admitted to AMU’s medical college for Covid-19 treatment. “After his report came back negative, he was moved to the non-Covid ward. But he died two days later of post-Covid complications,” medical college principal Prof Shahid Ali Siddiqui said. He, too, died on Wednesday. A day later, Uzzaman passed away. “His Covid-19 test report was negative but he had symptoms like fever and coughing. He died in Meerut, where he had gone to attend his mother’s cremation,” principal of University Polytechnic Prof Arshad Umar said. It is not known if his mother had Covid-19. Since Sunday, five retired faculty members also died with Covid-19-related complications — Prof Rizwan Husain, 84 (English), Prof Vakeel Jafari, 90 (physics), Prof Humayun Murad, 80 (zoology), Prof Saeeduz Zafar, 75 (former chairperson of the department of psychology), and Prof Iqbal Ali, 70 (former principal, University Polytechnic AMU). “Rizwan died of a cardiac arrest but had been in isolation at home after his daughter-in-law tested positive. His wife and son, too, have been infected,” Husain’s brother-in-law Prof Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi, also a faculty member at AMU, said. Husain died on Sunday. On Monday, Jafari passed away. “My father was in Delhi at the time. He had fever and congestion,” his son Rehan Jafari said. Two days later, on Wednesday, Murad died with similar complications. “He had been admitted to a private hospital with fever and weakness. When his condition started deteriorating, he was referred to the (AMU) medical college, where he tested positive for Covid-19. He died within two days of admission,” his friend and former media adviser of AMU Jaseem Mohammad said. On the same day, Zafar died. “My father passed away with Covid-19. He had been admitted to the (AMU) medical college for four days,” Zafar’s son Mohd Imran said. Iqbal, on the other hand, died a day later in Kanpur. “He had been admitted to the hospital with a complaint of fever and throat ulcer. He passed away within a day,” a senior faculty member at the University Polytechnic said. With a spate of such cases, those associated with university faculty bodies have sought an upgrade in Covid-19 support facilities. “We urgently need to increase the number of oxygen beds and ventilators and (step up) deployment of medical staff,” former secretary of the AMU Teachers’ Association and former member of the AMU Executive Council Aftab Alam wrote in an open letter to the university and medical college administrations. “We also need to create dedicated facilities for teachers and university staff.” AMU’s medical college principal Siddiqui said arrangements to augment facilities are being made. “We have added two ventilators to the trauma ICU. In the 80-bed Covid ward, 60 are directly connected to the oxygen pipeline. Of these, 25 have ventilator support facilities,” he added. “We are trying our best.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/aligarh-muslim-university-loses-3-faculty-members-5-retired-professors-to-covid-19/articleshow/82221254.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Once ready, critical patients of the district won’t have to travel all the way to Haldwani’s Sushila Tiwari Hospital (Haldwani is a three-hour drive away from Almora). “The ICU will start functioning next week. As of now, there is no ICU facility in Almora, Bageshwar, Champawat or Pithoragarh. People go to Haldwani for treatment from here. A microbiologist has been deployed at the Covid-19 lab at the base hospital in Almora, who will join the four other staff members here and start RT-PCR testing here soon,” Nautiyal said, adding that 22 personnel are required to run the lab but they are starting with five as of now and trying to fill the vacancies soon. Meanwhile, the 34 ventilators that were installed at the medical college last year have still not been used due to lack of staff. Almora, along with the other hill districts, has seen an alarming rise in coronavirus cases. Currently, there are 400 active cases of Covid-19 in the districts.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Woman abused by mask-less man in auto, gets him arrested||KOLKATA: A man was arrested on Friday for threatening a fellow autorickshaw commuter, a young woman, when she asked him to put on a mask. The man has been booked under various sections of IPC, including threat and molestation, and under Disaster Management Act for not wearing a mask. The incident took place late on Wednesday, when the woman was returning home at Beliaghata from Sahitya Parishad Street. “When she boarded the auto, all the other passengers were wearing their masks. When the auto reached Kankurgachi, one passenger alighted and a new one stepped into the auto without a mask. The woman, along with other passengers, questioned the driver why he was allowed to get in. The offender—40-year-old Bimal Basu—who appeared to be somewhat inebriated began to threaten her,” police said. “He told her he would click her photograph and harass her regularly as he was a local and she, too, travelled on the route every day. The woman called up a family member, who advised her to approach the police.” On alighting from the auto on CIT Road, the woman went to the cops, who traced the auto, asked the driver where the accused had been dropped and arrested him from his residence. A senior officer said the force planned to felicitate the woman for her resolve to get the mask-less offender booked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-abused-by-mask-less-man-in-auto-gets-him-arrested/articleshow/82222100.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Lucknow||Use Bada Imambara as Covid hosp: Jawad||Lucknow: Shia cleric and general secretary of Majlis-e-Ulama-e-Hind, Maulana Kalbe Jawad, on Friday said the government should convert Bada Imambara and other Imambaras into makeshift hospitals for Covid-19 patients. In a three-minute long video statement, the cleric said in view of the crisis of beds for patients in the city, the community offers Shia Imambaras to be used as hospitals. “The Quran says that if you save even one life, it is as if you have saved the entire humankind. Covid crisis is aggravating and people are not getting beds. In such a situation, we will have no problem if the government uses the Bada Imambara and other big Imambaras of the city for the treatment of Covid-19 patients,” said Jawad. “Since the funds under the Husainabad & Allied Trust (HAT) for Muharram and Ramzan rituals have not been used for two years due to pandemic, it should be put to use for conversion of these imambaras as makeshift hospitals,” he said. “The district magistrate is the chairperson of the Trust and he can take this decision. We want the government to consider the suggestion,” Jawad added. The cleric also appealed to people to take full precautions and not consider Covid-19 a part of any propaganda. “The disease is very real. Many people known to me have lost their lives to Covid-19. Many in my family are also affected by it. People should not take it lightly and follow all Covid-19 protocols and hygiene,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/use-bada-imambara-as-covid-hosp-jawad/articleshow/82222907.cms||---
---||Agra||Turned away by 10 Agra hospitals, Covid-19 positive woman dies waiting for Oxygen||AGRA: For five hours, a desperate Akash Yadav, 22, and his sister Neha, went from one hospital to another in Agra begging that their Covid-19 positive mother be admitted. But none admitted the woman gasping for air. By the time they reached the 10th hospital, her oxygen level had dropped to a low that she breathed her last. Then, their taxi driver dumped the body on the road and sped away. The brother-sister managed to hire an ambulance to take their mother home to Firozabad. But it was hours before the administration responded and the body was finally cremated as per Covid protocol. “My mother died waiting for oxygen. She left us in pain. We kept requesting outside different hospitals to arrange for oxygen and provide her treatment. I made calls to helpline numbers and health officials, but no one helped. I saw my mother suffering for over five hours. I wish no one else goes through such an ordeal,” said Akash. Residents of Linepar area under Tundla police station of Firozabad district, Rakesh Yadav (50) and his wife Seema Yadav (47) tested Covid-19 positive last week. The couple isolated themselves at home. On Monday, Rakesh’s health deteriorated. He was admitted to a private hospital in Agra. On Thursday evening, Seema’s fever shot up and she experienced difficulty in breathing. Akash and Neha brought her to Agra to the hospital where their father was admitted. But the hospital authorities refused to admit her, citing non-availability of bed and scarcity of medical oxygen. For over five hours, the duo tried to get Seema admitted but were turned away by 10 hospitals. All the while, her condition deteriorated. She died at around 10:30 pm. After bringing their mother’s body to Firozabad, the brother-sister kept making calls to the district administration and health department officials for her cremation. It was after neighbours intervened that a health department team arrived in the afternoon and took the body for the last rites. When TOI contacted Dr Sanjeev Verma, superintendent of the Tundla community health centre, he said, “We had received the information regarding the death of the Covid-19 positive woman at around 8:00 am. After making the required arrangements, the body was cremated as per the Covid-19 protocol. We will be sending samples of the deceased’s son and daughter for RT-PCR test. Suitable help will be provided to them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/turned-away-by-10-agra-hosps-covid-19-woman-dies-waiting-for-o2/articleshow/82221266.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Nagpur||3-year-old Bhima defies tiger ways, sticks to mom||Nagpur: Science and research say tiger cubs become independent from their mothers at 17-24 months. Males travel further from their mother’s range than females. But defying this behaviour is an extended family of tigers in Sirkada area of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) buffer zone. Currently, the family consists of five tigers — Dadhiyal (has a beard), Patlinbai, 3-year-old Bhima (the pair’s cub from a first litter) and two sub-adult cubs. In Tadoba landscape, where 6 tigers occupy 100 sq km, male cubs generally separate early in search of new territories. While 1 male and 2 females from Patlinbai’s first litter of four have moved way, Bhima, born in 2018, continues to stay put with her second litter delivered last year. The big family was photographed by India’s well-known wildlife filmmaker Subbiah Nallamuthu and tourist Nikhil Abhyankar on March 29. “All the five could not be captured in one frame as Dadhiyal left the spot on seeing the tourists. The other four looked very relaxed. The family of five was sighted by several tourists before tourism was withdrawn recently due to Covidd. Bhima seems to be still dependent on Patlinbai,” said Abhyankar. The wildlife buff has shot some videos too. “In one, Bhima can be seen pushing Patlinbai to suck her nipples. It still shows cub behaviour,” said Abhyankar. WII tiger scientist Bilal Habib says wildlife science is about the “living system and can defy logic”. “Dispersal depends on local circumstances and it not necessary that males cubs have to disperse after two years,” he added. Habib also cited the example of Matkasur (8 years) and Chhota Matka (3 years) being seen together in Tadoba. “Traditionally, Chhota Matka should have been overpowered by Matkasur. With other males eyeing Matkasur’s territory, he realised that both together would be able to fight off the new entrant,” said Habib. Tadoba field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar dubs it as a unique case. “We focus on 15-20 tigers in the tourism zone but there are 200 plus tigers in the district, and we don’t know if a similar trend is witnessed elsewhere. It is a matter to study,” he said. Nallamuthu says that male sub-adult cubs are “usually the last ones to leave the tigress”. “It tries to take maximum advantage of being with the mother before separation. “However, this is not a healthy sign. It may lead to territorial fights and cubs being killed for mating with females,” he added. Deputy director (buffer) G Guruprasad is also surprised at Bhima’s behaviour. “It is not only living peacefully with the family but also takes care of the Patlinbai’s new cubs. I’ve heard about one such case among tigers in Kabini in Karnataka.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-year-old-bhima-defies-tiger-ways-sticks-to-mom/articleshow/82222110.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Have Maharashtra govt labs maxed out their capacity for RT-PCR tests?||MUMBAI: The capacity of government laboratories to carry out RT-PCR tests appears to have maxed out, leading to a momentary slowdown in testing. TOI has learnt the ratio of RT-PCR that had gone up to 75% in March is now down to 60% with antigen tests filling in the gap. The state’s 99 government laboratories have a collective capacity to carry out 50,000-55,000 RT-PCR tests daily. Since the second wave hit, the labs are pushing the daily average to over 70,000. “But they are stretched to a limit now,” said a senior official. If government laboratories have reached a saturation point, it could mean both over-reliance on private laboratories as well as on antigen tests that provide results swiftly but could miss cases. Data shows after a massive scale-up of testing in the first week of April, it has stagnated in the past seven days. The state is currently carrying out an average of 2.7lakh tests daily of which roughly 1.6lakh are RT-PCR and 1.1lakh are rapid antigen. A district official said any further increase in RAT would go against the ICMR norm of conducting 70% RT-PCR. For most of the first wave, daily testing numbers were less than a lakh, but picked up in March 2021. By the beginning of April, the state was clocking an average of 1.8lakh tests , exceeding 2 lakh by April 6 and touching up to 2.8lakh more recently. In the last one week though, numbers have plateaued at 2.6-2.8lakh. On Friday too, 2.8 lakh tests were done. Dr Abhijit More of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan said testing of high-risk contacts and contact tracing, considered cornerstones, has broken down in many districts. In Mumbai, after touching 56,000 tests a day, it has dipped to an average of 45,000 now. A civic official said civic and state-run hospitals are doing about 800 and 250 tests daily respectively, whereas private labs are doing nearly 28,000 tests against their capacity of 45,000. “Mumbai has enough capacity to expand,” the official said, adding 50% of samples tested in private labs are from BMC. “There is no slowdown in testing in Mumbai,” the official added. Maharashtra has 230 laboratories of which 99 are government and 131 private. In addition, the state has 293 antigen collection centres, loosely categorised as labs. Overall, the state claims to have 523 laboratories to test Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/have-maharashtra-govt-labs-maxed-out-their-capacity-for-rt-pcr-tests/articleshow/82222910.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Justice VG Arun held that serving summons through WhatsApp is not acceptable after considering a petition (Crl MC No. 1658/2021) filed by Anoop Jacob MLA through advocate Manoj P Kunjachan. The MLA had challenged a non-bailable warrant issued by additional judicial magistrate (special court for cases related to MPs/MLAs), Ernakulam, in a case over a protest march. It was contended by the petitioner that the summons allegedly sent to him over WhatsApp had never reached him as he had not downloaded the app on his phone. In the judgment, the court referred to sections 62 and 65 of CrPC and rule 7 of Criminal Rules of Practice, Kerala, which deal with the mode and manner of service of summons. The court then said, “The above provisions do not provide for service of summons through WhatsApp.” Negotiable Instruments Act was amended to include speed post or approved courier service for serving summons. In a 2014 judgment (Indian Banks Association Vs Union of India), the Supreme Court allowed issuing summons by post as well as by email, the court noted. The court then said, “In the case at hand, the summons is stated to have been issued through WhatsApp, which is not an accepted mode of service. As such, the court should not have issued non-bailable warrant against the petitioner on the assumption that he had failed to appear after receiving the summons.” The court issued a stay on executing the warrant for four weeks to enable the petitioner to seek bail from the lower court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/courts-cant-issue-summons-through-whatsapp-hc/articleshow/82221304.cms||---
---||Delhi||Home truth: Getting tested a huge challenge in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Worried by the fever Himanshi and her husband have had for some days, they called several pathology laboratories for a Covid test, only to be told they couldn’t come home to collect the sample. She and her husband cannot go out to have the test done because they have no one to look after their 15-month-old infant. Hundreds like the couple are caught in this desperate situation in Delhi, with no help forthcoming from any quarter. With home collection of samples for Covid tests declining rapidly, apparently due to the load created by the huge surge in cases, families with elderly people and children are struggling the most. Kalkaji resident Himanshi told TOI, “While, my 15-year-old son seems fine now after having fever for two days, my husband and I are still unwell. But not one of the labs nearby that I called has come, only told us we will have to wait at least three days.” It was worse for Vishal Tyagi, who lives in Ashok Vihar. He finally managed to get a response from a lab for home collection, but will have to wait for eight days. Shruti Das in central Delhi is as frustrated. “My mother has been feverish for five days. She is old and I cannot take her to the hospital,” she said. “One of the labs said it would take up bookings only after April 26 as its system had collapsed. Another told us someone would come only if there were more than five patients in the area. This is really a matter of big concern for a family caught in an emergency.” Helpless, Sujit Kumar, a professor at Delhi University, has knocked on almost every door possible to find out if tests can be arranged for his two children. “My wife and I we are infected. Her oxygen level has been fluctuating so she is admitted in a hospital,” the Mukherjee Nagar resident said. “I am worried about sending my kids to stand in queues outside hospitals because there is a rush for tests. Why cannot the government set up mobile vans like last time for carrying out tests?” Rajesh Upad lives in the same neighbourhood in Mukherjee Nagar. There is just one testing centre at Dhaka village for the entire area, he pointed out. “It has the capacity to test 50 people, but on any given day more than 500 people turn up, waiting in lines for a long time, to get themselves tested,” said Upad, who has worried about the sore throat he and other members of his family have been suffering from. Since they have no test result to be certain about positivity, they have been routinely taking the medicines usually prescribed for Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/home-truth-getting-tested-a-huge-challenge/articleshow/82222927.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Agra||UP panchayat elections: Five members of a family elected unopposed in Mathura||AGRA: In a surprising and rare development in the ongoing panchayat elections in the state, five members of a family were elected unopposed in Mathura, where elections are scheduled to be held on April 29. They have received the certificates of becoming area panchayat members in Govardhan sub-division from the State Election Commission of UP. The family has a history of being in public life, and different members have held village administrative posts in the past. Talking to TOI, Preetam Singh, 47, said that this was the first time when five members of his family have been elected in such a manner. “My wife Laxmi Devi, 40, I, and three brothers — Narendra Pratap, 50, Harendra Pratap, 38, and Vipin, 36 -- have won the polls without even contesting,” he said. His mother Harnandi Devi and brother Harendra were elected area panchayat members unopposed in 2010. “Our family is involved in social work. During lockdown, we distributed food packets to many people, sanitised several areas and helped people in every manner,” said Preetam who runs a cold storage facility, a degree college and also dabbles in real estate. Singh’s three brothers are associated in different fields. His two younger brothers -- Lt Col Swaroop Singh and Major Sachin Singh are posted in Bhopal and Agra respectively, while another brother, Rasal, is a professor in Jammu Central University. “We all are serving our country in different ways,” he said. Preetam had been elected pradhan of the village Pali Doongra in 1995 and 2000. He had also contested assembly elections in 2012 but lost. His mother had been pradhan of Pali Doongra in 2005 and block pramukh in Govardhan from 2010 to 2015. “Our aim is to work for the welfare of the people and the whole family has been doing this for years'', he said. Preetam’s wife Laxmi is a post-graduate in English and had contested election for the first time. Vipin, who is post-graduate in Hindi, said his family’s agenda is development and helping people in crisis. “We have started distributing sanitisers and if required we will distribute food packets too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-panchayat-elections-five-members-of-a-family-elected-unopposed-in-mathura/articleshow/82221289.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Yet, the district health department, with its figures, is painting an altogether different picture. According to the figures released by administration, Bharuch so far registered 5998 Covid-19 cases and the death toll due to pandemic is 49. The ground report though is starkly different. In all 25 dead bodies were cremated, inside a period of 24 hours prior to Friday noon, at the designated Covid crematorium in Bharuch, informed a social worker who is helping out in the last rites of deceased. K V Patel, plant head of Jhagadia-based Vardhman Acrylics, Shantaram Dorik of J P Group of Industries, Vishnubhai Patel of Meet Industries, Ashmaben Sheikh, councillor of Bharuch Municipality, congress leader Bhaskar Bhatt and assistant sub inspector Mahendra Shinde are some of the prominent figures who have succumbed to the deadly virus in last five days. The district administration has started Covid Care Centres (CCC) at Bharuch, Gadkhol and Dahej. Bharuch being an industrial town, oxygen availability is not an issue. However, availability of beds in both the government as well as private hospitals is a major issue. Industrial associations come forward to help The Industries associations of Ankleshwar, Vilayat, Jhagadia and Dahej are extending support to the district administration in the fight against Covid. Associations have helped the administration in setting up oxygen facilities at Covid Care Centres (CCC) at Government Engineering College and also in installation of 10,000 litres oxygen cryogenic tank at ESIC hospital at Ankleshwar. State PSU GNFC and Aditya Birla group’s Birla Copper, Linde, and other smaller units are helping out in supply of oxygen across the state. Industrial associations have also helped in setting up of CCCs at Sultanpura, Avidha, Karetha, Netrang, Valia and Dadheda villages of Jhagadia. They have also helped in providing ventilators and oxygen facilities for the 48-bed CCC at Dahej Welfare Hospital, which will be operational from Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bharuch-death-toll-continues-to-rise/articleshow/82221291.cms||---

However, owners of wedding halls in Dehradun, Rishikesh and Haridwar say that almost 80% of the bookings have now been cancelled at their venues. Bhavishya Pandit, owner of a wedding point in Haridwar said, “Several of our bookings between April 20 and May 8 now stand cancelled as people are now booking hotels for small gatherings.” Chandra Kant Purohit, a resident of Sahastradhara Road in Dehradun, said, “My sister's wedding is to be held on April 24. The current guidelines mandate us to reduce our guest list to 100 guests. Anticipating this cap to be curtailed further, I spoke to the wedding point owner to reduce the cost of the entire event.” Apoorv Bhandari, another wedding point owner from Rishikesh, said, “We hoped that this year would be better for business but the surge in infections has once again dented chances of recovery. Destination marriages have been cancelled completely as parties from Delhi, Chandigarh have cancelled their bookings.” Manoj Agarwal, a wedding point owner from Dehradun, added, “We have so far been able to pay salaries to our staff but we don't know how long will we able to continue this.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Ward war rooms get over 74k calls in 21 days of April, 2nd highest in 11 months||MUMBAI: In 21 days of April, the 24 civic ward war rooms have attended to 74,317 calls from Covid patients and their relatives wanting a hospital bed, ambulance or a quarantine facility, second only to the 1 lakh calls received in May last year. The April call-load is already 150% more than in March, when 30,096 calls were attended to. Incidentally, officials manning the civic war rooms also have to make calls to each of the patients whose RT-PCR report is positive; with over 7,000 patients testing positive daily, each war room has its task cut out every morning. Senior officials said they did expect a rise in calls this month as cases started to spike. “The team strength at war rooms was reduced when call numbers started dropping in December 2020 and January. But when cases increased once again, teachers, doctors and civic staff were asked to get into action,’’ said an official. The work is not as simple as attending to a call; the war room team has to first conduct a telephonic triage to understand how ill the caller/patient is. “Our doctors have to seek more details and advise the patient accordingly. Not all patients who call up for ICU bed need it. There are times when panicky relatives start arguing with us and we have to pacify them,” said the official. In case of patients calling up the ward war rooms between 11pm and 7am whose report has not arrived or whose Covid test is still not done but who has symptoms, they are entitled for allotment of beds in jumbo field hospitals in the suspected category of beds. A medical health officer said home quarantined patients call asking doctors to prescribe them medication. “We tell them to first contact their general physician. Some ask for guidelines on home quarantine, the quarantine centre nearest to their home or antiviral remdesivir,” said the health officer. However, there also are complaints about the working of war rooms. Colaba corporator Makrand Narwekar said: “We urgently needed an ambulance to take a positive patient to St George’s Hospital near CSMT. But when after repeated calls to the war room, we got no response we had to move the patient in a private vehicle.” Goregaon corporator Sandeep Patel said there is a huge load on the war room staff as well. “Everyone is working hard in this pandemic. But sometimes there is no response on the phone number circulated. Once we found out that the MTNL number itself was not functional. This sends out a very wrong message,” he said. Some corporators have stopped relying on war rooms and directly check with the medical officers for a hospital bed for patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ward-war-rooms-get-over-70k-calls-in-21-days-of-april-2nd-highest-in-11-mths/articleshow/82222956.cms||Richa Pinto

The portal is not responding to online requests of students for getting their documents. Students from abroad and in India who used the portal said that it’s not responding and the facility exists only on paper. The online system is no better than offline one in which they have to wait. For getting urgent documents like degree, migration and provisional certificates required for admission, jobs and internship, the students are calling up numbers available on varsity website as the portal is unable to get hands-on the documents required. “I had to submit my PG degree for PhD admission at the University of Bern, Switzerland. I have got the scholarship but since the degree is not in my hand I can’t take things forward,” said a Delhi resident Ratnendra Pandey. He said that “I applied for it on EASE in January and now it’s over three months and have still not received it. They couldn’t even provide a provisional degree ,which takes less time.” A former LU student based in Saudi Arabia needs his PG degree for the continuation of his job contract, but according to him even after paying online and sending around Rs 5,000 to a clerk to help him get his marksheet he couldn’t get the required document. “When the online system failed to help me, I contacted at LU examination department and made the online payment now they are saying that since my chart cannot be tracked they won’t be able to make my marksheet. They should have communicated the same to me earlier. LU’s controlled of examination AM Saxena said, “We will take rectify the glitch soon so that students don’t face problems.

The team of six women hasn’t taken a single day’s leave after they donned the warrior’s suit to wage a war against the virus their way — making RT-PCR kits for Covid-19 detection. The all-women’s team working with Cosara Diagnostics Pvt Ltd (CDPL) since April last year, has made over 20 lakh RT-PCR kits. “Our team has been making the kits manually and gradually our capacity has increased. From 8,000 per day last year, we now make about 40,000 ‘reactions’ per day,” said Dr Swapnali Kulkarni, senior manager, technical services, CDPL. Her team includes Kesha Parikh, officer production, Julie Tahilramani, officer QA, Kirti Joshi, officer QC, Dr Jinitha Varghese, officer R&D and Janki Dalwadi officer R&D. Four of them are working in the production department and two in research and development. CDPL, established in 2019, is owned by the Sarabhai Group that has entered into a joint venture with US-based Co-Diagnostics Ltd and has its manufacturing unit in Ranoli. “When the pandemic began last year, we were uncertain about how to handle it. But the scare couldn’t pervade our enthusiasm and fortunately all of us also had full support from our families. We had decided to make as many kits as possible as the demand for test was high,” Kulkarni told TOI. “We were one of the first companies to supply the RT-PCR kits to Gujarat government when the pandemic began last year. Apart from Gujarat, we have supplied kits to Telangana, Hyderabad, Delhi, Karnataka and Maharashtra,” said Chaula Shastri, director, Sarabhai Group. The firm also makes test kits for hepatitis, chikungunya and other viruses. “We are proud of our all-women team as they have worked very hard over last one year. They don’t just make the kits but also provide technical support to the government and private labs that buy our product,” said Shastri, adding that the firm is planning to ramp up its production and make seven to eight lakh kits per month.

He had immediately issued a video statement confirming that he was hale and hearty. “One of my MLA friends called up and informed me about such a message doing the rounds in their area. Soon more MLAs started calling up and I realized that now this thing (message) has gone viral. Panic spread among many of my relatives and well wishers, but fortunately we were able to counter that very quickly,” said Sawarkar. The video message of Sawarkar denying the fake news was forwarded zealously by his supporters to multiple groups. “Within an hour we were able to convince everyone that it was just a rumour,” said Sawarkar. “Somebody has done this with malicious intent and I hope such people are punished by the law,” the BJP MLA added. Later in the day, a police complaint was filed by Sawarkar regarding this issue. A member of Sawarkar’s team told TOI that they have named a person in their report. “We have named the person from whom we got the message. He too had received it from someone, and police will look into the chain of messages by back tracking to the original source,” said the source in Sawarkar’s team. Sawarkar says there should be strict laws against such activities. “It’s sad that people are indulging in all this when the entire country is in the grip of Covid-19.

The CM also urged the PM to ensure “easy accessibility” to drug Remdesivir, and pushed for the immediate commissioning of an integrated vaccine complex in Chengalpet, a Union government project. Tamil Nadu had administered 47.31 lakh doses and is expected to continue to inoculate two lakh people a day, the CM said in his letter to Modi. The letter was released minutes before the PM was to hold a video conference with CMs. Tamil Nadu chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan represented the state government at the meeting. Hours after the meet, senior bureaucrats led by Rajeev Ranjan met the CM at his Greenways Road residence and apprised him of the developments. The meeting lasted 40 minutes. “The discussion with the CM was more on strengthening Covid care centres, oxygen supply and diversion of health workers wherever required. The state is planning to impose further restrictions without affecting economic activities. It could be announced on Saturday,” sources said. In his letter the PM the CM said, “It has come to the notice that directions are being issued by national and certain state regulators, prioritizing supplies by individual manufacturers to certain states and restricting Remdesivir sales only within the state where it is being produced.” This would be very damaging to the availability of such valuable life saving drugs in places of need, he said. At this stage, any restrictive orders by individual states, should be strictly barred to ensure easy accessibility of Remdesivir. “I urge the Government of India to take up this issue with such states where the companies have their production facilities located,” the CM said. The integrated vaccine complex in Chengalpet is ready and awaits commissioning and validation, the CM said. “I am informed that this would be possible if some pending work can be fasttracked. I would appeal to you to bring this facility to working condition at the earliest to augment the production of Covid vaccines,” the CM said. The state had reduced vaccine wastage to below 5% and fixed a target of bringing it further down to 3%, since the wastage has an impact on getting more vaccines from the Centre. At least 20 people could be administered vaccines from each vial of Covaxin, and 10 from a vial of Covishield. Since the public avoided vaccination in the initial stages of the vaccination programme, and only five or six people dropped in until the end of the day, the remaining doses got wasted. A vial should be used within four hours of opening it. Now with people above 45 years coming for vaccination from April 1, and the plan is to administer to all above 18 years from May 1, the state government hopes that wastage could be avoided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cm-seeks-20-lakh-vax-doses-access-to-remdesivir-from-pm-more-curbs-likely/articleshow/82222113.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Hyderabad||20 percent younger population among all Covid-19 victims in Telangana||HYDERABAD: The elderly and those with comorbidities are always at a higher risk of contracting Covid-19, but data obtained from the Directorate of Public Health and Family Welfare shows how younger groups — 21-30 years and 31-40 years — are increasingly falling prey to the deadly virus and turning more serious with an extended hospital stay. "While we are seeing more deaths in senior citizens and those with comorbidities even during the second wave, the infection rate and death rate in the younger population is more this year when compared to last year and it is something that needs to be investigated,” said Dr Shashidhar Reddy, a senior doctor at Gandhi Hospital. A look at the data on February 15, February 23, March 15, April 1 and April 23, shows when the new infections were 99, 114, 157, 965 and 6,206, respectively, the percentage of exposure to the virus in the age group 21-30 years, and 31-40 years was over 20%, which is comparatively higher compared to other groups. The data revealed by the health department for the last five days also revealed that the 21 to 30 years and 31 to 40 years age group recorded 22% positive cases, which is the highest compared to other age groups in the state. "The younger population that steps out of their homes for work and meets more people on a day-to-day basis has more chances of contracting the virus. Also, many people are still not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing, which has contributed to the rise in cases," said Raghu Ram, director, KIMS Ushalakshmi center for breast cancer. “All it takes for the virus to spread is just one person. They can be super spreaders,” he said. Doctors said the reason for many people getting infected this year compared to last year could be that the current strain is more severe and the younger lot are yet to be protected by vaccination. “The Covid trajectory is definitely seeing a shift from the elderly to the younger group. One reason could be that they are yet to be protected by vaccination and second is they might not be following Covid-appropriate behaviour after the number of cases began declining after the first wave,” said V Vamshi, a doctor working in the Covid-19 ward at Gandhi Hospital. While most of patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, there have also been cases of serious infections and deaths among patients in thirties in last few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/20-percent-younger-population-among-all-covid-19-victims-in-telangana/articleshow/82222121.cms||Moulika.KV

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Government-formed panel recommends 'less use of Remdesivir to overcome double mutant’||Dehradun: A government-formed committee comprising doctors and citizens has recommended less use of Remdesivir and change in treatment strategy to overcome the ‘double mutant’ variant. The committee said treatment protocols must be changed to tackle the 'double mutant' variant of the virus, which is believed to be present in Uttarakhand since late March. The B.1.167 ‘double mutant’ variant of SARS-CoV-2 is said to be highly transmissible and infects those who have been immunised. It is believed to have caused the recent spike in cases in the hill state. According to the committee, headed by professor Hem Chandra, VC of Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Uttarakhand Medical Education University and Dr Ashutosh Sayana, principal of Government Doon Medical College along with director general (health) Dr Tripti Bahuguna, the spread of coronavirus in the state is "increasing with great speed and so is the mortality of Covid pneumonia patients". “The peak of Covid is due to a sudden burst of cluster cases which is responsible for increase in mortality. It is also because of delay in diagnosis and treatment and in transportation of patients to better healthcare facilities,” says the panel report. The report also maintains, "It has been proved that there are limited indications of use of injection Remdesivir whose use doesn't reduce the mortality". "Hence, the drug should not be used in every Covid patient. This injection is indicated only in moderate Covid cases with SPO2 less than or equal to 94 percent and duration of illness is 9 to 10 from disease onset, as per the early treatment protocol. Doses to be given are 40mg IV followed by 100mg IV on day 2 to day 5. There is no need to extend this treatment beyond this,” the report adds. The panel also stated that even if RT-PCR report is negative, but the patient has Covid-like symptoms, the treatment for coronavirus must start immediately. The government should increase testing as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-formed-panel-recommends-less-use-of-remdesivir-to-overcome-double-mutant/articleshow/82221308.cms||Ishita Mishra

As many as 60 people were rewarded and within three months, people stopped disposing waste on roads. We have now removed garbage bins from public places. We have e-vehicles to collect garbage from doorsteps. Sanitary workers segregate it into dry and wet waste before disposing it scientifically. Works are going on to turn wet waste into compost,” he told TOI.There is an orchard, a Miyawaki forest and a nursery spread over 3.75 acres at Muthalipalayam village, Kandavel said. “We turned a barren land into fertile land. Initially when we decided to plant saplings there, we received a lot of discouragement. But now people are surprised. We spent Rs 29 lakh to turn the area into a green zone.” In 2016, DRDA set up a nursery with 11 beds to grow 12,000 saplings. Two years later, 500 saplings of fruit trees, 2,400 saplings of nochi plant and another 350 tree saplings were planted. “The orchard now has guava, pomegranate, lemon, almond, custard apple and prickly custard apple. The Miyawaki forest has pencil bamboo, rosemary, sandalwood and magilam,” the official said. Fruits from the orchards are given to MGNREGA workers who are maintaining the gardens. Earlier, fruits were distributed among school students, Kandavel said. “Work to supply potable and non-potable water to houses has commenced. Achankulam lake was desilted and restored a couple of years ago. Whenever it rains, it brims with water. Over 70% of roads have been laid and work to lay remaining roads is under process. Pending applications to obtain electricity and water connection were cleared. Taxes were paid without arrears,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/muthugoundenpudur-panchayat-bags-coveted-national-award/articleshow/82222137.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Irdai said it has come across reports of certain network hospitals charging high rates and insisting on cash payments from policyholders for providing treatment to Covid-19 infected patients despite having cashless arrangement with insurers. “Insurers are advised to report levying of excess charges or denial of cashless facility to the respective state governments for appropriate action,” Irdai said in its latest circular on Friday. While reviewing cashless requests, Irdai has told insurers to ensure that policyholders are charged as per the rates agreed to by network hospitals. “Insurers are also advised to ensure hospitals do not levy any additional charges for same treatment other than those rates agreed upon with the insurers,” it added. Meanwhile, Irdai has also urged network hospitals to “rise to the occasion” and provide cashless treatment to policyholders for all treatments covered by the insurance policy, including Covid-19. It also requested hospitals not to differentiate between patients who have insurance and those who do not have one. “A gesture of this nature on the part of hospitals in these difficult times will reinforce the confidence of the public in the healthcare system including health insurance and build trust,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/irdai-tells-insurers-to-complain-about-errant-hosps/articleshow/82222133.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Goa||Goa: Margao council polls register 64% turnout||MARGAO: Polling for 25 seats of the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) held on Friday recorded 64.25% voter turnout. The polls which weren’t officially conducted on party lines, however, saw Congress, BJP and GFP fielding its panels, with altogether 115 candidates in the fray, including independents and others. The election to the Margao municipality is viewed among political circles as a high-stakes battle as its outcome would help enable the political parties to gauge the measure of their popularity among the voters ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. As in the 2015 Margao civic polls, Margao MLA Digambar Kamat and GFP have forged an alliance this time too. In the 11 wards coming under Fatorda constituency, it’s a battle for political survival for both GFP president and Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai and ex-MLA and BJP general secretary Damodar Naik. While GFP had won all 11 seats in the last civic elections, any significant loss in seats for the regional outfit this time is likely to put Sardesai in a vulnerable position ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. Conversely, if BJP wrests some seats from GFP this time, it would only add to BJP’s arsenal in the battle for 2022 assembly polls, propelling Naik to a forward position. Not surprisingly, while Sardesai almost single-handedly led the campaign for all his 13 candidates fielded under Fatorda Forward panel – 11 in Fatorda and 2 in Curtorim constituency, Naik vigorously led the BJP campaign in Fatorda undertaking some significant social engineering initiatives. Significantly, Fatorda block Congress also fielded candidates in several wards of Fatorda, thereby posing a challenge to the Kamat-Sardesai alliance. In the rest 11 wards coming under Margao constituency, it’s likely to be a close contest in several wards between Kamat-backed Model Margao panel and BJP-supported Vibrant Margao. Kamat criss-crossed the town during the campaign in favour of the 11 candidates, and though this has placed Congress in a fairly comfortable position, the BJP has spared no effort in its bid to wrest control of the civic body. Shadow Council for Margao has also fielded candidates in 8 wards on its Citizens Choice panel. “The outcome of the MMC elections,” as a political observer put it, “will be decisive as it has the potential to alter the political contours of the state”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-council-polls-register-64-turnout/articleshow/82223019.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Shortage of oxygen & beds continues to devastate families||Lucknow: The acute shortage of hospital beds and oxygen continued to claim more lives on Friday. Ajay Kumar Singh, a post-doctoral fellow in the Urdu department of Lucknow University and a resident of Aryanagar, lost his battle for life on Thursday night after he was denied admission by several hospitals citing shortage of oxygen. The 33-year-old research scholar had started treatment at home after developing Covid-19 symptoms six days ago. “He developed breathlessness in the morning. As his condition deteriorated rapidly, he started gasping for breath. The family approached several hospitals but all refused admission saying they don’t have beds with oxygen support,” said Ajay’s mentor, Prof Abbas Raza Nayyar, who himself called several healthcare facilities but got no success. “We lost a good scholar with extraordinary skills. He also edited several poetry books written by me,” he said. “We kept pleading with the hospital staff with folded hands to provide him some emergency medical care but all of them refused saying that no beds are vacant,” said an inconsolable Charu, wife of Ajay. Married two years ago, the couple had lost their only son, who was just three-month-old, to a congenital heart disease. Another Covid-19 patient, Anand Mishra (51), died at his residence in Chinhat waiting for the Integrated Covid Command Control Centre’s call for hospital allotment. Mishra’s son Anadi arranged an oxygen cylinder at home but on Friday morning, the patient’s blood oxygen level dropped below 50. “We visited several hospitals in the area but could not find any bed with oxygen support,” Anadi said. Similarly, 56-year-old SC Srivastava died at home during the wee hours of Friday. “As beds were not available, we provided him life support by arranging oxygen at home. On Thursday, he had to stay without oxygen for three hours as we could not get a refill on time. Though oxygen was restored later, his condition did not improve,” said Sharad, younger brother of Srivastava. 3 days after patient’s death, kin get call for hosp bed: Three days after Raj Kumar Rastogi (59) died due to Covid-19 at RSM hospital after waiting to be shifted to a hospital with a ventilator facility, his family received a call from the ICCC on Friday informing that their request for allotment of bed at a superspecialty hospital has been approved by the health department. “I received a call from the ICCC in the afternoon. The caller told me that now we can shift our patient to a bigger facility for better care,” Rastorgi’s son Swapnil told TOI. “The request was made on Monday when doctors at RSM Hospital told us that my father urgently needs to be shifted to a superspeciality hospital, but nothing happened. He died a day later,” he added. He told the ICCC staff to save a life by allotting the bed to a needy patient at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shortage-of-oxygen-beds-continues-to-devastate-families/articleshow/82222960.cms||---

As many as 60 sellers opened stalls at the new market on Friday.The decision was taken to reduce the number of people at the market and to ensure sufficient space to maintain distance between them. The corporation has also deployed officials to enforce Covid-19 guidelines. A penalty of Rs 200 is slapped on violators.Of the 163 flower sellers paying rent to the corporation, 60 have shifted to the new market, said Durai, joint secretary of Kovai District Flower Merchant Association. “Corporation officials had asked us to put up stalls on rotation basis. But such a move would put both sellers and farmers in distress because cut flowers could not be stored for a long time. When we expressed our grievance, officials allowed us to use the new market,” he said.But only 10% of the walk-in customers visited the new market as they were not aware of it, said Ganesh, a flower seller. “Usually, I give flowers to regular customers on a credit basis and they settle it later. I did not see them today and I don’t know whether they visited the market. I don’t know when I will collect the credit amount.”“Corporation officials warned us of closing the market if social distancing norms are not followed. I don’t know if the footfall will increase. It would be better if the corporation allows us to move to a school ground like last year, where all of us can do business together and follow Covid-19 guidelines,” Ganesh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-reopens-new-flower-market-to-check-crowding/articleshow/82222132.cms||---

This is the second time that the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) recorded more than 1000 daily cases eve since the pandemic broke in March 2020. During the first wave, GHMC had highest number of 1,658 cases on July 4. Experts warn that the situation could become more dangerous this year. After the peak in July last year, cases saw a quick dip with the highest number of cases a day around 500 in August. This year, however, they feel cases might even cross 2,000-mark in GHMC limits. In fact, that cases have doubled in just one week in GHMC. “It is not surprising that GHMC is showing an increase in cases in the second wave. There is huge density of population here. Crowds can be seen gathered without any Covid protocol — like wearing masks and social distancing. This is only compounding the problem. A further increase will put more pressure on the hospital infrastructure. Covid-appropriate behavior is crucial at this time of crisis. The only good news is that the recovery rate is still high and vaccine coverage is increasing,” said Dr Subodh Kandamuthan, professor and director, Centre for Health Care Management Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI). In spite of increasing cases, the number micro-containment zones have come down from 70 to 52 in GHMC in last 24 hours. If a building has five cases, it is considered a ‘house cluster’ and if an area has more than five to 10 cases it is a ‘micro-containment’ zone. However, no barricades are being set up at the containment zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-sees-1005-covid-19-cases-on-course-for-new-record-experts/articleshow/82222129.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Jagtap pointed out that at a time when there is acute shortage of the drug, a leading firm was found indulging in hoarding and black-marketing of the injection in connivance with BJP leaders. “When police summoned the owner of the firm, opposition leaders Devendra Fadnavis and Praveen Darekar, and legislators Parag Alwani and Prasad Lad stormed into the police station to rescue the firm owner. We demand that along with the firm owner, BJP leaders too be investigated,” Jagtap said in his letter to Walse Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-seeks-sit-probe-against-bjp-netas-firm/articleshow/82223090.cms||---
---||Nagpur||O2 Exp chugs in with 48MT, stock may last 2 days||Nagpur: The first Oxygen Express carrying 48 metric tonne oxygen rolled into the city on Friday, mitigating the daily shortfall of around 20-25MT. The stock is likely to tide over the crisis for at least two days. The authorities remained on tenterhooks as a refilling plant at MIDC developed a snag, leading to some tense hours before it was fixed. The administration is now hoping that another 100MT of oxygen reaches the city from Rourkela as planned on Saturday, to meet the ever-increasing demand in the district. The district administration sources claimed oxygen production in city has a maximum capacity of filling around 13,750 jumbo cylinders, of which 10,500 have already been utilized. With the rising numbers of Covid cases and increase in beds, city hospitals would face graver oxygen shortage if they fail to adopt self-generation techniques.Top doctors and hospital managements have already started devising strategies and techniques, like ‘Oxygen titration protocols’ and deployment of ‘Oxygen stewards’, to tackle the oxygen shortfall. This has hit them as hard as the shortage of crucial anti-viral drugs Remdesivir and Tocilizumab.After 62% hospital beds were allotted Remdesivir a day ago, the district administration could only distribute the drug to 43% beds on Friday, when 4,094 vials reached the district from various pharmaceutical companies. Late on Friday, the Central Railway Nagpur division’s Oxygen Express, which had started from Vishakhapatnam, brought seven liquid oxygen tankers of Inox Air Products on ‘Roll On-Roll off’ (Ro-Ro) basis. While three were off-loaded at Nagpur railway station’s platform number eight, the other four headed to Nashik.The arrival of Oxygen Express eased the tension of district administration after Jubilee Plant at MIDC stopped operations for the second time in last 48 hours. Though the plant was repaired and production resumed, the pending re-filling work had pushed up anxiety levels at several hospitals. District collector Ravindra Thakare on Friday visited oxygen production plants at Butibori and Hinga. He asked them to follow fire safety guidelines and measures to avoid major industrial accidents. Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious diseases specialist, said Alexis Multispecialty Hospital is following ‘oxygen titration’ protocols by deploying ‘oxygen stewards’. This comprises bio-medical experts and nurse, to check the requirements of patients, detect wastage and leakage, apart from various other regulations for optimum and judicious use of oxygen. “Our new normal of oxygen level is 92-93% as against the earlier standard of 96-97%,” said Shinde. “We also make patients sleep in prone position, which saves some more oxygen.” Dr Shantanu Sengupta of Sengupta Hospital also said the position is ‘tight’ as far as oxygen cylinders are concerned. “Government should cap prices of oxygen concentrators and make it available at subsidized rates. We are also now talking to a Tamil Nadu company to help us set up our own oxygen generation plant,” he said.Dr Rajesh Atal, critical care specialist, too said the new revised oxygen normalcy is 92-93%, which was higher earlier. “We have stopped high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) as per the guidelines and also shifted to the use of bi-pap,” he said.Dr Mohan Gaikwad Patil of Covidalaya Hospital, Jamtha, said that he had begun sending several trips to refill oxygen cylinders with fewer cylinders, instead of all together. So, if the vehicle is held up for delays or other reasons, then the hospital does not run out of stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/o2-exp-chugs-in-with-48mt-stock-may-last-2-days/articleshow/82222145.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Coimbatore||District records 889 fresh cases||Coimbatore: The district recorded the highest-ever single-day spike in Covid-19 cases on Friday, when 889 people were declared positive for the virus. It is almost 20% higher than the previous high of 735 fresh cases that the district reported during the first wave on April 19. It is also the third highest single-day spike that is reported by a district on the day, after Chennai and Chengelpet.Given that 9,971 samples were subjected to Covid-19 testing in the district as on Tuesday evening, the positivity rate stood at 8.9%. The Covid-19 tally, meanwhile, zoomed past another grim milestone of 71,000-mark to 71,161 on the day. While 64,621 patients have recovered so far, the recovery rate has further dipped to 90.8% in the district, majorly because of the continuous spike in the cases in the past couple of weeks. The number of active cases also increased to 5,830 on the day, as, at 419, the number of patients who were discharged from treatment centres was far less than the number of fresh cases.The toll remained static at 710, as the district didn’t report any Covid death on the day. To handle the growing number of active cases, the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) had increased its bed allotment to Covid-19 patients to 865 on Saturday from the earlier 555. In fact, the CMCH did so on the district administration’s request.The health department has ensured availability of another 1,072 beds in the private sector. To ensure beds to the needy, the district is also encouraging home quarantine of asymptomatic patients. There are 886 people in home isolation presently, compared to 200-odd people earlier in the week.On a positive note, 8,764 people were vaccinated in the district on the day. It had received 46,000 doses of Covishield on Wednesday. The district storage unit has also become more liberal in distributing Covaxin to government hospitals. CMCH had received a stock of almost 500 doses earlier in the week.

In her complaint, the woman said her husband was an alcoholic and having illicit affairs with many women. “On March 27, 2021, he consumed liquor at his residence and made the three-year-old daughter to drink the same. Later, he sexually assaulted her. When his wife questioned him, he kicked her on her abdomen and assaulted her. The woman immediately alerted the Salem city police control room and her husband escaped from the house,” the SI said quoting the complainant. On April 14, he returned home, forced the daughter to consume alcohol and sexually assaulted her again. “This time too, he thrashed his wife when she questioned him and locked her in a room. She, however, managed to come out of the room on April 16 and informed her parents, who are residing in Coimbatore city. They subsequently rescued her along with her daughter,” the officer said.Based on the woman’s complaint, the Sooramangalam all-women police registered a case against her husband under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 343 (wrongful restraint), 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code, Section 77 of the Juvenile Justice (care and protection of children) Act and Sections 5 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. He was arrested on Friday and remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-arrested-for-sexually-abusing-3-yr-old-daughter/articleshow/82222146.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: ICU beds run out with influx of critical Covid patients||HYDERABAD: The influx of critical Covid-19 patients at government hospitals has been so intense in the past few days that after Gandhi Hospital, ICU beds at all the other government and private hospitals in GHMC limits, and other worst-hit districts, are also filling up fast. The live bed availability tracking link, which was launched by the Telangana health department, showed that in most hospitals ICU beds with ventilators were occupied. The situation is leaving patients and their family members running from pillar to post in search of either oxygen or ICU beds. J Pavan, who was waiting outside Gandhi Hospital on Friday morning, said, “We came to Hyderabad six days ago and admitted my father in a private hospital in Uppal. After two days of treatment, they discharged the patient saying that they are short of oxygen and beds. From there, we came to Gandhi. Here, it took us a day to just take my father from the ambulance to the ward because they did not have enough beds and also had only one oxygen cylinder which was being used to take all the patients into the ICU wards.” Similar scenes played out at the Government Chest Hospital in Erragadda and Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) which are witnessing a heavy demand for ICU admissions for Covid-19 patients, allegedly due to many private hospitals attempting to abruptly shift critical patients to government hospitals. With ICU beds almost full at the facilities, doctors there are in a spot as they are forced to turn away family members unless an ICU bed is vacated. “Those who come here are mostly from poor backgrounds, we cannot even ask the family members to take the patients to a private hospital. We have oxygen beds available but there are not enough ICU beds,” said a doctor at TIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/icu-beds-run-out-with-influx-of-critical-covid-patients/articleshow/82222149.cms||Moulika.KV

Traders of many markets have now written to the lieutenant governor and the chief minister to extend it beyond April 26. On Friday evening, 35 market associations of Delhi held a meeting to discuss the matter and it was agreed that the traders would themselves keep the markets shut for a few more days as the situation was getting worse and breaking the chain of infection was important. In the wake of a high Covid positivity rate — it stood at 32% on Friday — and highly deteriorating medical facilities in Delhi, “we have requested LG Anil Baijal and CM Arvind Kejriwal for extending the lockdown”, said Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) secretary general Praveen Khandelwal. Traders said they were fully aware that any lockdown would cause great financial losses to them and the economy of Delhi, yet they were suggesting it to save lives. To protect people of Delhi from any further spread of Covid, it is important to prevent them from meeting physically, they pointed out. “At least 80 traders were present at the meeting and it was mutually decided that we will keep the shops closed even after the weeklong shutdown. However, it would be good if the LG or Delhi government issues the order because people will then strictly abide by the norms,” said Devraj Baweja of Sadar Bazar Traders Association. They agreed that the present situation in Delhi was highly chaotic and grim and, therefore, calling for more strict measures along with the lockdown to break the chain of infection was required. “Even if we open the shops from Monday, there won’t be any customer. People are so fearful that they don’t want to get out of their houses. Unlike last year, the double mutant of novel coronavirus is highly infectious and people are getting infected easily. So going to market means getting yourself exposed to chances of getting infected,” said Vipin Ahuja, chairman of Ashok Vihar Vyapar Mandal. Businessmen have already faced crucial losses in the past one year and don’t even have resources to get their families and workers treated, he claimed. Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said the majority of labourers had left for their hometown and it wouldn’t be possible to conduct business activities without them. “Some hawkers are still putting stalls. It is important that the government implements norms strictly and take a decision on the lockdown during the weekend,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/safety-first-despite-heavy-losses-traders-want-lockdown-extended/articleshow/82222993.cms||Vibha Sharma

We have been maintaining the OSR land for the last 40 years and using it for community celebrations. Elderly people and children use it regularly,” he told TOI.“All of a sudden, a real estate promoter claimed ownership of the land and performed bhoomi pooja to construct a building there. We staged a protest and submitted a petition to the city corporation. Officials reached the spot and after verifying documents, installed a board at the site stating that the land belongs to the corporation and warning encroachers of action.”Activist S P Thiyagarajan lauded the corporation for swift action. “Usually, corporation officials are reluctant to initiate action even if people submit several petitions. The civic body should install such boards on all OSR sites to deter encroachers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/attempt-to-encroach-land-foiled-at-sri-moogambigai-nagar/articleshow/82222139.cms||---

C Srinivasulu, zoologist of OU Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Studies, said it was a critically endangered bat in India which was known to have been found only from Hanumanhalli Betta in Mulbagal area.  “A spectrogram had shown echolocation calls typical of Kolar roundleaf bat along with calls typical of Cantor’s roundleaf bat,” he said. Cantor’s bat is found in Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. Srinivasulu said the Kolar roundleaf bat was chanced upon in 1994 during accidental collection of bats for screening virus loads among bats in India. “This species was wrongly identified and later found to be an undescribed species. A scientific description was provided in 1994 and a research paper mentioned that the species was found only in two places -- Hanumanhalli Betta and Therahalli,” said Srinivasulu. A team of bat researchers from OU took up a study in mid-2014. “We have confirmed that the species exists and was known to exist only in Hanumanahalli. We did not detect its presence in Therahalli. In the last seven years, we have been regularly conducting surveys at both the places and we failed to detect the presence of the species at Therahalli,” he recalled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ou-experts-find-critically-endangered-species-of-bat/articleshow/82222155.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

They say long queues at several centres is a cause of concern. “There is utter chaos at some centres as people have doubled in the last 10 days. At our centre only 100 people used to come for testing at the end of March. Now, more than 200 people come. There is no social distancing and sometimes those who come for vaccination are at risk,” said a government official. Iqbal Ahmed, a retired teacher, said, “I went to Nampally vaccine centre on Thursday with my brother.

---||Pune||Pvt hospitals in civic limits face acute vaccine crunch||Pune: Private hospitals in Pune civic limits reported an acute shortage of Covishield doses, with many beneficiaries not being able to get their first or second dose on Friday.According to the District Health Office report, the civic body was left with around 9,091 doses of Covishield on Friday.A PMC official said that due to unavailability of doses, they could not distribute the vaccine to many private hospitals. “We had demanded two lakh Covishield doses, and all we got on Thursday were 10,000 doses. How can we continue with the vaccination drive?” wondered an official.Manjusha Kulkarni, secretary, Association of Private Hospitals, Pune, told TOI, “The vaccine dose availability situation is pretty bad at present. On Friday, many hospitals had to turn down patients due to unavailability of doses. In fact, the PMC officials asked some private hospitals to return whatever doses they have so that it could be diverted to the civic-run facilities.”Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India, too, echoed the same views, saying that rescheduling beneficiaries amid the unavailability of vaccine was negatively impacting the vaccination drive.Meanwhile, the depleted vaccine stock was likely to have a major impact on vaccination drive as Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad were running short of Covishield doses.Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “I have not looked at the available vaccine stock, but there is shortage of vaccine and it could hit the vaccination drive in Pune district on Saturday.”Asked why Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad were getting low vaccine supply compared to Pune rural, Deshmukh said that the doses are distributed based on performance. “More the vaccination in any particular area, the more the distribution. At present, Pune rural is one of the best performers compared to Pune city and Pimpri Chinchwad. If Pune performs better, we will distribute more doses.”Meanwhile, as many as 56,815 people, including general citizens (above 45 years), healthcare workers, and frontline workers, were vaccinated in Pune district. The Pune rural continued to record the highest turnout of the day with 31,149 beneficiaries getting vaccinated, followed by vaccination in PMC limits (16,144 shots) and in the PCMC limits (9,522 shots).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-hospitals-in-civic-limits-face-acute-vaccine-crunch/articleshow/82222165.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Builder to give refund for failing to hand over shop booked in ’11||Mumbai: In a relief to a senior citizen, MahaRERA chairman Ajay Mehta recently directed Moongippa Realty Pvt Ltd to refund the amount paid by her for a shop in Moongippa Arcade, Andheri, with interest, as the decade-old project is not yet completed. In February last year, the then MahaRERA chairman, Gautam Chaterjee, in his interim order, had declined to pass an order for refund or delayed interest regarding the same complaint, citing the larger interest of project completion. Complainant Poonam Desai (65), who was represented by advocate Anil D’Souza, stated she had purchased a shop in Moongippa Arcade on September 2, 2011, and paid more than Rs 12 lakh for the 70-square-foot property worth Rs 21 lakh then. The promoter had promised to hand over its possession by December 31, 2012, which it has not yet done. Desai appeared personally and stated her husband was bedridden and sought a refund of the amount she had paid. Desai stated she would like to withdraw from the project and the promoter should pay interest along with a refund. The counsel also sought compensation for the stamp duty and other taxes that Desai had paid towards purchase of the premises. Advocate Vidya Nair, who represented the promoter, stated it had already refunded Rs 3.25 lakh to the complainant and was willing to refund the balance and sought adequate time. Listing out the difficulties the promoter faced in completing the redevelopment project, the counsel stated it had a tough time resettling the existing occupants and also regarding the height clearance for civil aviation. The counsel for the promoter further stated its intention was to complete the project and issue a refund. Due to circumstances beyond its control, though, it has not been able to do the same and that, if given sufficient time, it would honour its commitments. MahaRERA chairman Ajay Mehta, in his April 7 order, observed there appears to be no pressing reason for compensation and the ends of justice would be served by letting both the parties disengage with the promoter refunding the amount with interest. Mehta directed the promoter to refund the amount paid by the complainant till date along with interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-builder-to-give-refund-for-failing-to-hand-over-shop-booked-in-11/articleshow/82222172.cms||Sanjeev Devasia
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu girl, who picks trash, returns Rs 58,000 to owner, cops & netizens doff their hats||TIRUNELVELI: It’s a rags-to-riches story of a different kind. Not one that’s measured by the value of the currency one holds, but by the abiding human values of honesty and integrity even in penury. When 19-year-old G Mariammal, a ragpicker whose earnings even in the best of times don’t cross Rs 300 a day, spotted a purse with wards of currency and a smartphone on Wednesday, she didn’t sit down to count her luck or the money, but took it straight to the Mukkudal police station in Tirunelveli district where cops found Rs 58,210 in it. On Friday, Tirunelveli district superintendent of police N Manivannan felicitated Mariammal, the last of the five daughters of Ganapathy, 45, and Selvi, 40, for her honesty. The family belongs to the Kattu Naicker community, an impoverished nomadic tribe that makes a living through begging or selling smallwares on the streets of Tamil Nadu. All her elder sisters are married and she lives with her parents. They are among the 32 families from the community residing at Ambedkar Nagar in Tirunelveli town. Like many others in her community, she could not continue schooling after Class V as getting a community certificate was a challenge. She dropped out and turned to rag picking. Her family is among the many that cannot afford a mobile phone but is loaded with debts. Since she does not have brothers, her family is saddled with Rs 3 lakh debt incurred in getting her four sisters married. Around 3pm on Wednesday Mariammal, her aunt P Selvi, 28, and six other women were collecting rags atCheranmahadevi. The teenager found the purse and deposited it along with paper, plastic wastes and metal scarp in her sack. “Suddenly the purse started vibrating and we found money and an expensive phone inside it,” says Selvi who has Rs 2 lakh debt. The women immediately took it to the police station. “We know the value of hard-earned money. The person who missed it could have been rushing for a medical emergency or may have saved it to buy something,” Selvi said. “We were not interested in knowing what was in it. We are happy that we returned it to the rightful owner,” she added. The Mukkudal police felicitated them and gave them a lamp. The owner of the purse gave them Rs 1,000 as a token of appreciation. On Friday, a correspondent of a private school in Kodaikanal rewarded Mariammal and Selvi with a cash prize of Rs 10,000. Their noble act has also won appreciation on social media, which, unfortunately, the women are not aware of due to lack of access to internet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-girl-who-picks-trash-returns-rs-58000-to-owner-cops-netizens-doff-their-hats/articleshow/82222171.cms||M K Ananth
---||Lucknow||Misery piles on oxygen seekers: No docs for nod||Lucknow: With a doctor’s prescription in hand, Adil Hasan stood in a long queue outside an oxygen plant in Talkatora to get a refill on Friday, while his sister, a Covid-19 patient, gasped for breath at home with blood oxygen level dipping below 70%. “When she did not get a bed in any hospital despite our desperate efforts, we arranged for four oxygen cylinders – of 25 litre capacity that last for four hours – to help her breath at home. All four are consumed daily and we maintain supply by getting one refilled as soon as it gets empty. I couldn’t get a refill on Thursday because of the long queue. By the time my turn came, no stock was left,” he said, hoping that he would not have to go back home empty-handed this time. Like Adil, many people are thronging the plant for refill, waiting with bated breath for their turn to get the lifesaving gas that would provide support to their ailing kin. Employees at the plant patiently check the papers, including doctor’s prescription, before allowing the refill. People said the Talkatora plant was among the few which are providing retail services as others have been asked by the administration to maintain supply to Covid hospitals. Abhay Singh, a milk vendor, is facing difficulty in getting a doctor’s prescription for oxygen which has been made mandatory by the administration to deter people from panic buying and stockpiling. “I urgently need a cylinder for my 80-year-old grandfather. Neither a bed is available in any hospital nor do we know any doctor who can give prescription,” he told an employee of a plant in Nadarganj. The employee asked him to call the Covid helpline which will help in getting prescription. Shubham Mukherjee, a resident of Naka, was searching for a doctor to get a prescription for his father whose blood oxygen level has dipped to 80. “My father has low-blood pressure. After searching for three hours, finally a doctor has agreed to give a prescription through teleconsultancy. After getting the prescription, I will search for an oxygen cylinder. Hoarding should be checked but the administration should give some relaxation in emergency cases,” he said. As oxygen demand has skyrocketed due to surge in hospitalisations and many patients managing on their own at home, some retail gas dealers ran out of stock by the evening. Blood oxygen level of Shashi Singh (55), a teacher, dropped to 44%, but despite desperate attempts the family could not get a refill by afternoon. “I visited three oxygen plants since morning with no success. I am now going to another centre in Aishbagh,” said Dheeraj, son of Shashi. (With inputs from Pushkar Raj Anand) O2 search takes many to adjoining districts: After failing to get an oxygen cylinder in the city, some are even going to adjoining districts. With the help of a friend, Ashwin Prakash got a jumbo cylinder from a dealer in Barabanki for Rs 70,000. Suman Mishra of C Block in Indiranagar, who is one-month pregnant, had to seek help of her relatives in Sitapur to get an oxygen cylinder for her Covid-19 positive husband as there are no other male members in the house and she was not in a condition to go out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/misery-piles-on-oxygen-seekers-no-docs-for-nod/articleshow/82222996.cms||---

Besides delays in receiving test results from the government, private labs have also told people they can expect results only after 48 hours. On Thursday, Bandekar appealed to people not to ignore symptoms and to begin treatment immediately instead of waiting for test results. He said the new wave was more powerful, and warned people not to take it casually. A total of 8,103 persons were vaccinated on Friday. Till date, the first dose has been administered to 2.2 lakh people, and the second dose to 59,367 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/twelve-more-die-active-cases-soar-past-11k/articleshow/82222998.cms||---

An investigation officer said N Lakshmanaraj, a farmer from Thondamuthur, and Saranya were married for the past six years. The couple have a five-year-old son. He said the two used to fight often after Lakshmanaraj found out that Saranya was having an illicit affair with his relative for the past two years. “Lakshmanaraj had asked Saranya to end her extra-marital relationship. Despite several warnings, she continued her affair. Distraught, he hacked her to death with a sickle at 3.45am on Friday, when she was asleep,” the officer said. After committing the crime, Lakshmanaraj surrendered before the Kottur police, who took the dead body of his wife to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for postmortem. The body was handed over to her relatives after the autopsy in the evening.

BMC commissioner I S Chahal issued the fresh protocol on Friday wherein the patients’ medical examination will be carried out by civic doctors and officials who will visit their homes. “The coordination for a doctor’s visit to a patient’s home will be done by the ward war room. For each ward, the BMC will set up at least 10 examination teams and one ambulance. This way, patients will be allotted beds as per their need and medical condition,” said a civic official. Officials said Chahal held a special meeting on Friday to achieve more effective management regarding distribution of beds to patients as in the past few days, the number of Covid patients has increased and there are reports that they face serious difficulty in getting beds. “As per the new protocol, requests from patients with symptoms will be examined by doctors and only then will they be allotted beds. So patients will be allotted beds based on their medical condition. The medical examination will be done at patients’ homes between 7am and 11pm. If a patient needs a bed between 11pm and 7am, then she or he will be examined at the BMC’s jumbo Covid centres. The BMC will arrange ambulances for the purpose. This coordination will also be done by the ward war room,” the official said. Civic officials said after medical examination, if a bed recommended by doctors is not available for the patient, then she or her will be put on the waiting list. “Once a bed is available, it will be allotted to the patient. The number of calls at ward war rooms has increased in the past few days. So, we are also going to get additional lines from MTNL,” the official said. A senior civic official said given the fact that the ward war rooms get hundreds of calls each day for beds, visiting all patients for medical examination in their homes will be difficult. “Given the high number of calls, visiting close to 100 patients per day in each ward is a very tall order,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-docs-to-visit-homes-before-allocation-of-beds-in-mumbai-hospitals/articleshow/82223747.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

K Hari Prasad, president, Apollo Group – Hospitals, said they have been able to manage over 90% of positive patients outside the hospital.  “Due to the volume, there is a stress on hospital infrastructure and supplies. With the support of the government and our service partners, we have been able to cope with this difficult situation,” he said. In addition hospitals are taking staff vaccination seriously. “Almost the entire staff is immunised. Training has been enhanced and infection control protocols strengthened. This time around we have seen far fewer infections in our staff dealing with Covid,” said Prasad, adding that use of PPEs are mandatory for staff safety. In terms of additional measures, Dr Ahmer Ali Khan, consultant general physician, Aware Gleneagles Global Hospital, said that in outpatient department, doctors are keeping room doors open and are not using ACs. “Not all protocols can be followed in OP as many come with cloth mask. So, we ensure there is cross ventilation. In ICU, PPEs come to our aid,” said Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-hosps-treating-patients-outside/articleshow/82222175.cms||---

Treatment in a general ward has been reduced from Rs 10,000 per day to Rs 8,000, for a twin sharing room from Rs 13,000 to Rs 10,400, for a single private room from Rs 16,000 to Rs 12,800 and for an intensive care unit (ICU) bed with ventilator from Rs 24,000 to Rs 19,200. “The above order shall take effect immediately and shall be applicable to all patients, including patients already admitted and shall remain in force till April 30, 2021,” the order stated. The package doesn’t include diagnostic interventions, special drugs, use of special equipment, other special procedures/surgery, etc, and extra oxygen flow other than ICU, the order states. It, however, includes admission charges, intensivist, primary and specialist consultant charges, bed charges, nurses, resident doctor, diet, PPE kits for staff, X-ray, ECG, UCG, 2D Echo, cardiac monitor, infusion pump, catheterization, CBC, FBSI, PPBSI, HBA1c, creatinine, liver function test, blood group, routine medicine, including multivitamin, Vitamin C, Zinc, Vitamin D, paracetamol, antacid, anti-allergic HCQ, azithromycin, doxycycline, levofloxacin and dexamethasone, ivermectin and dietary charges. The order was passed “considering the sudden surge of Covid-19 cases in the state of Goa and in order to make private services more affordable to the common man during the Covid-19 crisis”. After receiving criticism over its earlier order, the state government in September last year reduced the capping on per day charges in private hospitals from Rs 12,000 to Rs 10,000 in a general ward, Rs 18,000 to Rs 16,000 in a single room and Rs 25,000 to Rs 24,000 a day for ICU with ventilator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/capped-rates-at-pvt-hosps-for-covid-treatment-marginally-reduced/articleshow/82223033.cms||---

Now, plant 10 trees to give it back to nature – this is an appeal made to a Covid-19 patient on a discharge summary post recovery after spending a week in the ICU. The appeals strikes the right chord and leaves the desired impact. “I have resolved to plant and conserve even more than 10 trees this year. Covid-19 made me realize the cost and importance of oxygen that we get free of cost from nature,” said a 41-yr-old woman who was discharged from Get Well Hospital in the city on April 22. The hospital has started mentioning the amount of oxygen given to a hospitalized Covid-19 patient with an appeal to plant and conserve at least 10 trees after recovery. Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, who heads the hospital, said that people don’t understand the value of oxygen until it us needed desperately and is in short supply. “We take nature for granted. This is the most appropriate time to make people realize the importance of planting trees which not only give us oxygen to live but also clear the polluted air,” he said. According to Dr Swarnakar, he got the idea from a prescription that went viral on social media recently. “A doctor had specifically written on the prescription that the patient should plant one tree after recovery,” he said. “The idea was so good. I thought let’s mention the amount of oxygen the patient consumed during hospitalization in the discharge summary. The patient has paid for this amount of oxygen. So, it may help people realize the real cost of oxygen,” said Dr Swarnakar. Nagpur used to be a real green city and we must conserve this identity, he said. “I was brought up on Neeri campus as my father was a scientist. We grew among thick green foliage. While we are criticizing oxygen shortage in hospitals and cribbing about ventilator bills, how many of us realize that we take nature for granted which gives us free oxygen to breathe,” he said. Oxygen and us An average adult at rest inhales and exhales 7-8 litres of air per minute That totals to about 11,000 litres air (388 cubic feet) in a day A human being uses about 550 litres pure oxygen (19 cubic feet) per day A person who is exercising obviously uses a lot more oxygen than that During Covid-19, those who are on oxygen therapy need multiple times more O2 If High Nasal Flow Oxygen or ventilator is used, O2 requirement increases up to 90 litre/min||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/plant-trees-to-give-back-oxygen-to-nature-hosp-to-discharged-patients/articleshow/82222185.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

BJP leader Arjun Singh was present at the spot. Allegedly, four bullets were fired during a clash between Trinamool and BJP supporters and stones were hurled. BJP’s Belgachhia-Cossipore candidate Shibaji Singha Roy was injured. A bullet shell was found on the spot. EC officials demanded to know the reason behind the firing and how the BJP candidate was injured. As the meeting started, stones were reportedly hurled at the dais, leaving Singha Roy injured. He was taken to hospital. BJP’s Arindam Saha claimed he had taken cop permission for the meeting and they held no rally, as it was banned by EC. “We followed all EC norms but suddenly, some people started throwing stones.” BJP MP Arjun Singh told TOI, “We were attacked with stones. Even firing took place. A security guard gave me his helmet but he was injured in the face. The stone pelting went on despite cops and my guards chasing them. If the security guard had not fired in the air, I would have been killed. There was firing at me and my security guards fired in the air, cordoned me off and took me away from the spot. They fired to protect my life,” Singh added. Trinamool candidate Atin Ghosh said BJP leaders had abused a community, in protest of which locals threw stones at the dais. He said Trinamool was not involved. He also claimed Singha Roy was not injured, but he might have tripped in the melee. “It had nothing to do with politics. It was triggered by hate speech,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-seeks-report-on-belgachhia-firing/articleshow/82222233.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Over 2,500 from hotspot villages turn Covid positive in 2 days||PUNE: A total of 2,591 people from 104 hotspot villages across 13 tehsils in rural Pune tested positive for Covid-19 virus over the last two days during a survey conducted by the Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) as a part of its aggressive testing and early detection strategy aimed at bringing down case fatality rate. The ZP has tagged villages with more than 10 Covid-19 active cases as hotspots and focussed its mitigating effort there. These villages have a population ranging from 3,000 to 10,000 each. “We deployed 15,000 of our staffers, Aasha and Anganwadi workers, among others, for a door-to-door survey, which has so far covered 4.72 lakh people in these villages in the last two days,” Ayush Prasad, the ZP chief executive officer, told TOI. “Emphasis has been laid on testing people with greater social exposure on account of weddings, social or public commitments, among others, besides, clinical aspects like comorbidities. Our survey staffers initially used rapid antigen tests (RAT) before referring those with greater symptoms for the RT-PCR tests,” he said. “Out of 2,591 who tested positive for the virus, as many as 1,911 were admitted at Covid care centres at the respective tehsils and the remaining 680 were home isolated as they had mild symptoms or none at all. Their oxygen saturation levels were also stable and normal,” a senior ZP official said. “We have been testing shopkeepers, vegetable vendors, food and milk delivery workers, among others, to detect cases at an early stage,” the official added. Shekhar Ghogre, former president of the Chakan Municipal Council, said, “The administration needs to carry out such drives in municipal councils too as they are densely populated and have very poor health facilities. This would certainly help the council administration to mitigate the situation in a better way.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-2500-from-hotspot-villages-turn-ve-in-2-days/articleshow/82222184.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Goa||Across Goa, good samaritans reach out to patients in home isolation||PANAJI: Panaji-resident, Nikhita Kini, sat down for her lunch post 4pm on Thursday after a hectic first-half of volunteer work. It was only two days ago that she had tweeted about her willingness to help Covid patients with their errands. No sooner did she do so, she was flooded with requests. “In case there are families where all the members of a family must isolate, they will require groceries to be delivered at their doorstep. I offered to help since Goa doesn’t have the type of services seen in metros where this can be done online,” she told TOI. With Covid-19 cases soaring in the state, patients in isolation are likely to find it increasingly difficult to get their meals, medicines or even groceries. Good Samaritans have come forward offering food or facilitating the delivery of essentials and medicines as Goa grapples with the second wave of the pandemic. “Goa is a huge place and there are a lot of old people that don’t have immediate neighbours or their own families living with them, which is why I felt the need to volunteer,” Aaron Da Silva, an advertising professional from Fatorda, said. Most of them have taken to social media appealing to reach out to them for help, thus doing their bit to ease the burden off the shoulders of patients. Neha Reddy, a yoga teacher from Taleigao said that it’s amazing to see that a people’s movement of sorts has been created to fight the pandemic. “There is no official person or number of people that can be reached out to, but with the help of volunteers, who are running errands and delivering food, the burden on patients is lesser,” she said. Mackenzie Pereira, a resident of Merces, is reaching out to people who need essentials and is also willing to guide others that are stepping out to help. “While essentials are important, people also need to donate plasma right now,” he said. Some others are offering to compile data and coordinate with patients and pharmacies from home to ensure that their needs are met. “There are a lot of requests for oxygen cylinders for people under home isolation. The best we can do is verify the data of vendors and forward people the numbers. We are also reaching out to pharmacies to check if the medicines prescribed are available. The idea is to build this network and put out more information for those in need,” Neshwin Almeida, a resident of Margao, said. Similarly, Sneha Phalle from Sangolda has also offered to coordinate online to help patients meet their requirements. “Seeing all the suffering around us, we have a moral obligation to help in whatever little way we can with whatever resources we have,” said Ashish Kapur, owner of Antares restaurant, who has offered free meals to Covid patients. “There are Covid patients and senior citizens that are unfortunately stuck at home with no ability to cook and if we can do our little bit in helping them get to recovery and easing their pain, then we will,” he said. “There are still others that don’t have access to restaurants or hygienic food in their residential areas, which is where we come in,” said Saira Khan, who runs the cloud kitchen called Potluck in Panaji, and is also offering free food to Covid patients. Vilas Kulkarni, a Porvorim resident and volunteer, said that more volunteers should step forwards so that there is a point of contact in each area wherein volunteers can take turns to handle the deliveries to those in need. “In the second wave, people are bound to find it difficult to move out for daily essentials, grocery items and their medical needs. Last year, people had no contacts to reach out to but this time, we are ready to help,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/across-goa-good-samaritans-reach-out-to-patients-in-home-isolation/articleshow/82223041.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Lucknow||Hosps asks patients’ kin to arrange oxygen cylinders as crisis deepens||Lucknow: As the oxygen crisis continued for the third consecutive day, some city hospitals passed the burden of getting new cylinders or for refilling old ones on the patients’ kin. A few families also took their patients to other districts because of the scarcity. While people were seen fanatically searching for oxygen suppliers, social media was flooded with SOS calls. Several suppliers switched off their phones after running out of stocks. Many were seen transporting cylinders on their own vehicles. Sanjay Yadav, who came to a plant in Talkatora, said that his relative was admitted to a government hospital in Aashiana. “The hospital administration has asked us to get our own oxygen cylinder due to the crisis,” he added. Pawan Ahuja, a resident of Gosiganj, had come to arrange cylinder for his brother-in-law who was under treatment in a private hospital in Gosainganj for a heart condition. “My patient is on oxygen support. Hospital administration gave me an empty cylinder and asked to get it refilled because hospital reserves are depleting,” he said. When contacted, doctors of the several private non-Covid hospitals said there was crisis because the administration was giving priority in oxygen supply to Covid facilities. “We make all efforts to arrange oxygen for patients, but in some cases of emergency, we have to ask the patient's family to try as well,” said a doctor. Rajnish Pandey, a resident of Faizabad Road, said, “My father has acute pneumonia and his blood oxygen level has dropped to 70. The hospital has exhausted its oxygen supply and asked to arrange some.” After testing Covid-19 positive on Sunday, Rajajipuram resident Ravindra Kumar (61) had to wait for three days before getting a bed in a private Covid hospital on Wednesday. “However, as his condition deteriorated further on Thursday and the hospital was facing an oxygen crisis, we hired an ambulance and took him to a hospital with a ventilator facility in Bareilly,” said Ravindra’s daughter. Oxygen crisis was also reported from Fehmina Hospital & Trauma Centre. Nodal officer of Covid in the hospital, Dr Salman Khalid, said that they were arranging oxygen from other hospitals with the help of administration. “Our supplies are on the way,” he said.District administration officers said that all the oxygen plants have been told to ramp up the production.

---||Pune||Inhaled steroids included for mild Covid treatment||Pune: The national task force has included steroid-based inhalers as an experimental drug in the treatment protocol for Covid-19 patients with mild illness. Experts say at a time when there is a lack of availability of beds and oxygen all over the country, the approach is likely to significantly reduce this burden. Infectious diseases expert and national task force member Sanjay Pujari said, “Two trials abroad demonstrated that inhaled budesonide is capable of reducing the duration of symptoms in patients with mild disease. Hence, we have included it as an experimental drug for patients with mild Covid.”The task force included the inhaled steroid budesonide in the treatment protocol for mild Covid-19 patients under therapy based on low certainty of evidence on April 22.Pujari said, “The principal trial in the UK also revealed a slight decline in the need for escalating care (hospitalization/emergency care), but it was not statistically significant. This is the interim data. The trial’s final findings will show whether the drug really reduces progression to severe disease.” He, however, warned against steroid inhalers misuse or panic-buying. “The drug is not meant for hypoxic Covid patients. It may be used only when symptoms of fever or cough are persistent five days after the onset of disease,” Pujari said.Asthma inhaler has the potential to be a game-changer in the current fight against the virus, say experts in the field. “Inhaled steroid, in the UK trials, has shown to reduce progression and worsening of Covid-19 by 90%. That a widely used and easily available asthma drug, which has been tested for over decades with minimal side effects showing a beneficial effect in halting the progression of Covid, has come as a pleasant surprise. As more studies will be conducted, we will get better insights into the mechanism of its action,” said chest physician Sundeep Salvi, director of Pulmocare Research and Education Foundation.Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force on Covid-19, said they have known about the trial on the use of inhalers since last year. He said, “We have used it in mild to moderate cases. It should not be hyped. It is crucial to select the right time and the right case. The budesonide inhaler is also an investigational therapy, which may be used in carefully selected cases in a research mode. It is purely experimental currently.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/inhaled-steroids-included-for-mild-covid-treatment/articleshow/82222180.cms||Umesh Isalkar

In fact, a verification of the ICU data from the state shows that close to 24% of all ICU admissions comprise patients in this category, with most of them being men. “In our observation, we found that 85% of patients below 45-46 years, who require the ICU, are men. The percentage of women, on the other hand, is just about 15%,” said Dr Kiran Madala, ICU in-charge at the Nizamabad Government General Hospital. “This could probably be because men make up a significant part of the working population,” he said, adding that the average during the first wave of Covid was around 55 years. Incidentally, a gender-wise break up of the positive cases within Telangana — particularly within the 21 to 40-year bracket — also point towards a higher caseload among the male population. A quick scan of the figures reveal that of the total 21.6% affected, between 21 years and 30 years, 13.4% are men while 8.2% are women. Similarly, 14.2% of all Covid patients aged 31 to 40 years (here too the total is 21.6%) are found to be men. The remaining 7.4% are women. Hyderabad: The state set another record with 6,206 positive cases in last 24 hours, taking the total case load to 3.79lakh. The number of active cases reached 52,726. On Friday, a total of 3,052 people recovered. This took the total number of recovered people to 3.24lakh.

After the incident of oxygen tank leakage at Zakir Hussain hospital, which claimed 22 lives, Bhujbal conducted a meeting on Friday with the senior officials of various departments. Bhujbal said apart from carrying out proper maintenance of oxygen tanks, it is also necessary to arrange for dura and jumbo cylinders. He appealed to all the officials to ensure that there is no shortage of any essential service and facilities like oxygen and medicines. The guardian minister assured the officials that the state government will be soon providing a stock of remdesivir injections to the district in a phased manner. The district administration will supply the injections at the taluka level as per the guidelines. To overcome the shortage of doctors and nurses, the district administration can appoint retired and experienced doctors and nurses on an honorarium basis, who are willing to work on humanitarian grounds, he said. He added that there is a large number of patients’ relatives in Covid wards. All measures should be taken to ensure the relatives are not allowed inside the Covid ward and help can be taken from the police for the same. The meeting on Friday was attended by former MP Sameer Bhujbal, district collector Suraj Mandhare, police commissioner Deepak Pandey, Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav, police superintendent Sachin Patil, Nashik ZP CEO Leena Bansod and other senior officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ensure-upkeep-of-o2-tanks-in-hosps/articleshow/82220081.cms||---

In Mapusa, it is a triangular fight between the panel backed by BJP MLA Joshua D’Souza - Mapusa Development Front, Mapsekaracho Ekvot – backed by the Congress candidate at the last assembly polls Sudhir Kandolkar, and Shree Bodgeshwar Development Front which is supported by NCP’s state general secretary Sanjay Barde. The BJP-backed panel has fielded candidates in all 20 wards, whereas Mapsekaracho Ekvot has contested in 16 wards and Shree Bodgeshwar Development Front had put up candidates in five wards. A political observer said that “it is also a test for D’Souza who is facing his first municipal election as the Mapusa MLA”. Speaking to reporters, D’Souza said that his panel’s target is to win all the 20 seats, but are confident of retaining the 16 seats which the BJP-backed panel won in the last municipal election. “We selected candidates only after taking inputs from the electorate. We received a good response from the public. We have done a lot of work in Mapusa, we have helped people, and I have been personally working,” D’Souza said The Mapusa MLA said that the “other two panesl are not serious about the election as they have not fielded candidates in all wards”. “It looks like the other panels have contested only to bargain after the results. If they were interested in getting a majority, then they should have fielded candidates in all the wards,” he said. Kandolkar said that despite the fear of Covid, people came out to vote. “The people of Mapusa want the Mapsekaracho Ekvot panel to win the municipal elections. We got a good response. People have seen that there is no development in Mapusa. Even after planning, nothing has moved ahead,” he said. “Mapsekaracho Ekvot has fielded educated candidates as we are serious about taking up development of the town. A large number of votes are in favour of our panel,” Kandolkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/electorate-keeps-all-three-panels-at-mapusa-guessing/articleshow/82223062.cms||---

Nainital recorded a positivity rate of 41.4% on Friday while Champawat registered a staggering 62%, among the highest in the country so far. “With only 764 tests, of which 447 (were) negative and 317 positive, Nainital had a 41% positivity rate on Friday. It was 48% two days ago,” said Anoop Nautiyal from the Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the pandemic in the state. “I urge the government of Uttarakhand to ask Nainital district to conduct 8,000-10,000 tests a day.” At the beginning of the week, Nainital had a positivity rate of 17.4%, which means over a two-fold increase in five days. Nainital district magistrate Dheeraj Garbyal put it down to a high number of people coming to Haldwani for tests. “Many people from far-off places come to Haldwani and get tested or even get admitted here. We know the virus is spreading at a fast pace. We have decided to increase our testing capacity,” he said. “We are sampling all personnel who went to Kumbh. All of them have to go through seven days of mandatory quarantine.” Bageshwar district, too, has seen a surge coinciding with the Kumbh. “Many home guards and other security personnel are now coming back. Just yesterday (Thursday), 15 of them tested positive. This, along with rising migrant numbers, has increased positivity rates,” Bageshwar district magistrate Vineet Kumar said. “We have decided to test all people coming from Kumbh. We will also test as many returning migrant workers as possible to track and trace the virus.” Pauri Garhwal, the state’s largest hill district, has recorded over 20% positivity rates on four of the past five days, surging to 41% on Thursday and registering 30% on Friday. In Tehri, another major hill district, the positivity rate was 33% on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/at-41-positivity-rate-nainital-in-deep-distress/articleshow/82221440.cms||Ishita Mishra

He said though the state government had urged the Centre to provide a week’s stock at a time to ramp up vaccination of people aged 45 years and above, the supply “continues to be inadequate”. Ahead of May 1, Tope said, the state was exploring options of importing vaccines from other manufacturers if supply from Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech could not meet the demand. He said there would be more talks with the vaccine manufactures to finalize the rates. “We have been repeatedly reaching out to the Centre for more doses. The state has the capacity to ramp up vaccination, but we are unable to do so because of the shortage of doses,” he told TOI Maharashtra has over 4,000 vaccination centres. “It can have sub-centre facilities also. But if we do not have enough doses, there is no point in organizing the vaccination drive at these centres,” he said The state health minister said there was discussion on the issue of one-nation-one-price for the vaccines that would be given to the states from the manufacturers for the people aged between 18 and 45 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/doses-too-few-for-people-aged-45-and-above-tope/articleshow/82222193.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The arrested persons were identified as Kaushal Shukla, pharmacist, Vikas Dubey, third-year nursing student at KGMU, Ajit Maurya, technician in Lari hospital of KGMU and Rakesh Tiwari, a nurse in Queen Mary hospital. Cops also recovered 36 fake vials manufactured in Bangalore. ADCP, central zone, Chiranjeevi Nath Sinha said that the accused Kaushal Shukla had a deal with a customer promising him six vials of Remdesivir, each costing Rs 15,000. "The customer was asked by the accused to come to Kanausi bridge near Awadh hospital, while cops were also clad in civvies and had come along with the customer,” said Sinha. As soon as Kaushal opened the bag and handed over the vials to the customer, the police nabbed him red-handed, the officer said, adding that during interrogation, Kaushal told the police that these vials were given to him by Vikas Dubey who is a nursing student in KGMU.  The gang members told police that they got vials from Barabanki from one Ritanshu Maurya at Rs 3,000 commission. Meanwhile, in Aminabad, two persons, Saurabh Rastogi and Amir Abbas, were arrested and nine vials of Remdesivir were recovered from them. In another case, Gomtinagar police seized 54 fake vials of Remdesivir and arrested Shahzad Ali, Sachin Rastogi, Krishna Dixit, and Ritesh Gautam. The police said that Krishna and Ritesh were medicine distributors who used to give remdesivir to Sachin at Rs 6,000 and then Sachin further gave it to Shazad, owner of Harsha hospital, at Rs 10,600 and Shahzad sold it for Rs 20,000 per patient. Police also arrested four persons, including two ad hoc medical staff of KGMU, for black marketing of 116 vials of Remdesivir in Naka Hindola.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/2-from-kgmu-among-4-held-for-selling-fake-remdesivir/articleshow/82223051.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Shock over contracting virus claiming lives in Telangana||HYDERABAD: A Covid-19 positive report is having a devastating effect on some people. Going into shock and out of fear, there have been instances of people collapsing and dying. One such incident took place in Jagtial district. A family came to a primary health centre (PHC) at Dharmapuri for a Covid-19 test as they were primary contacts of a man who had tested positive earlier in Arepalli village. Four of his family members, including his 70-year-old father Regonda Chandraiah, came for the test. All of them tested positive. When the result came positive, the aged man collapsed to his death. A similar incident took place at Chintapalli in Nalgonda district. A 59-year-old man got a Covid-19 test done and the report was positive. As soon as he returned home, he died within one hour. The PHC had even given him medicines to take as he had tested positive. Such ‘shock deaths’ have become common in several places of the state. In Aswaraopet of Bhadradri Kothagudem district, a 38-year-old man tested positive after his family took him to a hospital and got a test done. When an ambulance arrived in Ootapalli village to shift him to a hospital after he had omplained of chest pain after testing positive, the man started crying looking at his family members. The man died even as he looked in shock at his children and wife. The last rites of the Covid-19 patient were later performed by gram panchayat workers. “All precautions have to be taken to prevent spread of Covid-19. But if a person tests positive, it is not that he or she should be disheartened. Even at the village level, we are creating awareness asking people to get tested if they have any symptoms and take treatment,” Kamareddy district medical and health officer Dr P Chandrasekhar Rao said. “Many know people who have been affected but they probably may be under the impression that they are safe. It is in such circumstances when they test positive they may tend to go into a shock,” Dr Rao said.He advised people not to have fear but take precautions. If they have any symptoms, he said they should immediately get themselves tested and take treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shock-over-contracting-virus-claiming-lives-in-state/articleshow/82222195.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Ahmedabad||Canada bans India flights, students stranded||AHMEDABAD: Several students from Gujarat who were to leave for Canada for higher education are now left stranded, thanks to a month-long ban on flights from India. Canada on Thursday said it would ban all flights from India and Pakistan for 30 days due to the growing wave of Covid-19 cases in the two countries. Students from across Gujarat had enrolled in universities in Canada and many of their visa clearances were delayed due to which they were preparing to leave by early May. Rohan Patel, a computer engineering graduate, said, “I was to leave on May 17. There are stringent rules imposed by the government regarding Covid-compliance which includes a 14-day quarantine and undergoing an RTPCR test after reaching Canada, all at my own cost, for which I have already paid and made arrangements. With the change in guidelines, I am now clueless on how to proceed.” Similar is the situation of Shivang Soni, who has already paid for his travel and quarantine arrangements. “After accepting all their conditions, I booked my hotel for three days quarantine and test, having paid $1,100 an additional $600 for 11days’ quarantine. This money is non-refundable which is a heavy burden for me and my family. The flight ban has led to a complete chaos now,” he said. Students are left frustrated due to the delay in their admission process and are now further riled up with the new development. “I have applied to study in Canada for spring 2021 in Seneca College. Due to Covid-19 processes are delayed in all countries, but Canada’s processes are delayed more than others,” said Tejas Prajapati. An Ahmedabad resident, Anshul Jansari, secured admission for a web designing course in January 2020. “I deferred my travel plans because of the coronavirus pandemic initially and then my visa approvals were also delayed. When I booked my ticket finally after all approvals for May 3. With the latest travel ban for Indian flights and given the rising uncertainty of the situation, I really don’t know what to do. A lot of money is at stake and quite a bit is non-refundable too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/canada-bans-india-flights-students-stranded/articleshow/82222196.cms||---

The tankers will be flown to the Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) plant in Jamnagar in two trips. “The first trip is at 8.30 am and the aircraft will carry two empty tankers. The second trip is at 11.30 am. We will see if a fifth tanker can be airlifted in the second trip,” said Avinash Dhakne, state transport commissioner. Each tanker has a capacity of 14-15 metric tonnes.The filled tankers will return by road. “It will take around 17-18 hours by road and the health department will decide which district needs oxygen on priority,” said Dhakne.Health minister Rajesh Tope said the state requires an additional 500 metric tonnes of oxygen from other states to fight the surge in Covid-19 infections.Meanwhile, on Friday the state home department ordered that at least 50% of all nitrogen and argon gas tankers be converted into oxygen tankers in the next 24 hours. There are 183 oxygen tankers in the state, 138 nitrogen and 67 argon tankers. “We have so far converted 49 tankers from nitrogen/argon to oxygen. Maharashtra is the only state to do it so far. Since Friday afternoon we have identified 7-8 tankers for conversion. We have requisitioned 41 tankers so we are almost near the halfway mark,” said Dhakne. The transport commissioner said nitrogen and argon are critical for the pharmaceutical industry and care has to be taken not to impact production while taking over these tankers. Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, core committee, All India Motor Transport Congress said there are around 1,000 nitrogen and argon tankers that have an all-India permit. “The government must ensure vaccination for all drivers and cleaners of such tankers,” he said.In a related development, the first Oxygen Express train bringing seven tankers with liquid oxygen from Visakhapatnam reached Maharashtra late evening.

The Institute of Engineering Technology (IET) will start MTech in AI and data science from this year. The growing demands of the use of artificial intelligence and data science in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector, especially at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, has made the two courses popular among students. “We will offer 18 seats in MTech AI and data science. Also, the institute is set to get the approval of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) for three courses: Mtech (mechanical engineering), MTech (structural) and MTech (power and energy) that will help students in getting various national and international level fellowships,” said IET director Prof Vineet Kansal. He said the healthcare industry has emerged as the top creator for data science and artificial intelligence jobs in recent years. Both, AI and data science have also contributed to designing and evaluating healthcare strategies that improve equity, opportunity, access, and health services quality. Some of the areas with enormous scope for data science and AI applicability, include drug discovery, diagnosis of diseases, delivering more precise prescriptions and customized care, post-care monitoring, hospital operations and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/iet-to-start-courses-in-ai-data-science/articleshow/82223069.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

After waiting in the queue for one-and-a-half hours, we were told that the dispensary had run out of Covishield for the day. We finally got our shots at Sana Hospital, Kausar Bagh, around 11am.”Rekha Suratwala (67) said, “My husband went to two hospitals at 9am with his friend and failed to get tokens at both the places after waiting in queue for long. The hospital staff said that they issue only 50 tokens per day.”Rajendra Kumar (64) said that even after booking his slot, he and his wife could not get their second dose on Friday. “When we went to Jupiter Hospital in Baner, we were told that they are only giving second dose of Covaxin and not Covishield, so we had to return home.”Arpan Dasgupta (71) said that he had an appointment for the first dose of vaccination in Undri. " After waiting at the centre for two hours, we received a notification that the registration has been cancelled.

According to police, Kishan Parmar, was in love with cousin brother Gopal Parmar's wife Hetal (38) and he was happy for the last few months. But Hetal discontinued talking to him and Kishan got very upset over that. On Friday morning, he reached Gopal’s residence with a knife and not finding his brother at home attacked Hetal. “Kishan kept asking Hetal why she stopped talking to him while he kept stabbing her for more than 15 times. An injured Hetal shouted for the help, hearing which neighbours rushed there. Fearing that he might be caught, Kishan locked himself inside the room and stabbed himself to death. Meanwhile, Hetal was rushed to the hospital where her condition is stated to be critical,” police said. Police said that Kishan had gone to Jamnagar and started living with Gopal about a year ago. Both brothers were engaged in vegetable selling business. However, during his stay with Gopal, Kishan fell in love with Hetal. When Gopal came to know about it, he asked Kishan to leave the home and also told his wife to discontinue her relationship with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/jamnagar-lovelorn-man-stabs-cousins-wife-kills-himself/articleshow/82221467.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray asks PM Modi for more oxygen, import of remdesivir||MUMBAI: In a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray demanded additional supply of medical oxygen, permission to import stocks of the antiviral remdesivir injections and vaccines available in the international markets to speed up inoculation in the state. Thackeray further said the government should allow private companies to purchase vaccines with their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. Thackeray said Maharashtra has 5.7 crore people who are eligible to get vaccinated in the next phase starting May 1 (in the 18 to 45 age group), for which the state will require nearly 12 crore doses. “Manufacturers in the country will not be able to produce vaccines in such huge quantities in such a short time. So, if a state seeks permission to import vaccines, it should be granted,” said Thackeray. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said several states have also demanded a“one nation, one rate” policy for vaccines. Thackeray said the Centre should also increase the supply of vaccines for the 45-plus age group, which has been slow due to erratic and inadequate supply of doses from the Centre. With rising demand for oxygen in the state, Thackeray said if oxygen-filled tankers cannot be airlifted, to save time, at least empty ones could be flown to a plant and, once filled, transported via railways or by road. “We tried to bring oxygen from Vishakhapatnam via railways but considering the time taken, help should be sought from the Indian Air Force and the National Disaster Response Force,” said Thackeray. Maharashtra requires 1,500 metric tonne of oxygen a day, of which 300-350MT is being brought from other states. Maharashtra will require an additional supply of 250-300MT as cases are on the rise. Thackeray said instead of distant states, if supply could be arranged from neighbouring ones, it would be available early. There are nearly 60,000 patients in the state on oxygen support and 76,300 on oxygen beds. “Modi has also called for an oxygen audit to ensure there is no wastage and it is being used in the most effective way. We are taking steps to ensure that,” said Tope. Maharashtra has also sought 13,000 jumbo cylinders and 1,100 ventilators from the Centre. Meanwhile, the state has stressed on the need for a study on the “double mutation” in the virus, which is reportedly causing a rapid spread. Genome sequencing of samples from the state must be done and fresh guidelines issued, if required. Thackeray said it is not known how effective remdesivir is, but is known to reduce hospitalisation. The state needs 70,000 vials a day but gets 27,000, and should be allowed to import it, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cm-asks-pm-for-more-o2-import-of-remdesivir/articleshow/82222219.cms||---

---||Nagpur||We failed as a collegium in appointing women judges to SC: CJI Bobde||Nagpur: The 47th Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde superannuated on Friday after holding the country’s topmost judicial office for 17 months. CJI Bobde presided over a number of landmark cases and addressed issues impacting the masses including the historic Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid, allowing access to basic services and government subsidies for citizens without an Aadhaar card, streamlining appointment of HC judges, marital rape, prohibiting firecrackers’ sale in Delhi due to pollution, banning a religious book and allowing retired HC judges to be reappointed to reduce pendency, among others. He also introduced a number of changes in the judiciary, like use of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual hearing during Covid-induced lockdown last year that proved to be a game changer and allowed the judiciary to continue functioning across the nation. In another landmark observation, CJI Bobde had said that freedom of speech and expression is one of the most abused rights in recent times.In an exclusive interview with TOI, he spoke at length on various issues, cases he handled and efforts he made to improve the dispensation of justice. Excerpts: Q. What changes have you brought to the judiciary in your tenure?A. The introduction of Artificial Intelligence programme SUPACE, shifting the court proceedings to virtual hearings and the introduction of SUVAS app that can be used in the translation of Supreme Court judgments into nine vernacular languages. I also laid a lot of emphasis on minimizing the use of paper in order to make the court’s functioning more environmentally conscious.Q. Which was/were the most intriguing case/cases you came across?A. Many cases have been intriguing, you can’t go by what is reported and well known. All the cases that we hear are important regardless of the fame attached to a case.Q. You introduced the concept of AI in the judiciary. How far has it been successful?A. The use of artificial intelligence is at a nascent stage and it hasn’t been used enough to call it successful or unsuccessful.Q. You recently observed that a woman should ascend to the post of CJI. What was the thought behind that? You had also said about efforts to appoint more women judges in SC.A. The question arose when an applicant filed a petition praying for more women judges in the apex court. We believe it’s time that not only more woman judges are appointed, but also for a woman Chief Justice of India. We have also held collegium meetings in which names of women were considered as possible candidates for the SC, but those didn’t result in any appointment. We failed as a collegium on this aspect.Q. How to bring in more women judges? What are the incentives for them?A. The same incentives that are available to men are sufficient for women. The solution is more appointments in higher posts including chief justices of state high courts and as the CJI.Q. When taking over as CJI, you had said your priority would be to reduce pendency of cases and streamlining the justice delivery system. How far do you think you have been successful?A. The listing and rate of disposal of cases dropped so low due to the Covid pandemic last year that it wasn’t possible to do that. We had asked the bar for consent for physical hearings and only a few members consented to it.Q. You introduced hearings through video conferencing during the pandemic, which revolutionized the judicial system. You think it’s going to be a permanent feature in future?A. Virtual hearings have some drawbacks like connectivity or feedback or sound which sometimes makes the hearing difficult. But there is no reason why these defects can’t be rectified over a period of time. I think the advantages far outweigh the drawbacks. For instance, a litigant from any part of the country, say Mumbai or Tamil Nadu, can be heard through an online proceeding in the Supreme Court at Delhi via virtual hearings. This gives an opportunity to an advocate to argue the case before the top court which would not have been possible otherwise. Similarly advocates in Delhi can appear virtually before any court in the country. Certainly, as a matter of law, every lawyer duly enrolled with the Bar Council of India (BCI) and capable of arguing a case is entitled to address any court. Therefore, I think and hope it’s likely to stay.Q. Physical filing of petitions has become impossible in current times, what is the progress in allowing e-filing in the Supreme Court?A. E-filing makes it easier to file a matter in the SC from just about anywhere. It has also helped in significantly reducing the use of paper in courts. Its multiprong approach and advantages can also be linked to artificial intelligence for making the entire process much easier and faster than the physical filings.Q. Do you think collegium’s decisions on judges’ appointment should be detailed ones and not mere recommendations?A. I don’t think so. As a lot of opinions about a candidate would otherwise find their way into the decision and might unnecessarily mar his/her reputation, as has happened in some cases in the past.Q. Don’t you think collegium should divulge details about transfer of judges?A. No, I don’t think so.Q. Please elaborate on steps taken by you to fill up vacancies in the high courts in your tenure.A. In my tenure 111 judges were appointed to various HCs. Also, we have recently passed two very important judgments that address the way the vacancy in the HCs can be filled in an effective and expeditious manner. We issued guidelines for the invocation of Article 224A for appointment of retired (HC) judges to the high courts, in the case Lok Prahari versus Union of India, to reduce the pendency of cases.Q. What’s your say on criticism of judges and judgments on social media?A. Social media should have the same standards as the print media. They can’t be making derogatory remarks or statements aimed at maligning the reputation of judges. One change I would like to see is that, off the cuff answers, exploratory remarks made by judges about the case should not be reported as views of the judge. In the judicial process, the judge and the advocate, both say things at times and with a view to explore the truth. These should not be reported and made much of. In other words, discussions should not be reported as decisions.Q. Do you think public perception of the judiciary needs to be improved?A. I think it’s an institution manned by humans and so, all aspects from excellence to the limitations and possible inadequacies in a human being would show up in the system. I think it would go a long way if people understood this. The court is greater than any individual judge or lawyer. CJI’s office is an institution and its sanctity must be preserved.Q. Should privacy of judges take precedence over transparency?A. The functioning of the judiciary is transparent and not opaque. Certainly, judges are entitled to privacy in their personal lives as much as any person.Q. You once said the Supreme Court would have a five-judge permanent bench to deal with the important issues like Sabarimala. Have any efforts been made in that direction?A. The Sabarimala case itself could not be heard due to the pandemic. However, there have been five-judge benches to hear other important matters such as the recently constituted constitutional bench that heard the Maratha reservation case.Q. What’s your take on Ayodhya verdict? You once remarked it was historic? Do you think it was the biggest case handled by the bench, including you?A. Possibly. It was the first time that the Constitution bench sat for five straight days in a week to hear the matter. The hearing lasted 40 days and more than a few thousand documents were part of the record. These documents had to be translated into English from Urdu, Persian and Sanskrit.Q. There are speculations that the executive is indirectly trying to influence and control judges’ appointments by delaying or sitting on proposals...A. If that’s how one wants to interpret the consultative process.Q. You once referred about too much freedom of speech for some and very little for others and that freedom of speech and expression is one of the most abused rights in recent times.A. Isn’t it true? The freedom of speech and expression is most abused right in recent times. Q. What’s your take on PILs? Those are always under scanner for being frivolous or being misused for blackmailing or targeting someone?A. There can be a gross abuse of this kind of litigation, like of any other kind, may be more so because the rules of locus standi (Right to appear in the court) are more relaxed.Q. Have you been able to narrow the Centre-SC divide or is the chasm widening?A. It’s not a divide. They operate in different spheres.Q. You are a big supporter of mediation and proposed to have a mediation bar in all courts. Any progress on it?A. I am awaiting the passage of a law that deals with pre-litigation mediation and makes an agreement arrived at in the course of mediation executable as a decree. Without this enforceability, mediation doesn’t have much value. Once parties think that mediation is more effective and the rule of champerty is relaxed, then it may be more attractive to many more lawyers.Q. How far has your dream project of setting up the National Judicial Academy (NJA) on the lines of NDA progressed?A. It was proposed at Maharashtra National Law University (MNLU) in Nagpur, but it hasn’t progressed.Q. How will you explain the contribution of Nagpur, where you were born and brought up and also started practice at the same place?A. Nagpur has produced legal minds second to none in the country. Unfortunately, its image receded after it ceased to have the Nagpur High Court which shifted to Jabalpur. It still has managed to produce fine lawyers and judges of repute, including a former CJI even though he was elevated from Jabalpur. There have been several SC judges of great eminence, though I am still waiting for an attorney general to be appointed from the city.Q. After being in country's topmost judicial post, what’s your next move?A. After retirement, I will be moving to my hometown in Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/we-failed-as-a-collegium-in-appointing-women-judges-to-sc-cji-bobde/articleshow/82222203.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Speaking to mediapersons, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said that analysing the trends and after speaking to people, he has concluded that BJP will form councils in all five municipalities. “BJP-backed panels will win elections in all these municipalities. There is a marginal impact on voting due to Covid,” he said. Tanavade said that BJP-backed chairpersons and vice-chairpersons will rule all the municipalities. He also said that in Mormugao, all three BJP MLAs have come together and fielded candidates. “Out of 25 wards in Mormugao, BJP will win more than 21 wards,” he said. He also said that there is no infighting between BJP in Mormugao. The state BJP chief said that wards in Margao municipality are spread across three constituencies - Margao, Fatorda and Curtorim. “We do not have sitting MLAs in the jurisdiction of Margao Municipal Council. When the opposition realised that they cannot defeat BJP in municipal elections, Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, Margao MLA Digambar Kamat and Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco joined forces. This coalition will not impact BJP, and BJP-backed panels will win the Margao municipality poll,” he said. Tanavade said that they will also win Mapusa council. During the recent-concluded election to seven urban local bodies, including the Corporation of the City of Panaji, BJP emerged victorious in six of these bodies.

---||Lucknow||Prone position helps combat low oxygen levels in emergency: Experts||LUCKNOW: Lying down on the stomach and taking deep breath can help a Covid-19 patient with low oxygen levels improve respiration in emergency situations and stabilize breathing till medical help arrives, according to experts. As shortage of oxygen supply takes the centrestage, Covid-19 patients under home isolation can take up deep breathing exercises thrice a day to maintain normal oxygen saturation levels. “Medically known as ‘prone position’, lying down on the stomach helps improve oxygen saturation levels in emergency situations. The simple exercise can easily be done at home. It is helpful in increasing lung capacity for gaseous exchange,” head of general medicine department at BBD University and governor elect of the American College of Physicians, India chapter, Dr Anuj Maheshwari said. “Lungs expand when one lies on the stomach and breathes deeply. It also helps in spread of oxygen in the body. However, it should be done only for half-an-hour to two hours and not more than that. It should not be done after meals,” he added. The ministry of health has also released a brochure on ‘proning for self-care’ for Covid-19. “Proning is required only when a patient feels difficulty in breathing and SpO2 decreases below 94.” it says. The brochure states that 4-5 pillows should be used for prone position – one below the neck, 1-2 below the chest through upper thigh and two below the shins. The prone position involves lying for 30 minutes each on your stomach, on the right side, sitting up with back support, on the left side and then again on the stomach. Prof Santosh Kumar, a faculty member at KGMU’s pulmonary medicine department, said deep breathing exercises and steam inhalation without any medicine in it, at least thrice a day, could also help in maintaining normal oxygen levels. “Social media is abuzz with videos and messages talking about the use of nebulizer for oxygen relief. All these are fake. Nebulizer does not give you concentrated oxygen. It will only give you atmospheric air which is not the same. It is not a substitute for oxygen,” he added. “Similarly, messages regarding the use of camphor, cloves and ajwain put together in a bundle to be smelt, is also fake. This will not help in improving oxygen levels. Deep breathing and steam should be taken. Prone position ventilation is the best,” Dr Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/prone-position-helps-combat-low-o2-levels-in-emergency-experts/articleshow/82223083.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Melghat sees spurt in deaths, many suspected to be due to Covid||Nagpur: A sudden increase in deaths in the hilly area of Melghat in Amravati district in a little more than a week has left the local administration worried. Apart from recorded Covid deaths, the tribal belt has also seen a high number of unexplained fatalities in a short period. The unexplained fatalities may be not recorded as due to Covid because the deceased had not undergone tests. It is suspected that a number of such fatalities may have been due to the novel coronavirus and have gone unreported. This further strengthens the theory that the latest variant B.1.617 has originated from Amravai district, leading to a sudden surge in the area. One of the doctors practising in Melghat said that it appeared from the symptoms that a new variant has emerged. Local sources including politicians put up the recent toll anywhere between 50 to 100, which include sudden deaths not officially attributed to Covid. Similar symptoms have been reported in number of non-Covid deaths too, said sources. The health department here has initiated a village-wise survey in homes where there have been deaths not attributed to Covid. The close contacts and kin of the deceased will be tested to ascertain if they are infected with the virus. A source said even tests on the dead bodies can be attempted but the locals are reluctant. The sub-divisional officer Deepali Sethi confirmed the development and said close contacts are being tested. At Chakarda village, around 10km from Dharni town, six deaths have taken place in six days. None were reported Covid cases and a survey is underway. There are other pockets like this too, said sources. A senior doctor in one of the government hospitals said that a helpline has been established. “If they cannot access any health worker, villagers can call on the helpline in case of symptoms like fever, cold or breathlessness,” said a source Rajkumar Patel, the MLA from Melghat, said that there are reports of around 100 deaths in Dharni alone within a fortnight. A number of these are unexplained deaths. The MLA said that the locals are highly reluctant towards getting vaccinated or even tested. “Repeated appeals have failed to make any impact,” he said. Appa Patil, a senior BJP functionary in Dharni, said that he is ready to volunteer for village-to-village awareness drive. “We have workers who can take up the job. I plan to approach the SDO for permission,” he said. Dr Sophy Ariankulam of Dayasagar Hospital at Dharni said that almost the entire staff including her have tested positive. The doctor who was recovering at a hospital in Amravati said that in 15 days they came across a number of cases with acutely low oxygen saturation. “This kind of weakness was also not seen earlier. Some could not even take in water easily. It appeared to be a new mutant. Majority of them had not done a Covid test,” the doctor said. A source at a primary health centre said that mainly people above the age of 50 had died. These were being reported as deaths due to old age but “Covid cannot be ruled out”. In a recent lot of 91 samples taken from a single pocket, 36 were found to be positive. Dr Ashish Satav, who runs a hospital near Dharni, said that they have to manage with oxygen concentrators machines due to shortage of cylinders. “Functioning of the machines is hampered by erratic power supply,” the doctor said. Dinesh Pandya who runs the sole shop selling material for last rites at Dharni said that a week ago items for as much as 18 funerals had to be sold. It continues to be 8-10 at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/melghat-sees-spurt-in-deaths-many-suspected-to-be-due-to-covid/articleshow/82222200.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Pune||Online appts for jabs fail, walk-ins a matter of luck||Pune: It has now come down to plain luck for people due for their second shot of the Covid vaccine in Maharashtra. Many are walking in to vaccination centres to try their luck after failed attempts to schedule online appointments. But this too doesn’t guarantee one would get the shot as vaccine stock has dried up at many centres. Home-based entrepreneur Mallika Manghnani, whose husband is due for the second dose, told TOI, “We tried to book online, but the page said no appointments were available. We then tried calling the hospital where he took the first dose but they had no vaccine doses. He then went to another vaccination site in Wanowrie but they too didn’t have any stock. It is very frustrating for citizens.” Similar is the situation with Sudeep Chintamani, whose mother got the first jab on March 10. “I tried scheduling the second dose appointment for my mother in Pune city, but the app was not showing any centre offering Covishield. When I searched under the Pune district header, I was shown the remotest centres in the rural areas. How do I travel to such far off centres with a senior citizen?” he said. Asha Baxi (85) was due for her second dose after April 12 and finally got it on Friday after repeated follow-ups with a city-based hospital. “We could not get the online appointment. My son visited another hospital, which too was out of stock. He finally put in a request to the hospital where we had received our first shot. The hospital staffers were kind enough to save two shots for me and my daughter-in-law.” A senior state official, in charge of the vaccination drive, said the process was like booking a movie ticket online. “If a show is not scheduled, how can one book a ticket for it? Unless the hospitals create a vaccination session for a particular date, no appointments will be available,” the official said. Another state official said, “If a vaccination session in a hospital is for 100 people, some of the slots would be for online appointments and rest walk-ins. If online appointments have already been booked, more online appointments for that particular session site would not be available. Anyone who is facing this issue can walk in to any of the nearest centres to get the second shot.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/online-appts-for-jabs-fail-walk-ins-a-matter-of-luck/articleshow/82222229.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Surat||History sheeter, friend murdered in cold blood in Udhna||SURAT: A 20-year-old history sheeter and his friend were murdered in cold blood near railway tracks in Udhna on Thursday late night over a past rift. Seven persons, who had attacked goon Ajay alias Sharad Patil and his friend Ravi Sharma (22), a commerce graduate, were detained by the police on Friday. Police said that on Thursday night, Patil, Sharma and a few of their friends were having food near the railway tracks when the group of seven accused arrived there. Patil and one of the accused named Dhama had a rift in the past and they had recently reached a settlement. However, when the group arrived near the railway tracks, Patil pulled out a knife and brandished at Dhama asking the latter why he was issuing threats to his friends. Dhama allegedly asked Patil to take it easy but when he did not back down, Dhama and his six accomplices attacked Patil and Sharma. According to police, Sharma was caught along with Patil in the melee while their other friends managed to escape. The attackers stabbed the duo mercilessly in their chest, throat, back and lower abdomen. “Both of them were stabbed over two dozen times,” said inspector M V Patel of Udhna police station. Later, when the duo’s friends arrived again, they found Patil and Sharma dead following which they informed their family members and police. Based on Sharma’s brother’s complaint, a murder case was registered against Dhama, Ajay Kaliyo, Mangal Kushwaha, Vicky Pandit, Narayan Udiyo, Mohan alias Mongiya Sonavane and Vishal Vasave. Police said that the attackers and the victims know each other as they all live in the same locality. “Patil was arrested in the past in an attempt to murder case by Limbayat police and there were half-a-dozen other cases of petty crimes registered against him,” Patel added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/history-sheeter-friend-murdered-in-cold-blood-in-udhna/articleshow/82221479.cms||---

The BMC said that the new SOPs were issued to prevent a crisis of oxygen shortage in the city. As per the new guidelines, chief engineers of the BMC’s mechanical and electric departments will prepare a data sheet containing ward-wise details of all private Covid hospitals, their oxygen suppliers and types of cylinders they have. This data will be made available to the BMC’s ward war rooms and the FDA. “Hospitals must raise a demand for oxygen from their suppliers at least 24 hours before their stocks are going to exhaust. If there is no supply even 16 hours after the demand, then the hospital must inform the ward control room,” the new SOP stated. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-frames-new-sop-for-oxygen-supply-and-management-for-mumbai-hospitals/articleshow/82223098.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vaccine shortage acute, centres told to give priority to 2nd jabs||MUMBAI: Acute vaccine shortage prompted the BMC to instruct vaccination centres on Friday to prioritise those coming in for the second dose.  Across Mumbai, thousands are either being turned away or are forced to head from one centre to another looking for vaccine doses. Booking an appointment though Co-Win has become a near-impossible task. “Why are you asking the state? Ask the Centre why there are no doses,” said Dr Dilip Patil, the state’s immunisation in-charge, on Friday. With less than 7 lakh vaccine doses in its kitty, vaccination is likely to suffer majorly across Maharashtra through the weekend. In Mumbai, Dr Mangala Gomare, the BMC’s executive health officer, said they were expecting 50,000 doses on Friday. Many private centres that didn’t do vaccination through the week may remain shut. Vaccination will start late on Saturday since stocks are expected to arrive late on Friday. Due to the shortage, as many as 52 of the 132 centres couldn’t conduct sessions on Friday. Even major centres such as Nesco in Goregaon had to shut post 2pm after they ran out of doses. Dean Dr Neelam Andrade said they hope to get stocks on Saturday.  On Friday, the city could vaccinate 48,280. Malad’s Caroline Morris (45) visited eight centres with her 69-year-old mother for the second dose, but couldn’t get it. “We started at Choksi Maternity Home at Malad. We got there at 2pm and were told they had run out of Covishield. We then went to Meenatai Thackeray Blood Bank at Goregaon and later Nesco at Goregaon (E). They told us to check on Monday,” Morris said.  They then headed to Dahisar’s jumbo centre. “But the line was so long, it felt like a Covid hotspot. From there we went to Karuna Hospital, Bhagwati Hospital and HCG Cancer Centre at Borivli (W). Our last stop was Shatabdi Hospital at Kandivli, where we were told to come back on Saturday.” Andheri’s Ranjana Guha has been trying in vain to book a Co-Win appointment for her second dose. Dr Shashank Joshi, member, state Covid taskforce, said vaccination has taken a hit in the private sector. “It is worrisome that a little over 3 lakh have managed to take the second dose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-shortage-acute-centres-told-to-give-priority-to-2nd-jabs/articleshow/82222235.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Now, plant 10 trees to give it back to nature.” This is an appeal made to a Covid-19 patient on a Nagpur hospital discharge summary. The patient, a 41-year-old woman, had recovered after spending a week in the ICU. “I have resolved to plant and conserve even more than 10 trees this year. Covid-19 made me realize the cost and importance of oxygen that we get free of cost from nature,” said the woman, who was discharged from Get Well Hospital on April 22. The hospital has now started mentioning the amount of oxygen given to a hospitalized Covid-19 patient, with an appeal to plant and conserve at least 10 trees after recovery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/plant-10-trees-to-give-back-oxygen-to-nature-nagpur-hospital-to-discharged-patient/articleshow/82225081.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Noida||Noida asks hospitals facing O2 crunch to stop taking in patients||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: The district administration of Gautam Budh Nagar has stopped all private hospitals that have run out of oxygen or have inadequate stock from admitting Covid patients. Most facilities have been grappling with dwindling oxygen stock for the past few days. “The only difference between a bed at home and a bed at a hospital is that the hospital should be able to provide oxygen. When there is no oxygen, why should a hospital admit a patient? That is not treatment. So, we have stopped all private hospitals that have run out of oxygen from admitting patients. We are continuously expanding ICU facilities and have currently got 2,500 ICU beds. We can treat 3,000 Covid patients now,” district magistrate Suhas LY told TOI. He added the district needs 60 tonnes of oxygen daily right now. But it is only getting a half or a little more of that amount. Several private hospitals have started announcing “no beds” in response to calls. Prakash Hospital in Noida stopped taking in patients on Fridays. At Kailash Hospital, officials said, they are “stretched” and will soon run out of oxygen. According to senior officials and doctors, due to frequent administration of high-flow oxygen among patients, the demand has spiked in the past few days. “More than half of the patients at our hospital require oxygen and almost one-fourth of them need high-pressure oxygen flow. The demand has increased to three to four times compared to the last wave. ,” said Ajeet Kumar, joint registrar and spokesperson, Sharda School of Medical Sciences and Research, Greater Noida. The hospital has more than 700 beds. The president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Noida Chapter, NK Sharma, also spoke on similar lines. “Due to the need for high-flow oxygen support for more patients, the overall demand has gone up. Earlier, we could manage a patient with 4-5 litres of oxygen per day. But now, 14-16 litres are being consumed by some patients within a few hours.” The crisis has hit more than 30 private facilities in Ghaziabad and many small hospitals in Noida. An official in the Ghaziabad administration said: “The district is in urgent need of eight tonnes of oxygen.” Two major oxygen manufacturers, Inox and Goyal Air Products and Goyal Gases, are supplying 12 tonnes and 20 tonnes a day, respectively, in Ghaziabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-asks-hospitals-facing-o2-crunch-to-stop-taking-in-patients/articleshow/82223109.cms||Sharmila Bhowmick

The deceased, including four women and three children, were returning to their Danapur residence after ‘tilak’ (engagement) ceremony of a family member at Akilpur village in Panapur diara under Akilpur police station area in Saran district on April 21. The marriage was scheduled for April 26. Three persons, including the driver, swam to safety. The deceased were identified as Ramakant Singh (65), his wife Geeta Devi (55), brother’s wife Saroj Devi (50), nephew Arvind Singh (45), his brother’s grandson Ashish Kumar (10), sister Anuragi Devi (60) and her two grandchildren Madhu Kumari (13) and Priyansh Kumar (8) and his sister-in-law Gayatri Devi (55). CM Nitish Kumar condoled the deaths and ordered immediate ex gratia payment of Rs4 lakh each to the next of kin of the deceased. The State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) team headed by sub-inspector Ashok Kumar fished out the nine bodies and pulled out the jeep by a crane from approximately 25 feet deep water. The accident took place around 8.30am. The spot falls under the administrative jurisdiction of Danapur block of Patna district. Akilpur police station, which was earlier with Patna police, was handed over to Saran police in May 2018. Akilpur police station SHO Sanjay Ram said an iron rod which connects both the front wheels to the steering column was found disconnected at one end. “The jeep veered off to the right soon after reaching the pontoon bridge and fell into the river by breaking the iron railing. Prima facie it seems the vehicle’s steering failed due to some mechanical breakdown,” he said. He said Ramakant and Arvind lived in Chitrakoot Nagar under Danapur police station area of Patna. “Rakesh Singh, the grandson of Ramakant’s brother, was to get married on April 26. They were returning from Akilpur after the ‘tilak’ ceremony on April 21,” he said. The SHO said Anuragi’s son Rajesh Singh and his relative Sanjeet Singh were sitting on the top of the SUV. “They along with driver Madan Rai jumped off the SUV when it fell into the river. Only they survived with minor injuries. the driver fled from the spot soon,” he said. He said Saroj, Geeta, Arvind, Ramakant and Ashish were originally from Akilpur village while Gayatri belonged to Mirpur under Awatar Nagar police station area in Saran and Anuragi, Madhu and Priyansh were natives of Sirasiya village under Barhara police station of Bhojpur district. Ram said the driver also hails from Akilpur. Danapur police station SHO Ajeet Kumar Saha said the bodies were taken to Danapur sub-divisional hospital for postmortem. The Patna district administration has constituted a three-member committee headed by ADM (disaster management) to inquire into the reasons behind the accident and submit a report within 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/9-of-a-family-die-in-pontoon-bridge-accident/articleshow/82221522.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 84-year-old woman dies waiting for Covid report||KOLKATA: An 84-year-old from Kasba awaiting a Covid test report, which eventually was found to be positive, died gasping at her home on Thursday evening before the report arrived, after a desperate and futile search for a bed and oxygen throughout the day. The trauma, however, did not end there as the woman’s body began decomposing in the heat and humidity as it lay in the first-floor apartment, waiting for cremation at a Covid facility. A hearse finally arrived after 16 hours on Friday afternoon, by which time stench and panic had spread in the neighbourhood. The incident in Haltu’s Jadavgarh reflected the plight of patients around the city and the challenge the administration is facing in providing sufficient number of beds and adequate oxygen support. Suffering from high-grade fever since Monday, the woman took a rapid antigen test at a KMC clinic on Wednesday morning. “We were told my mother had Covid-19 symptoms, but weren’t provided with a report,” said her son, who works as a sales executive in a private firm. When she developed further complications and complained of respiratory distress hours later, the absence of a report posed a huge challenge. “All of Wednesday, we rushed to multiple hospitals, including MR Bangur, SSKM, Shambhunath Pandit and Beliaghata ID Hospital, along with a few local nursing homes, but were denied admission everywhere. The Covid hospitals refused us in the absence of a report and other hospitals said they didn’t have beds to spare,” the woman’s son said. The family contacted a local doctor on Thursday morning, who advised immediate oxygen support as her oxygen saturation had dropped below 80%. “We tried to get an oxygen cylinder and did the rounds of pharmacies and oxygen suppliers. But we couldn’t manage one till the evening,” he said. The family finally managed an oxygen cylinder from an acquaintance in Kasba, but by the time it arrived, the elderly homemaker had died. “I was so glad I could finally offer her some relief. But when I reached home, she was no more,” her son said, adding that the Covid report came three hours later, around 11.15pm, saying his mother was Covid positive. The trauma didn’t end with her death, however. Despite calls to the local police station, KMC office and state health department, none came to collect the body before 12.30pm on Friday, more than 16 hours after she died. The body was in a first-floor room sealed from outside, but decomposition had begun and the foul smell had engulfed the neighbourhood by morning. Three other members in the joint family are suffering from Covid. While the man’s elder brother and sister-in-law are hospitalized, his younger brother is in home isolation. Tarun Mondal, former councillor and coordinator of ward 105, said the family approached him after the woman died. “The test report was lying at the testing centre. Possibly, due to pressure of testing and patients, there was a delay in sending it to the family. When I learnt about the incident, I contacted the ward officer and made arrangements to open the clinic after office hours to get the report delivered. There was also a delay in getting a hearse from the health department. This is not an ideal situation, but we all need to understand the kind of emergency we are dealing with,” said Mondal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-dies-waiting-for-covid-report/articleshow/82221514.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

At least 312 vials were seized from Lucknow, 265 from Kanpur Nagar and 105 from Noida. Another 185 oxygen cylinders were seized in Kanpur. Additional director general of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar said, the special task force in coordination with district police are working to nab those hoarding Remdesivir, oxygen cylinders and selling these at exorbitant prices. “National Security’s Act (NSA) and Gangster Act will be invoked against them,” he said. District police have been directed to carry out operations in coordination with local intelligence units to track down middlemen and distributors hoarding medicines and oxygen cylinders, the officer said. From April 15, when Remdesiver stocks vanished from the market, STF and Kanpur police busted a gang and seized 265 vials of Remdesiver. Three persons were arrested and booked under NSA. Five days later, 20 oxygen cylinders were seized, followed by a cache of 64 empty and 50 filled cylinders in next 24 hours. Kanpur police also launched another crackdown and arrested a chemist for selling oximeter at a premium. In Noida, 100 vials of Remdesiver were seized. Lucknow police commissioner D K Thakur, said, 312 Remdesiver vials were seized and 16 arrested in last 24 hours. “Of 16 arrested, two KGMU workers, a nursing student and pharmacist were nabbed for selling fake vials,” he said. The state government is committed to facilitate availability of Remdesivir and other Covid medicines and the STF has been instructed to conduct a statewide drive to check hoarding,” said Awanish Kumar Awasthi, adding “various intelligence agencies have been deployed to check illegal sale.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/remdesivir-hoarding-29-held-with-600-vials/articleshow/82223096.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Don’t forget to donate blood before your shot, say docs||Nagpur: Blood banks and doctors have appealed to all those who regularly donate blood to use the next six days, from April 24 to 30, to voluntarily come foreard as vaccination for all aged above 18 years will start on May 1. It not possible for a vaccinated person to donate blood for at least 60 days, as per rules. This may thus create a major crisis in blood banks because the majority of voluntary blood donors are in the 18-to-45 age group. “It’s not possible to conduct blood donation camps with the current restrictions. We can’t gather in more numbers. In such a case, healthy youths should visit blood banks in person and voluntarily donate blood before taking the Covid-19 jab,” said Dr Harish Warbhe, medical director of Lifeline Blood Bank. TOI had reported in March about National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) directives that those who take the Covid-19 vaccine should not donate blood up to 28 days from the second dose of the vaccine. The NBTC had issued these instructions to all blood banks in the country.  Blood donation has already been restricted and blood banks are facing a shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-dont-forget-to-donate-blood-before-your-shot-say-docs/articleshow/82222237.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

But the street-level sampling of pollutants will help us take more specific targeted action on the ground,” K J Ramesh, full-time technical member of the commission, told TOI on Saturday. Ramesh, former director general of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, “We would, meanwhile, keep on working on strict implementation of the existing graded response action plan (GRAP). We will soon finalise the modalities of our priority actions, including use of drones for street-level sampling of pollutants.” Besides Ramesh, there are two full-time members, including former chief secretary of Delhi, M M Kutty, who has been retained as chairperson of the reconstituted commission. Professor Mukesh Khare of IIT, Delhi, however, opted out of the panel due to his existing responsibility. Khare was one of the full-time technical members of the earlier commission, which ceased to exist on March 12 after lapse of the original ordinance. The environment ministry has included representatives from five ministries – transport, power, petroleum, agriculture and commerce & industry – as associate members in the new 18-member panel, responsible for monitoring and enforcement of law relating to air quality in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas spread over four states — Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab. Few other members, including two from NGOs and three representatives from agriculture, transport and construction sectors, will be included in the expanded panel in due course. Asked about the provision where the repromulgated ordinance spared farmers from hefty penalty (of up to Rs 1 crore) and jail terms (of up to five years) for stubble burning, Ramesh said the existing laws in states to deal with the problem through local bodies would, however, continue to be applicable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-quality-panel-to-focus-on-stubble-fires-use-drones-to-collect-samples/articleshow/82235819.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Lucknow||UP CM Yogi Adityanath informs PM Modi on steps taken to tackle Covid-19||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday attended the virtual meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with CMs of various states and informed him about the steps being taken by the Uttar Pradesh government to ensure the availability of oxygen and essential drugs for Covid-19 patients. He updated the PM on UP’s Covid-19 statistics, treatment, availability of beds and preparations for vaccination rollout for people above 18 years. Health minister Jai Pratap Singh said the Centre is already providing financial support to UP for infrastructure like oxygen plants.UP is in a comfortable position so far as facilities for patients are concerned. The CM informed the PM about the availability of oxygen and Remdesivir. To augment availability of oxygen, we are getting supply from various plants across the country. We are also tying up directly with vaccine manufacturers to procure sufficient doses for the next phase of vaccination,” Singh said. Later in the day, the CM also held a review meeting with Team 11 to take stock of Covid-19 situation in the state. Officials said the availability of oxygen in UP, especially in Lucknow, would improve over the next few days as the government is expecting a steady supply of oxygen from Saturday. “Inoculation will continue during the weekend lockdown and those going for vaccine dose should not be stopped,” the CM said. A web portal, Oxytracker, was also launched on Friday for the CM to monitor the demand for oxygen, availability and location of vehicles in real time. He also thanked the Centre for ‘Oxygen Express’ which has been started to transport oxygen from one state to another. Yogi also issued directions to officials to carry out an oxygen audit of all hospitals and said people in home-isolation should be provided oxygen as per requirement. “There is no shortage of life-saving medicines like Remdesivir. Medicines should be supplied to hospitals in a transparent manner and officials should ensure that all those who genuinely need it get access to it,” Yogi said. Speaking on vaccination for all people above 18 years of age from May 1, the CM said vaccines would be free for everyone. To ensure smooth operation of the campaign, a committee has been set up under the chairpersonship of finance minister Suresh Khanna which has health minister, MSME minister, additional chief secretary (health), additional chief secretary (finance), additional chief secretary (medical education), additional chief secretary (MSME) and Dr GN Singh as its members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-informs-pm-on-steps-taken-to-tackle-covid-19/articleshow/82223104.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kishore Bharati Stadium set to become a corona hosp; city to get 200 more beds||Kolkata: Kishore Bharati Stadium could soon turn into a Covid hospital once Medica Superspecialty Hospital gets the final nod from the state government. The hospital is planning to set up a 200-bedded temporary Covid unit there. Sources said the hospital had filed a tender with the government and a response is expected in a day or two. “Once we get the permission, we can set up the unit in about a week. We have started hiring doctors, nurses and other supporting staff. We have also started the process of procuring equipment,” said Alok Roy, chairman of Medica Group of Hospitals. This, however, is not the first time a stadium is being converted into a Covid hospital. The state health department itself had initiated one such unit at the Canning stadium in South 24 Parganas during the peak of the first wave. The 55-bedded stadium hospital is catering to positive patients at present. A team from Medica has already inspected Kishore Bharti Stadium. Two spacious green rooms have the capacity to accommodate around 100 beds each. One of the room is air-conditioned. The AC green room is likely to be reserved for the HDU ward and the other room will house 100 general beds. “We plan to have 100 HDU beds to tend to patients who require oxygen therapy. These beds will have all monitoring gadgets while the other 100 will be general beds. We can set up the unit and make it operational in about a week after getting the permission,” said Roy. Other private hospitals, however, said they didn’t have manpower to take up stadia or banquet halls and they will concentrate on scaling up beds in their existing facilities and satellite centres. “We have already started 30 beds, including 12 ICU beds, in the new building of our Mukundapur unit where we plan to add 70 more beds. This is in addition to 70 plus Covid bed we already have there. The need of the hour is critical care beds. So we plan to have 50% CCU beds in this 100-bedded unit. We are waiting for some equipment and manpower,” said Rupak Barua, CEO of AMRI Group of Hospitals. Belle Vue Clinic has added 14 more beds in the past couple of days to take the Covid bed count to 174. By next week, the hospital will have 23 more beds. “We don’t have manpower to take over stadiums. But we will scale up beds in the hospital as and when possible. Meanwhile, we have started one satellite unit with 40 beds. We will take over another hotel once those 40 beds are taken up,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO of Belle Vue Clinic. Meanwhile, the government will add 5,573 more beds across its facilities in the state. This include 100 beds at RG Kar Medical College and adding 150 beds to Sambhunath Pandit’s existing 250 beds. Five more alternative medicine colleges in the city will also be taken over as Covid hospitals, adding about 350 beds. Medical officers and nurses from the state health department, along with homeopathy and ayurvedic doctors, will run these units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kishore-bharati-stadium-set-to-become-a-corona-hosp-city-to-get-200-more-beds/articleshow/82221525.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The defence aircraft took off from the Begumpet airport and are expected to return with oxygen supply in the next few days. It is being said that this is probably the first time that oxygen cylinders have been transported by air. Speaking about the development, Telangana’s health minister Eatala Rajender said that generally it takes several days for the process — to send and get filled oxygen tankers — and therefore, the government chose to use use aircraft to reduce the time. “The decision taken by the Telangana government to airlift tankers to Odisha will save three days worth of time,” Rajender said. The empty tankers were sent to Odisha in two C-17 jets to bring back 150 metric tonnes of oxygen. They will be loaded with oxygen supplies from Angul, Rourkela Steel plant. While some of the tankers were dispatched in the morning, a second flight with four tankers were flown out of Begumpet in the evening, said officials. The health minister said it was on the directions of chief minister, K Chandrasekhar Rao, that defence aircraft were used to get oxygen supplies for the state and reiterated that the government is fully prepared and committed to attend to those affected by the cornonavirus, without worrying about finances and additional expenditures. Sharing that liquid oxygen tanks have been set up in 22 government hospitals, the health minister assured that Telangana will ensure there is no shortage of oxygen in the coming days. Wing Commanders Chaitanya and Nirjawan from the Indian Air Force are coordinating with the state government for this work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-airlifts-9-tankers-to-odisha-to-source-oxygen/articleshow/82222245.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Lucknow||Industry assn assurance on O2 supply||Lucknow: After a meeting with the industries department on Friday, the Indian Industries Association (IIA) has assured the government of full support in terms of oxygen supply and supply of medical essentials. IIA said that units which are interested in setting up oxygen plants can contact the MSME department for assistance. Meanwhile, all members have been requested to divert oxygen to the government for medical use. IIA national president Pankaj Kumar said that a meeting was convened by MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh and industrial development minister Satish Mahana earlier in the week to discuss these issues. “I appeal to all entrepreneurs to cooperate with each other in the hour of crisis. Ensure full compliance with government SOPs and guidelines related to health, and vow to supply oxygen to health centres or hospitals and cut down usage in their industries,” he said. The government has also issued an order for industries under which it said that no factory or unit will close even during curfew hours. All employees are to be given identity cards so that they can travel without being stopped. Covid protocols are to be followed strictly while Covid help desks are to be set up in each unit and employees will be given masks and sanitisers. The order says that factories where workers come from long distances should made arrangements for their stay so that they do not need to travel. Factories making masks, medical kits should be asked to expand their production capacity. Distilleries and sugar mills which supply material for manufacturing sanitisers should be given licenses at the earliest. The government will provide full support to all such MSMEs which want to manufacture any kits related to Covid-19 management. DMs have been asked to ensure that there is no disruption to food processing units and those involved in manufacturing of essential goods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/industry-assn-assurance-on-o2-supply/articleshow/82223115.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||We have to do the firefighting, HC tells Centre, Delhi on oxygen crisis||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Friday directed the Centre and Delhi government to take necessary steps to meet the oxygen shortfall in all city hospitals after two more hospitals knocked on its doors. During the hearing before Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, senior advocate Siddharth Dave, appearing for Batra Hospital, one of the two petitioners, said it had received 2.5 metric tonnes (MT) of liquid oxygen around 3pm, but it was going to last only till 9pm. The bench noted, “His grievance is that if further supply is not made, the hospital will be left with no supply and critical patients will suffer.” It ordered, “We direct the respondents to keep in mind the aforesaid submission of Mr Dave, and take necessary steps in this regard, not only in relation to the two hospitals before us, but all others who are serving serious Covid patients and other patients who are in need of medical oxygen.” The court enquired with the counsels appearing for Delhi and the Centre if CNG cylinders could be used for storage and transportation of medical oxygen. Both governments assured to looking into it. The bench was informed about the Prime Minister’s meeting with the chief ministers of a few states over oxygen shortage. “Now the initiative is at the very top. The railways has also started looking at it. It will take some time. Nudging of Delhi High Court has done it and shown that it’s not a distant dream,” said senior advocate Rahul Mehra appearing for Delhi government. Justice Sanghi, however, remarked, “Till that gets operationalised, we have to do the firefighting.” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta placed a letter of the central representative, additional secretary Piyush Goel, on record. States and Union territories shall circulate the contact details of their nodal officers who are supposed to address the grievances of the hospitals in case of an oxygen crisis, the letter stated. “These nodal officers are part of a virtual central control room,” it added. Mehra, on the other hand, submitted that across the national capital, most hospitals were stopping fresh admissions owing to “lack of faith” and “huge panic” that medical oxygen won’t reach on time. Mehra urged the bench to consider if the deficit of 100 metric tonne could be provided to fill the gap in the allocated 480MT. The court emphasised that though there was an assurance given by Solicitor General Mehta that 480MT would be supplied, the same hadn’t fructified primarily because the three points of supply locations were situated somewhere between 1,200-1,600km from Delhi. Mehra and advocate Satyakam submitted a list of oxygen cylinder refilling resources for smaller hospitals and nursing homes. It was also said that after the court’s intervention, Delhi had received slightly more oxygen from neighbouring states. “Received 350MT yesterday,” Mehra said. The counsel for the other petitioner, Bram Healthcare, submitted that the hospital had been unsuccessful in procuring medical oxygen from a refilling unit since 5am. He also complained that the nodal officer appointed by Delhi government didn’t respond to repeated requests. The court, therefore, directed Udit Prakash, special secretary of the health department, to take steps immediately. It suggested that looking into the number of hospitals and nursing homes treating serious Covid patients, more capable persons must work with Prakash and their numbers should also be circulated with all concerned “so that the grievances with regard to shortage of medical oxygen can be attended to immediately”. Delhi government assured that all necessary steps would be taken and if any hospital was unable to get help from the nodal officers, its counsels, Mehra or Satyakam, could be contacted. Their phone numbers “will be circulated among all nursing homes and hospitals dealing with Covid patients”, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/we-have-to-do-the-firefighting-hc-tells-centre-delhi-on-oxygen-crisis/articleshow/82223154.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Govt staff seek poll duty exemption, cite Covid rage||HYDERABAD: With a rapid surge in Covid-19 cases in the state, including districts and towns where civic polls will be held, government employees who have been drafted for poll duties are seeking exemption from election duties. Some employees said that since they are above 50 and suffer from co-morbidities, they should not be drafted for election duties. About 70 staff involved in election-related work have already been infected with Covid-19 in districts, sources said. District collectors, however, instructed the returning officers not to entertain any requests of exemption from poll duties unless it is a health condition. Telangana state election commissioner C Partha Sarathi said only 5% staff may get exemption for any major reasons. Admitting that requests have been pouring in from employees seeking poll duty exemptions, a GWMC official said they are not giving exemptions except for strong medical reasons. Elections to two corporations Greater Warangal and Khammam, five municipalities and some vacancies in other civic bodies are being held on April 30 and polling staff have to report for the duties a day before the polling. Official sources said some are worried as they have to allow even Covid-19 patients in the last one hour of the polling. This time, teachers have also been drafted for the polling. Telangana state election commissioner C Partha Sarathi told TOI that all precautions are being taken for the polling staff like complete sanitisation of the polling booths a day before the arrival of polling staff. “Generally, we keep 20% manpower reserve for polling duties. Collectors have powers to draw employees from any part of their districts for election duties,” the election commissioner said. The election authorities said polling staff and security personnel would be given mask, sanitisers, face shield and hand gloves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-staff-seek-poll-duty-exemption-cite-covid-rage/articleshow/82222247.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Delhi||How City’s Do-Gooders Are Trying To Ease Pain||New Delhi: There is not been even one second when child activist Yogita Bhayana’s phone has been silent this past week. And constant messages on Twitter and Facebook have kept her and her seven-member team on their toes as social media has become the trusted platform for Covid-hit families searching for authentic information and assistance on medicines, hospital beds and blood plasma. Till the start of last week, Bhayana hadn’t reckoned with the severity of the upsurge in Covid infection. But when she began to help a few people, she discovered the big odds that people of all economic classes were facing coordinate. “That is where we come in,” she said. “It is a relief for them to have someone calling the hospitals for beds and chemists for medicines.” When she started to get more requests than she could herself handle, Bhayana got seven people to join in. “We call hospitals to check for bed availability, search for plasmas, authenticate information about oxygen cylinders and scour for medicines.” But things are tough now. “The last 24 hours has been bad and we expect the government to run a helpline to give people such information,” she said. When oxygen cylinder for an octogenarian patient in Kalkaji was running out, his relative tweeted an SOS tagging it to, among others, @srinivasiyc. A series of communications over WhatsApp followed and a few hours later a person reached the Kalkaji home with a 10-litre oxygen cylinder. B V Srinivas once again provided a ray of light amidst the darkness. The 41-year-old Youth Congress Delhi head was busy having oxygen cylinders refilled on Friday. He stopped to say, “In the beginning, people tagged me on Twitter, but now most pleas for help are on the phone.” He claimed to have provided assistance to more than 30,000 people so far, all for free, including 300 requests for blood plasma. Srinivas is helped by an army of around 1,000 individuals, 100 of them based in Delhi. “We get around 9,000 requests every day, and almost 90,000 have sought help. Unfortunately, the crisis is so massive that we can’t help everyone,” he added. Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga of BJP also barely gets to sleep these days. His phone is constantly buzzing. At 2am on Friday, someone tagged him on a post on urgent need of oxygen. He did not mind the hour, but arranged the gas for the patient. “I get a thousand calls and messages for help every day. I am obviously unable to respond to every plea, but my effort is to assist as many as possible,” said Bagga. “The blessings of the people keep me going.” Members of Indian Civil Liberties Union (ICLU), a legal support group, also started to get regular SOS messages from last week, prompting a focus on relief efforts. “Our 40-member team and many volunteers, led by Sanobar, work on verification till 11pm. What we do is to check our networks when we receive a request and establish a connection,” said ICLU founder and advocate Anas Tanvir. Many similar voluntary groups have cropped up. Engineer and writer Kaushik Raj is on the 50-member Corona Virus Helpdesk. “We have assigned some with the task of taking calls. Once these are put on the request section, other volunteers check where the required resources are available and send them to the requestors.” When it began a few days ago, the helpdesk got over 200 response in the very first hour, according to Raj. “People found that with volunteers working on their specific requests, it streamlined all searches on Twitter,” Raj explained. Old Delhi entrepreneur Abu Sufyan had formed a relief group last year and regularly posted stories on Instagram. He is now part of several voluntary groups that count over 200 people as members. “We locate medicines, plasma, hospital beds and then we connect this information with the people who reach out to us on Instagram. We are functioning from Instagram because the interface is easier thus,” said Sufyan. The old Delhi resident said that with so many people chipping in, getting information had become easier. “But the situation is dire, with many leads often turning into dead ends,” Sufyan added. “There is a need for help from the government now. We can only do so much.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-citys-do-gooders-are-trying-to-ease-pain/articleshow/82223189.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Kolkata||City housing societies cold to civic body’s proposal for isolation units||Kolkata: KMC on Friday sent out advisory to all major housing complexes and high-rises in the city, asking them to convert their community halls into isolation units for Covid patients on the premises. A similar initiative was taken last year but this time, most complex representatives TOI spoke to seemed apprehensive about setting up isolation centres inside the compound on two accounts: the severity and unpredictability of the virus, and lack of transparency over legal liability in case of casualties at the units. “Being a conglomeration of a large number of people, high-rises also pose the risk of turning into Covid hotspots... It will be prudent to make available for such individuals a safe and hygienic isolation facility inside the complexes and buildings… The president and secretaries of such housing societies/complexes are requested to take necessary and early action for conversion of their community halls into isolation centres with adequate beds and supply of oxygen...” the letter signed by KMC commissioner Binod Kumar read. Most housing societies pointed out they had ample space but needed government help for steady supply of oxygen and other set-ups, along with dedicated doctors and nurses. “We have two large community centres that we can convert into safe homes. But the government should provide us with doctors, nurses and a steady supply of oxygen and other equipment. We are ready to pay,” said Deepak Agarwal of Diamond City West. Debjani Mukherjee of Urbana and Manak Daga of South City also said they were not ready to set up isolation units by themselves owing to the lack of clarity on who should be responsible in case anything untoward happens to a patient. Sameer Sharma of New Town Heights also seemed concerned: “We can try and arrange for oxygen but we need proper doctors, nurses and paramedics.” A senior KMC health official accepted the concerns. “We have asked our health officials in the boroughs to locate and identify willing complexes . If need be, we will help set up such units,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-housing-societies-cold-to-civic-bodys-proposal-for-isolation-units/articleshow/82222264.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The embezzlement cam to light when V Rajesh, HDB financial services zonal manager (Trichy), carried out a surprise audit at its Pudukottai town branch a few days back. The audit found 2,716g (305.6 sovereign) of gold pledged by 74 customers missing from the branch. Suspecting foul play by his staff including Pudukottai branch manager C Uma Sankar, 42, he lodged a police complaint on Thursday with the Ganesh Nagar police station in Pudukottai town. DSP K Senthil Kumar said that Uma Sankar, who had joined as manager a couple of years back, resorted to illegal means to meet his annual target of Rs 1.5 crore as he had to get more customers pledge their jewels for loans, but struggled. He lured local pawn shops to pledge gold jewellery pledged by customers in their shop in HDB finance services. For this, he offered them slightly higher interest. Since he had to bore the burden of additional interest, he had to borrow money for interest. At one stage, he could not manage the burden and decided to collude with Marimutthu, manager of Indel Money – another non-banking finance company in Pudukottai town. He pledged 2,716g of gold in Indel Money to manage the crisis but it was busted by the surprise inspection. Police arrested, Uma Sankar, R Solaimalai, 37, appraiser, P Muthu Kumar, 28, office staff, apart from Marimutthu. Ganesh Nagar police booked all the four under section 381 for theft and further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/managers-of-2-fin-cos-arrested-for-embezzlement/articleshow/82222246.cms||---

Trichy collector S Divyadharshini convened a meeting with the deputy director of health services (DDHS) Dr S Ramganesh, all block medical officers, tahsildars and other officials to discuss the facilities being made available to accommodate as many patients as possible in the days to come. The collector listed out the bed facilities available in the hospitals and the colleges. The district administration has made 160 beds in Bharathidasan University in Kajamalai, 550 beds at government engineering college at Sethurapatti, 500 beds at Bishop Heber college in Trichy city, 150 beds at Kurinji engineering college in Manapparai, 140 beds at Nehru memorial arts and science college at Puthanampatti and 160 beds at SRM medical college at Irungalur available to treat the patients based on the intensity of the infection. More than 750 beds are also reserved at the old buildings of Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital(MGMGH) in Trichy. The collector advised the block development officers (BDOs) to ensure the beds used by the patients are replaced with new ones after their discharge. The public health department has vaccinated 3,296 people including those taking second dose. As of today, the district covered 1,89,586 people under the vaccination in government and privatehealth centres.

---||Trichy||Linking underpaid teachers, students seeking tuition||Trichy: A social activist has come forward to bridge the gap between parents looking for home tuitions and and private school teachers struggling with curtailed salaries in the wake of the pandemic-induced crisis. M Sekaran, president of the federation of consumer and service organisations, Trichy, has now started a WhatsApp group to link the two. With students finding it difficult to focus on online classes, the demand for home tuitions has been increasing in recent months. On the other hand, private school teachers have been making ends meet with half the salaries they were drawing, and looking for additional opportunities. Sekaran says he has been receiving good response for the initiative with at least 20 people joining the group. School and college students had to rely on online classes for the whole of last year since April. While physical classes were conducted for students for the last two months, increasing Covid-19 cases have made the schools switch back to online. Sekaran said he had come across parents who have been looking for home tuition for their wards as online classes are not as effective as offline classroom education. “Since teachers in private school are underpaid due to the pandemic, they can utilise the demand for home tuition to improve their earnings,” he said. J Shanmuganathan, father of a class XII CBSE student in Trichy, said he is looking for a tutor for his daughter as she who could not focus on her board examination preparation after attending online classes in isolation. He has advertised in newspapers asking for a teacher or college student who can clear his daughter’s doubts and help her relieve stress. He is ready to pay up to Rs 7,000 a month. “Teachers in private schools are already underpaid and Covid-19 pandemic has halved the salaries since it struck,” said V Kamatchi, 36, a private school teacher from Trichy who counts on home tuition as an option to increase their income.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/linking-underpaid-teachers-students-seeking-tuition/articleshow/82222262.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While the state government did not allocate MLALAD funds to Sikandra in Kanpur Dehat, currently represented by state minister for electronics and IT Ajit Pal Singh, it announced funds for Swar seat in Rampur which had fallen vacant after the Allahabad High Court, in December 2019, declared the election of Abdullah Azam, son for senior SP leader and party MP Azam Khan, as invalid following discrepancy in affidavit regarding his age. The rural development department, which had issued the order on April 12, has removed the anomaly through a fresh order. In the latest order, principal secretary, rural development, K Ravindra Naik said, “Corrections have been made and chief development officers (CDOs) of the two districts have been informed about it. Funds have been allocated to Sikandra while MLALAD announced for Swar has been cancelled.” The state government had suspended MLALAD funds in April last year during the first wave of coronavirus pandemic to mop up Rs 1,500 crore for Covid care. The state cabinet had decided that legislators and ministers, including the Chief Minister, would take a 30% pay cut and the money saved would be used for Covid care. On April 12, the rural development department issued the order releasing the first instalment of Rs 1.5 crore to all the members of legislative assembly and legislative council. In all, the department announced release of Rs 750 crore for the purpose. The move came just ahead of the ongoing panchayat elections and in the run up to assembly elections due next year. The state had also decided to raise the MLALAD corpus from Rs 2.4 crore to Rs 3 crore per annum while making the provision of Rs 2,400 crore in the state budget for 2021-22. Officials in rural development department said funds allocated to legislators would be utilised as per rules and government orders issued from time to time. The finance department has also been issuing directions for utilization of funds as per the budget manual.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-declares-mlalad-fund-for-vacant-seat-rectifies-error/articleshow/82223167.cms||Pankaj Shah

The decision was taken after a peace committee meeting held in the village headed by officials from the district administration and TNSCB staff on Friday.TNSCB could not go ahead with the construction activity on Thursday after over a hundred villagers lay siege to the earth movers brought by TNSCB for the work. Following this, the district administration called for a peace committee meeting on Friday and conducted talks with the villagers.K Loganathan, one of the advocates representing the villagers, said that the village has plans to utilize the land for upgrading a school to higher secondary level besides building a primary health centre. They had already passed a resolution in the panchayat in this regard.Alagu Ponniah, executive engineer from TNSCB, clarified that they had taken over the land in February this year and started planning for the construction work. However, Loganathan said that as per panchayat raj Act, panchayat land will require 30 days public notice for any acquisition. But no such procedure was followed in this case, he added.It was decided in the meeting that the construction activity cannot happen without the consent of the locals. Therefore, the TNSCB has been asked to suspend the work and officials from the district administration have planned to carry out next round of talks in a few days to find an amicable solution for the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tnscb-temporarily-halts-building-works-at-pudukottai-village/articleshow/82222280.cms||---

In Durgapur, CM Mamata Banerjee on Friday alleged that diversion of oxygen was a deliberate act by the Centre to precipitate the crisis and take its benefit in the election. “To win Bengal, BJP has increased the Covid infection across the country. Our oxygen supply chain is being diverted to Uttar Pradesh,” she said. “There are only 20,000 oxygen cylinders in the state. Where will we get oxygen from? The central government wants to worsen the situation in Bengal,” Mamata said, blaming the Centre of neglect that worsened the Covid situation. The CM’s reaction in the wake of allotment by the Union ministry of health & family welfare on April 21 of 200 tonnes of oxygen from different plants in Bengal to other states. “As per the current patient load and rising trend of the infection, the consumption level in Bengal is expected to rise to 450 tonnes per day in the next couple of weeks. Allocation of liquid oxygen outside Bengal will jeopardize the medical treatment of Covid patients here,” read a government statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-hits-back-at-centre-over-oxygen-diversion/articleshow/82221556.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||India||US may not rush inputs for vaccines, Germany rethinks pharma sector aid||NEW DELHI: As India’s Covid crisis deepens, US rejected a key demand by Indian vaccine makers, indicating it would prioritise its own citizens before addressing India’s request for vaccine components. Responding to journalists, the US state department spokesperson said, “we have a special responsibility to the American people”. He added, “It’s of course not only in our interest to see Americans vaccinated; it’s in the interests of the rest of the world to see Americans vaccinated.” The implied subtext was that vaccination of Indians was less important even as non-availability of the components will be a blow to India’s vaccine programme. Foreign minister S Jaishankar has held a couple of rounds of discussions with counterpart Anthony Blinken on easing of the US export embargo. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla has held similar discussions with Wendy Sherman, US deputy secretary. Washington sources said some US Congressmen have also expressed support. But that getting a positive response is going to be difficult is now clear. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed doubts about helping India develop its pharma sector, especially as India tightened its pharma exports in the context of the ongoing Covid crisis.Merkel was quoted as saying by Politico, “We now have a situation with India where, in connection with the emergency situation of the pandemic, we are worried whether the pharmaceutical products will still come to us,” observed Merkel. “Of course, we have only allowed India to become such a large pharmaceutical producer in the first place, also from the European side, in the expectation that this should then also be complied with. If that is not the case now, we will have to rethink.” Indicating that Germany might rethink its own industrial policies Merkel said, “The truth is, we haven’t treated our pharmaceutical industry so well for many years.” On Thursday, John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned India against blocking vaccine exports to Africa under the COVAX program. “If you finish vaccinating your people before Africa or other parts of the world, you have not done yourself any justice because variants will emerge and undermine your own vaccination efforts,” Nkengasong said. Most countries in Africa haven’t even begun their vaccinations, while many others have been reported as saying they don’t know whether they would be able to get their second jab at all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-may-not-rush-inputs-for-vaccines-germany-rethinks-pharma-sector-aid/articleshow/82225033.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Pvt hosps may relocate vax sites to inoculate more from May 1||KOLKATA: Some private hospitals in the city will start shifting out their vaccination centres or relocating those on the hospital premises soon. The inoculation drive is set to be opened to all above 18 from May 1 and vaccination centres are expecting a massive turnout. “Shifting the vaccination site will also allow us to utilize that space for Covid care. We are also expecting a surge in the number of people who will want the shot once it is made available to all above 18. People might also feel more comfortable going to a vaccination centre away from the hospital because of the Covid situation,” said AMRI Group CEO Rupak Barua. The hospital group has started talking to a school close to the Dhakuria unit so that its vaccination centre can be relocated to the school campus before May 1. CMRI hospital will relocate its Covid vaccination centre from its ground-floor unit to a more spacious auditorium. “This auditorium is spacious and has a separate gate. We can also double the number of recipients from what we handling at present. There will definitely be a surge in footfall once the drive is opened to all above 18,” said Simmardeep Gill, COO, CK Birla Hospitals CMRI. The likes of Belle Vue, Peerless and Fortis, however, are yet to take a call on shifting their CVCs. Medica Hospital might take its vaccination centre to the Kishore Bharti stadium if they get the auditorium for the Covid unit. “Our vaccination centre is a makeshift erection in the courtyard. Even if we relocate, this space cannot be used for Covid care,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO, Peerless Hospital. “Our CVC located in the eye hospital will stay there since it has nothing to do with the Covid unit,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO, Belle Vue Clinic. Meanwhile, government CVCs in Bidhannagar complained of shortage of vaccine on Friday and one of the seven urban primary health centres was shut. from today while the remaining six complained of shortage. Many people had to return without getting the shot. The three sites attached with hospitals at EE Block and Rajarhat also saw a huge rush on Friday. Doctors across the country are reportedly seeing a fewer number of people who have been vaccinated fall ill to Covid in the second wave. Most, even if they get infected after vaccination, are getting a less severe form of the disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-may-relocate-vax-sites-to-inoculate-more-from-may-1/articleshow/82221571.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Aurangabad||Furnish PIL over O2, Remdesivirsupply issues: HC to amicus curiae||Aurangabad: Taking suo motu cognizance of media reports highlighting the medical oxygen and Remdesivir injection supply issues, the Bombay high court at Aurangabad on Thursday appointed lawyer S S Bora as an amicus curiae (friend of the court) and directed the latter to present a public interest litigation (PIL) detailing the matter at the next hearing on April 26. “Since we are apprised of the fact that the Supreme Court has placed matters pertaining to supply of oxygen and Remdesivir injections for hearing on Friday, April 23, 2021, we expect the amicus curiae to keep track of the said proceedings and in the event all matters are transferred for common hearing before the Supreme Court, he may point this out to us on April 26, 2021,” the HC bench of Justices Ravindra Ghuge and B U Debadwar said. The SC on Thursday on its own had taken cognizance of what it called a “national health emergency situation” and asked the Centre to furnish within 24hrs a national plan on bolstering supply of oxygen, medicines, treatment and vaccines. The SC’s directive came after it noticed that as many as six high courts had taken up proceedings on treatment of Covid-19 patients and passed orders that could affect distribution of precious resources like oxygen and medicines. The HC at Aurangabad referred to total 14 newspaper cuttings and said, “…this court finds it appropriate to take suo motu cognizance of the news reports.” Government pleader and chief public prosecutor DR Kale submitted on the occasion that the Union of India also needs to be arrayed as one of the respondents since it is the central government which decides the quota for distribution of oxygen and Remdesivir injections to various states, depending upon the population and the need of such states. The bench said, “We find that the divisional commissioner, Aurangabad, the commissioner of police, Aurangabad, the district collectors of the districts amenable to the jurisdiction of this court, the commissioners/administrators of the municipal corporations within the districts amenable to the jurisdiction of this court and the district superintendents of police of such districts have to be arrayed as the respondents. We also expect the secretary of public health department and the secretary of food and drugs department of Maharashtra to be arrayed as respondents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/furnish-pil-over-o2-remdesivirsupply-issues-hc-to-amicus-curiae/articleshow/82220075.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Trichy||Trichy corporation hikes water, UGD charges all on a sudden, residents fume||Trichy: In a decision that has left the residents fuming, the Trichy Corporation has increased the underground drainage (UGD) and water charges for residential and commercial properties without any prior intimation. While the UGD charge was hiked by over 130%, the water charge was increased by 12.5%. The hike comes at a time when the pandemic is taking a toll on the income generation capacity of the public. The local body had previously increased the water charges in April 2017. Stating that it has provisions to hike the water charge for not less than 10% once in every four years, the corporation passed a resolution recently revising the annual water charge from Rs 1,920 to Rs 2,160 for domestic connections. The deposit fee for water connection was increased from Rs 6,000 to Rs 6,600 with effect from April 1, 2021. Non-domestic and industrial water charge has also increased by 10% and 10.5% respectively. Similarly, the UGD fee was doubled from Rs 720 to Rs 1,680 per year. The UGD fee is to be calculated based on the square feet rate instead of the slab rate. “People have lost business, jobs and some have lost their breadwinners to Covid-19. Due to poor quality water, people are buying packaged water cans,” president of Lingam Nagar residents association, M Sivakumar said. While several houses were deprived of drinking water for the past few months, the hike in water charge has enraged the locals. “There was no intimation about the hike. Why should we pay when the service is poor? Garbage mounds on streets stand as a testimony for the corporation’s service,” V Nadaraja, district president, AITUC said. In the absence of an elected council, the drastic surge in service charges is likely to push property owners to increase the rent and maintenance charges. “The hike was part of the revenue generation measure. We have informed the public about this move long back after we passed a bylaw,” corporation commissioner S Sivasubramanian told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corporation-hikes-water-ugd-charges-all-on-a-sudden-residents-fume/articleshow/82222290.cms||Deepak Karthik

I have never missed a vote, this is the first time. I decided not to go because Covid is a bigger danger than anything else.” The elections should have been postponed to the end of next month, she opined. “Our government cannot be trusted to keep the people safe. They are selfish. They should at least have postponed the elections till things settled down,” she added. Another senior citizen with comorbidities from Borda, who takes all precautions against Covid, decided she would go at lunch time 1:30pm and leave immediately if she found a queue there. She, however, was able to vote, as there was no rush. She wore disposable gloves and a face shield over her face mask, and took her own pen to the polling booth. “At least someone from our family has to show up to vote, otherwise it doesn’t look good,” she told TOI. She didn’t take her husband along, fearing that he would touch surfaces unnecessarily and not follow Covid protocol. Other seniors were prevented from going to vote by their children. “My children went to vote, but didn’t allow me to go,” one woman told TOI. “I was a regular voter otherwise, and even voted in the last election. This time they told me stay at home because it’s dangerous and it’s difficult to tell who is carrying the virus. Once you get Covid, it’s difficult to get out of it.” Her children had a bath and changed their clothes after they got back from the polling station, she said, adding that their family personally knows people who suffered very bad outcomes of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-covid-19-everywhere-senior-citizens-give-civic-elections-a-miss/articleshow/82223205.cms||---

A state government spokesperson said that efforts of the state government have resulted in economic prosperity of villages and social uplift of villagers. At the same time, the state government has given housing facilities to lakhs of families in just four years. Under his governance, electricity connections were provided to over 10 million families. In fact, the state government believes if the panchayats become self-reliant, then every person in the village will become self-reliant. It claimed to have worked for the welfare of the marginalised Musahar community. The government provided 28,295 housing facilities to the Musahar community. In order to promote not only social and economic development in villages of Uttar Pradesh, but also to boost the income of agriculture, commerce, tourism and industries, road construction work is also being done by the government on a large-scale. In the last four years, the UP government has constructed 10,162 km of roads under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. Whereas around 41,212 km of roads were made free of potholes. To double the income of farmers, plantation and land development works have been done on individual land under MNREGA.

---||Kolkata||CBSE replaces rote learning with critical thinking||Kolkata: Questions based on unfamiliar real-life scenarios would be set for students of classes IX-XII at CBSE schools from this academic session, a circular issued by the board stated. Schools have been asked to change the exam pattern according to the directive. The change has been brought in, CBSE officials said, so that students don’t follow rote pattern but practise critical and creative thinking. According to the circular, the new exam pattern will have 30% questions from the competency-based section, demanding creative and critical thinking, for IX-X. For classes XI-XII, 20% questions will be from this section. The duration of the exams and the total scores will remain the same. City schools said they would modify the pattern at the earliest, initiate the competency-based questions in online classes and use them in unit tests to term exams. “Teachers will have to lead the kids into thinking beyond the obvious. This new exam section will test a child’s understanding of concepts, presence of mind and application of problem-solving skills,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal at Asian International School. Many school heads said they saw this coming as it was in line with the NEP, which discouraged rote learning. “Your basics have to be clear and you should be able to apply the concepts to solve real-life problems. This is the hallmark of education,” said Meena Kak, director at Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. , Birla High School principal Loveleen Saigal stressed applying, rather than memorising, was what every competitive entrance test expected of students.

---||Trichy||MSMEs feel the heat as demand for medical oxygen hits industry||Trichy: The fall in supply of industrial oxygen, a key component for MSMEs in cutting metals, has impacted productivity of fabrication units already reeling under crisis. MSMEs in the fabrication sector producing boiler components for power plants require bottled industrial oxygen to cut mild steel metal, the first step in production. Owing to the huge demand for medical oxygen due to rising Covid-19 cases, the supply of industrial oxygen has been diverted for medical use. Although the gas used for both sectors are almost the same, producers have been urged to keep producing medical oxygen. Medical oxygen is bottled in white cylinders while industrial oxygen is uusually bottled in coloured cylinders. Due to the surge in demand, a cubic metre of industrial oxygen is now selling for Rs 25 from Rs 20 until a month back. “We require at least 10 oxygen cylinders per day to keep the units running but we are not even getting 50% of the requirement,” said Rajappa Rajkumar, president of Bhel small scale industries association. The situation has put MSMEs recuperating from the surge in steel price and first wave of pandemic under trouble. “We were getting 80 tonnes of liquid oxygen per month, but now due to the heavy demand across India, we get only 20 tonnes. With that, we cannot even produce the medical oxygen we were supposed to,” said S Senthil Kumar, oxygen plant owner. As MSMEs that have received orders for boiler components have availed loans for several lakhs, ceasing production will put them under huge debts. “Halting our work will pave way for unemployment. The governments should allot a portion of the oxygen manufactured to MSMEs else we will be heading for closure,” said Prabu Venkatramani, secretary, Bhel industries association. Out of the 400 MSMEs in fabrication in Trichy, only a handful of companies have managed to obtain production orders as others are facing a bleak future. The shortfall in industrial oxygen is anticipated to make add salt on the wounds for surviving MSMEs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/msmes-feel-the-heat-as-demand-for-medical-oxygen-hits-industry/articleshow/82222291.cms||Deepak Karthik

In all, 81 vials have been seized. After finding that some gangs are involved in storage and blackmarketing of the drugs being used to treat Covid patients, several teams have been formed to identify and crack down on such interstate gangs. “On Wednesday, a trap was laid in GTB Nagar and two accused were identified as Talwinder Singh, a resident of Amritsar in Punjab, and Jitender Kumar from Roshanara in Delhi. We seized 71 vials of Remdesivir from them,” a senior officer said. Singh told the cops that both high demand and scarcity had prompted him to start dealing in the injection. “The accused supplied the injection on a pan-India basis through a courier company based in Chandni Chowk, from where Jitender was arrested,” the officer said. They used to charge Rs 2,000 as commission for supplying one vial. Police are also raiding in Punjab. “Singh has told us about the gang operating in major cities supplying Remdesivir at exorbitant prices of Rs 25000-40000,” he added. In another raid, Shoaib and Mohan were arrested with 10 vials. They operated like Singh and Jitender. Teams have been sent to Amritsar to trace the whole gang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-bust-two-interstate-gangs-selling-remdesivir-four-held/articleshow/82223214.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||22 Aapli buses to ferry Covid patients to hosps||Nagpur: Despite having 894 registered ambulances, the city is facing acute shortage of medical vehicles to ferry Covid-19 patients even as over 4,000 cases are being reported daily for the last few days. To tackle this problem, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to convert 22 Aapli buses into ambulances with oxygen facility. Two such buses will be deployed in each of the 10 zones. According to a senior official from NMC’s transport department, these buses will be manned by paramedical staff. The buses will have basic oxygen facility with first aid kits. “They will be under the control of zonal medical officers of NMC,” he said. “These “semi-ambulances” will be used to ferry home isolated Covid-19 patients or those who have only mild infection, to Covid-19 care centres or dedicated hospitals,” the officer said. In August last year too, when the city witnessed a spike in Covid-19 cases, the NMC had pressed six such ambulances into service. At that time, the buses only had first aid kits. The officer said the ‘bus cum ambulance’ service will be provided to those who can ensure there is a confirmed bed in the hospital they want to get admitted. Currently, out of the 11 ambulances available in ‘108’ services, most are provided for Covid-19 patients. These ambulances attend to an average 37 patients daily. According to the officer, the bus cum ambulance service will somewhat reduce the pressure on dedicated Covid-19 ambulances and private ambulances “which charge exorbitant fares”. Aapli Bus, which caters to 1.50 lakh commuters in city and neighbouring places of the district, has a fleet of over 400 buses. The buses were also used for ferrying emergency and essential services staff after the lockdown which was enforced in March last year. Initially, the buses were also used to shift citizens from city’s hotspot areas to quarantine centres. Besides, 16 minibuses have already been converted into hearse vans and 28 buses are on Covid-19 related emergency duties. “Nagpur is fighting a war against Covid-19. NMC’s Aapli bus service is playing a major role in it by extending service to patients,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/22-aapli-buses-to-ferry-covid-patients-to-hosps/articleshow/82222292.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The residents said that the civic body was taking authoritarian measures by not considering the income loss witnessed by the general public due to Covid-19 lockdowns. The civic body has terminated the water connection of at least 200 households in the city in the past week to collect property taxes dues. Bill collectors of the civic body were making door-to-door visits to complete the tax collection, putting pressure on residents to mobilise funds for paying the dues or witness disconnection of water supply, a local said. The residents said they were frustrated over the move as commercial establishments that owe the civic body taxes worth crores were left unpunished for decades but the residents for the past two years are facing harassment, one of the locals said. Condemning the local body officials for harassing the public, the locals were joined by DMK functionaries including ex-DMK councillor T Muthuselvam during the protest. However, the civic body officials continued their tax collection drive in all four zones here. The civic body has set May 1 as the deadline for collecting pending taxes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/protest-against-disconnection-of-water-supply/articleshow/82222295.cms||---

The health department began by assessing the number of beneficiaries district-wise in this age group. Assuming that the cost of each vaccine dose would be around Rs 400, with a population of 2.62 crore, the state has to spend Rs 800 on each person. In the past, health minister Eatala Rajender had announced vaccines will be provided free of cost to everyone and on Thursday, he mentioned different pricing of vaccine for state and Central governments. Sources said internally, there is discussion whether to provide vaccine at a subsidised price for some and give it free-of-cost to others. If the vaccine is provided free-of-cost on income basis, then beneficiaries of white ration cards or Asara pension may be selected. There is also the thought that in the age group of 18- 44, about 30% of the population may prefer vaccination in private centers. Then, cost of the vaccination would be around Rs 1,200 crore. However, the Centre has announced that free vaccination for people above 45 years under National Health Mission (NHM) will be continued by them. Sources say that government will take the final decision next week and may likely announce vaccination for free as civic polls are appproaching and many states have already announced free vaccination. The state government has stated that it has the capacity to give vaccine to 10 lakh people daily but is able to give around one lakh doses only, adding it has scaled up the capacity to 2 lakh people. Till now, around 36 lakh people have received vaccine doses and five lakh people have completed second dose also. There are about 3 lakh frontline workers in the state who have received vaccine doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/free-vaccinations-will-cost-t-rs-2100-crore-estimates-reveal/articleshow/82222300.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Aurangabad||CT scan behind spread of Covid-19, says Aurangabad civil surgeon||AURANGABAD: Patients with Covid-like symptoms should opt for RT-PCR or X-rays, rather than rushing for HRCT scan that are conducted in packed rooms that are dangerous in terms of spread of the disease, said Aurangabad civil surgeon Sundar Kulkarni on Friday. “CT scans are the latest super spreaders and I have raised this issue with all the authorities. It is conducted in a packed room and a person undergoing the scan is made to inhale and exhale several times during the scanning. If a Covid positive patient does it, the virus gets discharged in the air and also the particles land on the surface of the machine,” he said. Kulkarni said that even if the CT scan machine is disinfected after the test on every patient, the virus present in the room will definitely infect people who undergo scanning. He said that RT PCR tests clubbed with scanning through digital X-ray machines, are not only cost-efficient, but also give clear results and there is barely any scope for any other person getting infected. “During the first wave of the pandemic, CT scan was not being used rampantly. However, it has become a fad during the current second wave. It is being promoted and pushed for obvious reasons. The CT scan should be performed only as a last option,” said Kulkarni. The civil surgeon cited examples of people who tested positive after undergoing CT scan. “In some cases, we have noticed that the patient’s score has increased after undergoing CT scan where neither the machines nor the CT scan rooms were disinfected,” he said. Kulkarni demanded that specific guidelines should be issued for carrying out of CT scan and also for maintenance of CT scan centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ct-scan-behind-spread-of-covid-19-says-civil-surgeon/articleshow/82220088.cms||Mohammed Akhef

As per data shared by the health department, out of the 54 deaths reported in the state, the three highest number of fatalities are 13 from Patna district, seven from Muzaffarpur and five from West Champaran. The state capital also reported the highest number of new cases where 2,801 people tested positive taking the active cases in the district to 16,867. Covid-19 cases reported from other districts are Gaya (816), Aurangabad (748), Muzaffarpur (704), Saran (617) and Begusarai (607).

The group also said that the managing committee had not not taken other community members “into confidence” who are also “supposed to be mahajans” and said that the doors of goddess Kelbai temple in Mayem were kept locked on the day of the zatra, “leading to creation of a mourning-like situation” in Mayem village on the auspicious occasion. At a press conference, one of the Mahajans, Harirama Naik Gaonkar said that a few days before the festival, the devasthan president and other members had agreed to celebrate Malyachi Zatra by following Covid-related SOPs laid down by the government. However, at the eleventh hour, the committee members changed their earlier decision and decided not to celebrate the zatra, thereby compelling the Bicholim mamlatdar to issue a new order disallowing the celebrations, Gaonkar said. He also said that after this development, the mamlatdar directed the ruling committee to display copies of the new order on the notice board of all three temples connected to the zatra. Gaonkar said that that despite this order, Mulgao villagers entered Mayem along with the ‘peth’ procession on the first day in large numbers, and on the second day at Chavhtha Gaonkarwada in Mayem, devotees from Mulgao, Bicholim, Shirgao and Vaiginim villages gathered in large numbers to celebrate the zatra which was in violation of the mamlatdar’s order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dismiss-mayem-devasthan-panel-for-violating-mamlatdar-order-mahajans/articleshow/82223224.cms||---

The clerk was released only after three hours when the police found that the gun in his possession was an air gun that resembled an original revolver. Police said that the locals had informed Jinsi police about the clerk openly brandishing a firearm at a public place and boasting about it. One of the locals even recorded a video of the clerk carrying the firearm and later posted it on social media.

When contacted, Jinsi police station’s senior inspector Vyankat Kendre said, “On receiving the tip-off, the civic body employee was rounded up and an air gun resembling original revolver was found with him.” The officer added, “Initially, we thought that it was an original firearm. However, after cross verifying it multiple times, it was found to be an air gun and so the clerk was let off with a warning not to use it henceforth for creating panic in public.” Police suspect that the video of the clerk holding a firearm in hand while standing outside his house and interacting with his neighbours was recorded by one of the locals who was present at the spot.

GEL Church moderator Johan Dang said, “While some of our clergymen are down with Covid, a bishop of North-west GEL Church, Dular Lakra, succumbed to the infection on Friday morning. To add to our woes, a number of our technical and recording personnel are infected as well. Not only have we cancelled all our in-person services, but also suspended online services indefinitely. We need to keep people safe.” Vikla Bakhla, the general secretary of the Chotanagpur Diocese of CNI, said that while in-person church services have been suspended, Sunday mass would be broadcast live from St Paul’s Church in Ranchi. Ranchi bishop Theodore Mascarenhas said that all their churches have been shut down and Sunday mass will be broadcast live at 6:30 am from St Mary’s Cathedral in Purulia Road. “We have also decided to observe May 7 as a day of prayer which will be followed by a week-long prayer for deliverance from the pandemic,” Mascarenhas added. Meanwhile, the Ranchi Archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church is looking for newer options to serve the increasing number of people affected by the second wave of coronavirus. “This second Covid wave is a completely different type of emergency, more dangerous that the first wave of last year. While last year the Church had devoted itself to providing food and shelter to thousands of migrant workers, many of whom were rendered jobless in the aftermath of the Covid-induced lockdown, this year an abnormal spike in cases and number of deaths demand a completely different approach,” Mascarenhas said, adding, “The St Xavier’s College in Ranchi on Friday allowed its hall to be used for treating virus patients and the health department will convert it into a Covid care centre. We are also looking for more options to serve the sick and the needy.” He said that they are scouting for doctors and support staff for the hospital run by the church in Mandar (Constant Lievens Hospital and Research Centre). “The hospital is already overwhelmed and we are looking for human resources to bolster our existing staff strength,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/gel-church-cancels-e-services-after-tech-team-tests-positive/articleshow/82221654.cms||Tapas Biswas

Besides safety gear, the teachers have demanded an insurance coverage of Rs 50 lakh. In a letter to chief secretary Sukhdev Singh, the Akhil Jharkhand Prathmik Sikshak Sangh (AJPSS) has sought PPE kits for teachers on Covid duty. AJPSS has requested the government to refrain from deploying teachers at the intensive care units and even if it does, those above 50 years should be exempted from it. AJPSS’s chief spokesman Nasim Ahmad said, “Ever since the advent of the second wave of coronavirus, teachers are being posted for Covid duty and many are likely to get infected and subsequently, infect their family members. The government should ensure a high grade treatment for them and ensure an insurance coverage of Rs 50 lakh.” Similarly, the Ekikrit Para Sikshak Sangarsh Morcha has requested chief minister Hemant Soren for protective gear. It said that the para-teachers are surviving on a paltry honorarium and their family would face hardships if they get infected. The para-teachers demanded insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh and all the necessary protective equipment. The teachers said that the lack of adequate safety gear will only deepen the Covid crisis rather than contain its spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-teachers-on-covid-duty-demand-ppe-gear/articleshow/82221572.cms||Sanjay Sahay

As on Thursday night, the state had over 40,000 active cases. Soren on Friday visited the TB sanatorium in Itki block of Ranchi and took stock of its infrastructure. Speaking to reporters after his inspection, Soren said the sanatorium will be overhauled into a 500-bed Covid-19 hospital equipped with oxygen support. “So far, we have added 9,098 Covid-19 beds across the state. In the second wave, the number of infections is rising rapidly and the hospital infrastructure is falling short to attend to them,” Soren said. In a statement issued on Thursday, the government said it has taken the number of oxygen-supported beds in Jharkhand to 5,947, of which 1,824 were made functional within a fortnight. “Of them, 3,272 are ICU beds. The number of ventilators has been raised to 634 from 502,” the statement read. On Thursday, after doctors from various hospitals complained of shortages in ventilators and high flow nasal oxygen machines, the state health department allowed private hospitals to use unused ventilators in government hospitals by paying nominal charges between Rs 750 – Rs 1,250.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cm-to-open-cov-circuits-to-provide-o2-supported-beds/articleshow/82221952.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The train was loaded with three tankers, each of which contained a little over 16 tons of oxygen. The BSL management claimed it has already dispatched 230 tons of oxygen to Uttar Pradesh via road. “In April alone, 764 tons of liquid oxygen has been supplied to Ranchi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh by road,” the PSU said. Termed Oxygen Express by the Indian Railways, the train rolled into the diesel shed of Bokaro station in the early hours of Friday. The tankers were de-boarded through special ramps for loading, area railway manager (Bokaro) Prabhat Prasad said. The tankers were taken to the PSU’s captive oxygen plant operated by Inox Air products. Amarendu Prakash, the director in-charge of BSL, said: “The oxygen plant in BSL produces 150 tons of liquid oxygen per day. We dispatched three tankers. The BSL has reduced its liquid oxygen consumption so that it can supply oxygen to the hospitals in Jharkhand and across the country.” State Congress president Rajesh Thakur, however, questioned the feasibility of the exercise. “The Union railway minister (Piyush Goyal) has sent just three tankers in a train. Is it viable? It is a wastage of public money for a small consignment. But the minister is eyeing publicity. Hence, he is constantly tweeting about the train since it left Bokaro station,” Thakur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/oxygen-express-leaves-for-lucknow-from-bokaro-stn/articleshow/82221949.cms||---

Blood banks and doctors have appealed to those who regularly donate blood to use next six days, from April 24 to 30 as a mission mode to voluntarily donate blood.“It’s not possible to conduct blood donation camps in present restrictions. We can’t gather in more numbers. In such case, healthy youths should visit blood banks in person and voluntarily donate blood before taking Covid-19 jab,” said Dr Harish Warbhe, medical director of Lifeline Blood Bank.TOI had reported in March about the National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) directives that those who take the Covid-19 vaccine should not donate blood up to 28 days from the second dose of the vaccine. The NBTC had issued these instructions to all blood banks in the country.Experts told TOI that there is a deferral criteria for blood donation for every vaccination. This period will be 28 days in case of Covid-19 vaccine. It’s always best to donate blood the day before vaccination. After that, one has to wait for three months for the next blood donation.Youths who will get Covaxin jabs will have to wait for 28 days for the booster dose. After this, they have to wait for another 28 days to donate blood. This means, those getting Covaxin need to wait for at least 56 days for blood donation after vaccine.Those who take Covishield will have to wait for even longer. As per the present protocol, the second dose (booster) of Covishield should be delayed up to 8 weeks, which means a person taking Covishield needs to wait up to 84 days from the day of vaccination.Blood donation activity has already been restricted due to the lockdown and blood banks are facing shortage of blood. Once vaccine is available for all above 18 years, many people will be going for it and this may result in a major shortage of blood donors in next two months.DONATE BLOOD, DONATE PLASMAThose vaccinated cannot donate blood from 56 to 84 days after first jabPeople who have tested positive and recovered from Covid cannot donate blood for 28 days post recoveryLockdown like restrictions have stopped blood donation camps Colleges, social events are stopped, so youths are not donating blood in good numbersBlood banks have appealed to donate blood by visiting nearest blood bank in personThose who recovered from Covid-19 should also donate plasma as it is being used as treatmentCurrently, there is huge shortage of plasma of all groups, particularly so of blood group A Rh Positive||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dont-forget-to-donate-blood-before-your-covid-jab/articleshow/82222312.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The tenure of the agreement period is for 25 years. In its maiden venture into solar power, the world’s largest coal producing company in March’21 had won a 100 MW solar power project in a reverse auction conducted by GUVNL. “We feel upbeat that we could win in our first ever competitive bidding of solar auction. We will aggressively participate in more such auctions in future,” said a senior executive of CIL. CIL is serious on its intent to pursue solar power generation as an alternative green energy source. This lists high on its diversification portfolio. The company has rolled out a plan for 3,000 MW of solar power generation by 2024. Around Rs13,500 crore is planned to be invested in solar power projects through the company's internal resources, Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) and bank loans. CIL is developing necessary in-house expertise and has created a team of competent officers for its solar initiatives. “Solar will replace coal as a key energy provider in future and we are laying the groundwork to remain relevant in the country’s energy sector. We plan to venture into solar power generation in a big way”, said the executive. For the 100 MW bid that it won, CIL was awarded the work with a stipulation that it enters a PPA for establishment of a solar power project and supplies the power generated to GUVNL within 18 months from the date of inking the PPA. According to officials, to come up at a capital investment of at Rs 442 crore, CIL will execute the 100 MW project through a Solar EPC Contractor (engineering, procurement and construction).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/coal-india-inks-solar-power-deal-with-guvnl/articleshow/82222316.cms||---
---||Nagpur||State must conduct fire audit of all hosps: Fadnavis||Nagpur: Expressing deep anguish over repeated fire incidents in various parts of the state leading to killing of Covid-19 patients, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Friday demanded that the Maharashtra government must conduct an audit of all hospitals to prevent such tragedies.“Already the citizens are in grip of fear due to Covid-19 pandemic. Incidents like the fire in Virar hospital that was treating coronavirus patients add to their woes. The continuity of all such incidents like in Bhandara, Mumbai, Nashik, Nagpur and now in Virar, where patients have lost their lives, is shocking. After every such tragic incident, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s office and respective district administration simply ordered inquiry, but did nothing to prevent them,” he said.Speaking on the city’s situation, the Southwest Nagpur MLA said Covid-19 patients were multiplying and even deaths were increasing with every passing day. “We need more oxygenated beds and medicines like Reemdesvir. Fortunately, the centre’s oxygen express would be supplying two tankers of the gas brought from Visakhapatnam for the city. Union minister Nitin Gadkari and I are also working to improve the precarious situation and help the patients. We’re daily conducting 30,000 RT-PCR and antigen tests. But in Mumbai, only 35,000-45,000 tests are being held for such a big population. It means they’re suppressing the patients’ numbers, due to which the situation would explode in future,” he said.On arrest of police inspector Sunil Mane by Mumbai police in connection with Antilia bomb scare case, the former CM said NIA was doing its inquiry and everything would come out soon.The former CM added that the government must devise some mechanism to check all hospitals across the state and help them to set up safety measures. “The administration should now take care of the remaining patients of Virar hospital immediately and must go to the roots of inquiry to punish the guilty. We’re aware that the government is fighting against the deadly virus, but it needs to find a long-term solution instead of a knee-jerk reaction to avoid loss of precious lives due to such fire incidents.”Taking a dig at three coalition partners in Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, Fadnavis said some leaders were doing nothing to stop the pandemic or improve the collapsing health infrastructure except interacting with the media and censuring the BJP-led central government.“On one hand, the centre has increased Remdesvir injection quota for Maharashtra, but on the other, MVA leaders continue to play politics. The medicine is distributed considering the ratio of oxygenated beds. But the focus of our ministers is not the deadly virus but facing the camera and providing some wrong statistics,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-must-conduct-fire-audit-of-all-hosps-fadnavis/articleshow/82222324.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Dharni police investigating Harisal RFO Deepali Chavan’s suicide case initially booked Shivkumar booked under section 306 (abetment to suicide). But after his role was confirmed in the matter, police slapped sections 312 (punishment for causing miscarriage), 504 (intentional insult), 506 (criminal intimidation) and submitted it before the court. Filing bail application through his lawyer Prashant Deshpande, the accused DyCF argued that he had no criminal antecedent, was a law-abiding citizen and was working for the betterment of forest. Shivkumar, in his application, stated that the allegations made by Chavan in her suicide note were vague and do not fall in the definition of abetment. His actions were part of his official duty. However, opposing Shivkumar’s bail application, district government pleader (DGP) Parikshit Ganorkar said there are direct allegations against the accused which led to the suicide of Chavan. There is prima facie evidence against the accused and as he was holding a senior position, he may create hurdles in investigations and tamper with the prosecution’s witnesses. Ganorkar told the court that Shivkumar tried to flee and was dramatically arrested from Nagpur railway station. If bail is granted to him, he may flee from justice as well and pleaded for dismissal of his bail application. After hearing both the parties, the court said from the case diary and explicit, it is clear that Shivkumar was harassing Chavan for more than a year. In March 2020, he even threatened Deepali to implicate in the case of atrocity and put her behind bars. “The harassment didn’t stop here and the accused compelled her to do field duties during pregnancy which resulted in her abortion. The applicant used to call her anywhere during the night and talked in filthy language. The suicide note makes it clear that the accused tried to take advantage of her loneliness and when she refused, used to punish her,” the court said. “For proving abetment, it is not necessary that there should be direct involvement of anyone. There is ample material on record to hold that prima facie the accused abetted to the commission of suicide by RFO Chavan. If granted bail, he will tamper with evidence and also flee justice,” the court said and rejected Shivkumar’s application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/accused-dycf-shivkumars-bail-plea-rejected-again/articleshow/82222332.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The move has been prompted by the stellar role played by such entities in the first wave last year in combating the spread of the virus. Government thinktank Niti Aayog has written to state chief secretaries and urged them to ask district magistrates to mobilise all CSOs to help in ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour, use of masks, physical distancing as well as help in spreading the message about vaccination. “Community participation at field level is key. Every village, panchayat and district should collaborate with civil society organisations to fight the virus,” said Amitabh Kant, Niti Aayog CEO, who heads one of the empowered groups. In his letter to states, he said CSOs have contributed immensely by supplying food to the needy, distributing masks, creating awareness, providing shelter and healthcare facilities, developing communication material and their engagement would definitely add value to government’s efforts. The CSOs and NGOS have carried out a number of activities and the need to mobilise them comes against PM Narendra Modi’s emphasis to all stakeholders for micro containment zones which would help stop the spread of the infection locally and help avoid a national lockdown. The empowered group would prefer local administrations to identify hotspots and depute volunteers with a specific focus on the elderly, people with disabilities, children, transgenders and other vulnerable groups. Another key initiative that CSOs and NGOs have been asked to take up is sensitising the population about the need to use masks even if vaccination has been done. Kant also urged NGOs and CSOs to use the toolkit on the mask campaign to spread awareness vigorously “Masks are social vaccines. Mask up and save the world,” Kant added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-to-mobilise-1-lakh-ngos-for-fight-against-covid/articleshow/82225083.cms||Surojit Gupta

According to state health officials, the centre is currently receiving about 8,000 calls a day from a few thousand calls just a week ago. Andhra Pradesh reported 11,766 Covid-19 cases on Friday. Call centre executives have been tasked with providing information related to testing centres, status of tests and the availability of beds in hospitals and Covid care centres, and raising a request for Covid testing and hospital/care centre admissions. The state health department has brought about 1,400 doctors for virtual triaging of suspected cases based on their symptomology and diagnostics through this centre. To achieve all these objectives, the district call centres have also been fully activated with dedicated phone lines and placement of sufficient manpower to work on a 24x7 basis. Ahmad Babu, MD of AP Dairy Development Corporation Ltd., who has been appointed as a special officer for effective functioning of 104 call centres, said that about 180 people are working at the central 104 call centre in Gannavaram in three shifts. “The average time taken for a call currently stands at about four minutes, and we want to reduce it to three minutes to take more calls. Apart from the virtual triaging by the 1,400 doctors from across the state, the centre has also tied up with ambulances to shift the patients to the hospitals. Contact tracing is also done through the centre,” said Babu. Babu added that the peak time in terms of the volume of the calls at the centre is between 8 am to 12 pm. “The state government asked us to resolve every request within three hours. Considering the increasing number of calls in the recent days, the centre would be strengthened to meet the demand. We request the public to utilise the services of the 104 call centre,” said Babu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/second-wave-sees-more-people-dial-104-for-help/articleshow/82220872.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Assistant teacher Sunita Rani (32), who was posted in a primary school in Nakha, died on April 21. She had reported for poll duty at a polling station in Mitauli block and later took ill. She was experiencing breathlessness and died while being treated at home. Sushma Kannaujiya, principal of a government primary school in Maharajnagar, was unwell but her application to cancel her duty in Mohammadi was turned down. Post-duty, her condition deteriorated and she died on Wednesday, gasping for breath. Like Kannaujiya, Shiv Singh Verma (41) had requested that his election duty be cancelled after he fell ill during training but his request was declined. He died late on Wednesday night. A primary school teacher, who tested positive after polls, told TOI, “Voters were not maintaining social distancing. We were crammed into buses like animals. But we can’t even make a complaint because we will be suspended immediately and our family members will not get any compensation if we die of Covid later.” Rajni Verma (38), principal of a school in Phoolbehad block, was deployed in Behjam area. She too died on Thursday. Some fell ill after election training on April 8, like Amroha’s Ravi Prakash Verma who later tested positive and died on Thursday. School teacher Santosh Kumar tested positive after training and died while being treated on April 18. Even those who were not doing field duty got exposed to the viral infection. Akhilesh Kumar, a clerical officer at the basic education office, had been allocated election duty and died due to Covid. His colleagues said that he had been working non-stop for several days. In addition, four people on poll duty took ill and died of “fever” while still being treated.

They submitted a representation to RP Thakur, vice-chairman and managing director of APSRTC, to take necessary measures to instill confidence among workers. Palisheti Damodhar, general secretary, the Employees Union (EU), said that in every depot 20 to 30 workers have already been affected with Covid-19. He said as the second wave is spreading fast, there is a sense of fear among the workers as they are prone to contracting the virus. He requested the management to supply all safety material like face masks and sanitisers besides conducting medical tests and vaccinating the workers and their family members. The workers' unions also requested to rationalise bus services by reducing number of buses where passenger traffic is less. They have requested for 14-day casual leave to those infected with the virus and operating with 50 per cent manpower by implementing shift system. On the other hand, Thakur reviewed Covid-19 situation with all regional and depot managers. He instructed them to take all precautions according to Covid-19 protocols.

He is the fifth official from the secretariat to fall victim to the disease in a span of five days. Ajay Babu, working as a section officer in the labour department, had tested positive last week and died while undergoing treatment in a private hospital. Three senior officials, including an assistant secretary and a record assistant in the secretariat, have died of Covid-19. While the high court moved to virtual hearings within 24 hours after the death of two of its employees last week, the state government is yet to take a call on the demand from secretariat employees to be allowed to work from home. “Many employees are worried to come to office with each and every block in the secretariat complex witnessing positive cases. We requested chief secretary Dr Adityanath Das to take the issue to the notice of the chief minister and allow us to work from home,” said secretariat employees federation president K Venkatramireddy. Meanwhile, industries minister Mekapati Gautham Reddy tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. He had a mild fever for the past two days. The minister said he is doing fine and requested all those who came into contact with him to undergo tests and stay at home. Mekapati has confined himself to his Hyderabad residence and cancelled official programmes including the one on signing an MoU with Microsoft for a skill development programme.

He said that private hospitals were caught unawares to the impact of the second wave leading to a mismatch in bed strength to patient numbers ratio in the initial two weeks. However, a majority of hospitals have geared up to meet the demand by setting up dedicated Covid-19 wards, said Dr Busireddy. “All private hospitals, including those in the Aarogyasri network or non-network have handed over 50 per cent of beds to the government and are operating only the remaining 50 per cent in the management quota,” Dr Busireddy told TOI. He further said that all Aarogyasri network hospitals were extending treatment to Covid-19 patients as per the rules and fees prescribed by the state government. According to Dr Busireddy, young people turning victims to Covid-19 has become a big concern for healthcare professionals. He appealed to youngsters to stay at home unless otherwise warranted. “We are expecting numbers to come down by May 10–15. We must be very careful for the next three to four weeks,” he said. The Aarogyasri hospitals’ association president said that the entire medical fraternity is spending sleepless nights to serve the growing number of patients and people are panicking and rushing to hospitals despite about 80 per cent people not requiring hospitalisation. “Majority of people can recover from their homes. We request people to be calm and bring only those requiring hospitalisation with dipped oxygen levels,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hosps-geared-up-to-meet-demand-dr-busireddy/articleshow/82220923.cms||Samdani MN

As the high court is short-staffed in view of Covid-19 guidelines and counters are yet to be filed in some of the petitions, Justice Durga Prasad Rao suggested to take up the matter on April 30 so that all counters will be filed and matters can be taken for detailed hearing. Earlier, Justice Durga Prasad Rao stayed the election notification by passing interim orders, as the Model Code of Conduct was not imposed for a period of four weeks prior to the date of polling as directed by the Supreme Court. However, a division bench of the high court modified the order and allowed State Election Commission (SEC) to conduct elections as per the schedule but directed not to announce the results. The division bench also said that the announcement of the results will be subject to the outcome of the main writ petitions before Justice Durga Prasad Rao. C V Mohan Reddy, counsel for SEC, requested the court to hear the matters at an earlier date as the election has already been conducted and the contestants and all political parties are waiting for the results.

A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition has been moved challenging the notification issued by NBCC, inviting bids from the intended buyers. The state government has issued separate GOs to sell land parcels located at various places in Visakhapatnam city and NBCC was roped in conduct the auction. Consequent to the MoU, NBCC issued e-auction notification inviting bids. One Kanneganti Hima Bindu from Vijayawada moved the high court with a PIL challenging the GOs and the e-auction notification. B Nalin Kumar, counsel for petitioner, argued that the high court has stayed all further proceedings in similar matters where the government land is put on sale under the same scheme. As the matters are pending for adjudication before the high court, the state government has issued separate GOs for the sale of five land parcels at Visakhapatnam. He said that they are challenging the sale of government land as in other petitions and sought interim directions to stay all further proceedings as the bids have been already received by NBCC. Arguing on behalf of the state government, additional advocate general Ponnavolu Sudhakar Reddy said that the intent of the petitioner is to stay the process that was intended for welfare of the poor. He said several attempts were made in the past to choke the government and they have filed another petition in the name of a PIL to prevent the government from functioning. He said that the petitions are not maintainable as it was the policy decision of the government. However, the arguments of Reddy did not impress the high court bench comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice C Praveen Kumar. The bench observed that as the similar matters are in pending for adjudication, there shall be a stay on all further proceedings and asked the state government to file counter affidavit. Further hearing of the matter has been posted to July 15.

GPPDA had kick-started the process to prepare the land use map and register for the Kadamba planning area, which includes parts of Chimbel and Old Goa, in November 2018. GPPDA had also kept the plans open for objections and suggestions, which were then considered by the planning body as well as the town and country planning department. “The authority considered the report of the committee with some modifications and the authority unanimously resolved to adopt the said land use map and register of Kadamba planning area,” said Pandita. GPPDA has issued a notification to inform the public that copies of the present land use map and land use register of Kadamba planning area have been kept for inspection at the panchayat offices of Chimbel, Se-Old-Goa and Curca-Bambolim-Talaulim. The time to submit objections has lapsed, said officials. They said that several objections and representations were received by GPPDA. “The said map and register was placed for inviting objections from the public. Under Section 27(3) of Town & Country Planning Act, a committee was appointed to hear the public objections and prepare the report, which was then submitted to the Planning and Development Authority,” said Pandita. The GPPDA has three planning areas under its jurisdiction — Taleigao, Bambolim and Kadamba Plateau. The TCP department had considered extending the jurisdiction of the Kadamba planning area till the Corlim boundary in Ella village, but after vociferous protests, the proposal was dropped. The land use map and register for the Kadamba planning area has been under process for the last 36 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kadamba-plateau-land-use-map-adopted/articleshow/82222622.cms||---

There is an urgent need to study the river’s biodiversity index with Karnataka attempting to dam and divert its waters, said Pradip Sarmokadam, member secretary of Goa State Biodiversity Board on Thursday. Sarmokadam explained that the index is a scale of the diversity of plant and animal species present in the river. It is used as a tool to estimate the complexity, stability and thus the general health of the river. This study helps estimate the extent of the survey required to record and detect floral and faunal diversity of the river’s ecosystem, said Sarmokadam, speaking on World Earth Day. “Mhadei harbours rich fish genetic resource, however, only a limited research has been carried out on it so far. The river not only supports rich biodiversity, but offers livelihood and nutritional security,” he said. The occasion also witnessed release of a publication on Mhadei -- ‘Antarang Mhadeiche’ compiled by Shubhada Chari.  Writer Rajendra Desai said that Chari’s publication has already traced, to a large extent, Mhadei’s hidden treasure covering its upstream stretches, Western Ghats till the mouth of the river on the west coast of India. “It tells us historically how the river has sustained numerous communities that rely on the Mhadei for drinking water, agriculture, fishing and transportation,” said Desai.  Artist Sanskruti Naik painted the Barazan waterfalls live at the event to the tune of a song on Mhadei presented by Narayan Gawas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/study-a-must-on-mhadeis-biodiversity-index-expert/articleshow/82222733.cms||---

A new system is also expected to form after 48 hours, which may cause light rain on April 26 and 27. “The system in interior Karnataka is expected to slightly move away from Goa over the next 48 hours. The thunderstorms are mostly developing in Karnataka, but higher level easterly winds are transporting the thunderstorm clouds so there is likelihood of slight instability in the atmosphere and light rain or thundershowers over Goa,” IMD scientist, Rahul M, said. More details are awaited on the possibility of rain on April 26 and 27, which will be due to a different system that is expected to form.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-likely-to-receive-rain-on-april-26-27/articleshow/82222748.cms||---

It has further stated that the directorate of Agriculture, Panaji, under the Goa Fruit and Ornamental Plant Nurseries (Regulation) Act 1995, issued a public notice in local newspapers to all registered plant nurseries to display sign boards and stop using hand carts for the sale of plants. February 15, 2018, was the last day for the licenced plant nurseries to fulfil the conditions as listed in the notice dated February 1, 2018, Goacan stated. If these illegal nurseries continue to operate,then consumers will have no other option but to take all legal steps to ensure their protection, Goacan stated while urging that needful be taken to remove these nurseries from Bardez taluka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unregistered-nurseries-must-face-action/articleshow/82222759.cms||---

While most of the rules and fees remain the same, the new norms require all cargo handling firms to submit daily performance reports regarding the movement of cargo and vessels handled. MPT chairman E Ramesh Kumar said that stevedoring and shore-handling agents would have to submit an online report to MPT’s traffic department, which will help capture productivity on a daily basis. Stevedoring refers to the act of loading or offloading cargo from a ship. MPT earns a royalty for all cargo and services handled by the agencies. The daily performance report on the stevedoring agent’s productivity will be reviewed by the MPT chairman, traffic manager or any other officer every month. Stevedoring licences, which are valid for three years, will be renewed based on the performance reports. “Failure to submit daily performance report or any other information sought by the traffic manager or an officer acting on his behalf can lead to cancellation of the license,” said Kumar. The new norms also say that licences of agents who fail to meet productivity norms on average over a period of three months may be revoked. The norms also stipulate that stevedore agents will have to employ at least six supervisory personnel with minimum two years of cargo-handling experience. Under the earlier norms, stevedores were required to employ four supervisory personnel. Kumar said that the Mormugao Port Trust Stevedoring and Shore Handling Regulations, 2021 supersede the existing Mormugao Port Trust (Licencing of Stevedores) Regulations, 2010 and have the approval of the Centre. MPT’s traffic manager will continue to be the nodal officer responsible for monitoring of stevedoring and shore-handling tariff, and the traffic manager will be responsible for handling all complaints on violation of stevedoring.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mpt-unveils-new-stevedoring-norms-seeks-daily-reports/articleshow/82222785.cms||---

The facilities include, learning activities, scientific instruments, nature exploration and sky observation. “Open air, full of fun and a relaxed learning environment,” said Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte after inaugurating the park. “Children will get an opportunity to observe, feel, and enjoy many of the scientific phenomena that surround us.” The park has a dedicated activity space for schools to utilise and display science and action projects for experiential learning. Apart from this, the park also has an amphitheatre to screen science and environment films and to organise guest lectures, a space on top of the building for star gazing and exploring atmospheric science and a lecture hall/community space. The park is the property of people and they should maintain it, Khaunte said, adding that the park will have a free internet facility. “The park should not be used for any other purpose than a learning hub,” he added. The science and community park, which is the initiative of Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte was inaugurated by PWD minister, Deepak Pauskar in the presence of Khaunte. “This park is a great addition to the Porvorim constituency. The cost of the park came to Rs 1.5 crore and despite it’s various amenities, there is still scope for more developmental additions. There are a number of plants that can be planted here bringing more character to the park,” he said, assuring his support to complete the remaining works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/porvorim-science-park-full-of-fun-and-learning-khaunte/articleshow/82222853.cms||---

He breathed his last on Thursday night. The condition of his wife and son is serious, sources said. Ramesh’s nephew, Deepak Diwakar, said, “My uncle, his wife and son were detected Covid-19 positive five days ago in Auraiya. Initially they were taken to a local hospital. From there, they were referred to Kanpur. But, due to inadequate facilities and his serious condition, the uncle was taken to Ghaziabad and then to Meerut.” In Meerut, the BJP leader was admitted to Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College. His condition deteriorated on Thursday evening and he died a few hours later. His brother Lal Ji Diwakar said, “In Kanpur, he (Ramesh) did not get proper facilities after which he returned to Auraiya and was given oxygen support at his farmhouse. But, as his condition did not improve, he was taken to Ghaziabad. There too, he did not get proper treatment. So he was then brought to LLRM hospital in Meerut where he got a bed.” Ramesh’s last rites will be performed at his ancestral village in Auraiya, his brother told TOI.

Claims that the extent of the health crisis should not be reported in the name of free expression drew a sharp criticism from the EGI, which condemned all such suggestions, referred to such statements as casual and irresponsible, and said that the prevailing health emergency was a time that demanded greater accountability from the authorities for the “gross mishandling of this monumental health crisis”. “EGI sees these voices as an attempt to deflect attention from the objective and bold reporting by intrepid journalists, who, unmindful of their personal safety, are bringing to the fore harsh facts about the spread of the pandemic and its mismanagement by the authorities,” the EGI statement said. The Editors body also said that in the absence of these media reports, possible only in a constitutional democracy that safeguards free speech, the country and the world will not get a true picture of the enormity of the crisis. “Even the courts would not have taken cognisance of the threat to lives of patients due to scarcity of oxygen and medicines,” EGI said, demanding that the government should “regularly and truthfully” share data about the pandemic and its on-going response to it with the media and people at large.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/editors-guild-outraged-at-call-to-suspend-right-of-expression/articleshow/82225181.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: Armed forces swing into action in battle against pandemic||NEW DELHI: From setting up hospitals to airlifting doctors, medical supplies and large cryogenic oxygen containers, the country’s defence establishment and armed forces have swung into action once again in the ongoing battle against the Covid-19 pandemic. With depleting oxygen supplies across the country, the IAF has deployed its C-17 Globemaster-III and IL-76 heavy-lift aircraft to transport empty oxygen containers or tankers from their place of use to oxygen plants and filling stations to avoid transportation bottlenecks. “With a view to make available additional tankers for movement of oxygen, the home ministry is also coordinating lifting of high capacity tankers from abroad, such as Singapore and the UAE, by IAF transport aircraft,” said an official on Friday. Though the proposed airlift from abroad is yet to take off, two C-17s and a IL-76 airlifted transported empty Linde and Inox oxygen containers from Hindon to Panagarh in West Bengal on Thursday. Similarly, eight empty cryogenic containers were airlifted from Begumpet to Bhubaneshwar by C-17 on Friday, while another was transported from Indore to Jamnagar by the IAF. After being replenished, the large containers or tankers are being sent back on trains or roads. Airlift of loaded liquid oxygen tankers is not being carried out because it’s potentially hazardous if the aircraft suddenly loses cabin pressure at high altitude, said officials. DRDO, along with the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS), has set up the 500-bed Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (SVP) Covid hospital in New Delhi, with another 900-bed one being inaugurated at Ahmedabad in collaboration with the Gujarat government on Friday. “The SVP hospital has 161 doctors, including super-specialists, and 217 paramedics. In the Dhanvantri Covid hospital in Ahmedabad, 150 beds are with ventilators, while the remaining 750 also have oxygen. Similarly, a 450- bed hospital in Lucknow and a 750-bed one in Varanasi are also coming up,” said an official. In keeping with defence minister Rajnath Singh’s instructions, the armed forces are in touch with state governments to provide assistance, while defence PSUs, ordnance factories and DRDO are working overtime to provide oxygen cylinders and extra beds to civil administrations in the country. Military hospitals around the country are also augmenting their facilities to tackle the surge in Covid patients among serving and retired personnel. “The AFMS, for instance, is importing 23 portable oxygen generation plants from Germany for its military hospitals. They are expected within a week,” said another official. “Each such plant has the capacity to produce 40 litres of oxygen per minute and 2,400 litres an hour. At this rate, it can cater to 20-25 patients round the clock,” he added. Rajanth Singh has also sanctioned delegation of emergency financial powers to AFMS, which amounts to Rs 5 crore for Lt-General-rank officers, Rs 3 crore to Major Generals and Rs 2 crore to Brigadiers. The defence ministry is also giving extension to short-service commissioned military doctors till December 31 to tide over the current pandemic. “This will augment the strength of AFMS by an additional 238 doctors,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-armed-forces-swing-into-action-in-battle-against-pandemic/articleshow/82225134.cms||---
---||India||Bengaluru is country’s district with highest active caseload||BENGALURU: With nearly 1.5 lakh Covid active cases, Bengaluru Urban has become the district with the highest active caseload in the country, way ahead of Pune (1,16,602) as of Friday. The surging count triggered calls from public health experts for establishment of temporary care centres where patients can be stabilised at early states as any increase in severity can overwhelm the city’s health infrastructure. Bengaluru added 16,662 fresh Covid cases on Friday, taking the city’s total active caseload to 1,49,624. Delhi’s active tally is nearly 1 lakh while in Mumbai, it is 81,174.   Dr Giridhara R Babu, epidemiologist and member of Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said the daily spike in Bengaluru would hit 25,000 cases by May 1. “Even if 5% of them need critical care, our health system will be totally stretched,” he said. Rajendra Cholan P, special commissioner of health of the city corporation (BBMP), said 90-92% of Covid patients in Bengaluru are in home isolation and the challenge is to monitor them. Health experts urged the state government to set up medical centres urgently in places like Palace Grounds and marriage halls for triaging Covid patients needing oxygen support. Once the patients are stabilised, they can be shifted to Covid hospitals where beds are available, they said. BBMP is in the process of resuming distribution of Covid medical kits to needy patients, as it was done during the first wave last year. “Distributing the medical kits to home isolated patients was stopped when the number of cases dropped in Bengaluru. There is not much demand for Covid Care Centres. In all the 12 CCCs, we have only 800 patients,” said Cholan. Cholan maintained that despite the high number of active cases, 80-85% of patients are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and the major issue before BBMP is to secure beds for the 5-6% of patients who have severe illness. Based on the trajectory of the cases, Dr Giridhara Babu said, Bengaluru needs a complete lockdown just to reduce the number of cases, though it is the last resort. “We should not repent later. Without reducing the overall number of cases, we can’t be redistributing the bed capacity to reasonable levels. Along with lockdown, we have to step up the bed capacity levels. Both need to be done,” Babu said. The need is to ramp up existing critical care facilities and increase the number of oxygen beds, as oxygen is a medicine, said Dr S Sacchidanand, vice-chancellor of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, who is also the chairman of Covid-19 clinical expert committee. “The cases are expected to rise. Currently, the government can increase the bed utilisation in private medical colleges from 50% to 80%. It’s easier to strengthen the existing system than to create new facilities,” he said. 2,000 makeshift ICU beds in 15 day At least 2,000 makeshift ICU beds will be ready in Bengaluru in 15 days and 800 of them will have ventilators, health minister K Sudhakar said on Friday. “In Victoria Hospital campus alone, 250 ICU beds will be set up and in another new building 150-200 ICU beds will be arranged and 100 of them will have ventilators,” he said. He added that makeshift hospitals will also be set up at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases and NIMHANS. The minister said CM Yediyurappa has directed the health department to increase the availability of ventilators 10-fold and steps have been initiated. “Private hospitals have been asked to establish makeshift hospitals,” he said. He added that the state is getting 10,000 to 20,000 vials of Remdesivir on a daily basis. “The Centre has allocated additional 25,000 vials. I have also spoken to Biocon MD Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw to supply 10,000 vials in 10 days and another 50,000-60,000 vials within a month. We are trying to directly procure 2 lakh vials from abroad. We are seeking the Centre’s approval for this,” he added.

He said there was a need for aggressive implementation of Covid-appropriate behaviour and protocols so that burden on hospitals was reduced. The use of face masks and social distancing, along with messages on hygiene, would reduce the pressure on the medical system. The PM said monitoring of recovery rate in hospitals and increasing it by timely and prompt treatment was essential. This needed efforts to ensure treatment protocols were followed and standards maintained. Creating awareness that no medicine be taken without doctor's advice was important as it would ensure medicines were available for those who really needed them. Given the current oxygen crunch, a focus on oxygen audits and ensuring judicious use of the medical gas was essential even as the Centre and states made efforts to increase production and improve distribution, he said. Lastly, in order to deal with the increased pressure, manpower at hospitals should be increased by deploying retired medical practitioners and staff from the armed forces and other such organisations. A call centre could also be set up and run by retired medical staff for tele-consultations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-appropriate-behaviour-monitoring-recovery-rate-among-pms-five-suggestions/articleshow/82225231.cms||---
---||India||Inhaled steroids may soon be part of ‘off-label’ Covid treatment||MUMBAI: Inhaled steroids, mainly used to treat asthma and other serious respiratory problems, may soon be added to the list of “off-label treatment” for Covid-19 patients in Maharashtra. The Maharashtra government’s task force on Covid-19 is preparing guidelines for use of inhaled steroid budesonide for patients with mild to moderate symptoms. “We may announce this addition within the next few days,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the task force. Two puffs of budesonide daily for 14 days could reduce the risk of hospitalisation in mild to moderately ill Covid-19 patients by 91% (as compared to Covid-19 patients on regular treatment), according to a study published by Oxford University in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine earlier this month. After the study was published, the UK National Health Service introduced inhaled steroid in the list of medicines used “off label” for Covid-19 patients. “Fewer participants on budesonide had persistent symptoms at day 14 and day 28 compared to participants receiving usual care,” said the Lancet study. Doctors whom TOI spoke to said that inhaled steroids have been used by medical practitioners in Mumbai since May 2020. A doctor from a BMC hospital said that budesonide has a role to play in a certain subsection of Covid-19 patients. “It cannot be used for all Covid-19 patients. It is best to let the doctor decide instead of the patient deciding that they need inhaled steroids,” said the doctor.Pulmonologist Dr Sujit Rajan from Tardeo’s Bhatia Hospital too treats mild to moderate Covid-19 patients with budesonide. “In September, my team called up all the 170 asthma patients in our care and found out that only one had got Covid. None of the patients with other lung diseases had caught the infection either,” he said. This showed they had protection perhaps from the inhaled steroids they need to use daily. Dr Sundeep Salvi of the Chest Research Foundation in Pune said budesonide could be the potential game changer in the pandemic. “The Oxford study showed that if recently infected Covid-19 patients start taking inhaled steroids as soon as symptoms such as sore throat and cough start, they would benefit immensely,” he said.On the plus side, budesonide has been used for children and pregnant women with asthma for around four decades. “It is mild, affordable and easily availableOral steroids given to severely ill Covid patients are 40 times the strength of inhaled steroids,” pointed out Dr Rajan.But several doctors are worried about the inadequate research and potential misuse. “Asthmatics are trained by counsellers to use the inhaler properly. If the shot is not delivered properly, it could increase the risk of fungal infection,” said a doctor. Another said that while treating Covid-19 patients with inhaled steroids, care must be taken to ensure the patients don’t have underlying disease such as tuberculosis. A doctor from a civic hospital said there is no “cellular level” proof that inhaled steroids work. “We know that it works at the cellular level for asthma patients, but there is no equivalent research for Covid-19,” said the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/inhaled-steroids-may-soon-be-part-of-off-label-covid-treatment/articleshow/82225251.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Kolkata||6 BJP workers arrested for attack on party’s Malda candidate||Malda: A political controversy has erupted over the arrest of six youths in connection with the attack on a BJP candidate here on April 18. Not only are they pronounced saffron party supporters, one of them is the nephew of a panchayat pradhan who owes allegiance to the BJP. Police arrested the six on Thursday night and identified them as Akash Mandal (nephew of pradhan Ukil Mandal), Bittu Choudhury, Arjun Ghosh, Suman Ghosh, Sayan Saha and Bikash Halder. They were produced in court on Friday and remanded in police custody for seven days. Gopal Saha, the BJP’s Malda candidate, was shot at and injured at a party meeting in Sahapur last Sunday. He was rushed to Malda Medical College, where the bullet was removed. He is said to be stable now. While the BJP had squarely blamed Trinamool Congress for the attack on Saha and staged an agitation, the TMC had called it the fallout of BJP infighting. It may be recalled that Saha’s nomination from Malda was plagued with controversy. A section of BJP workers had hit the streets and even vandalised the party office, demanding that Saha be replaced. Several party leaders later refused to campaign for Saha. During the April 18 party meeting, a scuffle had broken out between rival BJP factions amid which Saha had been shot at. Ukil Mandal said the charges against his nephew were fabricated. “He was not on the spot that night,” the pradhan added. District BJP president Gobinda Mandal too reacted to the arrests and said: “We want the real culprits behind bars. Police are trying to protect them and defame our party leaders.” Trinamool spokesperson Sumala Agarwala said the party’s stand had been vindicated. “We had kept on saying that the attack was the outcome of BJP’s internal feud.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/6-bjp-workers-arrested-for-attack-on-partys-malda-candidate/articleshow/82222861.cms||Subhro Maitra

While this April’s figures are better compared to April 2020 when the country was under lockdown, signs of any further recovery appear bleak due to the current spike in Covid infections, transport department officials fear. The number of vehicles registered this month so far (till April 22) is 54,775 compared to 88,747 in April 2019. Last April, only 38,885 pre-booked vehicles were registered. The two previous months of the year, too, witnessed a drop in vehicle registrations. This February, the registration figure stood at 85,262, compared to 1,11,347 in February 2020 and 92,729 in the same month in 2019. This March, when the second wave was yet to hit the state, 97,400 vehicles were registered in the state compared to 1,73,034 last March and 97,629 in March 2019. “Last year showed the possibility of a recovery of the car market in the month of March, but the advent of Covid turned the tables,” said a transport department official. “Last year showed the possibility of a recovery of the car market in the month of March, but the advent of Covid turned the tables,” said a transport department official. Senior transport department officials, however, said revenue generation had not taken as big a hit as they had anticipated as resale and registration of old vehicles increased. A lot of people, under distress, had sold their cars to new buyers, often at low prices,” said an official. An RTO official in Salt Lake said the used car market had boomed in 2020 as people opted for personal transport, which was considered a safer way to commute over public transport during the pandemic. A lot of companies dealing with second-hand cars have emerged in the market who buy old cars and sell refurbished ones to customers. Banks have also queued up to finance second-hand cars. The record hike in fuel prices, however, has dealt a cruel blow to the car market. Many people who managed to buy second-hand cars, cannot afford the fuel cost any more and so the possibility of third-hand distress sale seems imminent, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vehicle-registrations-dip-in-state-cov-puts-recovery-under-cloud/articleshow/82223377.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

According to local sources, Raja Chowdhury was taking a post-dinner walk around 11.30pm near his home in Goli no. 2, close to Kankinara Bazar, along with friends when he was attacked. “Two youths came on a motorbike, opened fire and fled the spot. The boys scattered in panic and ran for cover. But Raja was struck in the head by a bullet and slumped to the ground, bleeding profusely,” a neighbour said. He was rushed to Bhatpara State General Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. “Raja was a Class IX dropout. But he was an innocent boy and wasn’t associated with any political party. He used to take a walk after dinner and chatted with friends. But he had to pay with his life in firing by goons who were trying to grab control of the area after elections,” said cousin Samir Chowdhury. Residents claimed some local miscreants were terrorizing people on poll-eve. “Bhatpara-Kankinara area witnessed several clashes and bombings before polls. Armed goons also unleashed a reign of terror in the area. But ignoring all threats and violence, almost all locals cast their votes, after which goons opened fire to teach people a lesson. An innocent boy, who wasn’t a voter yet, was killed by goons,” a resident said. Both Trinamool Congress and BJP leaders said that none of their supporters was involved in the attack. Police are investigating if rivalry could have led to the murder. “Preliminarily, we suspect the goons targeted the boy and fired at him from point blank range. A raid is on to nab the culprits,” said a senior officer of Barrackpore Commissionerate. Post-poll violence erupted in Jagaddal’s Panpur too where at least seven persons suffered severe splinter injuries in bombing after a clash broke out between Trinamool and BJP supporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/16-yr-old-shot-as-post-poll-violence-rocks-bhatpara/articleshow/82222694.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Mamata: Why did EC curtail rallies after Modi’s decision?||DURGAPUR: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday questioned why the Election Commission’s decision to restrict poll campaigns came after PM Narendra Modi cancelled his public meetings in Bengal, and not much earlier, in view of the spiralling Covid situation. But she added that she — and her party — would accept the restrictions “for the sake of the people”. On Thursday, a few hours after PM Modi announced that he was scrapping all rallies scheduled on Friday in favour of virtual addresses, the EC banned all roadshows, padayatras and rallies with vehicles and put a cap of 500 people on all political meetings, prompting parties and politicians, including the Bengal CM, to go for virtual meetings and reschedule their programmes. “The EC could have done this much earlier,” the CM told the press on Friday. “Why do the EC’s decisions always come at the last moment?” She also questioned the rationale of the poll panel not clubbing the last three election phases, saying the EC did “whatever the BJP” asks it to do. “It could have been a five-phase polls, rather than an eight-phase one. The EC always heeds what the BJP tells it. Whatever BJP asks them to do, they will do.” The CM alleged that the BJP, in its bid to “capture” Bengal, was pushing the state — and the country — into a crisis. “There are over two lakh forces and officials in Bengal. Have they undergone RT-PCR tests? You have curtailed campaigning time. It is okay, but why haven’t the phases been curtailed?” she said, adding, “The negligence of the central government has led to this situation.” “On March 7, the Union health minister had indicated that Covid was on its way out,” the CM said. “Didn’t they have reports from experts? Last year itself, WHO had warned India of a surge in oxygen demand. The PM never discussed that with the states.... Even today, he had a meeting. But we were not invited. Had I been invited, I would have definitely attended. But I was told that he met those 10 states where there is a high prevalence of cases. Only they have been invited, and that is all right.” The CM also hinted at anomalies in vaccine allocations, saying, “Bhashon noy, vaccine chai (We don’t need speeches, we want vaccines)”. “Sixty percent of the vaccines have been given to Gujarat,” she alleged, adding, “The other states have got only 15%-20%. Let the Centre provide vaccines. Let them fix the rates and let us know where to buy these from.” She also questioned why vaccines could not be provided to everyone for free. “I have made some quick calculations. To provide these vaccines for all of India at Rs 150, the Centre needs to spend around Rs 20,000 crore. PM-Cares has lakhs of crores. What stops them from buying it? They have money to buy planes, build a Lok Sabha and even statutes. But when it comes to saving lives, why are they silent? And how will they (provide vaccines)? As much as 65% of the vaccines have already been sent abroad. This is nothing but sheer negligence,” she said. Banerjee, however, sounded confident that Bengal would beat the second wave of the pandemic, saying several measures had been taken by the administration. “We have handled the situation before, and we will do it again. I have been speaking regularly (to state officers) on this. We are scaling up hospital beds and safe houses. I would urge people to be cautious but not to panic. By nature, the disease is very contagious, but not all patients are severe. Take medical advice and go to hospitals only when asked to,” she said. She also ruled out lockdowns. “No, we have no such proposal. Lockdowns will not help. It will snatch away the livelihoods of poor people. We need to very careful.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-why-did-ec-curtail-rallies-after-modis-decision/articleshow/82223355.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||Kolkata||In last virtual poll speech, PM focuses on ‘Kol aspirations’||Kolkata: PM Narendra Modi used his last virtual speech to Bengal’s voters on Friday to lay out the road map for building a “Sonar Bangla” and Kolkata. “We will use technology to transform Kolkata, the City of Joy, to the City of Future,” Modi said ahead of the last two phases of Bengal polls that would see 71 seats, including 11 from Kolkata, going to vote. The “Didi, o Didi” taunts were replaced by a focus on the aspirations of the urban voter as Modi wove a “win-win” narrative for the state based on rule of law and effective administration that would boost healthcare, education and industry minus systemic leakages. “Bengal elections are not just for a change of government. I can see a yearning for a better life, better education, better employment in both cities and villages,” the PM said, adding that the BJP’s “double engine” government would work to make Kolkata a major centre for global exports. The only political message was an iteration of the party’s confidence that it would seize office in the state; he would come to Bengal for the new government’s swearing-in ceremony and “bow to the people” after result day May 2, he said. “Bengal is waiting for a governance in which every department works honestly without discrimination. Bengal is voting for a government that will end corruption, syndicates, infiltration and create an atmosphere for development, industry and well-being,” the PM said. “People have come out on the streets to vote for a government of their choice after four decades,” Modi said, adding: “I would urge voters of Kolkata, Malda, Murshidabad and Birbhum to do so in the last two phases too.” Then, in a nod to Covid restrictions, he added: “We should wear masks even after taking the jab. Our precautions could help minimise the pressure on hospitals. We have to fight this battle together.” Modi, focusing on the middle-class’s aspirations, said the new government would enforce the Real Estate Regulatory Authority in Bengal and assured affordable housing “on rent” for migrant workers, besides work for “roofed accommodation” for the rural poor. “Kolkata was among the few cities to have electricity. The first Metro Railway in the country was in Kolkata. We will work on expanding metro connectivity. We have already taken up revamp of Kolkata Port,” the PM said, looking back at a Kolkata where people came for “fulfilment of their dreams”. He also promised to bring down the city’s pollution levels. “The new government will set up a city gas distribution network and CNG stations,” the PM said, adding it would also strive for “dengue eradication”. Supply of safe piped drinking water to households would be one of the priorities of the new government, Modi said, explaining that most diseases were water-borne. The New Education Policy provided for education and studying professional courses like medicine and engineering in the mother tongue, the PM said. “Gurudev Tagore’s vision has been the guiding light,” he said, also promising to set up girls’ colleges and technical institutes. “Bengal will win, BJP will win. We all will win together,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-last-virtual-poll-speech-pm-focuses-on-kol-aspirations/articleshow/82223368.cms||---

Many orders that were either finished or under process have been put on hold by the buyers. They say that a call on the same could only be taken once the lockdown ends in their respective cities. Speaking with TOI, finance secretary of Knitwear Club Harish Kairpal said, “As anticipated, buyers in other states have started canceling orders that are under process. What is even worse is that the consignments that were about to be dispatched have also been put on hold. The buyers are wary of receiving the consignments during the lockdown. Moreover, there is a high risk of the lockdown being extended beyond the deadline set by the state governments. “The situation has put us in a fix as the finished goods have started piling up in our factories. As far as cancellations of under-process orders are concerned, we will have to finish them and cannot leave them in between. It seems that this year will be worse than the last one and we will end up suffering record losses due to the ongoing situation.” Jagbir Singh Sokhi, the president of the Sewing Machine Development Club, said, “Lockdown in consumer markets like Delhi and Maharashtra have given us a huge setback. The biggest wholesale market of sewing machines in India is in Delhi. Similarly, there are several important wholesale markets in Maharashtra. These are the major markets on which sewing machine and parts manufacturers of Ludhiana are dependent for their sales.” According to Inderjit Singh Navyug, a former president of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association, “Cycle industry is seeing a very tough time. This is due to the fear that a lockdown can be imposed in the entire country anytime. Forget about new orders, buyers of Delhi and Maharashtra are not even ready to accept deliveries of the orders that were finalised.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/order-cancellations-inventory-pile-up-give-city-bizmen-jitters/articleshow/82221578.cms||Mohit Behl

Speaking to reporters, she strongly expressed her disapproval of such incidents. “Do not attack people. Do not play with fire. Some (officers) are getting carried away by what is being said by central forces. I urge all to let people vote,” she said. The Bagdah police firing case took a dramatic turn on Friday after the investigating officer (IO) produced five persons, arrested for being involved in the attack on cops, in Bongaon ACJM court. Sub-inspector of Bagdah police station and IO Asadur Rehman allegedly even threatened lawyers during a heated argument before judge Debasish Santra for police remand of the accused. The IO reportedly said, “Guli chaliyechi, besh korechi. Darkar hole court er maddhye o chalabo. Apnara ja korar kore nin (We were right to open fire. If necessary, we will do it in court too. You can do whatever you want).” A case was filed in Bongaon court against Rehman under Section of 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the IPC . “Police arrested five villagers for attacking cops and produced them in court. During the hearing, the SI engaged in a verbal duel with lawyers and made derogatory comments. A case was slapped against him and later he was granted bail on surety of Rs 1,000,” said Samir Das, a senior lawyer. Police had opened fire at Ranoghat in Bagdah during the sixth phase of polling on Thursday to break a clash. Three policemen, including Bagdah OC Utpal Saha, were seriously injured when a 150-strong mob attacked the sector office. The five were arrested on Friday and remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-orders-probe-into-bagdah-police-firing/articleshow/82222654.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

Sources said several of Mondal’s relatives too had received similar notices. Polling in Birbhum is scheduled on April 29. Recently, BJP’s Bolpur candidate Anirban Ganguly had raised questions about “immovable benami properties” allegedly owned by Mondal. Ganguly claimed that even Mondal’s security guards had amassed wealth illegally and owned houses in several places. The alleged properties are in Purulia, Bolpur and Asansol-Durgapur belt. Sources in the I-T department said the notices to Mondal and his kin had been sent to “clarify facts” following such complaints. The Trinamool leader refused to comment on the matter.

The boot-camp had participants engage in pitch sessions on businesses ranging from artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled products, healthcare, promote economy, education among others. The top-three finalists get a direct entry into the next cohort of the 8-12 weeks’ incubation programme run by the Nexus Incubation Center in New Delhi and access to funders specialising in supporting startups. Finalists include representatives from Ranchi, Patna, Shillong, Guwahati, Imphal, Durgapur and Kohima. Congratulating the participants who had made it to the last lap of the programme, US consul general Patti Hoffman said, “The US government supports women’s entrepreneurship around the world. When women are empowered economically, they invest in their families and communities, spurring economic growth and creating more stable societies. The best way to ‘not waste the Covid crisis’ is to ensure that women come back stronger.” Due to Covid-19 surge, the programme slowed down after phase one, but women entrepreneurs who had proceeded to phase two, utilised their time and this opportunity to collaborate, explore alternate business models, adopt technology to scale up, learn from each other, and pivot to fit to the needs of the pandemic time. Four of the women entrepreneurs who were in their idea stages have launched their businesses during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/us-consulate-project-for-women-entrepreneurs-in-east/articleshow/82222323.cms||---

Reviewing the situation, Bambi said that the district administration has two oxygen generation plants and five bottling plants.  He said the district at its full capacity was generating oxygen for 1,800-2,000 D type cylinders. He said that Civil Hospital too has its oxygen generation plant and was getting 115 cylinders on its own. He added that in the last two days, around 250 cylinders of oxygen have been supplied to Jalandhar. “Anyone who is facing any difficulty in getting oxygen cylinders in Ludhiana for Covid patients can dial helpline numbers 7837018500 and 0161-2421091,” he said.  Meanwhile, deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said there was no need to panic as efforts were afoot to ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen.  He said clear directions had been given to take stern action against people involved in hoarding of oxygen cylinders  Deputy Commissioner added that as the Covid cases were skyrocketing in the district and the people needed to adhere to Covid-19 protocols. He appealed to the masses to take the vaccine and shun any kind of doubts or fears associated with it. He also urged people to not take flu-like symptoms lightly. “Immediately contact nearby health facilities so that the spread of the contagion can be halted. People have been reporting late to the doctors, hence their condition deteriorates. There is no dearth of resources and manpower with the state government to tackle the pandemic,” Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/efforts-afoot-to-ensure-uninterrupted-o2-supply/articleshow/82221664.cms||---
---||India||‘Escape variants infecting doctors post vaccination’||NEW DELHI: Most doctors who have breakthrough infections after vaccinations tend to have some kind of escape variant or the other, not the normal strain, said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integrated Biology, underlining that it was a good sign of the quality of the vaccination programme as most of them had mild illnesses. Experts also said that while the double mutant was detected in Maharashtra, it was not the only variant in the country. It was not found in some parts of the country, like Kerala and Punjab. Amid concerns that the current surge in Covid-19 infections could be because of the double mutant, Dr Agarwal said, “First such sequence was part of the database pack in October. But in October, with declining cases, there was no knowledge about this particular mutation being important. The outbreak started in December-January in Kerala and Maharashtra. We gave importance to these states and started looking for mutations in these areas. Kerala had the most severe outbreak at that time. This mutation was absolutely not seen in Kerala. So, it was not related to the clinical outbreaks over there.” Dr Agarwal further said, “In Maharashtra, you will see the first report in India of sequences starting to show this came from BJMC Hospital and a few samples were sequenced. But those were not representative. Around the same time, this mutation turned out to be important with papers coming out from California. They tied it with outbreaks. At that point, you have an outbreak. You have mutations available in sequences. And, you have reason to correlate together. We are making the same judgment today. Today, we can see many doctors are having breakthroughs. We are correlating that.” He also said that since double mutants were sequenced from positive samples, it was not possible that they were not detected through RT-PCR. If people with symptoms went for RT-PCR tests late, after seven-eight days when symptoms become severe, then there was a possibility of the test report coming negative, another expert said. “The emergence of a new mutant is a long procedure,” Dr Saumitra Das of IISC, Bengaluru, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/escape-variants-infecting-doctors-post-vaccination/articleshow/82225285.cms||Sushmi Dey

When 19-year-old G Mariammal, a rag picker whose earnings even in the best of times doesn’t cross Rs 300 a day, spotted a purse with wards of currency and a smartphone on Wednesday, she didn’t sit down to count her luck or the money, but took it straight to the Mukkudal police station in Tirunelveli district where cops found Rs 58,210 in it. On Friday, Tirunelveli district SP N Manivannan felicitated Mariammal, the last of the five daughters of Ganapathy, 45, and Selvi, 40, for her honesty. The family belongs to the Kattu Naicker community, an impoverished nomadic tribe that makes a living through begging or selling smallwares on the streets of Tamil Nadu. All her elder sisters are married and she lives with her parents. Like many others in her community, she could not continue schooling after Class V. She dropped out and started picking rags. Around 3pm on Wednesday Mariammal, her aunt and six other women were collecting rags when the teenager found the purse. “Suddenly the purse started vibrating and we found money and an expensive phone inside it,” says Selvi. The women immediately took it to the police station. “We know the value of hardearned money,” Selvi said. The police felicitated them. The owner of the purse gave them Rs 1,000 as a token of appreciation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ragpicker-19-returns-rs-58000-to-owner-cops-doff-their-hats/articleshow/82225326.cms||M K Ananth

The said issue, if need arises, can be raised before the appropriate forum,” the HC observed while closing the matter. “There are allegations with regard to maltreatment or torture during police custody. The state has filed the status report annexing the medical report. Senior counsel R S Cheema appearing for Nodeep Kaur seeks liberty to avail remedy in accordance with law for redressal of grievance with regard to maltreatment and custodial torture. The present petition is disposed of with liberty as prayed for,” the court added. Justice Avneesh Jhingan has made these observations while disposing of the petition related to the case. The matter had reached before the court after the court had taken suo motu cognizance of the reports about “illegal detention” and “torture” of Nodeep Kaur in the police custody. HC took cognizance after receiving some emails. In response to the HC notice, it was informed about her arrest in connection with an FIR registered by Sonipat police. However, a medical examination report of Nodeep Kaur had hinted at injuries on internal parts of her body. These injuries were allegedly caused due to physical torture by Sonipat police in custody as alleged by Kaur in her petition before the Punjab and Haryana high court. After the HC intervention, a status report about the cases against Nodeep was also filed by the Sonipat police. On February 26, the HC had granted bail to her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/on-nodeep-kaurs-plea-hc-closes-case/articleshow/82225328.cms||---

This is problematic because of the inter-generational transfer of norms to children, including a lack of empowering role models for men undertaking domestic work in the home and women working in the paid workforce,” said the report titled “Gender Bias & Inclusion In Advertising In India.” The research conducted by Unicef with the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media measures the level and type of gender stereotyping found in Indian advertisements on TV and YouTube, through analysis of over 1,000 most viewed advertisements in 2019. The ads were provided and translated by the International Advertising Association (IAA). Unicef said IAA will be working with members to launch campaigns to deconstruct harmful stereotypes. Times ViewAdvertisements play an important role in subconsciously shaping our social attitudes and even more so in a world in which we are constantly bombarded through all kinds of media. Ads with gender biases reinforce prejudice. But advertising can also become a key agent of changing attitudes. The marketing world needs to make the right choice.The research also found consistent gender differences in sexualisation. Female characters are nine times more likely to be shown as ‘stunning/very attractive’ than male characters (5.9% compared with 0.6%). They are six times more likely to be shown in revealing clothing (11.2% compared with 1.7%); four times more likely to be depicted as partially nude (7.6% compared with 1.6%); and five times more likely to be sexually objectified (4.7% compared with 0.9%) than male characters. The report also highlights “colourism”. Two-thirds of female characters (66.9%) have light or medium-light skin tones — significantly more than male characters (52.1%). “This is problematic because this advances the discriminatory notion that light skin tones are more attractive,” the analysis concludes. Dr Yasmin Ali Haque, Unicef representative in India, said: “This report will help us challenge biases and advocate more effectively with the Indian advertising community, and across South Asia”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/desi-ads-follow-gender-stereotypes-un-study/articleshow/82225335.cms||Ambika Pandit

The Army on Thursday issued an initial Request for Information (RFI) to vendors for the procurement of 350 newgeneration light tanks, less than 25-tonne in weight, in a project under the “Make in India ethos” with requisite transfer of technology. The Army had managed to deploy its heavier Russian-origin T-90S and T-72 main-battle tanks (weighing between 40 to 50 tonne each) in eastern Ladakh. Since then, there has been troop disengagement between India and China on both sides of the Pangong Tso in February. But the People’s Liberation Army has thereafter refused to complete the stalled disengagement at Gogra, Hot Springs and Demchok, let alone stop blocking Indian patrols in the Depsang Plains, as was reported by TOI earlier. Officers said a need has now been felt for procurement of “much more manoeuvrable” and “operationally flexible” light tanks, with adequate firepower, in mountainous terrains. “This is an initial RFI, for which responses have to be submitted by mid-June, to explore the platforms available now. If the project takes off, it will take several years for the 350 tanks to be inducted in phases,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-looks-to-buy-350-light-tanks-to-boost-warfare-in-hills/articleshow/82225356.cms||---

Officers shot and killed the attacker at the scene on Friday, authorities said. The attack stunned the quiet residential neighbourhood near the famed historic chateau of Rambouillet, and prompted renewed French government promises to fight extremism and protect police. Anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard told reporters that his office took over the probe because the attacker had staked out the station ahead of time, because of statements he made during the attack, and because he targeted a police official. Ricard did not provide details on the attacker’s identity, motive or purported terrorist ties. His national anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office opened an investigation into murder of a person of public authority in relation with a terrorist group. French media reports identified the attacker as a 37-year-old French resident with no criminal record or record of radicalisation. A French judicial official said the suspect was born in Tunisia and that witnesses heard him say “Allahu akbar”, Arabic for “God is great”, during the attack. Police searched the attacker’s home in Rambouillet and detained three people in his entourage, an official said. French PM Jean Castex rushed to the scene with other officials and pledged the government’s “determination to fight terrorism in all its forms.” “She was a policewoman,” President Emmanuel Macron wrote on Twitter after the attack, identifying the victim only as Stéphanie. “We will yield nothing in the fight against Islamist terrorism.” The official killed on Friday was a 49-year-old administrative employee who worked for the national police service, a police spokesperson said. Valerie Pecresse, president of the Paris region, said, “Police are symbols of the republic. They are France. The face of France was targeted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/man-fatally-stabs-police-staffer-france-opens-terror-probe-detains-3/articleshow/82225375.cms||---

Yediyurappa requested the Centre to supply 1,471 tonnes of oxygen every day and two lakh doses of Remdesivir immediately. “The state used 500 tonnes of oxygen on Thursday whereas supply from the Centre was only 300 tonnes,” Yediyurappa pointed out. “As per the Centre’s own guidelines, the state requires 1,142 tonnes of oxygen from April 25 and it will go up to 1,471 tonnes from April 30. The Centre must supply oxygen as per requirements or else we will be forced to shut some health facilities,” he said. Modi reportedly responded to the demand positively, saying steps are being taken to step up production of medical oxygen and Remdesivir. Yediyurappa said there has been an alarming rise in infections in Bengaluru, Tumakuru, Ballari, Mysuru, Hassan and Kalaburagi, due to which demand for Remdesivir has spiralled. Listing measures taken to tackle the situation, Yediyurappa said his government has ordered private hospitals to reserve 50% of beds for Covid patients referred by the government. He told the PM the government has permitted private hospitals to use hotels as step-down medical facilities, while plans are underway to set up field hospitals with ICU facilities. He also apprised the PM about measures initiated by his government to control the spread of the virus particularly in Bengaluru and how curbs on movement of people have been imposed in such a manner that economic activities would be least affected. He also said that so far 82 lakh people had received a dose of the vaccine, and efforts will be made to uniformly distribute vaccines from May 1 when the new vaccination policy kicks in to enable doses for all above 18 years of age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/allocate-1-4k-tonnes-of-oxygen-to-karnataka-bs-yediyurappa-urges-centre/articleshow/82226137.cms||---

Recovery rate is the number of patients recovered per 100 patients who have been tested positive for Covid-19. On April 15, the recovery rate in the state was 83.9% and on April 23, in just a week it has deteriorated to 80.4%. This means that out of total patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the state till April 15, nearly 84% had recovered from the disease and now on April 23, only 80% of the total who have tested positive have recovered. These figures also signify the increase in active cases in the state—as more people had tested positive and less have recovered. However, of the 52 districts while the condition in 41 had deteriorated in the past one week, it has improved significantly in 11 districts. Agar-Malwa district has seen an improvement of 12% while Shajapur has shown an improvement of 8.79% and Narsinghpur has shown an improvement of 7.15% in recovery rate. Overall the situation in 27 out of 52 districts of the state is graver as the deterioration in recovery rate in these districts is more than state average. Among the worst are districts like Sidhi, Morena, Sheopur, Datia and Shivpuri. In Sidhi recovery rate has reduced by more than 20%. Even Damoh district that has witnessed a by-election recently is among the 10 worst districts when it comes to reduction in recovery rates. It has deteriorated by 9.75% in Damoh district in past 7 days. Then there are several other districts where recovery rate has deteriorated but my meagre percentages, these includes Indore, Khandwa and Ujjain districts where the positive rate has reduced by less than 1% during the same seven days. Sources said that while the 11 districts with improvement raise a ray of hope, those districts which are on the brink also needs to be focused upon, as they are likely to improve, districts like Sidhi where the situation has worsened, should be the top priority, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/silver-lining-recovery-rate-improves-in-11-districts/articleshow/82225399.cms||Amarjeet Singh
