---||World||Help for India: UK diaspora raises over Rs 1 crore within hours||LONDON: The UK Indian diaspora raised more than £100,000 (Rs 1 crore) within hours to help India win its deadly Covid-19 battle. A GoFundMe appeal set up by Amit Kachroo and two others to supply India with oxygen concentrators had by Sunday night reached £1,00,000 from just 1,800 donors. The appeal read: “Since lack of oxygen supply has been a limiting factor, we would like to contribute as many Oxygen concentrators as we can procure from various sellers and send it to India to aid in recovery and ease the burden on already stretched resources. Oxygen concentrators need just a 220V power supply to purify oxygen from ambient air by filtering out nitrogen. Every contribution no matter how big or small counts. Time is of essence and we would like to raise these funds by Monday morning UK time to ensure that we can get hold of all supplies that are available.” In the Facebook group, Indians in London, many PIOs worried sick about loved ones back in India, shared contact numbers of UK courier companies and companies selling oxygen concentrators in the UK including links to supplies on Amazon and discussed how to put them together in one container and ship them to India all at once within days. Various charities launched emergency appeals over the weekend too as the true scale of the disaster became apparent. The British Asian Trust launched an 'India Covid-19 emergency appeal' on Virgin Money and JustGiving websites which had raised £1,500 in 24 hours. Lord Gadhia, a trustee of the Trust, said: "We are getting a lot of enquiries from the UK Indian diaspora about how they can help in the current situation. The British Asian Trust works with some long-standing and highly reputable delivery partners like Jan Sahas and Goonj to reach the frontline. In the last campaign during the first lockdown in India we raised £1 million in our Covid-19 emergency appeal. This time around, we will assess the most pressing requirements and act accordingly." The BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in London, known as Neasden Temple, launched The BAPS India Covid Emergency to provide critical health care and support to the vulnerable. A petition on change.org started by British Indian Rohit Kotecha, addressed to Boris Johnson, had garnered just under 2,000 signatures within hours. “I would urge the UK government to, as a matter of urgency, procure and send life-saving oxygen along with any other equipment/expertise that is available to assist in the current emergency, regardless of whether a formal request has been made,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/help-for-india-uk-diaspora-raises-over-rs-1-crore-within-hours/articleshow/82249070.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||India||Joe Biden, Kamala Harris assure India of support in fight against Covid-19||WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have assured India and its people of providing all assistance, including urgently sending necessary medical life-saving supplies and equipment, to help the country combat the deadly coronavirus crisis.  "Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need," Biden said in a tweet.  The President was spending his weekend at his home in Delaware but is believed to be following up the developments in India.  "The US is working closely with the Indian government to rapidly deploy additional support and supplies during an alarming COVID-19 outbreak. As we provide assistance, we pray for the people of India -including its courageous healthcare workers," Harris said in a tweet.  The tweets by Biden and Harris are the first reactions by the top American leadership after the recent outbreak of deadly COVID19 pandemic in India. The two have been criticizsed by friends of India in the US, including some of their own party leaders, for slow response to the American help to their natural ally.  Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said she has been in close touch with Foreign Secretary Harshvardhan Shringla and India's Ambassador to US Taranjit Singh Sandhu in recent days on the issue.  "The American people stand in solidarity with our friends in India during these difficult times. We are rapidly providing therapeutics, ventilators, PPE, raw material for vaccines, and more," Sherman said.  Earlier on Sunday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke to his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval during which the White House announced that it is urgently sending medical supplies and equipment to save lives in India.  The Indian-American community, which had been critical of the Biden administration so far, welcomed the move.  "Great to see our US India partnership at work at this critical time," Indiaspora said after Biden's tweet.  "Good first steps," Indian-American Democratic bundler Shekar Narasimhan said after Sullivan announced details of the assistance to India.  In a tweet, he described it as "moving the needle".  "I am also counting on private and corporate actions to make a difference. Many have a big stake in India and it's not just Indian Americans," he said.  India's Ambassador to US Sandhu thanked both US Secretary of State Tony Blinken and Sullivan for their prompt response. "Thank you Sullivan for your reach out and support. We will fight the global pandemic through our collective action!" he said in a tweet.  "Thank you Secretary Blinken for your solidarity and support. Together, we will fight the global pandemic!" Sandhu said in another tweet.  Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna, Congressional India Caucus Vice Chair and Member of the House Armed Services Committee, applauded the Biden administration.  "International cooperation and humanitarian assistance are the hallmarks of a truly progressive foreign policy. In the face of apocalyptic numbers of COVID-19 cases & new variants exploding in India, I applaud the Biden administration's decision to put people over profits and provide additional Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), oxygen, and other medical supplies to India," Khanna said.  "I am also pleased to see the deployment of raw materials for India to produce more vaccines and USAID's work with the CDC to expedite the mobilisation of emergency resources for India through the Global Fund. This must be done with the utmost speed and urgency," he said.  Khanna said the Biden administration can still do more, like give India "our stockpile" of AstraZeneca vaccines that won't be used in the US and have already opened up to Mexico and Canada. "And we should facilitate the Indian diaspora in America to help assist hospitals in India."  Khanna said the administration should also call on Pfizer and Moderna to provide an intellectual property waiver for six months to a year as India grapples with the COVID-19 crisis. It will buy them an inordinate amount of goodwill in one of the largest emerging markets, he added.  "The White House should also convene Indian business leaders to make the case for why this is in these companies' long-term strategic interest. Many Indian American business leaders such as Vinod Khosla are happy to make the case to them why this is a good business decision. Mr. Khosla has committed to financially help any hospitals in India in need of supplies and will also be speaking with the India Caucus leadership to discuss what else can be done to assist," Khanna said.  In a statement, Khanna said he is looking forward to joining the India Caucus leadership on a call with Indian Ambassador to US Taranjit Singh Sandhu to discuss what additional steps the US can take to help India during this "incredibly difficult time".  "This is a very tough time for the Indian people and underscores the continued threat of COVID-19. These new strains of the virus are gravely alarming and could pose a threat here in America and across the globe if we do not do all we can to contain the virus and its new variants," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/joe-biden-kamala-harris-assure-india-of-support-in-fight-against-covid-19/articleshow/82249085.cms||---

Even on Sunday, the country reported 3.55 lakh cases and 2,807 deaths, both new global highs. In the seven days between April 18 and April 25, India reported 22.49 lakh cases, which is the highest number of cases reported by any country in any seven-day period since the beginning of the pandemic. The excess burden on the health care system is also being reflected in the alarming growth rate of deaths in this period. Compared with 8,588 deaths reported in the week ending April 18, the last seven days saw 16,257 deaths. The 89% increase in cumulative deaths is nearly double the rate of increase of cumulative cases in this period which saw a 47% surge. Before India clocked over 22 lakh cases in a week, the only country which had come anywhere close was the US, which recorded 17.9 lakh cases in the seven-day period ending January 10 this year.

For the UK, this was 4.3 lakh; for Turkey, 4.2 lakh. No other country has ever reported more than 4 lakh cumulative cases over seven days. The highest cumulative total for deaths for any seven-day period was reported by the US which recorded 23,411 fatalities for the week ending January 15. The corresponding figures were 21,865 for Brazil and 16,257 for India. No other country has ever seen over 10,000 deaths in any continuous seven-day stretch. Coronavirus: Live updatesIndia’s cases started surging from mid-February. On February 12, the cumulative total of cases for the preceding seven days touched a little over 77,000 — the lowest for any seven-day period in this year. Since then there has been a steady increase in cases. The weekly total of cases touched one lakh on February 25, two lakh on March 18 and four lakh on March 29. Cases started rising exponentially in April. On April 4 – the first Sunday this month — the cumulative total of cases for the previous seven days was 5.49 lakh which increased to 9.37 lakh on April 11 and 15.32 lakh on April 18.

---||India||Covid-19: Second wave has shaken country, says PM Modi||NEW DELHI: The second wave of Covid-19 infections has shaken the country and is testing the patience and limits of people but the government is utilising its entire might to give a fillip to efforts of state governments to overcome the crisis and beat back the disease, PM Narendra Modi said on Sunday. In his monthly ‘Mann ki Baat’ radio address, the PM acknowledged the virulence and spread of the current wave. “Many of our near and dear ones have left us untimely. After successfully confronting the first wave of corona, the country was full of enthusiasm, full of self-confidence, but this storm has shaken the country,” he said. Seeking to reassure people of the efforts to contain the spread of infections, Modi said he has had lengthy deliberations with experts from the pharma industry, vaccine manufacturers, those connected with oxygen production and experts from the medical field who had all offered valuable suggestions. “This time, for emerging victorious in this battle, we have to accord priority to expert and scientific advice. The government of India is applying its entire might to give a fillip to the endeavours of state governments. The states too are trying their best to fulfil their responsibilities,” the PM said. In a departure from his usual practice, Sunday’s Mann ki Baat was only on Covid-19 with experts and healthcare workers speaking of their experience and the need to contain panic. Modi spoke to doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers to instill confidence in people and said the biggest priority was to defeat the disease. Modi emphasised that people should get information only from correct sources. “You can consult your family doctor or doctors in the neighbourhood on the phone. I am noticing that many of our doctors are taking upon themselves this responsibility, on their own. Many doctors are providing information to people through social media.... Many hospitals have websites where information is available,” he said. The PM urged people to opt for vaccination and not be swayed by rumours. “Now, from May 1 onwards, the vaccine is going to be made available for every person above 18 in the country. Now, the corporate sector and companies too will be able to participate in the programme of administering vaccines to their employees,” he said, adding that the programme of free vaccination by the Centre would continue. Modi lauded the voluntary services being provided by people from different walks of life who are delivering medicines, vegetables and other essentials to families living in quarantine and those offering free ambulance services to patients. He spoke to physician Dr Shashank Joshi who explained the need to attend to any Covid-like illness without delay, saying that people think they will get better on their own and this takes a toll. He said in most cases, protocols of medicines and oxygen assistance were enough to cure people and also spoke of the efficacy of vaccines. An ambulance driver spoke of his mother asking him to discontinue his job but said he had explained that taking patients in need to hospital was a critical function and a national duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-second-wave-has-shaken-country-says-pm-modi/articleshow/82249466.cms||---

The posts have since been removed and the action – the most for content on Twitter — comes amid online criticism over the handling of the second wave of infections. However, IT ministry sources maintained that it had sought action only against posts or URLs, which were adjudged to be hindering the fight against the virus. The IT ministry action came in the wake of a recommendation by the home ministry, which took note of “misuse of social media platforms by certain users”. In recent days, social media platforms have also emerged as a source for mobilising help as well as generating chatter around the fresh and deadly wave of coronavirus infections. “This decision has been taken to prevent obstructions in the fight against the pandemic and escalation of public order due to these posts,” an official said. Read Also'Need to stop panic &amp; misinformation': Govt clarifies on Twitter moveNEW DELHI: The IT ministry said that it had asked social media platforms to remove around 100 posts to prevent efforts to 'spread fake info about the Covid situation.' It said that old, unrelated and out of context images and visuals were being misused by certain social media users to spreadSources said the intention through the action was “not to block any criticism about Covid handling, but to block inflammatory content that used morphed or doctored images and statements” to attack the government and created disturbance in the society. “The ministry flagged blatant cases of forgery where old photographs of cremations were used, or photographs of cremations in a particular city were being passed off as the scene in some other city. Twitter and other platforms acted after verifying the genuineness of the complaints,” a source said. Those whose posts have been ordered to be taken down also came from certain verified accounts such as that of Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera (who made a reference to action on Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi last year and holding of Kumbh this year and political rallies), Congress MP Revanth Reddy (criticised corona deaths over shortages with a picture of a crematorium), and West Bengal minister Moly Ghatak (who blamed the government for mismanagement of crisis and put pictures of crematorium and political rallies). Khera has sent a legal notice against his tweet being taken down. Posts from Avinash Das and Vinod Kapri (filmmakers) and Dr Kafeel Khan were also blocked for using “old and unrelated visuals of patients and dead bodies and trying to show them as related to the Covid crisis to create panic in society”. The official sources claimed that through the posts, “certain people are misusing social media to create panic” in society. “The government welcomes criticism, genuine requests for help as well as suggestions in the collective fight against Covid-19, but it is necessary to take action against those users who are misusing social media during this grave humanitarian crisis for unethical purposes,” one of the sources said. Facebook and Instagram did not comment on the matter. A spokesperson for Twitter said, “When we receive a valid legal request, we review it under both the ‘Twitter Rules’ and local law. If the content violates Twitter’s Rules, the content will be removed from the service. If it is determined to be illegal in a particular jurisdiction, but not in violation of the Twitter rules, we may withhold access to the content in India only.” Twitter said it does notify account holders directly so they’re aware that it is taking the action due to a legal order. “We notify the user(s) by sending a message to the email address associated with the account(s), if available.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ordered-only-fake-covid-posts-blocked-not-critical-ones-it-ministry/articleshow/82249535.cms||Pankaj Doval

In an emailed statement to TOI by Ulfa (I) president Abhijit Asom on Sunday, the outfit said it was concerned over 67-year-old Moran’s "critical health condition and lack of proper treatment at his current disadvantageous location". "It has been decided to relieve him of all responsibilities of the organisation from April 25, 2021, following his desire to return home for treatment and spend time with his family members," the statement read. "I, on behalf of all members of the outfit, wish our strong and dedicated comrade well on his return journey home." The statement didn't reveal Moran's location. A senior police officer of the special branch said Moran hadn't communicated with the administration yet. "But we have heard that he has been released. We will be able to give details once we get a confirmation from him." Moran, a close associate of the outfit’s commander-in-chief Paresh Barua, was part of the second batch of Ulfa militants to go to Myanmar for training in 1984. He remained second-in-command of the hardline faction of the outfit till now. Moran, the oldest member of Ulfa(I), hails from Kakojan in upper Assam's Tinsukia district.

For immediate enhancement of oxygen supply for treating Covid-19 patients, industries have been ordered to restrict the use of liquid oxygen, including existing stock, and divert it for medical purposes. This is expected to add around 1,500 tonnes to the daily supply, estimated at 6,600 tonnes on Friday, government sources said. Coronavirus: Live updatesThe 551 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) units are in addition to the 162 announced earlier, for which over Rs 200 crore was sanctioned. PM Modi has ordered that the facilities be made operational at the earliest. Steel units and oil refineries have already stepped up supply of liquid oxygen produced at their plants and the move will not impact their manufacturing or refining operations, industry sources said. Steel plants, for instance, require gaseous oxygen and set up captive units to produce the gas along with nitrogen and argon. These plants can produce 5-6% liquid oxygen at their peak capacity. Liquid oxygen is a highly pure product compared to industrial oxygen. The Centre has asked states and Union territories to allow all manufacturing units to maximise their production of liquid oxygen and make it available to the government for medical purposes. Plants can only optimise liquid oxygen production by sacrificing some gaseous oxygen and optimise process parameters, the steel ministry said. “No exception is allowed to any industry with regard to use of liquid oxygen,” an order issued by home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said. The decision to limit the use of liquid oxygen to medical purposes by all industries was taken at a review meeting chaired by home minister Amit Shah on Sunday. A home ministry official said the order would not affect the nine industry segments which had been exempted from the ban on supply of industrial oxygen by manufacturers and suppliers. Separately, the government has asked major ports to waive all charges, including vessel-related and storage fees, for three months and accord highest priority in the berthing sequence to vessels carrying oxygen consignments.

He dismissed allegations that the Centre was getting 50% of the local vaccine production at a cheaper price than states, saying it did not give vaccines directly to anyone and the jabs were distributed through states and UTs. After May 1, these vaccines will be free of cost in government hospitals for people above 45 years. “The actual situation is that states are getting one guaranteed channel of free vaccine supply, while they can simultaneously procure vaccines from another channel as per its aspirations and commitment to its people,” he said in a statement on Twitter. Vardhan’s statement came in the wake of many states complaining about differential pricing of vaccines. Without naming Congress, he said, “...there are certain political leaders who have chosen to indulge in needless politics on the issue of vaccination and are spreading misinformation at every step.” “Now, this ‘balance 50% quota’ shall give them (states) freedom to vaccinate groups they deem as priority,” he said, adding that states will have the liberty to procure directly from manufacturers and even negotiate prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-states-now-have-2-vaccine-channels-one-of-them-free/articleshow/82249732.cms||---

The ministry sent an ‘action plan’ to the company on April 1, a day after full-time chairman Shashi Shanker retired. The letter from additional secretary (exploration) Amar Nath asked acting chairman and director (finance) Subhash Kumar to respond by “Monday the 5th of April”, or just four days. The action plan centres around hiving off in-house operations -- drilling, well services, logging, workover services and data processing - into separate entities. It identifies Ratna-R and Pana-Mukta offshore fields as well as Gandhar onland in Gujarat for inducting private partners in the western region. In the eastern offshore, the $5-billion KG-DWN-98/2 gas project, slated to be the crown jewel, Deendayal West block, acquired from GSPC for $995 million in 2017, and Ashoknagar onland discovery near Kolkata have been flagged for inducting “global majors as partners”. Industry analysts said the plan will turn ONGC into a surrogate company where it will be left with investing risk capital for exploration but will have to share the fruits of its toil with private partners brought in to develop discoveries "on market-friendly terms as lower royalty". Separating in-house expertise and functions, built over the years, into separate entities will weaken ONGC’s value and raise costs. “ONGC will have to pay 18% GST to the subsidiaries for services but will not be able to claim input credit. Today this is not so since these are in-house functions,” one analyst said requesting anonymity. ONGC will lose its financial leverage in raising cheaper debt as “nobody lends to a company whose primary task will be to sink risk capital,” a former company executive said on condition of anonymity. Another former executive said ONGC may be left stranded as the subsidiaries will look for contracts from others. “Many companies with fields are struggling due to dearth of cheaper domestic resources in these services. There could be instances where, say, the capacity of the drilling subsidiary is booked by other companies.” The plan also envisages privatising smaller fields and monetising assets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/oil-ministry-plans-to-carve-up-ongc-in-pieces-offer-stake-to-private-companies/articleshow/82249743.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||India||Congress accuses government of facilitating vaccine profiteering||NEW DELHI: Congress on Sunday accused the Modi government of facilitating vaccine profiteering amid the steep and persistent rise in coronavirus cases in the country. Congress’s communications head Randeep Surjewala said it was unacceptable that the two vaccines available in India were being sold at five different price points and accused the Modi government of abdicating its responsibility to the people by allowing this to happen. Surjewala also alleged that by introducing the “highly discriminatory vaccine policy” under which the vaccines would be sold at different prices to the Centre, states and private hospitals, the government had allowed the two vaccine manufacturers, Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech, to make a profit of Rs 1.11 lakh crore at the expense of India’s young. “Modi government's vaccination policy has deregulated 50% production of the two vaccine manufacturers — Serum Institute (Covishield) and Bharat Biotech (Covaxin) — as free from price regulation, to fix the prices for supply to states and private institutions. The two have now released an absolutely discriminatory pricing policy,” he said. Last week, Serum Institute announced that it will sell its vaccine to the Centre at Rs 150 per dose, to states at Rs 400 a piece and to private hospitals at Rs 600 per vial. Bharat Biotech, on the other hand, said its vaccine will cost Rs 600 per dose for state governments and Rs 1,200 for private hospitals. The Union government, however, will continue to get Covaxin at Rs 150 per vial. After widespread outrage over the differential pricing of vaccines by all opposition parties including Congress, the Union government clarified that it will make its share of vaccines available to states for free. However, it did not comment on higher prices for the remaining 50% of vaccines. Criticising the “liberalised” vaccine pricing, Congress said India will need 202 crore doses to inoculate its eligible population. It also said this “discriminatory and insensitive” price policy would effectively disenfranchise around 31 crore BPL population, and crores of others who represent marginalised or economically backward communities. Congress also slammed the Modi government for failing to use the PM-Cares fund to set up a single oxygen plant in the last one year, despite having promised to start 75. “Not a single plant has been set up using PM-Cares fund in the last one year. Only announcements have been made, but no implementation on the ground,” Surjewala said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-accuses-government-of-facilitating-vaccine-profiteering/articleshow/82249746.cms||---
---||World||Did Boris Johnson aide carry ‘Indian variant’ to UK?||LONDON: One of UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s key aides caught Covid-19 on a failed trip to India in March to secure more AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines from the Serum Institute of India (SII), sparking fears he may have brought the deadly Indian variant into the UK and the heart of the British government. David Quarrey, the UK PM’s international affairs adviser and deputy national security adviser, tested positive a week after returning from India on March 25, after travelling there with Lord Udny-Lister, Johnson's then key aide, on what turned out to be a failed mission to secure millions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the SII. The SII delivered five million vaccine doses to the UK in early March but held back the next five million it had promised owing to the rising Covid cases in India. It caused a temporary shortage of vaccines in Britain and led to the doomed trip. Being a government representative, who was conducting essential state business outside of the UK, Quarrey was exempted from quarantine and testing requirements. He took a pre-departure Covid test in India ahead of flying back to the UK on March 25. That test was found to be negative. Quarrey then flew back to the UK and went back to work in Whitehall. He did not have Covid symptoms on return from his trip to India. However, On April 1, a week after his return, Quarrey received a message from NHS Test and Trace informing him that someone on the same flight had tested positive for Covid. He took a coronavirus test the same day, was found to be positive, and went into self-isolation for 10 days. Before being contacted by NHS Test and Trace, Quarrey had been in his office in Whitehall, including at 10, Downing Street. Downing Street sought to play down fears he may have helped bring the 'Indian variant' of the virus into Britain. No.10 said that all his close contacts followed the correct procedures and self-isolated after he was found to be positive. “Mr Quarrey followed the correct procedures on his return to the UK," a government spokesperson said. His trip came ahead of the planned visit by Johnson this weekend, which was cancelled last week due to India’s deadly second wave of the virus. Last March, Johnson was hospitalised with Covid and a string of ministers and government advisors had also caught it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/did-boris-johnson-aide-carry-indian-variant-to-uk/articleshow/82249748.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Nine airline container loads of supplies, including 495 oxygen concentrators, 120 non-invasive ventilators and 20 manual ventilators, will be sent to India this week after India reported its highest number of new daily cases and deaths since the pandemic began and hospitals are facing severe shortages of oxygen. The Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), which has funded India' assistance package, said: “Following discussions with the government of India, the first shipment of equipment left the UK on Sunday, arriving in New Delhi in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Further shipments are due to follow later this week.” The package includes ventilators and oxygen concentrators from surplus stocks which will be used by the Government of India to provide vital medical treatment to those suffering from Covid-19 in India.

Vital medical equipment, including hundreds of oxygen concentrators and ventilators, is now on its way from the UK to India to support efforts to prevent the tragic loss of life from this terrible virus. We will continue to work closely with the Indian government during this difficult time.” said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The Department of Health and Social Care have worked closely with the NHS, as well as suppliers and manufacturers in the UK to identify reserve life-saving equipment that can be sent to India, the FCDO said. “This equipment will be crucial in helping to save the lives of the most vulnerable in India. The oxygen concentrators, for example, can extract oxygen from the air in the atmosphere so that it can be provided to patients, taking the strain off hospital oxygen systems and allowing oxygen to be provided in situations where hospital oxygen supplies have run out,” the FCDO explained. The announcement comes a day after the Indian High Commission in London put out an SOS tweet on Twitter asking for anyone in the world to supply India with oxygen concentrators, Remdesivir, oxygen manufacturing plants in situ in hospitals and empty oxygen cylinders and provided an email address to contact. The UK is working closely with the Government of India to identify further assistance it can provide in the coming days, the FCDO said. UK health secretary Matt Hancock said: “The heart-breaking scenes in India show once again how awful this terrible disease is. We are determined to support the people of India through this very difficult time, and I am hugely grateful to those who have worked hard to make this initial delivery happen.” “We are supporting our Indian friends with medical equipment to help them in the battle against Coronavirus.

---||Patna||Bihar: Woman gets bro nabbed in liquor smuggling case||PATNA: A woman reached Mohania police station in Kaimur to get her brother nabbed as he was allegedly involved in liquor smuggling, police said on Sunday. Mohania police station SHO Ram Kalyan Yadav said the accused, Arvind Kumar (28), was arrested on the information provided by his sister Saturday night. Yadav said Arvind is a native of Piparia village. He had been to jail on two separate occasions earlier on the charges of liquor smuggling. “Arvind’s elder sister with her husband reached Mohania police station from Chanduali, which is a neighbouring district in Uttar Pradesh, at around 5pm on Friday,” he said. Yadav said the woman was initially hesitant but soon she opened up giving information against her brother’s involvement in liquor smuggling. The SHO said the woman even alleged that Arvind also frequently thrashed their elderly widow mother whenever she tried to stop him from smuggling liquor. “Soon after getting the information, a police team headed by ASI Parvez Alam was sent to Arvind’s residence at Piparia and recovered 51 bottles amounting to 10 litres of UP-manufactured IMFL. He was arrested from the spot,” he said. “Arvind’s sister didn’t want to become a complainant herself in the case against him due to several reasons, including family matters. Understanding the situation, an FIR was registered against Arvind on the basis of ASI Alam’s written complaint,” he said. Yadav said Chandauli border is hardly 5km away from Mohania and Arvind used to take advantage of this border location of his residence to smuggle liquor from UP. The SHO said the woman is settled in Chandauli after marriage and had reached Mohania directly from her husband’s residence to pass on the information about her brother's illegal activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-gets-bro-nabbed-in-liquor-smuggling-case/articleshow/82246347.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Kochi||Kerala: Idukki cardamom farmers affected as prices crash||IDUKKI: Ever since the pandemic broke out, cardamom prices have been declining sharply on low demand in the district saddling farmers and traders alike with unsold stocks. The prices dropped to below Rs 1,000 per kg in the local market. The average price recorded at an auction at the Spices Park in Bodinaikannur on Friday was Rs 1,089 a kg. In comparison, prices touched Rs 7,000/kg in August 2019. Normally, cardamom prices increase in April and May on high demand due to the festivals. There is a huge uptick in demand during Ramzan as well from north India and foreign countries. But this year, the prices have fallen due to the pandemic. Expecting better prices during the festival season, production was increased and traders stocked huge quantities, but now they are struggling to sell them off. In Kumily and Kattappana, the prices have fallen to as low as Rs 800 per kg. Adv K S Mathew, chairman of Cardamom Producers Company, said: “Traders and farmers are left with large stocks of unsold cardamom. This supply glut is also driving down the prices. The next crop will reach the markets from July onwards. In the present situation we expect the prices to fall further,” said Mathew. “We never expected such a steep fall in prices. I approached several buyers but none of them were willing to buy my stocks. The decline in prices have come as a major shock for the farmers,” said Jose T, a farmer based in Pathumury. M J Joseph Mattapparampil, a cardamom trader in Kumily, said in the present scenario the traders cannot buy the product from farmers due to the demand slump. “We used to sell cardamom to tourists who visit our shops. But after the second wave, the tourist arrivals have come to a halt.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/idukki-cardamom-farmers-affected-as-prices-crash/articleshow/82246212.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Special officers to monitor 104 call centre ops||AMARAVATI: The state government on Sunday appointed special officers to monitor calls received at Covid-19 emergency 104 call centre. Assistant collectors and senior officials were directed to stay at district call centres and monitor assistance provided to patients. With chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy directing the health department to strengthen the call centre in order to provide effective services to patients, the government deputed special officers to monitor the performance of the call centres. The chief minister wanted one of the three joint collectors to stay in district call centres to supervise the situation and take decisions. The chief minister said Covid-19 care should be made call centre centric by attending every patient in need. He made it clear that no patient should complain of shortage of bed or treatment within three hours of the receipt of the call. Sources said health and family welfare department had, however, deputed assistant collector and deputy director rank officials to handle the 104 call centre based on inputs received from districts. Sources said district collectors told the government that they could not spare joint collectors to handle the 104 task in view of the growing positive cases as they felt that senior officials’ presence was required to make field inspections. While probationary IAS officers were posted to call centre operations in 10 districts, senior officials were posted in the remaining districts. The government has already appointed special chief secretary and principal secretary rank officers to all districts to take stock of the situation. Meanwhile, the government has fixed the CT scan price at Rs 3,000. “In the current second wave, many cases are being reported and to be admitted and treated on the basis of CT / HRCT scan and clinical picture. If this important diagnostic test is not affordable and accessible to public, then the disease will spread in the community leading to more number of cases and resultant burden on the health infrastructure,” said principal secretary health Anil Kumar Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/spl-officers-to-monitor-104-call-centre-ops/articleshow/82246354.cms||Samdani MN
---||Kolkata||Week-long wait to find out if you have Covid||KOLKATA: As the daily Covid-19 case load continues its steep climb, pathology laboratories have been overwhelmed with demand for RT-PCR tests. With capacities exhausted, the wait time for swab collection has gone up from one day to four-five days with another two-three days’ wait for the report. Some of the private labs are testing 2,500 swab samples a day. The private hospitals are pitching in between 600-1,500 daily tests and the government hospitals are testing over 1,500 swab samples. But these numbers are still not enough with the demand-supply gap widening. “In the beginning of April, we were testing above 25,000 samples a day. Now, the figure has gone up to 55,000 with almost the same infrastructure. The demand is several times higher than that. Bigger cities, like Delhi, are conducting close to 1 lakh tests daily,” said a government doctor. The worst-hit are those who want to get tested at home or those who are in home isolation. While several need the test result to arrange for oxygen, others are not even able to consult telemedicine doctors on time. For hundreds in home quarantine, it has meant delayed investigations, like CT chest scans, and blood tests, like D-Dimer and Ferritin, that are essential to monitor body vitals. “A person suspected to have contracted Covid has two options — go out for tests and risk infecting others or wait for days for laboratories to process the report and make adequate arrangements. The average wait at laboratories for home collection is 72-96 hours with another 48-72 hours before reports reach patients,” said a source.. People have also not been able to cremate their kin due to delay in the arrival of Covid report. Hospital authorities refuse to release the body until the report arrives as they can then decide whether the body will go to a general crematorium or a Covid facility. For those in home isolation, the wait to find out whether one is infected is turning out to be an agonizingly long one. Anuradha Pal of Behala, who planned to get her tests done last Tuesday after developing high fever, said, “What if I develop complications while waiting for the report?” Her office has now demanded another RT-PCR test to allow her to work from home. Sayoni Patra, a college teacher from Dum Dum Park, said she received her report five days after her swab was collected. “The collection was done four days after I contacted them. The laboratory said they had a queue of 16,000 patients across the state,” Patra said. Those who thought they would opt for the more expensive CB-NAAT test and get a faster result were in for a shock too. An elderly couple had to wait several hours to get the result. “Our son, who is settled abroad, suggested this test. But we had to wait for four hours despite me running a high temperature for two days,” said Swapanjit Banerjee from Lansdowne. Typically, a laboratory needs 10-15 people for processing about 2,000-2,500 samples a day and if the laboratory has to run double shifts, the number of people required increases to 25. A lot of data entry, too, is required under government protocol. “The pressure to test samples is tremendous. But it is good that people are going for the test. How fast we detect and isolate has an impact on treatment and mortality,” said nuclear cardiologist Alok Roy, chairman, Medica Group of Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/week-long-wait-to-find-out-if-you-have-covid/articleshow/82247131.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Despite the higher allocation, however, the crisis continued unabated on the ground with private and government hospitals asking patients to procure the vials despite notifications by the Union and state health ministry prohibiting Remdesivir sale over retail channels. The additional 4,600 vials of Remdesivir for Bengal will meet much of the state’s requirement, but there will still be a deficit of 18,000 vials. While the problem with Remdesivir has been partially resolved, Tocilizumab continues to be out of stock. The state health department on Saturday also issued revised guidelines for use of Remdesivir, making it clear that it needed to be administered judiciously. In the notice, it has outlined that the drug can be given to patients within five to 10 days of the onset of symptoms, but not to patients who have already had the symptoms for 10 days. The dosage has also been laid out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-allocation-hiked-to-32000-remdesivir-vials/articleshow/82247143.cms||---

A CMO official said Nitish gave this order after reviewing the Covid-19 scenario in the state. After the CM’s order, the state government officials decided to send an aircraft to Ahmedabad to bring the Remdesivir injection. Hailing the CM’s decision, BJP’s Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi said there would be no dearth of Remdesivir in Bihar due to “promptness” of the Centre and the state government. He also said the Union government has increased Bihar’s quota of Remdesivir injection to 40,000 vials from the existing 24,000 vials by April 30.

He asked them to make arrangements of more beds and oxygen availability in hospitals. Dr Ajay said Deepak called him back within minutes and discussed the current situation and sought opinion as how the government could further strengthen the healthcare to help all. Since IMA members from all the 38 districts have been regularly exchanging information on the Covid situation and challenges coming in the way of treatment, they are now of firm opinion that 80% beds in all government hospitals would help create over 5,000 more beds for Covid patients. “History will not excuse both the government and doctors if we failed in providing beds and treatment facilities to one and all in the state,” said Dr Ajay. Information reaching from other districts also confirmed that the second wave of the pandemic has now begun affecting rural people as well and they may turn up to the nearest towns, and even Patna, for treatment under specialist doctors, he said. Most of the city doctors have been busy sharing medical suggestions for those in home isolation after being tested positive. However, in some cases with complications and low oxygen saturation, hospitalisation is the only way to help patients recover, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/reserve-80-of-beds-in-govt-hospitals-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82246513.cms||VK Tripathi

However, the girl was soon dumped after two villagers spotted her being dragged out of the SUV in an unconscious state by the youths near Panjwara Chowk under the same police station area. Banka Sadar SDPO Dinesh Chandra Srivastava said, on getting information about the incident from some villagers, the girl was taken to a hospital by police in an unconscious state. “The matter came to light before police around 12.30am on Sunday. After this, police contacted the girl’s family,” the SDPO said. Srivastava said the girl lives with her family members near Mela ground under the Bounsi police station area in Banka and had gone out to purchase some household items on Saturday night. “Four youths in an SUV dragged her forcibly inside and also drugged her. Prima facie the youths had an intention to gang rape her. However, as they were dragging the girl towards a secluded place, two villagers returning home spotted them and raised an alarm. As soon as the two villagers raised alarm, all the four youths dumped the girl on the spot and fled with the SUV. The girl, after regaining her senses told police that she had identified two of the youths,” the police officer added. “The two identified accused are Laddu Bhagat of Bikram village and Sonu Thakur of Panjwara village, both falling under the Panjwara police station area of Banka district,” he said adding an FIR has been lodged against them with the Panjwara police station in connection with the incident.

According to Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar, railways has started steam-cleaning of passenger train rakes to maintain proper hygienic level inside the coaches. The mechanized cleaning staff at each coach maintenance cum washing pit in the division are taking full precautionary measures during the process. Railways is taking all precautions to clean airconditioned (AC) and sleeper coaches as well as lavatories properly with new cleaning gadgets. “This has become a must at a time when deadly virus is infecting people, including frontline railway staff of the division. Besides, several passengers travelling from Maharashtra and New Delhi have tested positive for Covid-19 on their arrival at Patna Junction and Danapur,” the DRM said. According to the DRM, at least 24 pairs of special passenger trains have been running from different places of the division to facilitate people to undertake journey to places like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Secunderabad, Pune, Chennai, Howrah, Ahmedabad, Indore and other places, he said. In addition to coaches, railways is also cleaning and sanitizing platforms, booking counters, waiting halls, foot overbridges, circulating areas, main concourse of station buildings at Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Patliputra Junction, Danapur and other stations of the division, the DRM said. He said railways has already removed curtains from the AC coaches as a precautionary step. No linen is being supplied to passengers in the trains originating from the division as per Covid-19 health protocol issued by ministry of home affairs and the Railway Board to check the spread of the deadly virus, he said, adding railways has issued an advisory to AC staff to maintain airconditioned coach temperature between 24 and 25 Celsius during journey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rlys-launches-steam-cleaning-of-train-rakes-at-patna-depots/articleshow/82246358.cms||Kumod Verma

Despite the pandemic, the ‘villa culture’ is picking up. At least 10 to 15 villa ventures are expected to come up in the city soon. Credai-AP president B Raja Srinivas said that the demand for villas has gone up among the rich since Visakhapatnam was touted to become the executive capital of Andhra Pradesh. “Location is buyers’ top priority,” says Srinivas adding “people look for gated communities with playgrounds, parks and other amenities”. The first villas came up in Vizag back in 2000 when row houses were constructed near Madhurawada. Later, villas were built in Gajuwaka, PM Palem, Madhurawada, Kapuluppada and Bheemili, where land prices were relatively low. Finding enough land for villas remains a challenge, says Srinivas. “Some villa ventures are coming up on the northern outskirts of the city, we expect the villa culture to spread,” he said. For buyers, the quality of construction and the promoters’ reputation are also important considerations, according to Rinku, a businessman from Odisha who is looking to purchase a villa in the city. “We have zeroed in on a couple of ventures and may take a decision soon,” Rinku said. People who were initially looking to buy house sites are now considering villas, say realtors. The base price of a villa is around Rs 2.5 crore. A 200–300 square yard villa in Madhurawada costs between Rs 3–10 crore depending on facilities. Only 6–8% of city residents can afford to buy villas or ‘super-luxury’ flats, according to Credai members. The demand for villas is from NRIs and people from other districts or states. While there is yet to be a ‘villa boom’ in Vizag like in Hyderabad, demand for villas is certainly rising in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/villa-ventures-emerge-as-vizags-new-realty-trend/articleshow/82246563.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Business||Protect funds, even if returns are low||MUMBAI: The surge in Covid infections is forcing investors to look at preserving their capital by moving a higher percentage of their portfolio into liquid funds, other fixed income instruments and gold, and less into equities. Basically, they are aiming for assets that could be liquidated at a short notice to get money. The renewed uncertainties are also forcing investors to build a large emergency corpus and buy bigger medical insurance covers. Financial advisers and industry experts say, given the current crisis, investors should look at preserving capital even if that means earning lower returns, rather than make some dangerous moves and invest heavily in risky assets like stocks. According to city-based mutual fund distributor Mukund Seshadri, first, investors need to have a large emergency corpus. And they should also have adequate mediclaim cover. Uncertainties about jobs and sudden need for medical expenses have taught people to make these two things their priorities, Seshadri said. Once these are in place, the other things that investors should have are according to the basics of financial planning. Whenever they want to invest, they should have a purpose behind that investment with a fixed milestone and a time horizon. And, to build wealth over the long run, every investor should be able to distinguish between their needs and wants, with needs always getting the top priority, Seshadri said. ithought Financial Consulting’s founder Shyam Sekar advises investors to move their money into most liquid assets like fixed-income products and gold. Given the current uncertain environment, “it’s important to keep away from risky assets and important to preserve capital even if that means getting lower returns”, he said. Sekar is advising his clients to invest in gold through the digital mode, that is, through gold ETFs, e-gold, etc, but not in gold jewellery. For investing in fixed-income assets, he advises investors to put money in floating rate bonds and debt funds. Equity investments should be limited to about 25% of the portfolio. “Here, the focus should be to invest in stocks under three themes — reforms, defensives and commodities,” he said. Investments in the first theme should be through PSU ETFs or dedicated funds. Among the defensive sectors — which include pharma, IT exporters and FMCG companies — tech stocks should be preferred among the three. And to invest in the commodities sector, one should invest through the funds dedicated to this sector, Sekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/protect-funds-even-if-returns-are-low/articleshow/82248376.cms||---

The police nabbed Sonu Kumar Gupta (35) from Barharwa Ghat near NIT under Pirbahore police station area in the state capital. The killing took place around 1pm and Gupta was held around 11pm while he was trying to escape to the riverine belt after crossing the Ganga on a boat. Sinha, a resident of Mainpura in Danapur, along with his staff Sunny Kumar (25), was sitting inside his shop, Rajnish Medisurge, when Gupta came and fired several rounds from a countrymade semi-automatic pistol. Gupta owns Maa Durga Surgical Store beside Sinha’s shop. Pirbahore police station SHO Rizwan Ahmed Khan on Sunday said Gupta had plans to meet his wife on Govind Mitra Road before finally fleeing to the riverine area. “Police also got an input about his movements and locations after which he was nabbed from the ghat around 11pm,” he said. Khan said a countrymade pistol loaded with two live cartridges was also recovered from his possession. “It is the same pistol used in the crime. His staff Sunny is still in a critical condition and undergoing treatment at PMCH,” he said. SHO Khan said one pellet was recovered from Sinha’s body during postmortem besides two empty cartridges were found on the spot. “The pistol, empty cartridges and pellet would be sent for ballistic matching after seeking court order. It would be a strong exhibit for nailing Gupta during the trial in Sinha’s murder case,” the SHO said. Khan said Gupta has given a confessional statement that he shot Sinha dead after a fight over parking a vehicle in front of the slain person’s shop. “However, police are also investigating the other angles, including dispute over oxygen cylinder sales amid the pandemic,” the SHO said. He said Sinha’s elder brother Prakash Kumar Sinha had lodged an FIR against Gupta. “Gupta is a very short-tempered person. He had earlier broken the arm of another shopkeeper after picking up a fight with him. He is accused in two criminal cases and police have filed chargesheet against him in both the cases,” Khan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/surgical-store-owners-murder-accused-held/articleshow/82246314.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The condition of at least eight of them is critical. One of the judicial officers, Manish Kumar, passed away during treatment at a private hospital in Patna on April 20. As per information, at least 13 judicial officers of different ranks posted in Patna judgeship, including the district judge, and seven in Muzaffarpur district have been tested Covid-19 positive till now. Besides, judicial officers in Purnia, Darbhanga, Siwan, Sasaram, Aurangabad, Gaya and several other districts have been also tested Covid-19 positive in the second wave. When contacted, Bihar Judicial Services Association secretary Ajit Kumar Singh confirmed that more than 100 judicial officers have been found infected across Bihar. “Reports of officers testing positive have been received from almost every district,” he said. “These officers are compelled to get admitted to private hospitals at smaller places in emergency because of non-availability of beds at AIIMS-Patna,” he said. “I request the health department principal secretary and AIIMS-Patna director to make arrangements for those judicial officers of state who are in serious condition,” he added. Besides these judicial officers, a large number of subordinate court staff have been infected. The district bar associations of Muzaffarpur and Chhapra have already passed a resolution to abstain from any court hearing till April 30. In the Patna high court, at least 222 of its administrative staff were tested positive till April 23, as per the information available on its website. Two of its employees have already died. While assistant registrar Gagan Mishra died during treatment on April 17, a deputy registrar, Nasimul Hoda, died in his official quarter at Adalatganj in Patna on April 20. The high court virtually remained non-functional from April 19 as no employee was coming to the court premises. However, a fresh notice has been issued that staff in skeletal strength would reach the high court for extremely limited virtual functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/over-100-judicial-officers-in-state-undergoing-treatment-for-covid/articleshow/82246474.cms||Debashish Karmakar

All doctors and nurses associated with the OP wing have been shifted to Covid-19 wards. GGH superintendent Dr Neelam Prabhavati said the decision was taken to expand Covid-19 services in the hospital. All planned surgeries have already been put off due to the prevailing situation.

From using their social influence to crowdfund essentials, to amplifying call for donations, to throwing open innovation challenges to scale oxygen availability — they are doing it all. Silicon Valley-based Indian investor Vinod Khosla to tweeted on Sunday, offering to fund hospitals at this time of crisis. “I’m willing to fund hospitals in India that need funding to import bulk planeloads of oxygen or supplies into India to increase supply. Public hospitals/NGOs also pls reach out.” He tagged the PMO and health ministry. In a separate tweet, Khosla also called upon US president Biden to release the AstraZeneca vaccines stocked in the US for use in India. Food delivery major Zomato said its not-for-profit arm Feeding India is joining hands with logistics unicorn Delhivery to set in motion the ‘Help Save My India’ plan. The company is raising funds to procure and distribute oxygen concentrators to hospitals and patients. “We have already kickstarted the effort, and now need your help to raise Rs 50 crore for Feeding India in the next few days (hours?) to save hundreds of thousands of lives. If we raise more, we will get more oxygen,” Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal said on Twitter. Paytm’s Paytm Foundation is also focusing on oxygen shortage and raising Rs 2 crore on its app to donate oxygen concentrators, and is matching contributions received from users. “We have sourced supplies for oxygen concentrators of different sizes while we place the order using our own money…,” Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma tweeted. Kunal Shah, founder of recently minted unicorn Cred, tweeted, believes that the real challenge lies in availability of cryogenic containers to get oxygen to hospitals. He took to Twitter on Sunday looking for leads. “We are looking to fund innovative ideas to solve 1) building self-sufficient oxygen plants within hospitals 2) finding creative ways to convert other containers to move oxygen,” Shah posted on Twitter. ACT Grants, the brainchild of around 40 marquee investors like Accel, Kalaari Capital, Lightspeed and others, is raising over Rs 75 crore for home health management, oxygen solutions and other tools to support the country’s healthcare sector. Sequoia India’s Tejeshwi Sharma made a call on Twitter on Saturday for contributions from the ecosystem. “We have already raised Rs 50 crore to commit to oxygen solutions, vaccinations and home healthcare,” he said after a day. Amazon India on Sunday said it has joined hands with ACT Grants, Temasek Foundation, Pune Platform for Covid -19 Response (PPCR) and other partners to urgently airlift over 8,000 oxygen concentrators and 500 BiPAP machines from Singapore. Payments platform Razorpay is making it easier for NGOs and others to transact for relief work on their platform, while bike rental startup Bounce has enabled donations on its app. The cryptocurrency community too is raising capital for the cause. Responding to a crowdfunding drive launched on Twitter by entrepreneur Sandeep Nailwal, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of cryptocurrency Ethereum, donated around $600,000 (about Rs 4.5 crore) for India’s Covid relief. Indian American investor and entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan also donated $50,000 worth in cryptocurrency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/startups-tech-giants-pitch-in-to-help-india/articleshow/82247879.cms||Mamtha Asokan

The company will allot Rs 250-Rs 300 crore in capital to this entity and measure the return on capital. To be called Digital Finco, this SBU will focus on small ticket loans particularly in the two wheeler space. Currently Mahindra Finance does not have a presence in two wheeler financing. Digital Finco will also enter personal and consumer durables financing segments both in urban and rural markets. “Digital Finco will use Mahindra Finance knowledge of these markets and convert it into a digital solution,” said Iyer. “We are looking at a loan book of around Rs 5,000-Rs 7,000 crore in the first year and want to scale it up to Rs 25,000 crore by 2023,” he added. Mahindra Finance is also readying its rural housing finance subsidiary — Mahindra Rural Housing Finance — for an IPO in 2-3 years. “Currently the book size of this entity is around Rs 8,000 crore and we will build it to Rs 50,000 crore before the listing,” he said. The company is also exploring possibilities regarding a banking licence. “We are looking at that option closely because it is interesting and we are considering governance and other parameters about the bank vs NBFC debate. It will be considered once these parameters are looked into,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mahindra-finance-plans-to-separate-fintech-biz-mulls-banking-licence/articleshow/82247816.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta
---||Business||HSBC remains bullish on India, to grow local business||MUMBAI: HSBC has retained its growth forecasts for India despite the second wave of Covid and has said that it intends to grow its business in the country. The bank, which has around 39,000 employees here, gets a big chunk of revenue from the country and sees it as the third-largest economy by 2030. Speaking to TOI, HSBC India CEO Surendra Rosha said, “We do not see short-term challenges with regard to things related to Covid dislocating our strategy.” Even as multinational rivals like Citi have announced their exit from the consumer business in India amid the pandemic, HSBC has said that it is going the other way. While the bank did rationalise its branch operations in India a few years earlier, which gave an impression of shrinking, the customer base in India has grown. This is because of the shift to digital channels. “A positive development is that adoption of digital has increased and the payoff for investment in digital is much better than it was a few years ago,” Rosha added. Rosha pointed out that HSBC’s number of customers has increased 37% since December 2017 to 10.5 lakh in December 2020. The bank’s pre-tax profits from India have been over $1 billion for 2019 and 2020. He added that India was among the top three markets for HSBC in 2020 and has always been part of the top five. HSBC has the advantage of having a strong presence in countries where the Indian diaspora is predominant. This includes the UK, Middle East, Southeast Asia, Australia, Canada and the US. As a result, it has been able to target persons of Indian origin as well as Indians looking to invest in these markets or move there for studies. While the overall economy has shrunk due to Covid, for a multinational bank like HSBC the opportunities have increased in the last 18 months. This is because of some government measures, which include a reduction in the corporate tax rate, production-linked incentives and the disinvestment plan. All of these provide an opportunity to facilitate inward investment. “Covid is a damper, but India is not an unknown quantity to global corporations. It is about telling them the opportunity in the next few years. So, Covid is not going to be a showstopper for foreign investment,” said Rosha. Despite the second wave, HSBC research has retained its growth forecast of 11.2% for FY22. “We feel that if there is an impact in the first half of the fiscal, it will be made up in the second half. While the situation is evolving, what we have seen is that with the decline in cases there was a strong pick-up in economic activity,” said Rosha. “So, while we feel that growth will be similar to what the projections are, there will be some adjustment between the first half and the second half,” he added. As part of its strategy of targeting Indians with an international connection, HSBC has a 24X7 international service centre to cater to overseas Indians. It provides borderless banking services through its global network that allow customers to have a consolidated view of accounts across countries and lets them move money across markets. Students going abroad can also open an account from India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hsbc-remains-bullish-on-india-to-grow-local-biz/articleshow/82248392.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Kolkata||Govt asks pvt hosps for 1,387 Cov beds as crisis continues||Kolkata: As the struggle to get a Covid bed in Kolkata and its suburbs got tougher, the Bengal government on Saturday stepped in to acquire 1,387 beds in private hospitals, including 917 general Covid beds and 460 for critical patients. The state will acquire 260 of these beds in Kolkata with eight private hospitals helping out. The state will also acquire 258 beds in Howrah and 311 in North 24 Parganas, which is likely to reduce referral cases from these high-prevalence zones to Kolkata. Kolkata on Sunday had 19,873 active Covid cases. The active Covid cases in Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas and Howrah account for 56% of the 81,375 active cases reported state-wide on Saturday. The trauma continues for many. Family members of a 37-year-old Covid patient in Behala had to hire an ICU ambulance for six hours last Tuesday and keep it parked outside their home, just so the youth — whose oxygen saturation level had dropped below 75% — on oxygen support while his family and friends searched for a bed in hospitals. He was eventually admitted to MR Bangur Hospital with help from an acquaintance, a doctor, and his condition remains critical. “We had called over two dozen private hospitals and nursing homes for a bed, but in vain. Repeated calls to Swasthya Bhavan helpline numbers, too, didn’t yield any result. As his condition deteriorated, we hired an ICU ambulance and kept him on oxygen support in it. We later took him to MR Bangur Hospital in that ambulance,” said the patient’s friend, a Tollywood actor. The situation was similar for family members of a 70-year-old from Metiabruz who died in an ambulance outside Medical College and Hospital last Tuesday after they failed to manage a bed at any of the government hospitals and nursing homes they visited in eight hours. “I saw my father dying before my eyes, but couldn’t do anything,” said his son. Even well-connected people are finding it difficult to get a bed in Kolkata. “I got a call from a friend whose family, despite being well-connected, was finding it difficult to get a bed for their 31-year-old younger daughter who had Covid. I tried a number of places before finally managing to get a bed at a small nursing home in Baruipur. But by the time I called them, the family said the girl had expired,” said a senior official of an MNC. The state health department and the state health commission on Saturday announced a slew of measures to not just increase the Covid-bed count in hospitals, but also free up beds that are currently occupied by announcing more stringent parameters to ensure optimal use of hospital beds in short supply due to the heavy rush of patients. While the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission has asked all hospitals to hike the Covid bed count to 60% of licenced beds, the state health department has asked the government to prioritize admission of patients requiring oxygen support. “It is our endeavour to join hands with the state and the health department to cater to the ever-increasing demand for beds by patients suffering from Covid-19. We will honour the requisition of beds at our facilities in RN Tagore hospital and Narayana Multispeciality Hospital, Howrah, as a part of achieving the objective,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (east), Narayana health. “We will abide by the state directive to requisition 30 beds in our hospital. We should be able to hand over some beds in the next couple of days,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO, Peerless Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-asks-pvt-hosps-for-1387-cov-beds-as-crisis-continues/articleshow/82247079.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Vax price gap may affect its roll-out in Bengal||Kolkata: Ahead of the May 1 proposed nation-wide vaccine roll-out, policy makers and senior state officials have pointed out several gaps in the differential pricing, which may impact the roll-out of the process. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has already flagged her concerns on differential pricing for Centre and states. According to the now-decade-old 2011 Census, the 18-plus age group comprises around 6.1 crore of the state’s 9.1 crore population. Of them, over a crore stays in Kolkata and North 24 Parganas — the two most Covid high-prevalence zones in Bengal due to population density and mobility. Bengal, till Saturday morning, vaccinated 98 lakh people in the 45-plus age group. The Centre will keep vaccinating the priority 45-plus age group, as well as healthcare and frontline workers. Officials claimed the state and private hospitals will have to bear the bulk of vaccinating the 18-45 age group. In Bengal, the 18-45 age group is around four crores according to the 2011 Census. As of now, the CM has declared that a Rs 100 crore fund is being set aside to buy vaccines. At Rs 400, this will allowthe purchase of 25 lakh Covishield vaccines, which can fully inoculate 12.5 lakh people. At Rs 150, it could have been over 66 lakh vaccines. For Covaxin, the rates for the states will be higher, at Rs 600; for private hospitals it will be Rs 1,200 — double that of Serum Institute of India (SII) rates. The Centre buys Covaxin at Rs 150 now. There are two parts to the differential pricing argument. The first is the rationality of such pricing and the second where debt-ridden states like Bengal have the resources to buy vaccines. “The policy is arbitrary and discriminatory. There exists no rational basis for the Centre to pay a rate lower than the states and private hospitals, especially when the finances of the Central government are far healthier than the states’. It appears that the Centre has tried to shift its burden to the state, despite being aware the state cannot afford the cost of buying such vaccines at large numbers,” said advocate Sanjay Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-price-gap-may-affect-its-roll-out-in-bengal/articleshow/82247064.cms||---

NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh sent urgent messages to the health department officials and the DM seeking immediate supply of oxygen cylinders for saving life of Covid patients admitted there. Dr Binod said the oxygen pressure went declining from 3.55 to 4.40 pm indicating shut down. While doctors and staff were on their best to save life of patients, attendants of patients lost their cool and became aggressive. “Beside informing the principal secretary of health department Pratyaya Amrit, I also called the DM and sought immediate help in restoring the oxygen supply to Covid wards,” he said. It was around 4.40pm that 50 oxygen cylinders reached the hospital where 404 patients are undergoing treatment. On Saturday, 856 oxygen cylinders were used for 364 patients while their number increased by 38 today, apparently needing more oxygen.

From May 1, Covid-19 vaccinations will begin for all above 18 years of age. Once vaccinated, people may have to wait for a few weeks or a couple of months before they can donate blood in accordance with existing rules and the type of vaccine administered. Every summer, there is at least 50% scarcity of blood due to fewer camps. But the pandemic has made matters worse with blood banks looking at 80–90% shortage. Dr A Sugandhi, medical director of AS Raja Voluntary Blood Bank, said, “This year we are going to have a scarcity of blood due to fewer donation camps, the raging pandemic and the vaccination drive for people between 18 and 45 years of age. Most donors are from this age bracket.” “The worst sufferers will be children and patients suffering from thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia. Many accident victims and pregnant women also need blood. We appeal to the public to donate blood as a moral duty before getting vaccinated,” added Dr Sugandhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/donate-blood-before-getting-jab-request-blood-banks/articleshow/82246541.cms||Sulogna Mehta

Patients and their relatives are haplessly waiting for hours on end in hospital premises and even in ambulances on oxygen support to get admitted. For example, the CSR Block in King George Hospital in Visakhapatnam and the Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS), Government General Hospital Vijayawada, etc. are almost packed to their capacity. In terms of absolute numbers, only one oxygen bed was vacant at VIMS in Visakhapatnam at 4 pm on Sunday out of the 300 ICU and oxygen beds. Scenes at GGH Vijayawada are similar, with only one ICU bed available. Top-rung private hospitals are also packed with Covid-19 patients. Oxygen shortage has been reported at several hospitals. When state irrigation minister P Anil Kumar Yadav inspected the Covid care centre at the government general hospital in Nellore on Sunday, he found several shortcomings in services. At the peak of the first wave of Covid-19 last year, about 260 hospitals with a combined capacity of some 35,000 beds had served the patients. As the daily case numbers dropped to triple-digits and consequently double-digits, the health department denotified nearly 220 hospitals between October last year and February 2021. But now with the exponential growth in the case numbers, the health department has lined up nearly 300 hospitals, while 270 were already serving as of Sunday with a bed capacity of 27,000. As per the official data, only about 45% of the total beds have been occupied by the patients. But patients and their relatives alleged that the ground-level situation is very different. Speaking to TOI, AP Covid-19 nodal officer Dr K Rambabu said that the health department is increasing the number of hospitals based on the case numbers. “About 300 hospitals have been identified for Covid-19 services. And if need be, the number would be increased in the coming days,” said Dr Rambabu. Meanwhile, the state health department has also revived the concept of Covid care centres to treat the mild cases who cannot avail home isolation. There are about 26,000 beds at the 43 CCCs spread across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-lines-up-300-hospitals-to-handle-covid-patient-influx/articleshow/82246334.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The decision to this effect was taken after the visit of local MP and Union minister of state (IC) for power and new & renewable energy R K Singh on Saturday to the Sadar hospital and the sub-divisional hospital, Jagdishpur. He was accompanied by Bhojpur DM Roshan Kushwaha and SP Rakesh Kumar Dubey. Bhojpur DPRO in-charge Rashmi Choudhary informed the media persons that the minister asked the Bhojpur SP to ensure 24 hours police deployment in the emergency ward. He also asked him to take very strict action against those who assault the doctors or the paramedical staff. The district administration assured the minister that strict action will be taken against the troublemakers. Later, in a meeting with the private hospital owners who are also providing Covid treatment, the Bhojpur DM assured them to provide security to the doctors and the paramedical staff in the wake of increasing incidents of assault on them by the attendants of the patients, the DPRO said. The Union minister’s direction to the Bhojpur SP was necessitated in the wake of a ruckus and assault on the sadar hospital manager, doctors and paramedical staff after the death of a woman patient named Aarti Devi (36). The on-duty doctor, Dr. Vivekanand, told the media persons about his nightmarish experience. “The attendants were openly asking to bring the doctor for beating him. I had to run outside and hide behind a temple to save myself from their fury. How can we perform our duty fearlessly unless we get security,” he said. Taking cognisance of the fact that there is dearth of sufficient doctors, minister Singh asked the Sadar hospital and the sub- divisional hospital Jagdishpur administration to prepare a duty roster of doctors and the paramedical staff in the emergency ward and the Covid ward. He also gave the direction to keep an extra doctor in reserve for every shift in order to take his services in case of an emergency. Meanwhile, the Bhojpur DM has asked the officials concerned to assess the requirement of oxygen and coordinate with the Patna and Aurangabad district administration for its supply. The DM has appealed to the people to cooperate with the doctors and the paramedical staff, who are providing their services in these critical times of the Covid-19 pandemic. He also asked the people to follow the Covid appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhojpur-sp-told-to-provide-24x7-security-to-doctors-paramedics/articleshow/82246496.cms||---

Ravi Kishan told TOI, “I have written to PM Modi and the health and family welfare minister, and I am providing Rs 40 lakh from MPLAD fund to the PM Relief Fund for the setting up of an oxygen plant in Gorakhpur at the earliest so that critical Covid patients can be saved,” “For setting up the plant, I have asked the DM to identify an appropriate location,” he added. “The second wave of the pandemic is very dangerous, and it is a matter of deep concern that there is shortage of oxygen in many hospitals across the country. In view of such a crisis, I have decided to strengthen the infrastructure of Gorakhpur so that the district becomes well-equipped to fight these challenges. Gorakhpur is the largest city of eastern Uttar Pradesh, and lakhs of people depend on Gorakhpur for their medical needs. This is why setting up an oxygen plant could save many lives,” said the MP. Ravi Kishan also gave assurance that the government is making sincere efforts in all possible ways to combat Covid-19 and save people from this deadly disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/mp-ravi-kishan-asks-dm-to-identify-location-for-setting-up-oxygen-plant-decides-to-give-rs-40-lakh/articleshow/82248400.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

So far, the certificates received by the students received honours degree which posed hurdles when applying for entrance tests or postgraduation professional courses as this degree was not considered nationwide. With the renaming of degree students will be able to apply for various professional courses.These courses will now be treated at par with BSc agriculture and bachelor’s in technology (agricultural engineering). The move was announced in a government notification issued by the state department of agriculture, animal husbandry, dairy development and fisheries on April 22 following the decision by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) that announced these degrees as professional courses. Deputy secretary of the department, Balasaheb Raskar, said, “Since the students passing out of these courses did not have the nationally-recognised graduate degree, they were at a disadvantag with respect to participating in competitive examinations and also entrance tests conducted by ICAR. This resolution was passed in the 104th agricultural conference held in February this year.” Ashwini Giri, who is pursuing her course in horticulture, said that, the honours degree was not considered while filling up forms for entrance exam as a criteria. "This was a long pending demand and many of our previous batches have in fact missed out on national opportunities. This will boost the admissions to these courses and the concentration towards the main agriculture degree will get diverted now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bsc-degree-for-3-year-agri-courses/articleshow/82247049.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

On Saturday, Nabanna issued a notification saying, “Wearing facial mask has been made mandatory in public places in the current pandemic situation.” The government has also ordered all persons to “maintain social distancing whenever they go out in public”. “The notification on masks and following Covid protocol had to be re-issued to alert district and police administration so that they can intensify action against those flouting the rules,” said an official in the state home department. The order has asked officers at the rank of sub-inspectors to ensure use of masks. Anyone flouting the rule will be prosecuted under Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. Over the past week, Kolkata Police has stepped up its drive against those not wearing masks.

At times, infection is being detected in the lungs even after negative RT-PCR report of Covid test. Accordingly, medical imaging and diagnostics centres in the city are witnessing a heavy rush of people going for HRCT (high-resolution computerised tomography) scan of the chest, which not only detects the virus but also shows the severity of infection. Sanat Banerjee, manager of a city-based HRCT scan centre, told this newspaper that they are were witnessing a large number of patients, who tested negative in RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests but had Covid-19 infection in the lungs. “People with symptoms of Covid must get both the RT-PCR and HRCT scan done for confirmation of the infection,” he said. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid at AIIMS-Patna, said RT-PCR can detect presence of the virus but not its severity. “Also, RT-PCR test is at times not able to identify new strains of the virus. Thus, HRCT scan is required when the person has all major symptoms of Covid, such as cough, fever and lung congestion. HRCT scan shows the condition of the infection,” he said and added: “HRCT is suggested to a a person having chest congestion with early symptoms of Covid such as cough and fever. One should consult the doctors if HRCT scan shows severity score above 15.” Dr Sanjay Kumar, a city-based pulmonologist and diabetologist, said, “There are some pateints whose Covid RT-PCR report is negative but HRCT scan shows chest infection. There may be some chances of Covid infection. It depends on Corad scoring system. If the Corad score is 5 or above, it confirms Covid infection in the lungs. RT-PCR is a diagnostic test, which can be wrong at times. But, HRCT scan detects the specificity and severity of the virus as well.” Few Covid patients also claimed that infection in the lungs was detected in HRCT scan, though the Covid test report was negative. “Even after testing negative in RT-PCR test, I had all the Covid symptoms. My family doctor suggested me to go for HRCT scan, which eventually detected the virus. Fortunately, the infection was mild to moderate, so I didn’t need hospitalization. Few medicines, injections and steam cured the condition,” said Ishita Amar (32), a housemaker from Mithapur area. Shrishti Singh (21), an undergraduate student from Boring Road, who recently recovered from Covid, said: “As my doctor suggested, I went for both the RT-PCR and HRCT scan and some blood tests as well. I was tested positive for Covid along with mild lung infection. As I already had respiratory problems, I was hospitalized and remained under observation for five days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-19-test-report-ve-but-hrct-scan-detects-lung-infection-in-some-patients/articleshow/82246434.cms||---

Sitamarhi SDPO Ramakant Upadhyaya said Kumar had just reached near his kiln located on the outskirts of the village when the criminals on two separate bikes intercepted him. He said Kumar’s house is also located in the same village and is hardly a couple of kilometres away from the kiln. “Kumar was on a bike while his younger brother Shambhu Kumar was riding pillion. The criminals also snatched the bag containing Rs3 lakh from Kumar’s hand,” he said. One of the criminals opened fire and the bullet pierced through Kumar’s chest, killing him on the spot. “Prima facie it seems that the criminals had intercepted Kumar with the motive to kill him. The loot was to misguide the police,” he said. Upadhyaya said police have come to know that Kumar had a land dispute with a villager. “Police strongly suspect that he was killed over the land dispute. Cash was snatched to give it a colour of loot. Five suspects have also been detained by the police,” he said. He said police were trying to identify the criminals with the help of Kumar’s younger brother who had seen them. He said further investigation was and Kumar’s body had been sent to Sadar hospital for postmortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/brick-kiln-owner-shot-rs3l-looted-in-sitamarhi/articleshow/82246525.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The case was lodged against Mukhtar on Saturday, 18 days after he was brought from Ropar jail in Punjab to UP and lodged in Banda jail. ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan said, “The siphoning off of Rs 25 lakh from MLALAD funds was detected recently. Between 2006-07 and 2017-18, Mukhtar ensured release of Rs 25 lakh to Anand Yadav and Baijnath Yadav of Sakin Sarva village to construct a school on gram sabha land that was illegally transferred in Baijnath’s name. However, not a single brick was found on the site. Local police lodged an FIR against Mukhtar Ansari, Baijnath Yadav, Anand Yadav and one Sanjay Sagar under Sections 419, 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forging documents), 468 (forgery for cheating), 471 and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC on Saturday.” Mau police had started investigation on getting inputs about the fraud for siphoning off money from MLA fund for opening a school, said officials. During probe, it came to light that gram sabha land had been transferred fraudulently in the name of Baijnath’s wife for opening a school, Guru Jagdish Singh Baijnath Pahalwan Uchchatar Madhyamik Vidyalay. Baijnath was instrumental in ensuring transfer of the land in the name of his wife with the help of his son Anand and a local Sanjay, they added. There is not even a sign of any construction activity at the school site but Rs 25 lakh were released from Mukhtar’s MLALAD fund from 2006-07 to 2017-18, the ADG said. “The probe was completed and all facts were verified and then an FIR was registered at the Sarai Lakhansi police station on Saturday,” he added. Mukhtar and his gang have been facing action from police and local administration in Mau, Ghazipur, Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Varanasi and other districts since May 2020, resulting in loss of over Rs 258 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/mukhtar-booked-for-siphoningoff-rs-25l-from-mlalad-fund/articleshow/82248398.cms||---

The move came on the last day to file such an appeal. A review plea can be filed within 30 days of a verdict, and the SC ruling in this SP-Tata Sons case was pronounced on March 26. The petition challenges certain alleged errors in the judgment, which had set aside the order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) that had reinstated SP scion Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons. SP holds 18.4% in Tata Sons, the holding company of the $100-billion Tata conglomerate, and Mistry was removed from the chairman’s post in October 2016 in a boardroom coup. The petition is not a review of the entire judgment but some aspects of fact and law that are patent errors, said people familiar with the matter. The SC judgment had also diluted certain provisions of the Companies Act, specifically section 166 which requires all directors to exercise independent judgment and discharge fiduciary duties in the interest of the company and not only in the interest of their nominators, the people said. Tata Sons is controlled by Tata Trusts and the public charitable organisation nominates a third of the directors on the board of the company. The nominee directors enjoy affirmative voting rights on certain matters specified in the Articles of Association (AoA) of Tata Sons, including any matter affecting the shareholding of the Trusts. The SC had observed that Trusts nominee directors are “not like any other directors who get appointed in a general meeting of the company” and that they “hold a fiduciary relationship with the Trusts and fiduciary duty towards the nameless, faceless beneficiaries of those Trusts”. This SC observation, said corporate lawyers, suggested that the role and duties of directors of a charitable trust are different from those of other non-charitable trust members. SP had contended that such affirmative voting rights enjoyed by Tata Trusts nominee directors breached the duties of directors under companies Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sp-files-for-review-of-sc-judgment-in-tata-case/articleshow/82248399.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Patna||Pandemic has affected children, emotionally||PATNA: Even as the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has affected most people emotionally, it has hit the children the most. With most people imposing a self-lockdown to ensure safety of their family members, children are forced to stay at home and deprived of their normal activities. Online classes, isolation from their friends and neighbours, lack of physical sports and games and staying away from parks and recreation centres have developed depression and boredom among the children. The pandemic has changed the way children are supposed to grow, learn, play and interact. Consequently, parents are facing the dual task of managing their children at home and also coping with their Covid-19 stress. ”Children usually thrive under predictable conditions. Disruption led by the pandemic has greatly impacted them physically and emotionally. The biggest worry for children confined to their homes these days is whether or not they will see their friends in school or will they get sick,” Patna University Central Dispensary’s former chief medical officer and yoga expert Dr Prabhakar Devraj said. Devraj points out that parents would have to pay more attention to their wards now. Leaving aside their own interest, they would have to spend more time with their children, involving them in creative activities like painting, singing or playing some indoor games. Children must not be allowed to spend more time on mobile phones or TV screens to keep themselves away from negativity, he adds. Indian Medical Association’s former state president Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad asserts children always treat their parents as their role models and rely on their protection. Hence, parents should always present a brave front even if they are worried. Parents should try their level best to keep their wards happy by engaging them in creative activities. They should also try to answer their children’s queries arising due to some confusion in the topics taught by their schoolteachers online. In most cases, children fail to comprehend a subject very clearly through virtual classes, he says. Patna College psychology department’s senior teacher Sheo Sagar Prasad observed that the anxiety of children can be tackled by parents to some extent by addressing their fears, talking about problems and possible solutions from the child’s perspectives. Besides, parents can maintain a routine even if confined at home. They can plan activities with kids and involve them in various home activities and educate them about hygiene habits and social distancing. Retired civil surgeon Kumkum Prasad said parents should pay more attention to the emotional well-being of the child. They should keep emphasizing Covid protective measures like wearing a mask, social distancing and frequent handwash. Also, children should be encouraged to socialise with their friends and classmates through digital forums under parents’ supervision. Moreover, parents should respond to child’s reactions in a supportive way, listen to their concerns and give them extra love and attention, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pandemic-has-affected-children-emotionally/articleshow/82246483.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Bihar: Quarantine centres in dists still await returnee workers||PATNA: The district authorities have swung into action to set up quarantine centres at sub-divisional headquarters to accommodate migrant workers returning home in the wake of an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases. “We have already set up quarantine centres at all the four sub-divisional headquarters at Gaya sadar, Tekari, Nimchak Bathani and Sherghati in the district,” Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said on Sunday. Singh clarified that no migrant worker has turned up at any of the four quarantine centres so far. “But we hope the workers will stay there once the number of returnees increased in the days to come,” he said over the phone. Gaya district shares its border with Jharkhand. On an average, 200-250 migrant workers alighted from different trains at Gaya Junction every day. “Most of the workers who tested positive prefer to remain in home isolation,” Singh revealed. Unlike previous year, no complaints related to returning migrant workers not being allowed to enter their home either by their family members or restricted by the residents have been received from any part of the state till date. The authorities are of the view that the migrant workers will start living in these centres after the number of returnees crossed 1,000 or 1500 per day in each district in the state. “The influx is not high as compared to last year,” a district magistrate said. The authorities in Rohtas and Kaimur districts, which share their borders with Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh respectively, swung into action soon after the instructions were issued from the disaster management department for setting up the quarantine centres. Kaimur deputy development commissioner (DDC) Kumar Gaurav said those tested positive were asked to stay at the quarantine centres at Mohania and Bhabua in the district. Rohtas DM Dharmendra Kumar said three quarantine centres each with a capacity to accommodate 500 migrant workers have been set up at Dehri-on-Sone, Sasaram and Bikramganj sub-divisional headquarters in the district. The DM said eight to nine people have reported to the centres in the district till date. “But the number will increase with more migrant workers’ return to their native villages from their work place in other states,” he added. Earlier, labour resources department minister Jibesh Kumar said the influx of returnees will be more after the CM’s appeal to come home at the earliest. An estimated 25 lakh migrant workers are likely to return home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/quarantine-centres-in-dists-still-await-returnee-workers/articleshow/82246173.cms||Ramashankar

P B Gandal, the Nashik division deputy director of health, said they have been sending a vehicle to Pune — after every two days — to get Covid-19 vaccines as the stock that is received gets exhausted in a couple of days. However, the vaccination centres are not facing any shortage, he added. “While Ahmednagar does not have a problem as it is close to Pune, from Nashik, we have to send the vaccines to Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar. A lot of time is lost in this process,” said Gandal. After the vehicle with vaccine vials returns from Pune to Nashik, the vaccines are then sent out to Dhule and Jalgaon. The vehicle first goes to Dhule and then leaves for Jalgaon. Meanwhile, a vehicle from Nandurbar goes to Dhule to pick up its share. Health officials said if they were to get adequate vaccine stocks for 8-10 days at a time, then those operating the vaccination centres will not be on tenterhooks. So far, the Nashik division has received approximately 2.45 lakh vaccine doses for Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar districts. Other health officials added that if the beneficiary age categories are increased, there would be a huge rush at the vaccination centres. However, the guidelines for vaccination of people above 18 years of age are likely to come soon. Health officials said they are also in communication with senior officials to increase the stock of Covid vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-division-still-faces-erratic-covid-vaccine-supply/articleshow/82245834.cms||Santosh Sonawane

In a video from Chaudhari High School ground that went viral in social media shows a person placing a chair on top of his car’s hood to place the IV drip bottle that is being administered to a patient sitting inside the car. While innovative ‘jugaads’ by kin of patients waiting in the serpentine queues outside the hospital premises like getting own beds, fans etc from home have become a regular affair, this, however, brought a new distress to the fore. While the man in the video denied talking to the reporters, other patients too have been seen managing their own oxygen cylinders and IV drips without depending on the administration for the healthcare service for its delivery. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/innovation-holds-iv-drips-sans-stands/articleshow/82246246.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Gujarat hit by five-fold rise in active Covid cases||AHMEDABAD: It could well be the fortnight that has changed the course of the pandemic in Gujarat. If one takes the base of the 2011 Census data as an indication of the districts’ and state’s population (6.04 crore), the state had 4 active cases per 10,000 population on April 10 at 22,692. The number shot to 19 on April 25 as the state’s active cases tally reached 1.15 lakh — recording a five-fold rise. The districts’ analysis showed that Ahmedabad had 4,583 active cases on April 10, which rose 11 times to 48,555. Tapi recorded an 11-fold rise from 1 active case per 10,000 population to 11 on Sunday. The share of the four major districts —Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, and Rajkot — in the total active cases was 67% a fortnight ago, which rose to 72% on Sunday. Thus, seven of every 10 active cases are in these four districts, the analysis reveals. A city-based epidemiologist said that the rise of Covid cases in urban areas is worrisome, but also of concern is the fact that no district is unaffected by the pandemic’s impact. “Districts like Dang and Porbandar were relatively less affected in 2020 with hardly one or two daily cases being reported,” he said. “But this past fortnight witnessed the doubling of active cases in Dang (from 50 to 109) and nearly a 12-fold rise in Porbandar from 17 to 204.” Did the new variant alone create this tsunami of cases? Experts point to the rise in daily testing and the increase of the RT-PCR share that brought more patients formally into statistics. “On April 10, the state had recorded 5,011 daily cases, which were found from 1.49 lakh tests, giving the test positivity rate (TPR) of 3.4%,” said a public health expert. “On Sunday, the cases reached 14,296, which were found from 1.68 lakh tests, giving the TPR of 8.5%, showing more than doubling of the TPR.” Another analysis of the cases reveals that the number of active patients in Ahmedabad has already reached half of its total recovered patients. Compared to 86,959 patients recovered so far, the district already has 48,555 active cases, or more than 33% of its total cases is active.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/gujarat-hit-by-5-fold-rise-in-active-covid-cases/articleshow/82250090.cms||Parth Shastri

Speaking to TOI, Godse said the idea is to have backups for patients who are looking for oxygen but are not finding it. These additional cylinders will help them for a few hours — until they get the oxygen beds in hospitals. “This will help patients maintain their oxygen level until further arrangements can be made. We have bought 100 oxygen cylinders from Delhi. The NGOs will be giving two cylinders to each patient at home. The used cylinder will have to be refilled while the second cylinder acts as a backup,” said Godse. “There has been a rise in the number of new Covid-19 cases in the city. All beds, particularly oxygen beds in civic and private hospitals, are occupied. Patients who need oxygen support are not getting the oxygen beds,” said the Sena MP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-mp-provides-100-o2-cylinders/articleshow/82245838.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Covid breaks will, forces many to make final plans||NEW DELHI: The increasing mortality in the current wave of Covid-19 infections has created a sense of apprehension, prompting people to think about their last wills and testaments. Keeping their children in mind, many of them minors, Delhiites have been consulting lawyers on wills. To encourage this important familial responsibility, some lawyers are also providing their service for free. Lawyer Sanhita Dasgupta shared her willingness to help families draft wills on social media and been getting a steady stream of callers. “People die without making wills, and often fights and questions on how assets should be divided follow,” said Dasgupta, who is helped by her lawyer brother and sister-in-law. “The pandemic has created a huge concern among people. There have been cases when minors have been affected because they are left with no guardians to take care of them till they reach 18. Children are the most affected in cases where no wills exist.” The lawyer explains to people, a lot of them belonging to the middle class, who can be the witness signing the will. “But the registry is closed due to the lockdown, and there are restrictions too,” Dasgupta pointed out. “So, I have been telling people to prepare a video recording alongside the written will and kept it in a safe place.” Advocate Abhay Pandey has, in the past few weeks, helped around 12 people with the format of the will. “Many people have called to find out how to prepare their wills. With Covid so intense, people are realising that there is no certainty to life,” said Pandey. “There are families that are traumatised, especially those with children. That is why I have been helping people in whatever way I can.” Tarun Chaudhary of Legal Service India.com, a company that offers professional help in drafting wills, said, “With this surge in infections, the number of people wanting to draft wills has gone up a lot. You can easily say thousands have got in touch with us from across the country. And, significantly, even people in their late 20s want to prepare their wills.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-breaks-will-forces-many-to-make-final-plans/articleshow/82248285.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Pune||PMR oxygen supply stays stable but concerns linger||PUNE: With the region still seeing intermittent oxygen deliveries, private and civic-run hospitals said on Sunday that they are doing their best to keep supply steady for their patients. Members of the Pimpri Chinchwad Hospital Owners’ Association and the Association of Hospitals in Pune said they are currently operating under enormous stress daily, with no guarantee of supply the next day. Pramod Kubade, secretary of the Pimpri Chinchwad Hospital Owners’ Association said the situation “has not improved”. “We get supply, but we’re uncertain if it will continue the next day. The PCMC has told private hospitals not to admit new patients if they don’t have enough oxygen. But who will be responsible for these patients?" Rajesh Patil, PCMC chief, said their guidelines never asked hospitals not to admit patients. “We simply wanted to tell them to conserve their oxygen. We have released new guidelines for private hospitals (see box).” Patil said hospitals in the region are managing. “We have formed committees to ensure each hospital gets the supply it needs.” Ayush Prasad, CEO of the Pune zilla parishad, said the administration has set aside nearly 500 oxygen cylinders for Bhor and Velha talukas. Another 500 have been reserved for the Wipro medical unit in Hinjewadi. Doctors are keeping a close eye on reserves. In the early hours of Saturday, some 20 patients at the lead Sassoon Hospital had to be quickly shifted to its old building in the same premises after the unit's ran low on oxygen. S Chockalingam, the SGH’s administrative controller said the move was a precautionary measure. “The hospital’s Covid ward needs nearly 24 tonnes of oxygen. We have a 15-tonne and 13-tonne tank. On Friday, we ran low and that would've been a problem. But we fixed it; the tanks were refilled by 3am on Saturday.” District collector Rajesh Deshmukh and divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao did not respond to calls made on Sunday to get details on the oxygen situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmr-oxygen-supply-stays-stable-but-concerns-linger/articleshow/82248241.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The district administration claimed that it was on its toes in making arrangements to supply oxygen to both government and private hospitals. Doctors have suggested the government to shut down all industrial units using oxygen and divert supplies for medical use. A local hospital’s managing director, Dr Avtar Singh, said, “Human lives are more important than economic interests during the present times and oxygen supplies should be made to hospitals on priority.” Dr H S Nagpal, managing director of Hartej Hospital, observed that the number of Covid patients had come down slightly in the city. According to sources, Guru Nanak Dev Hospital (GNDH) had oxygen supplies for four-five hours only. Deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khera said they would be receiving oxygen supplies by Sunday night. GNDH medical superintendent Dr K D Singh said they were getting around 40 patient admissions every day . He said the number of admissions had registered some increase after health authorities directed private hospitals to shift their patients to GNDH if they didn’t have oxygen supplies. Meanwhile, nine persons died of Covid in Amritsar on Sunday, while 569 were tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/barely-breathing-oxygen-supply-erratic-in-amritsar/articleshow/82248222.cms||Yudhvir Rana

These four private hospitals have not provided the patients’ bills to the auditors for inspection since April 1 nor have they displayed boards with rate chart for Covid treatment and contact numbers of the auditors.  NMC has directed the four hospitals to provide the bills of Covid patients discharged from their hospitals since April 1 to the auditors. The civic body has warned of action under the Epidemic Disease Act and Disaster Management Act if they do not provide the bills within three days. B Sonkamble, the chief auditor of the NMC, said the squads of officials visited some private hospitals to ensure they are following all the guidelines by the state government. He said the government has already fixed the rates for Covid treatment and the rate chart is expected to be displayed at the entrance of the hospitals. Private hospitals must submit the bills to auditors for inspection and get their approvals before handing them over to the patients. “We found four private hotels, who handed over the bills directly to the patients without the auditor’s approval. Hence, we have served notices to four private hospitals asking them to submit the bills of the current month to auditors within three days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/4-pvt-hosps-get-show-cause-notice/articleshow/82245846.cms||Tushar Pawar

Out of the 73,199 total cases till Sunday, as many as 5,825 fresh cases were added in the last seven days alone, one of the fastest spikes seen by a district in Tamil Nadu, next only to Chennai and Chengalpet. Incidentally, the number of people who got discharged on a single was also a record-high, as 1,267 people walked home after treatment from government and private healthcare facilities. Death rate in Coimbatore was much lower than other districts, which are seeing a high number of cases. Chennai has recorded 167 deaths since April 18 and Chengalpet witnessed 45 deaths during the same period. However, Coimbatore which had cases similar to that of Chengalpet, reported only seven deaths in the last one week, according to the bulletin released by the state health department. Meanwhile, the death count was even lesser – only two people died of Covid in the last seven days, according to health bulletin released by the district authorities. The rate was way lesser than districts like Krishnagiri, where the number of active cases as well as daily surge was far lesser than Coimbatore. While the state bulletin said the total number of deaths so far in Coimbatore was 714, the district bulletin said 709. Health officials said that the district still has enough beds. There are 817 beds left in Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, ESI Hospital, Mettupalayam and Pollachi government hospitals, and primary health centres put together. In private hospitals, there are 880 in addition to 1,400 beds in Covid care centres. Health officials said that there is stock of about 10,000 doses of Covid vaccines in the district. There was, however, a steep drop in the number of people vaccinated on Sunday, which stood at 984. So far 3.43 lakh people have been vaccinated in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/1000-more-cases-for-2nd-consecutive-day/articleshow/82264711.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But all were turned away by the authorities, who advised them to approach EMRI 108 services instead, which would bring the patients. Sources close to the development said that the facility started admissions, but the number of patients did not exceed 25. The figure could not be verified with the authorities. But sources said that the dry run with the oxygen facility could be the reason for delay in admission of Covid patients. The facility, once completed, would be the biggest outside MediCity campus at Civil Hospital for Covid patients. A video that went viral on Sunday showed a family pleading with the authorities to get their grandfather admitted at the facility. “We are attempting to get a bed for past two days. We are here since the early hours, but we are not given admission. Don’t the authorities know that it takes two days for the ambulance to respond? Why can’t the critical patients be brought in our own vehicles?” asked a man in the video. Several critical patients were brought in private vehicles by their relatives but none could secure admission at the facility. Police officials deployed outside the convention centre said that they have been fielding hundreds of queries from the morning about the admission procedure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dhanvantari-hospital-starts-intake-but-only-for-a-few/articleshow/82248416.cms||---

The hospital had reached out to Hinjewadi police on Saturday as they had only three hours of oxygen left. The police, with assistance from Mulshi tehsildar Abhay Chavan, were able to get the tanker to the hospital by 4pm. By that time, the hospital had only 15 minutes of reserves left. Inspector Balkrishna Sawant of Hinjewadi police said, “At noon on Saturday, Shatayu Hospital sent us an SOS, saying they had limited oxygen, with 22 patients on support.” He said he immediately informed his seniors, including police commissioner Krishna Prakash, additional commissioner Ramnath Pokale and deputy commissioner Sudhir Hiremath — about the emergency. “The senior officers sent teams to many hospitals for cylinders,” Sawant said.A private hospital in Bavdhan then sent three oxygen cylinders. "This helped ease some pressure," Sawant said. Finally, the police got information about an oxygen tanker in the Bhosari MIDC area. “We approached that agency and asked them to send the tanker to the hospital. The vehicle reached the hospital, when only 15 minutes of supply was left,” Sawant said.Yogendra Pandey, medical director of Shatayu Hospital said, “We always have a reserve stock of 100 cylinders with us. But on Friday, the number of serious patients was high and so was oxygen consumption. We were helpless.

All shops, except pharmacies and petrol pumps, were closed. As 500 police personnel were deployed across the city, very few people were roaming freely. The cops stopped all those who were on roads and questioned them. Most of them had stepped out to visit hospitals, buy medicines or on the way to the railway station. Meanwhile, hundreds of guest workers were found at the Coimbatore Railway Junction, waiting for the Dhanbad Express and Gorakhpur Express. Most of them had reached the station on Saturday night. Mohan Prasad, 21, of Basti district in Uttar Pradesh, who was working for a pump manufacturing company at Thennampalayam for the last eight years, said he decided to return as his parents were worried about his safety. “My parents are farmers. After hearing that Covid is spreading in Coimbatore, they asked me to return. I won’t get any work in my hometown. I will take care of the cattle and sell milk,” he told TOI. “I will come back when the situation becomes normal.” Shivakumar, 32, from Lucknow, who was working as a carpenter in the city, had returned to Coimbatore in February. “I was staying in a rented room at Ramanathapuram. During the last lockdown, I shifted to Bengaluru, where the government offered shelter for guest workers. I stayed there for two months and later left for my hometown. I had returned to Coimbatore just a month ago,” he said. Some hotels were functioning in the city, but they offered only takeaway. However, Amma canteens were open. Due to the total lockdown, construction work at the elevated corridor on Avinashi Road and flyover work on Trichy Road and Ukkadam were stopped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/streets-empty-shops-closed-amid-lockdown/articleshow/82264732.cms||A Subburaj

Survivors say there is no need to panic and things turn normal in a couple of days after subsidence of symptoms and recovery. Most survivors appeal people to take all precautions and follow Covid protocol that can help them to keep the virus away. A K Tripathi, 52, a Colonelganj resident who tested positive about two weeks ago and completed home isolation on Sunday told TOI, “I got a call from a friend who suggested me to get myself tested because he had visited my house and had tested positive. I had no symptoms, but decided to go for it. Three days later, I got report of being positive and isolated myself.” I followed all the directions and took medication as per doctor’s advice, but never felt lonely as my friends and relatives kept on cheering and encouraging me on WhatsApp and Facebook, he added. The first night of the 14-day quarantine period was worst because I was isolated. There was fear of the unknown that I cannot express in words, said Tripathi. “My parents, friends and relatives kept connected with me via phone and social media, and continued motivating me,” said Sumit, another survivor while sharing his experience on social media. “One should not lose heart on testing positive, but must take proper medication and nutritious diet as advised by doctors for quick recovery,” he added. “I never talked about the disease with friends in chats and focussed on being happy,” said Sumit. Raju, a Rajapur resident, said “The isolation period was difficult. I had never been locked up for two weeks in a room. I am fond of meeting people, visiting places and so felt bad initially. My usual routine was completely disrupted and I could not have proper sleep for some days. But, my friends encouraged me and I made a speedy recovery.” The moral and mental support of family members, friends and relatives and their advice boosted the morale of most survivors, who have been sharing them with others on social media.

Additional district health officer Dr Abhay Tidke of the ZP said, “We suspect that more people in villages have come in contact with positive patients, hence the number of cases increased in villages. But most of these patients are asymptomatic and under home isolation. A ‘Gram Dakshata’ committee is working effectively to keep a tab on the positive patients at the village-level. We strongly feel that the cases will decline as these asymptomatic patients will turn negative in the next few days.” A senior official from the ZP health department said, “In rural areas many asymptomatic patients are seen out in their localities for various purposes. Hence, the number of hotspots has increased over the last week. As a result, it has now decided to carry out testing of people seen outside their homes without a reason in market towns and big villages in rural Pune with the help of the police.” Rural Pune has recorded a total of 1,38,130 Covid-19 positive cases since the outbreak of the virus last year. Total 1,16,203 patients have been discharged, 2,010 people have succumbed to the virus and 19,917 cases remain active till April 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rise-in-ncov-hotspots-at-villages-across-rural-areas/articleshow/82248271.cms||Sandip Dighe

The current price is 70 paise lesser than the rate that prevailed four days ago. On April 21, one egg was priced at Rs 4.85. It took a steady fall in the coming days to Rs 4.50 and Rs 4.15.Poultry farmers said prices were going upwards and there was steady sale of eggs until the Sunday lockdown was announced. Post the announcement of lockdown and fresh restrictions, both the sale and price have dropped.Vangili Subramanian, leading poultry farmer and president of Tamil Nadu Poultry Marketing Society, said the poultry farmers had resorted to panic selling, leading to the price drop. “They fear that there would be more lockdowns and traders are procuring eggs at lower prices by exploiting the circumstances.”There are around 1,100 poultry farms in Namakkal producing up to three crore eggs a day that are being sent across the country. Since the egg price has plunged in the district compared to other egg production hubs such as Hyderabad, Namakkal farmers are left with little choice but to sell the eggs at a lower price.On the other hand, Subramanian said, input cost has increased by about 10 paise per egg, causing loss to the poultry farmers.In the comparable period last year, the poultry farmers had to undergo nightmarish situation, as egg prices fell to less than Rs 2 per piece after the total lockdown. While the situation has been much better so far this year, farmers fear that there could be further plunge in the business in the coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/egg-prices-drop-as-fear-of-restrictions-looms-large/articleshow/82264735.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Allahabad||Covid containment zones up from 14 to 182 in just seven days||Prayagraj: In the past seven days, from April 18 to April 24, the number of Covid containment zones in Sangam city has gone up from 14 to 182. The highest concentration of containment zones is in posh, urban and semi-urban pockets while rural areas in trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna have comparatively fewer numbers, indicating that more cases are coming from the urban pockets during the current surge in Covid-19 cases in the district. Inspector General of police, Prayagraj range, K P Singh told TOI on Sunday, “On April 18, there were 14 containment zones, but the number rose to 182 on April 24, showing the rate at which the infection is spreading.” He further added, “On April 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23, as many as 51, 29, 25, 22, 20 and 21 new containment zones were added respectively in the list.” He also informed that a joint team of police, administration and health is focusing on creating containment zones across the district. This will not only help the authorities in conducting an effective surveillance and in health screening activity but also aid in restricting the movement of those people who are infected or are at a high risk of exposure. On April 24, when the joint team of health, administration and police added 24 new containment zones to the list, 16 out of 21 containments zones were in city areas while the rest five in trans-Ganga and -Yamuna pockets. Officials of the health department, meanwhile, pointed out that around 67 per cent of containment zones are in the city’s urban and semi-urban areas. All of these 182 areas (containment zones) have been sealed by the local administration. Densely populated pockets like Dariyabad, Attarsuiya, Govindpur, Allahapur, Sohbatiyabagh, University area (Katra), Khuldabad, Himmatganj, Allenganj, BaiKa Bagh (Kydganj), GTB Nagar, Rajruppur, Preetam Nagar, Kalindipuram, Mundera, Jhalwa, Malviya Nagar, Mutthiganj, Maulvi Nagar, Teliyarganj, Shivkuti, Phaphamau and Naini have reported the maximum number of Covid cases. A health department official reiterated that more Covid cases were coming from urban and semi-urban areas during the current wave. “It is difficult to pinpoint the reason behind it, but it is believed that the densely populated areas have more cases,” he said. In the first two months of this year, the number of containment zones had come down as the authorities had freed up several containment zones. However, the number of cases started rising again as the authorities tried to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus infection by creating sealed zones in and around flats and buildings where Covid cases had been reported. A containment zone is unsealed 14 days after the last Covid positive case is detected there. Currently, Prayagraj district has more than 20,000 active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/covid-containment-zones-up-from-14-to-182-in-just-seven-days/articleshow/82248490.cms||---

Sharing his experience, Akhilesh said, “After acknowledging the fact that many people are unaware of the benefits of traditional kadha and the right way to prepare it, we decided to prepare traditional kadha from spices and herbs, and are now serving it to residents of Prayagraj three times a day.” He added, “When we shared the information about the benefits of traditional kadha on social media platforms, people started responding and seeking our help to get kadha.” “As kadha is known for its immunity boosting powers, people have started visiting our home to take kadha for their loved ones. We feel very happy to serve our people,” said Sahai, adding, “We are also informing people about the benefits of steaming in Covid times,” he added. The couple has been serving kadha to people since April 9 at their home in Karelabagh colony. People from across the city have been visiting them to get kadha. “We buy all sorts of spices to make kadha from Chowk Bazar. We leave them to dry first. Once the required spices are completely dried and turned into powder, we mix them in right proportions and add lemon, neem powder and other herbs to prepare traditional kadha,” said Sahai, adding, “We have decided to continue this work and help the residents of our city boost their immunity in such difficult Covid times” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/city-based-couple-serving-kadha-to-boost-immunity-of-citizens/articleshow/82248496.cms||---

While a section of restaurants did not function on Sunday citing difficulty for their employees to reach work, restaurants that have accommodation for their employees functioned. People used food delivery applications and start-ups providing food delivery through phone calls and social media to order food. “Bachelors and people who are alone at home were the most to order food. Although offices were closed, we received orders more than what we get on usual weekdays,” said R Sindhuja, proprietor, The Foodiee, a food delivery start-up. Delivery boys said they were not intercepted by the police since they were recognisable with their company’s uniforms and delivery bags. “Online food orders soared three times more than what we receive on usual days. We planned our operation and mobilised our staff in advance by anticipating a surge in demand,” said Elvis Jarret, manager, Ammikkal restaurant in Cantonment. Bachelors staying in paying guest houses, working women staying in hostels and even families who preferred to enjoy the Sunday in leisure were among those who had kept the delivery boys busy. “Around 80% of the hotels we have partnered with were available to order foods. The response was above our expectation. It seems the IPL matches and discount offers we gave encouraged people to place orders,” a manager of an online food aggregator said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-sees-surge-in-online-food-orders/articleshow/82248317.cms||Deepak Karthik

Devotees have been urged to be more careful while eating food during Saher (pre-dawn meal) and Iftar in the course of this Ramzan. Dr. Syed Touheed Ahmed acknowledged the negative impact of consumption of cold fruits and water at this crucial time. “For the time being, it is best to abstain from having cold drinks, cold water and some citrus fruits,” Dr. Ahmed said. “Patients approaching us are complaining of cold and fever. When enquired, most say that cold fruits and drinks at Iftar led them to catch cold and develop fever. In fact, cold fruits’ negative impact leaves many people in confusion. So all of them, whether devotees or citizens, should stick to normal diet,” said, Dr. Ahmed.

The police have found a diary containing a list of borrowers. This case is similar to a 2018 murder case of Manjula Vora (78), a Matunga resident who was also into money lending business and was stabbed to death. The case remains unsolved till date. On April 15, 70-year old Ratanben Mohanlal Jain, who resided alone in her chawl home at Phoogawala compound in Bhandup (West), was found murdered and gold ornaments worth Rs 3.5 lakh that she was reportedly wearing were missing.  Though the murder took place on April 14 evening, it came to light on the next day when the victim’s domestic help turned up to clean the house. She alerted the neighbours and the Bhandup police. Ratanaben is survived by her only married daughter who lives in South Mumbai. Her daughter told the cops about the missing gold but her safe that contained around Rs 3 lakh was intact. Although the immediate neighbourhood is crowded and the chawl rooms had free access most of the houses were bolted due to the Covid curbs and nobody was spotted visiting the victim. There are no CCTVs in the vicinity. Police suspect that Ratanben may have opened the door to someone she knew, possibly, a client. “Since the past one year due to the lockdown, she had lost many clients. There are a few whom we are questioning,” said a senior police officer.—Ahmed Ali||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bhandup-sr-murder-killer-may-have-known-victim/articleshow/82248331.cms||Ahmed Ali

A Vijayakumar, who has been collecting stamps that were released for Malaria awareness by India Post, said more than two crore people get infected and more than 7 lakh people die every year due to the contagious parasitic disease. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared April 25 as World Malaria Day in 2007 to create awareness on the disease. Two decades ago postcards and letters were one of the major modes of communication. To take malaria awareness to all sections of the society, the government had released inland letters, stamps with malaria awareness slogans in several languages. Vijayakumar has more than 50 types of postal stamps, postcards and inland letters with malaria awareness slogans, which include commemorative stamps, 50 paisa postal stamps, and 25 paise Mehadoot post cards. Many of the stamps came with the awareness slogans on the usage of mosquito nets to prevent the spread of malaria, he said. Vijayakumar said that we can win over such diseases if we could succeed in sensitising children. Encouraging philately among children can be an effective mode to create such awareness, he said, adding that such stamps will kindle interest among children to learn about the disease. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-philatelist-raises-awareness-on-malaria/articleshow/82248310.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

DUTA has also asked vice-chancellor PC Joshi to request the government for monetary compensation for all those faculty members who have lost their lives due to the virus. In its letter, DUTA said the second wave of the pandemic had hit all sections badly and “we have lost a number of teaching and non-teaching staff in the last 15 days. Students and their families are undergoing a similar crisis.” The association also wants exams to be postponed. DUTA told Joshi that as things were getting worse, special leave and compensation provisions needed to be created for teachers working in ad hoc capacity. “Similar provisions should also be instituted for the non-teaching staff working on a contract basis. Provision of paid medical leave for the period of illness for self and dependent family members should be urgently extended to ad hoc teachers.” DUTA asked the university to request the government for a compensation of 2.5 crore for the families of those faculty members who have lost their lives because of Covid. The teachers have also requested for extension of internal assessment submission deadline and postponement of exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-teachers-seek-special-compensation-for-those-suffering-from-covid-19/articleshow/82248341.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||No order to shut iron and steel units, says minister||Ludhiana: Clearing the confusion following rumours of state government’s orders to shut down iron and steel industry amid oxygen shortage, industries minister Sundar Sham Arora said there were no such directions and industries have only been asked to stop processes that use oxygen.Arora said, “There is no ban on operation of the iron and steel industry in Punjab. We have only ordered to shut processes using oxygen. The step is taken as an emergency measure to meet the high demand for the medical grade gas for Covid patients. Once the situation improves and there is sufficient buffer stock of oxygen in the state, the order will be revoked.” Businessmen were relieved over the clarification, and some were of the view that the government should introduce subsidy for those willing to set up oxygen manufacturing plants in the state, as the initial cost was very high. They said if such a scheme was introduced, there would be adequate supply of oxygen in the state for both industrial and medical purposes.Gurpargat Singh Kahlon, president of Auto Parts’ Manufacturers’ Association, said, “We are thankful to the minister for clearing the confusion. Since Saturday there were several unconfirmed reports that the Punjab government has ordered closing of iron and steel plants in the state. Panic had spread among the industrialists as almost all units manufacturing engineering goods like bicycle and auto parts and hand tools rely on the iron and steel plants. As far as the ban on oxygen-dependent processes is concerned, there is no doubt it will impact the production, but it is better than a complete closure of the plants. We request the state government to assist businessmen in setting up oxygen manufacturing plants in Punjab to meet the increasing demand.”Rajkumar Singla, president of Fastener Suppliers’ Association of India, said stopping the processes that require oxygen would definitely cripple the industry. “The state government must promote setting up of oxygen manufacturing plants as huge costs are involved in it. A finance-cum-subsidy scheme should be introduced by the department of industries. Interest-free loans should be offered to the interested businessmen and subsidy should also be given at the completion of the project.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/no-order-to-shut-iron-and-steel-units-says-minister/articleshow/82246290.cms||Mohit Behl

As many as 10 panchayats in Neyyattinkara have recorded high TPR in the past one week. Kollayil, Aruvikkara and Amboori panchayats have recorded TPR above 30%. Kollayil has been the worst hit with a weekly TPR of 31.27%. A total of 96 positive cases have been confirmed in this panchayat out of 307 samples. Aruvikkara and Amboori have been reporting high positivity rates for the past two weeks. At Aruvikkara, 512 samples were collected which yielded 157 positive cases in a week. For the same period Amboori recorded 47 positives out of 155 samples. Health officials in these panchayats said that they are recording mostly home-based infection. “The pattern has been mostly similar, one member in a family catches infection and soon all members fall ill. There are families where all the seven members tested positive,” a health official said. Amboori panchayat has been slowly witnessing a resurgence of Covid-19, according to panchayat representatives. Recently family members from three wards in the panchayat went to attend a wedding outside the state and when they returned many family members tested positive. There are even cases where source of infection remains unknown. A 73-year-old woman had died of Covid-19 here but she had hardly stepped out of her house and none of her family members tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The officials said that the general trend of infection in rural wards is being reflected at Amboori as well and so far there has not been any cluster related infection here. The officials said that Aruvikkara is one area where many people frequently travel to corporation areas for work and some of them contracted the infection from workplaces and passed it on to family members. Some of the panchayats with high TPRs are recording a repeat of the pattern of infection which had stricken these rural wards in the first wave. Unbroken contact transmission had resulted in around 45 clusters across the district in August. While the first half of July was consumed by random transmission along the coastal belt, the final half leading up to August saw a similar transmission chain unveiling in rural panchayats. In panchayats like Kallikadu, Perumkadavila, Peringamala and Kattakada, more than half of the total wards had reported cases. One striking feature of all these cases had been simultaneous transmission in family members soon after an index patient was identified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/rural-panchayats-witness-home-based-infection/articleshow/82247141.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Chandigarh||PGI mortuary out of space||Chandigarh: The mortuary at PGI is packed with bodies of both Covid and non-Covid victims. There is no scope for autopsy even to understand the cause of death. As there is no proper system for death registration, doctors are relying on the overseas data for the cause of Covid death. “We must have a database of the cause of death due to Covid. This will help in research and our understanding about the reasons for death,” said PGI director Prof Jagat Ram. There have been 808 deaths in PGI since the onset of Covid in the city. These include fatality from neighbouring states and Chandigarh. Sources inform that the fridge in which the bodies are kept are always full and at times the bodies are kept outside for an early electric cremation. On Sunday, team TOI was told that four bodies were placed on the corridor as there was no space in the fridge. These bodies were immediately sent for electric cremation. “Fatality rate is not more 1.14% which at the face value looks abysmally low. But once we get more cases and have a proper death audit, the cause of death can be known,” said a public health expert. He said, “Death audit is significant as it decides if a particular treatment could have been avoided. Most of the drugs during the pandemic are repurposed drugs which have not been on the basis of randomised control trial for the specific disease.” Doctors have been observing that the mutant strain has been immediately lowering the oxygen saturation levels. “There is need for oxygen therapy or ventilators in some cases where the saturation dips below 94%.

Since a negative result is must in certain offices for employees who showed symptoms to report for work, they are in a fix. Many have been going easy on the isolation norm assuming they have tested negative.Around 18 UPHCs of the city corporation have been collecting 80 to 100 samples daily. However, owing to the surge in the spread, the health centres recently increased their intake. The UPHCs send the samples to the microbiology laboratory at Trichy KAPV government medical college and the results are sent through text messages to the registered mobile number of the person. The result can also be generated online by submitting Specimen Referral Form (SRF) ID in the government medical college’s web portal (https://cv19.microkapv.in). From conducting 1,700 tests a day in the first week of April, Trichy corporation as of last week has scaled up testing to 3,000 daily. “We are releasing the test result within a maximum of 48 hours. At a few places, the result generation may have been delayed due to samples reaching the lab late. Will sort out things to disclose the results quickly,” Dr M Yazhini, city health officer (CHO) said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/it-takes-up-to-5-days-in-trichy-to-receive-rt-pcr-test-results/articleshow/82248348.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Coimbatore||Doctors chalk out plans to check pandemic spike||Coimbatore: The Tamilnadu Government Doctors Association recently submitted a set of recommendations to the state government to control the rising number of Covid-19 cases. In a statement, association president K Senthil said that the government should enforce social distancing at public places, including shops and markets. “Shops should deliver essential items at doorsteps, so that people don’t have to step out of houses,” he said. “Work-from-home option should be encouraged at government and private offices. Only one-third of the workers should be allowed to use offices at any given point of time.” To generate herd immunity and control spread of the virus, mass vaccination drive should be organized, Senthil said. “The government should take steps to ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen for patients. Liquid-oxygen plants should be set up in all hospitals. Biomedical engineers should be deployed to ensure proper maintenance of ventilators and oxygen supply system. Non-Covid operations should be stopped temporarily.” Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), in a statement, requested the state government not to divert oxygen to other states until Tamil Nadu becomes self-sufficient. It also urged the government to take steps to convert industrial oxygen to medical oxygen and for liberal use of oxygenator machine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/doctors-chalk-out-plans-to-check-pandemic-spike/articleshow/82264740.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Chandigarh||Captain: Follow 7 rules, avoid travel||Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has requested the general public to restrain non-essential travel and local movement to contain coronavirus. He said here on Sunday: "We cannot let the situation go out of hand. Our daily cases range from 5,500 to 6,000, with more than 10% positivity in the past one week. There are signs of stress on the health system with the increased demand for oxygen. Punjab is also getting cases from the neighbouring states, some of whom may be relatives of the natives. So, this fight is collective." Highlighting the strong link between social interaction and the spread, the CM called for a voluntary hold on non-essential travel and movement out of home. Amarinder said: "The virus will travel from the cities to the rural hinterland unless we reduce the interaction between towns and villages. The panchayats and the urban local bodies should help the containment plan by motivating people to comply." He asked the people of Punjab to realise the gravity of the situation and to follow seven rules—stay home, self-isolate on developing symptoms, get tested, seek medical advice for mild and moderate infection, wear mask, get admitted in the case of severe illness, and get vaccinated. The CM requested the patients to use ‘Fateh Home Kit’ of medicines as advised by the doctors and take teleconsultation for health issues, wash hands and observe social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/captain-follow-7-rules-avoid-travel/articleshow/82248321.cms||---

They also distributed food parcels to the attenders of the patients admitted to the government hospitals and frontline workers. “We had prepared food for 500 people, but there were so many people in need. We could not serve around 50 people as the parcels got over,” E Mohan, a volunteer, who distributed food packets near Trichy MGMGH, said. The people carrying food packets to the needy in commercial streets were permitted by the police to commute provided they were wore facemasks. Private trusts -- Rangaraja Desika Swamigal trust and Sathuragiri Sithar Annadhanam group supplied food packets to localities where homeless people usually resided. Few volunteers also distributed food and water packets at the Trichy railway junction, Puthur, Central bus stand and near Palakkarai. “We had face masks and hand gloves to ensure our own safety. Since there is a possibility of all Sundays to be observed as complete lockdown, we managed to gauge the demand today,” S Arul, a volunteer from E Pudur serving food for the needy, said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/food-packets-distributed-to-the-homeless/articleshow/82248351.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Groom tests positive for Covid, wedding goes online in Uttarakhand village||ALMORA: The families of Umesh Singh Dhoni and Manju Kanyal had been ceaselessly preparing for their wedding on Saturday. But a day before the wedding, Umesh tested positive for Covid-19. While both families mulled over the idea of deferring the wedding, their priest came up with a solution — a virtual wedding, the first at the village in Almora. Manju’s marriage with Umesh, who lives in Lucknow and hails from Lwali (better known as cricketer MS Dhoni’s village), had been solemnised by their families months earlier. But last Tuesday, he had started developing symptoms. He got tested and on Friday, his report came Covid-positive. His entire family had to go into quarantine and he was put in isolation. “The Ganesh Puja had already been performed by both sides. Stopping a wedding after Ganesh Puja was not considered auspicious. Therefore, our priest advised that we get married online,” Manju said. Around 8 pm on Saturday, the bride and groom — separated by a distance of around 450 km — performed the wedding vows on videoconferencing app Zoom. Quarantined relatives joined in. As the priest recited the mantras, Manju’s younger sister tied the mangalsutra round her neck and smeared sindoor on her head. The two were officially married after a three-hour virtual ceremony. The only major thing missing, Manju said, was that the baraat (groom’s wedding procession) could not come. Also, the phera ceremony (ceremonial circumambulation around the fire) could not be done either. “We will do it again once he recovers from Covid-19,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/groom-tests-ve-for-covid-wedding-goes-online-in-ukhand-village/articleshow/82246283.cms||---
---||Kolkata||At 100, Deshbandhu’s granddaughter may miss vote for 1st time since 1952||KOLKATA: The centenarian Aditi Mukerjea, who is the granddaughter of Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, has been doing one thing uninterruptedly since 1952 — going to the booth and exercising her right to vote in all elections. The current coronavirus pandemic, however, threatens to put a break on her seven-decade long participation in Indian democracy. Mukerjea, who celebrated her 100th birthday on April 20, is a voter from the Bhowanipore constituency. However, when the assembly seat goes to polls on Monday, she is unsure of going to vote at the Bakul Bagan booth which is near her Nafar Kundu Road home, against the backdrop of the record-breaking second wave of Covid-19. “I always plan to go to the booth as I have been voting all these decades. Like many other 80-plus citizens, I have never opted for postal ballot,” she said, adding that she never missed an opportunity to vote even in the civic polls. During her centenary celebration at home, she expressed her wish to family members to go out to vote. But her daughters are not willing to let her venture out, expressing concerns over the sudden spike in Covid cases and crisis of hospital beds and oxygen cylinders. Mukerjea has a faint memory of Deshbandhu, the first mayor of Kolkata. When Das died she was barely four-year-old. She had been actively involved in social work for decades along with her mother Sujata Devi. All she now wants to know is whether the  commission can make a special arrangement for her to vote through postal ballot. The EC officials came down to her home to facilitate the voting through the postal ballot system earlier this month, but at that time she had turned down their proposal, believing that she would be able to go to the booth again. According to her, the polling officials and agents and security staff always gave her a preferential treatment considering her age and she was never asked to wait. With a request for postal ballot unlikely to be heard by EC at this time, Mukerjea may now see her uninterrupted participation in Indian democracy come to an end if she fails to turn up at the polling booth. Mukerjea recalled how Shyama Prasad Mookerjee was elected in 1952 as an MP from Calcutta South East. The family of Aditi continues to have close ties with kith and kin of Asutosh Mookerjee. Hailing from Bhawanipore, she is now more interested about the prospects of another Bhawanipore voter – Mamata Banerjee. She said she would follow the counting on TV on May 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/at-100-deshbandhus-granddaughter-may-miss-vote-for-1st-time-since-52/articleshow/82247152.cms||---

When I got a call from a colleaguein Dubai about the regulation, I had no choice but to cancel my ticket and book a fresh one. I had to pay Rs16,000 for the fresh ticket and seats were filling up fast,” Kalra, who works at a bank in Dubai, told TOI. Amrut Bhosle, who had an Air India flight booked from Mumbai to Dubai on April 30, said,“I was preparing myself to travel back but got a message from the airline on Saturday. Getting through the customer service of the airline is tough and I haven’t been able to connect. On social media, Air India has posted a message stating that passengers booked with them during the suspension period would be able to reschedule their tickets once the restrictions are lifted.” Swati, who has a flight from Mumbai to Dubai on April 29, was able to contact Air India’s customer service, where she was allegedly told that the flight for April 29 was operational. But Air India tweeted categorically stating that all flights to the UAE were suspended for 10 days with effect from April 24.  “I am really stressed and I might get sacked,” Hadapsar resident Ashwin Joshi, a working professional in Sharjah, said. A travel agent said queries were coming in scores about travel to other countries too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/uaes-10-day-flight-ban-catches-flyers-unawares/articleshow/82248378.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Trichy||It Was Total Compliance In Trichy District||Trichy: The lockdown on Sunday saw full compliance from the public as only those needing essentials or attending scheduled weddings in the central region ventured out on Sunday. Police said that the people had cooperated as even arterial roads wore a deserted look. In Trichy, all the commercial streets - Thillai Nagar main road, Bharathidasan road in Cantonment and Singarathope - were completely deserted. It was the same in Thanjavur and Kumbakonam. “Arterial roads did not witness even 1% of the usual buzz. People had genuine reasons to step out with evidence such as medical prescriptions. This is the most successful lockdown we have ever patrolled since the beginning of the pandemic,” a police officer in Trichy city said. The police personnel, apart from penalising people venturing without facemasks, also provided facemask to the violators free of cost. The Central and Chathiram bus stands were completely deserted as TNSTC crew members had moved the fleets to the depots on Saturday night. Similarly, the taxi and autorickshaw stands were vacant. Except for essential service providers, police said that the roads did not witness any other vehicular movement. A few petrol bunks were kept available but the workers reported poor demand for fuel refilling throughout the day. The city saw a few weddings held as per plan. However, there were complaints of the city police harassing the public returning from a wedding in Srirangam. “Although we had facemasks, the police personnel stationed near Chathiram bus stand levied and collected Rs 200 as spot penalty from us. We were told that they have a penalty target every day to achieve, so we ought to pay the penalty,” said K Ganesh Kumar, a Nadaswaram artist. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/it-was-total-compliance-in-trichy-district/articleshow/82248360.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Towns reeling from acute oxygen shortage||AHMEDABAD: Oxygen supply problems, doctors counting minutes for the arrival of the next oxygen consignment to sustain patients, hospitals denying admission due to the lack of oxygen — for a person in cities like Ahmedabad, this may sound grimly familiar. But the scarcity has now percolated down to tier II cities and towns of Gujarat. The majority of the districts are just about getting by on the existing supply chain, but the rise in cases may destabilize the balance, some medicos say. Thus, in some districts, authorities have passed formal or informal orders to regulate the supply before the situation gets dire. Dr Girish Anand, district president of Indian Medical Association in Narmada-Rajpipla, said that they had to turn a few patients away due to the lack of oxygen. “We try to find ways to ensure that the supply remains uninterrupted,” he said. “We are literally operating hand-to-mouth when it comes to oxygen supply and usage,” said Dr Vijay Goswami, an anaesthetist from Jamnagar. “Today, the doctors’ time is equally divided between providing treatment and getting oxygen.” Dr Goswami added: “But the medical fraternity ensures that if some hospitals run out of oxygen, other rush to help and ensure that the patients don’t suffer.” In Valsad, doctors have pooled in resources to get oxygen on their own directly from the manufacturers whereas some southern districts are reeling from a steep rise in oxygen prices. “While the state government has opened up Covid treatment for all hospitals, the oxygen requirement is surely playing a deterrent for several of them,” said Dr Ketan Patel, a doctor from Dahod. “With oxygen being an integral component of the treatment protocol, hospitals cannot admit a patient if supply is not ensured.” Dr Patel added: “While the oxygen supply is divided between government and private hospitals, major hospitals are so far getting adequate stock. But it may not be the case if the number of hospitals increase.” Several doctor bodies have already made representations to the state government to divert oxygen supply to the medical sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/towns-reeling-from-acute-oxygen-shortage/articleshow/82248368.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Two top doctors of Virar Covid hospital arrested for fire tragedy||MUMBAI: Police on Sunday arrested the chief executive officer and chief administrative officer of the Virar hospital where 15 Covid patients died after a fire broke out in the ICU in the wee hours of Friday. Vijay Vallabh Hospital’s CEO Dr Dilip Shah (56) and CAO Dr Shailesh Pathak (47) were remanded in police custody till Monday by the Vasai court, said DCP (crime), Mira-Bhayander Vasai-Virar Commissionerate Dr Mahesh Patil. The duo has been booked under IPC sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 337, 338 (causing hurt by act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life) and 34 (common intention). A five-member committee under Palghar district collector Dr Manek Gursal has been set up to probe the incident. The nurses, ward boys and doctor on night duty when the incident took place are being questioned, said a police officer. They too are named in the FIR. A nurse told the police that as per protocol, they had called Dr Shah and Dr Pathak after noticing sparks in the AC unit of the ICU. It was Dr Shah and Dr Pathak who called the fire brigade, said police, adding that allegations of the fire brigade being informed of the blaze after a 15-minute delay is being investigated. The hospital, too, has alleged that the fire engines took over five minutes to reach the hospital early morning (3.18am as per the fire brigade record) when there was no traffic, said a police officer. A nurse alleged that some of the patients’ relatives, who were contacted, reached the hospital even before the firemen. The 90-bed, four-storey Vijay Vallabh Hospital had been converted into a Covid facility in March last year. The hospital had got its fire licence renewed at the same time. But in September 2020, it did not renew the fire licence, which is mandatory after every six months. In November 2020, after a drop in Covid cases, the hospital resumed treating non-Covid patients. Then in February 2021, the hospital was again converted into a Covid-only facility. “All this was done without informing the civic body,” said a civic source, adding that civic officials had not visited Vijay Vallabh Hospital to inspect the arrangements and facilities despite it being among the top three private Covid hospitals in Vasai region. The hospital got its fire lice-nce last month, though the mandatory sprinkler system was missing. Police are questioning fire and civic officers as to why the audit was not carried out since last September. Details of the audit done last month is also being verified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-two-top-doctors-of-virar-covid-hosp-arrested-for-fire-tragedy/articleshow/82248373.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Kochi||Revenue gap of Kerala rose steeply in last financial yr||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as the state’s revenue receipts shrunk in 2020-21, the expenditure of the state government shows that it surpassed even the higher projected figures in the revised budget estimates. This would mean that the revenue gap of the state has steeply increased in the last financial year much higher than the estimated figure. Also, as per the latest figures of the finance department, accessed by TOI, the net public debt of the state increased in the last one year by 9.6% than the projected figures in the revised budget estimates for 2020-21. The net public debt increased from Rs 30,499.97 crore as anticipated in the revised budget estimates to Rs 33,429.88 crore, showing an increase of Rs 2,929.91 crore. Though the state’s expenditure for 2020-21 was projected as Rs 1,28,382.63 crore in the budget estimates, the actuals was much higher at Rs 1,41,946.24 crore, which is Rs 13,563.61 crore more than the estimates. Of the total expenditure, 89.06% (Rs 1,26,425.44 crore) is revenue expenditure of the state while only a minor share of 9.13% (Rs 12,962.86 crore) has gone to capital expenditure. “Among the revenue expenditure, salaries, pensions and interest payments eat up majority of the share, and mindless of the increasing revenue expenditure, the government has been creating more and more posts, while not deciding to abolish posts despite several studies on government’s administrative machinery recommended cutting the large size of the government,” said a senior official with the finance department. A finding by a committee appointed by the government to rationalize state’s revenue expenditure, led by Sunil Mani, director, Centre for Development Studies, had found that salaries, pensions and interest payments form approximately 70% of the total revenue expenditure. The salaries of government employees alone form 30% of the expenditure and these three components together contributed to a 51% increase in the state’s total revenue expenditure in the last 10 years.  The committee had also found that the average salary of a state government employee has almost doubled over the last seven years. Meanwhile, the state’s total revenue receipts, that was projected to become Rs 1,14,635.90 crore in the budget estimates for 2020-21, had ended up at Rs 92,456.11 crore, which means that the state fell short by Rs 22,179.79 crore. Also, as per budget estimates, the revenue share from the state’s own tax revenue (SOTR) were projected as Rs 67,420.01 crore, the actual earnings were Rs 46,032.88 crore, thus a shortfall of Rs 21,387.13 crore. Excluding state GST, sales tax and VAT, the state earned Rs 3,375.50 crore from stamps and registration in the Covid-19 year, which was more than Rs 3061.98 crore, the anticipated sum in the budget estimates. The state also earned Rs 3,272.91 crore from motor vehicle tax in the last financial year, lesser than the estimated figure of Rs 3,367.11 crore. Sources said that since expenditure was as expected and the revenue receipts not meeting expectations, the state will face a grim financial situation without more financial discipline in the present year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/revenue-gap-of-state-rose-steeply-in-last-financial-yr/articleshow/82246309.cms||KP Saikiran

The fund, which is being awarded through the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)-India, is to support the fisheries that are in early stages of improving their management practices. WWF officials said that they are working in collaboration with several local partners in the region to help the fishery move towards MSC certification by 2025. The fishery targets Arabian red shrimp, deep-sea shrimp and Indian nylon shrimp, operating off Kerala’s coast, mainly in Kollam bank, where around 80% of Kerala’s deep-sea shrimp are caught. Most of the catch is exported to the EU and the US. Alongside sustainability, market access has been a key driving force for the fishery and supporting stakeholders to seek certification. In 2019, the seafood exporters association of India (SEAI) and the forum for deep-sea shrimp sustainability developed an action plan and initiated an MSC pre-assessment. This showed that improved research is vital to help the fishery managers understand the stock status of the shrimp and to inform the development of harvest strategies for the fishery to demonstrate its practices are sustainable. WWF-India will work with industry, government, fishers and NGO stakeholders to undertake a stock assessment and determine a reference point for sustainable fishing. Their ocean stewardship fund grant will also help the fishery meet other requirements for certification, such as reducing bycatch and assessing local habitat and ecosystem impacts. “As most fisheries resources are overexploited in India, bringing sustainability is the only way by which the resources can be conserved and protected for future generations. This funding will help enable us to implement the fishery improvement project activities for these species of shrimp which are of great commercial importance,” said Vinod Malayilethu, team leader of the WWF-India marine conservation programme. The marine stewardship council’s consultant in India, Ranjit Suseelan, said that the seafood exporters association of India has prioritised the sustainability of fisheries with the foresight that good business relies on sustainable resources. “Also, the government of India has developed and commenced with the implementation of several policies and improvement tools to support resource conservation and sustainable harvesting in India,” he said. “The fisheries department aims to manage the fishery resources of the Kerala coast in a sustainable manner without harming the livelihood of those who are dependent on it. We are certain that the MSC grant will aid us in bringing forth our effort to manage the region’s resources sustainably,” said Smitha Nair, joint director of fisheries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/msc-grant-for-deep-sea-shrimp-fishery-project/articleshow/82246313.cms||---

The result: employees are finding it hard to cope up with the rush of passengers at the ticket counters. A total of 20 railway employees are down with Covid-19. Ten of them are posted at the reservation windows. Now, just four are left to do the work. They said they are subjected to double shifts as many migrant laborers are heading for their native places fearing a longer lockdown. Ten employees out of 33 in the travelers’ ticket examiner staff are under treatment. Some of the class IV employees are also suffering from Covid. Railway station superintendent J P Singh said, “We are facing major staff crunch as many employees have been infected. The major effect is at the booking counters.” At the same time, huge rush can be seen at the booking windows as people plan to go back to their native places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/virus-hits-rly-station-staff/articleshow/82246312.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

As cases spike in the district, sources in major hospitals said they are getting calls enquiring about the availability of beds from relatives who are looking to shift patients from small and medium hospitals to larger ones and that they are compelled to put them on waiting list. As it will take 10 days to subject the patient for antigen testing, there is delay in patient discharge, thereby increasing the number of occupied beds, they said. “All 95 Covid beds in our hospital are occupied. We are not admitting new Covid patients as we do not have vacant beds. Antigen tests are conducted after 10 days. Seventy per cent of the calls we get are from relatives who want to shift patients from medium hospitals to ones with better facilities. We also receive a large number of calls from other districts, including Alappuzha and Kozhikode enquiring about availability of beds,” said a spokesperson of a private hospital near Cheranelloor. The hospital will start a first-line treatment centre in their annex, he added. Some private hospitals are questioning the reason behind the delay in converting the government medical college in Kalamassery to a full-time Covid facility. “We don’t have single bed to accommodate Covid patients. Even CovidICUs are full. Every hospital has to pitch in to deal with the crisis. The district is registering more than 3,000 new cases every day. We are being pushing against a wall. The government has to do something. The government medical college in Kalamassery has not yet begun to function as a full-fledged Covid treatment facility. Also, it is the responsibility of everyone to cooperate by strictly adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said an official with another hospital in the city. Sources in a private hospital in Aluva also said it is grappling with scarcity of beds for Covid patients. Another one in Kakkanad said it has enough beds for Covid patients.Private hospital management association office bearers said it is the responsibility of the district administration to ensure that all private hospitals set aside minimum 25% of beds for Covid patients. “Some hospitals set aside 40-50% of beds for Covid treatment. Some may not earmark even 20% beds. It is up to the district administration to ensure the availability of beds,” said Dr Bevanan Joseph, secretary of Kerala Private Hospitals Association. “The resources must be micromanaged and distributed equally. The authorities have to ensure that patients are not moved from one district to another for treatment, until an emergency situation arises. Relatives of patients admitted to medium hospitals call up because they know only major hospitals have ventilators and ICU facilities,” he added. There were 490 patients under treatment in government hospitals and 1,193 in private hospitals on Saturday. As many as 225 were in ICU, in both government and private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/major-pvt-hosps-facing-shortage-of-beds-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82247153.cms||---

The patient was brought by a relative to the hospital on April 19. Police have already arrested Jagdish Solanki (20), an attendant in the Covid ward and Hitesh Mahida (18), a sweeper, after a video of the former striking a deal for Rs 9,000 had gone viral on April 20. The duo had then managed to get an 85-year-old woman from Junagadh get admitted on the bed of a person who succumbed to the infection. “During questioning, both accused confessed that they had also taken Rs 9000 from the relatives of Jignaben. a Covid patient from Chotila to get her admitted into the civil hospital. Solanki, who had brought the patient in a private car, told the doctor that the patient was his relative. We are questioning them to find out how many more patients they got admitted by taking money from their families,” the police said. Elaborating their modus operandi, cops said that while Mahida would hunt for vacant beds inside, Solanki would negotiate with relatives of needy patients outside the hospital. As soon as Mahida would find a vacant bed, he would alert Solanki and the process of deceit would begin. Solanki used to pass on the patients’ details to Mahida who would make a case window and get the patient registered and a file made. Mahida would then get a stretcher to the trauma centre, while Solanki would bring in the patient. All entries of Covid patients, however, take place only from the backside of the hospital from the Chaudhari High School ground. If asked why the patient was brought through trauma centre, the duo would lie that the patient had been taken for some tests. Solanki and Mahida are from Jamnagar and knew each other. Both were dismissed from their jobs after arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/duo-confesses-to-managing-bed-for-chotila-patient-too/articleshow/82246316.cms||---

A large number of patients have died due to non-availability of oxygen and ventilator-beds in hospitals and the casualties are only increasing.

---||Ludhiana||No order to shut iron and steel units, says minister||Ludhiana: Clearing the confusion following reports of state government’s orders to shut down iron and steel industry amid oxygen shortage, industries minister Sundar Sham Arora said there were no such directions and industries have only been asked to stop processes that use oxygen.Arora said, “There is no ban on operation of the iron and steel industry in Punjab. We have only ordered to shut processes using oxygen. The step is taken as an emergency measure to meet the high demand for the medical grade gas for Covid patients. Once the situation improves and there is sufficient buffer stock of oxygen in the state, the order will be revoked.” Businessmen were relieved over the clarification, and some were of the view that the government should introduce subsidy for those willing to set up oxygen manufacturing plants in the state, as the initial cost was very high. They said if such a scheme was introduced, there would be adequate supply of oxygen in the state for both industrial and medical purposes.Gurpargat Singh Kahlon, president of Auto Parts’ Manufacturers’ Association, said, “We are thankful to the minister for clearing the confusion. Since Saturday there were several unconfirmed reports that the Punjab government has ordered closing of iron and steel plants in the state. Panic had spread among the industrialists as almost all units manufacturing engineering goods like bicycle and auto parts and hand tools rely on the iron and steel plants. As far as the ban on oxygen-dependent processes is concerned, there is no doubt it will impact the production, but it is better than a complete closure of the plants. We request the state government to assist businessmen in setting up oxygen manufacturing plants in Punjab to meet the increasing demand.”Rajkumar Singla, president of Fastener Suppliers’ Association of India, said stopping the processes that require oxygen would definitely cripple the industry. “The state government must promote setting up of oxygen manufacturing plants as huge costs are involved in it. A finance-cum-subsidy scheme should be introduced by the department of industries. Interest-free loans should be offered to the interested businessmen and subsidy should also be given at the completion of the project.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/no-order-to-shut-iron-and-steel-units-says-minister/articleshow/82246302.cms||Mohit Behl

Baramati is one of the worst hit tehsils in the district. At 2,642 active cases, the tehsil has the highest numbers in rural Pune. A decision to provide 150 oxygen beds at GMCH was taken at a review meeting chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in Baramati on Sunday. Issues related to supply of remdesivir and other medicines were also discussed at the meeting. Senior officials from the revenue department, police officers and local political leaders were present at the meeting. Baramati’s sub-divisional officer Dadasaheb Kamble told TOI, “As of now, we have 450 oxygen beds at private hospitals, which have been designated as dedicated Covid facilities, and another 177 oxygen beds at state establishments, such as the sub-district hospital. Yet, there is a high demand for oxygen beds and we had to refer many patients to health centers outside the tehsil. We discussed this issue at the meeting held today.” Kamble said the issue of shortage of remdesiver was also discussed during the meeting. “We are getting around 300-350 Remdesiver vials now, as against our requirement of 600 vials every day. We have requested the deputy CM to make available the required vials to tide over the situation.” Pawar has already directed the police and the revenue authorities to work in tandem to implement social distancing norms effectively across the tehsil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/150-beds-from-april-30-for-govt-hospital-in-badly-hit-baramati/articleshow/82248386.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Chandigarh||In Haryana, supply of oxygen ‘hand to mouth’||CHANDIGARH: Haryana health authorities waited until last week’s surge of Covid-19 to press their case for medical oxygen, as a series of communications between the health ministry and the state since April 15 now reveal. Since then, the ministry has issued four allocation lists (April 21, 24, and the latest on Sunday evening). Haryana wasn’t on the first. In revised list of April 21, it got a quota of 64 metric tonnes oxygen, which was revised on Saturday night to 164 MT.  On Sunday, allocation was unchanged but ministry reduced Haryana’s share from the Panipat unit from to 100 MT 120 MT, and made up for it with 20 MT from Bhiwadi. Till Sunday, Haryana had consumed 160 to 170 MT oxygen in both private and government hospitals. Its allocation of 164 MT includes the supply to private hospitals, which have separate contracts with oxygen makers.  Anticipating a demand surge by next week, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has written to the health ministry for enhancing the quota to 260 MT. Haryana also seeks oxygen from the steel plants of Bokaro. An official in the food and drug administration (FDA) said: “As gathered from data, we are on a par with requirements. Based on the assumption of a greater surge, CM has asked for more allocation." Districts are managing with existing supply of oxygen. Rohtak CMO Dr Anil Birla said district needs 800 oxygen cylinders a day and hospitals get supply with 5 tonnes extra. Karnal DC Nishant Yadava also claimed no shortage. Ambala DC Ashok Kumar Sharma put oxygen requirement and supply at 9 tonnes. He said a plant in Saha will divert industrial oxygen to hospitals at 250 cylinders a day. Yamunanagar civil surgeon Dr Vijay Dahiya said: “We need 5 tonnes a day and supply is hand to mouth. Roorkee gives us 4 MT. A plant roped in on Sunday can give us 400 cylinders a day."

---||India||India, France kick off major naval exercise in Arabian Sea||NEW DELHI: India and France on Sunday kicked off their major ‘Varuna’ naval exercise in the Arabian Sea, as a step towards promoting maritime security in the Indo-Pacific region. The bilateral exercise, in which France has deployed its nuclear-powered aircraft carrier FNS Charles de Gaulle with its Rafale-M naval jets, comes soon after the two countries joined the US, Japan and Australia in the ‘France plus Quad’ La Perouse wargames in the Bay of Bengal earlier this month. With China’s aggressive and expansionist behaviour in the Indo-Pacific, there is growing strategic congruence among like-minded democratic countries to ensure a stable and secure Indo-Pacific as well as a rules-based order in the region. “The three-day Varuna will see high tempo-naval operations at sea, including advanced air defence and anti-submarine exercises, intense fixed and rotary wing flying operations, tactical manoeuvres, surface and anti-air weapon firings, among other maritime security operations,” Navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said. India has deployed guided missile stealth destroyer INS Kolkata, stealth frigates INS Tarkash and INS Talwar, fleet support ship INS Deepak, with Seaking-42B and Chetak integral helicopters, as well as a Kalvari-class diesel-electric submarine and P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft for the exercise. Apart from the aircraft carrier, France has fielded air defence destroyer Chevalier Paul, multi-mission frigate FNS Provence and command and supply ship Var, apart from E2C Hawkeye aircraft and helicopters. “The joint exercise comprises various drills across the spectrum of maritime operations, with the goal of fostering interoperability and mutual learning between the two navies and reinforcing their capability for joint action in a strategic area,” the French embassy said in a statement. “In this respect, this exercise underscores the shared interests and commitment of both nations in promoting maritime security in the Indo-Pacific. It bears testimony to the vitality of the strategic partnership between France and India, which continues to be strengthened despite the pandemic,” it added. The ‘Varuna’ joint exercise is part of the French carrier strike group’s ‘Clemenceau 21’ deployment being conducted in the eastern Mediterranean, the Gulf and the Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea) from February to June. “The goal is to contribute to the stabilisation of these strategic zones and strengthening cooperation with the navies of partner countries, in particular India for the Indian Ocean component. As part of this deployment, the carrier strike group is also taking part in anti-ISIS operations,” the French embassy said. After the completion of Varuna, INS Tarkash will continue to exercise with the French carrier strike group from April 28 to May 1, taking part in advanced surface, anti-submarine and air-defence operations||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-france-kick-off-major-naval-exercise-in-arabian-sea/articleshow/82249768.cms||---

Justice Sarang Kotwal rejected Abhay Kurundkar’s application for temporary bail for six days between April 23-28 to attend the tenth and thirteenth day rituals at Ajara. Kurundkar’s wife succumbed to Covid19 on April 15. Kurundkar, who was police inspector at Thane rural branch, is facing trial for the murder of Ashwini Bidre, assistant police inspector attached to the Protection of Civil Rights Department in Kalamboli headquarters and training centre of Navi Mumbai police. Bidre went missing on April 11, 2016. Kurundkar moved HC after the sessions court, Panvel rejected his plea. On April 23, his advocate argued that Kurundkar’s son and daughter have tested negative and he has taken first dose of vaccine. He said the escorts would be frontline workers who have taken the vaccine. Hence, there would be no danger in allowing him to go to Ajara. But special public prosecutor Pradip Gharat opposed his plea saying it is not just a question of Kurundkar or his family’s safety but also safety concerns for the jail inmates and escorts once he returns. Justice Kotwal agreed with Gharat. “At this stage the risk involved is much higher. Though it is very unfortunate that the applicant was unable to attend the funeral of his wife, I am not inclined to permit the applicant to go to Ajara to attend the rituals, considering the prevailing situation in the State of Maharashtra,’’ he said. The judge said that the court would have considered Kurundkar’s plea in normal circumstances. “However, the situation is serious. Infection is spreading fast and wide.”  Justice Kotwal said Kurundkar may apply again once the situation becomes reasonably safe for him to travel to Ajara and the trial court shall decide his application on its merits. The judge added that the trial court’s April 20 directions, including for video conference, shall remain. “The jail authorities shall make proper arrangement as directed by the trial court so that the applicant can interact with his family members through video conferencing at the time of these rituals,’’ he concluded. After Ashwini Bidre went missing, her brother Anand Bidre and husband Raju Gore had lodged a missing complaint at Kalamboli on July 14. 2016. After Anand filed a habeas corpus petition in the high court, the police probe began in earnest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-jailed-cop-denied-visit-to-attend-wifes-post-funeral-rites/articleshow/82248402.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Kolkata||TMC’s Khardaha contestant dies of Covid, Babul tests positive||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress’s Khardaha contestant Kajal Sinha succumbed to Covid-19 on Sunday, becoming the third candidate in the ongoing assembly elections to have died after testing positive. On Sunday, Union minister Babul Supriyo, the two-time MP from Asansol who is contesting from Tollygunge assembly seat, tested positive. Supriyo is in isolation at his Howrah residence now and won’t be able to vote in Asansol that goes to polls on Monday. Voting for Supriyo’s constituency is already over. Sinha was the chief administrator of Khardaha municipality and two-time councillor from ward No. 5. The 59-year-old leader was admitted to the Beliaghata ID hospital on Wednesday after testing positive. On April 15, Congress candidate for the Shamshergunj constituency, Rezaul Haque, had died of the infection. A day later, Jangipur’s RSP candidate Pradip Nandy also succumbed to the virus. The elections in these two seats were originally scheduled for April 26, but  Commission has announced re-polling there on May 16. TMC supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressed shock and grief over Sinha’s demise. “Very, very sad. Shocked. Kajal Sinha, our candidate from Khardaha, succumbed to Covid. He dedicated his life to serving people & just fought a tireless campaign. He was a long-serving committed member of @AITCofficial. We will miss him. My condolences to his family & his admirers (sic),” she tweeted. Principal of ID & BG Hospital at Beliaghata, Anima Haldar told reporters that Sinha was diabetic and had hypertension. “He had acute respiratory distress with low oxygen saturation. It would have helped if he was admitted earlier,” she said. Many Trinamool supporters gathered in front of Sinha’s residence at Khardaha’s Panshila area. According to his election agent Nilu Sarkar, Sinha had complained of breathing issues since Monday during the last leg of campaign. Khardaha went to polls on Thursday. Sinha’s ex-colleague-turned-political rival, BJP’s Shilbhadra Dutta, told TOI that he had known Sinha for 30 years, describing him as a “family friend”. Sanjukta Morcha (CPM) candidate Debojyoti Das was also “deeply anguished” by the news. An EC official said: “A re-election in Khardaha will be held within six months if the winning candidate is deceased.” Supriyo’s mother, Sumitra Baral, had succumbed to Covid-19 on December 9 last year. This time, his wife too has tested positive. “We are in isolation in a room. My daughter is in the other room with my father. My parents-in-law are checking on her. I don’t have fever and my oxygen saturation is also OK. I have a body ache. I am attending calls, working on the computer and discharging all my duties from my room,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmcs-khardaha-contestant-dies-of-covid-babul-tests-positive/articleshow/82247171.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

---||Hyderabad||Over 3L parents in Telangana took loans to pay school fee||HYDERABAD: During the academic year 2020-21, where students got to attend physical classes for hardly two months, as many as 3.8 lakh parents from Telangana, mostly the ones with school-going children, have taken loans to pay the school fee. About 900 schools in the state are said to have tied up with third-party firms to provide EMI options for parents to clear school fees. These loans are given at zero or low interest rates. “We want quality education to be accessible to everyone. Even applications of those who are typically not eligible to get loans through the traditional system are given loans by our form,” said Rohit Gajbhiye, founder, Financepeer. The firm is said to have tied up with a total of 750 schools in Telangana, including some of the top international schools, and is providing loans to 2.3 lakh students from the state during the pandemic. In total, Financepeer is said to have provided loans to 10 lakh students during the pandemic and is associated with more than 4,500 institutes pan-India. “The parents can either approach us via school or individually through our website. When a school is tied up with us, the loan is provided at zero interest,” Gajbhiye told TOI, adding that during the pandemic they have tied up with 600 schools per month on average. Apart from giving an option to pay fees in equated monthly installments (EMIs), these fintech firms are also providing insurance and rewards to parents, who are opting to pay fees through their firm. “Our main USP is we don’t charge interest from parents,” said Rishab Mehta, founder, GrayQuest, which has provided loans to parents of 1.5 lakh students in the state to date. Mehta said that his firm has tied up with almost all chains of schools in the country to provide EMI options to parents. “There is a massive increase in the number of parents opting for the EMI option during the pandemic as cash flow has become a challenge,” added Mehta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-3l-parents-in-t-took-loans-to-pay-school-fee/articleshow/82259220.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Hyderabad||Taking loans will do more harm than good : Parents’ associations||Hyderabad: Even as lakhs of parents are opting to take a loan to pay school fees, parents’ associations in the state said that doing so is going to do more harm than good in case a parent defaults on payments. “This clearly shows that parents are unable to pay the fee,” said Ashish Naredi, whose daughter is studying in class 8 in an international school, which had tied up with a financial tech firm to provide EMI options. “Instead of addressing fee issue, schools are tying up with the third-party firm. Even the state and courts are silent when it comes to fee issue,” he said, adding that the school management has hiked the fee by about 10% and is asking parents, who have not registered with the third-party firm for the EMI option, to make quarterly payment for the academic year 2021-22 by April 26. “The school said that it is going to charge Rs 200 per day as a late fee from April 27 and is not giving monthly option,” he added. Naredi said that although the school or firm is showing as if the loan is provided at zero interest, an extra amount is being charged in the name of the processing fee. The members of Hyderabad Students Parents Association (HSPA) said that while the fee payment is usually between the school and the parent, by involving a third party, a parent risks getting his credit score decreased. “This is only going to complicate things to parents. If a parent is unable to pay fees for a month or two, he could talk with the management and take more time.

In a key decision, the district disaster management authority (DDMA) has mooted a plan to set up at least 1,000 oxygen beds in a fortnight. The meeting of the DDMA attended by agriculture minister V K Sunil Kumar on Sunday decided to arrange at least new 250 oxygen beds so as to meet any eventuality. “As of now, the situation in the district is well under control. We have enough beds and other facilities. We have adequate oxygen beds as well,” district collector S Suhas said. “Still, we will have to be prepared for any steep rise in the cases. That’s why we are planning to increase the strength of oxygen beds in the district by 1,000 in a phased manner within a fortnight,” Suhas said. Around 250 oxygen beds will be set up at a convention centre near Angamaly within five or six days. “Another facility with around 200-250 oxygen beds will be set up at Cochin Port Trust. A third facility with around 300 oxygen bed capacity will be arranged in an auditorium at Kalamassery. There is also a plan to set up 200 oxygen bed facility at a stadium in the city,” sources said. “It will take around Rs 1 crore for setting up the four facilities which can together provide around 1,000 new oxygen beds,” sources said. Kochi mayor M Anilkumar has promised to give all the support for converting a hall in Cochin Port Trust into a 200-250 oxygen bed facility. An urgent meeting will be conducted with major industrial units like Cochin Shipyard Ltd and FACT for enhancing the production of oxygen. A system to ensure smooth delivery of oxygen cylinders will also be put in place. At a meeting convened by the district collector, the managements of private hospitals have agreed to earmark 25% of their beds for Covid-19 patients. In the wake of reports that Covid-19 patients are not being admitted to private hospitals, a team will conduct inspection at private hospitals to see that they admit patient as per the promise. The team will also conduct a physical verification of oxygen beds which are vacant at each private hospital. There will be a facility at the taluk level for managing the shifting of patients from various Covid first-line treatment centres (CFLTCs) and domiciliary care centres (DCCs) to Covid hospitals. Control rooms will be set up at taluk level and telephone numbers of the control rooms will be published soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ekm-to-enhance-covid-treatment-facilities/articleshow/82247204.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Officials said that the department will soon take action against the gated communities and other establishments that are not following the norms. “Due to non-maintainence of STPs in these gated communities and other apartment complexes, treated water is not being used for gardening, cleaning and other non-domestic purposes. It was also found that several STPs were not constructed despite the relevant authorities issuing the occupancy certificate,” said an official. According to the audit analysis given by the officials, the total private STPs in GHMC, HMDA and Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation limits were 628 out of which 537 STPs were audited. The audit of remaining 91 STPs had to be put on hold due to Covid-19. Highlighting the issue, a citizen, Sangeetha Maheshwaram tweeted, “Respected sir. Please focus on Sewage Treatment Plants in Gated Communities, Hospitals and Commercial Complexes. They release waste water directly into the nalas. So please set up any cell under MAUD (sic).” Responding to the issue, the MAUD principal secretary tweeted, “We have taken up the audit of existing privately managed STPs in such communities and will initiate action against the defaulting gated communities and will ensure STPs are working”. The aggregate operational capacity of existing STPs is 154.419 million litres per day (MLD), of which 137.379 MLD of water is being treated. A total of 79.679 MLD of treated water is being used for several purposes every day including gardening, flushing, cooling tower and selling treated excess water to GHMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/under-ghmc-limits-9-stps-in-complexes-defunct/articleshow/82247194.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Over 30 cash-strapped teachers in state ended life between Sept ’20 and April||Hyderabad: Caught in the grip of a financial crisis, amid a raging pandemic that put brakes on their salaries for almost a year, at least 33 school teachers across Telangana died by suicide between September 2020 and April 2021, reveals data compiled by the Telangana Private Teachers Forum (TPTF). That records, available with TOI, show that most of these teachers were not paid salaries since March 2020, soon after schools went into lockdown and classes were moved online. Desperate for funds, while many of them took up odd jobs — including working as daily-wage labourers — the burden of debts and liabilities, their family members say, got the better of them. According to a senior official from the education department, no records on death of private teachers or their pending salaries are available with the department as managements don’t provide such details. “We still haven’t been able to come to terms with the fact that my son is no more,” said M Shankaraiah, father of 29-year-old Marri Venkat, who committed suicide on October 4, 2020. He was employed as a Telugu teacher at a private school in Nalgonda. But once Covid hit, Venkat was forced to take up a job as a sanitation labourer, to make ends meet. “Maybe it was the mounting debts — the family had taken land on rent for farming — or the fact that he wasn’t getting a salary that pushed him to consume pesticide,” said the distraught 55-year-old father ,who is now working as a daily wage labourer. “Venkat was the eldest of my three sons. I spent all my wages on his education, hoping that at least he would lead a comfortable life. I never expected him to die at such a young age,” he said. Neither did the parents of V Shivani, a biology teacher from a private school in Hyderabad, who died by suicide on September 7, 2020. “I had raised my daughter to be a strong and independent woman...I don’t know why she lost her confidence,” said father, K Komaraiah, sharing that Shivani and her husband, also a teacher, had availed of a loan to buy a house three years ago. With their income drying up last year, the family was struggling to pay the EMI, the retired RTC employee added. The family is now at sea and just don’t know how to provide for Shivani’s teenage son who recently completed his class 10. Members of teachers’ groups say thousands of teachers have been similarly pushed to the brink of collapse — they have sold their houses, land parcels, jewellery and other belongings — while trying to survive the pandemic. “In fact, families of some teachers who died even struggled to arrange for the last rites,” said A Santosh Kumar from the Telangana School’s Technical Colleges Employees Association, claiming at least 51 KG to PG teachers committed suicide over the last few months. They accused both school managements and the state for failing to support teachers. “While the managements failed to come to the rescue of their staff, the state failed in implementing the government order and ensuring that teachers are paid their salaries,” said Shabir Ali, president, TPTF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-30-cash-strapped-teachers-in-state-ended-life-between-sept-20-and-april/articleshow/82247231.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Shyam had written the lyrics of Bhojpuri movie ‘Nirahua Rikshawala’ and even acted in ‘Rani Dilbar Jani’. “He had come home about three weeks ago. He moved around and people too thronged his home,” mukhiya Sudha Singh said on Sunday. After his death at Gorakhpur on April 19, she wrote to the DM that a large number of people had attended his funeral the night before and that the deceased had mingled with many earlier. On April 21, she again wrote a letter to the DM, fearing that 300 to 400 villagers might be infected. The administration swung into action and 54 out of the 230 villagers who gave samples tested positive. “We have sealed the village,” Bagaha SDM Shekhar Anand said. “Health workers had put strings with containment zone posters, but the villagers removed them,” the mukhiya said and added: “People are evading tests. In fact, even those who have tested positive are running mithai and kirana shops,” she said in anguish. Her fears found credence in the death of co-villager Radhey Shyam Pathak of Covid on Saturday. “His cremation last night was a full congregation sans PPE kits or bodybag in neglect of the Covid protocol,” she said. “Any mass congregation in denial of Covid safety protocols is a powder-keg,” said Pramod K Tiwary, superintendent at Government Medical College & Hospital, Bettiah. The doctor’s fears, however, find no consonance in the number of band-baaja-baarats that defy both night curfew orders and limits in the number of participants prescribed. “About 20 to 30% cases are from rural areas,” the Bagaha SDM said, emphasising that he has been relentlessly advising people to shun big, fat weddings. However, his fears of Covid’s rural march were affirmed by 119 people testing positive in Bagaha 1 and 2 blocks alone on Friday. Over a dozen villages reported positive cases. In Narkatiganj sub-division, IAS officer Sahila is trying to curb the virus spread in rural areas. “We are increasing the number of containment zones from the three in place in Gaunaha, Mainatar and Sikta blocks,” she said. The rural areas identified by the SDM include Balthar (10 cases), Sarapharwa (7), Bashtha (6) and Rampurwa (6). “Fortunately, cases found in these villages are not critical. We hope to contain them with home isolation,” she said, adding that patients are being rung up twice or thrice a day to monitor and advise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhojpuri-lyricist-dies-of-covid-19-leaves-54-of-his-villagers-infected/articleshow/82247233.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

Around 20 private and public hospitals are catering to Covid patients, having around 200 ICU beds. But the second wave is quickly exhausting the ICU beds available. Both Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16, are unable to take further admissions owing to 100% occupancy in Covid hospital. PGI is getting patients from Delhi, flooding the hospital supposed to cater to the Tricity and adjoining states. PGI director Prof Jagat Ram said, “We have started seeing patients coming from Delhi for Covid treatment. We cannot refuse anyone who comes here, but we have beds occupied by patients from adjoining states.” The issue was discussed in a recent meeting with the administration. Public health experts feel if there were live feeds online, like Mumbai, where people can look at the availability of the beds, ventilators, medicines and oxygen supply and then try those hospitals instead of shuttling, this could save lives and prevent unnecessary panic. Patients are desperately looking for medicines and hospital admission for their near and dear ones, said sources. “My father was outside GMSH, Sector 16, as there was no bed available. He is looking for an ICU with a ventilator,” said a patient’s relative. When Team TOI approached the hospital staff for help, a bed was arranged in a private hospital. Sources said there were directions during the first wave not to admit Covid patients from outside the city, like neighbouring states of Haryana, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. But now, there is nothing on paper on these lines. “We don’t not have any system of beds’ reservation for any state. Though we see a lot of patients from Punjab as they are referred from the state, there are no fixed quotas,” said Prof Ram. In Mohali, major hospitals have run out of the Covid beds with 100% occupancy. The district is left with just a handful of L2-L3 beds at government hospitals. However, deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said they have around 200 beds at their disposal to be set up at Chandigarh University. Just 15% Covid beds are vacant. The district hospital has the highest 60% Covid bed capacity, out of which 50 have been occupied under L-2 category, whereas no bed has been occupied under L-3 category. Dayalan said, “All Covid beds in private hospitals are occupied and we are left with some 15% empty beds at government hospital. We already have Chandigarh University with 200-bed capacity, which can be upgraded to 1,000.” The district hospital with 100 beds has 60 beds for L-2 and L-3 category and 50 are occupied. In Fortis hospital, there is a total capacity of 340 beds, with 170 for L-2 and L-3 category after 50% reservation, but all the beds are occupied. In SGHS, Sohana, the total capacity is 235 out of which 118 were made available after 50% reservation. Eighteen beds are vacant there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/crisis-looms-as-hospitals-near-the-breaking-point/articleshow/82246338.cms||Shimona Kanwar

He was 63 and is survived by his wife, son and daughter. Born on May 5, 1958, Shantanagoudar breathed his last late on Saturday evening in the ICU of Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon. His body was flown to Bengaluru, where the Karnataka government accorded him a state funeral. He was buried as per the practices of the Lingayat Hindu community. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday condoled the death of Justice Shantanagoudar. In his condolence message, Vijayan remembered him as a judge who had made his own unique contributions to the field of justice delivery. The chief minister also said Justice Shantanagoudar had maintained a cordial relationship with lawyers and fellow judges and played a leading role in the courts. CJI N V Ramana, who had been helping out in the treatment of Justice Shantanagoudar for quite some time, expressed grief at the judge’s death. “I was hoping for his speedy and complete recovery and his return to the bench at the earliest. The news of his passing has come as a rude shock. I have lost a valued colleague,” he said. “In the last four years of my association with him in the SC, I have benefited immensely from his amazing legal acumen,” he added. He spoke to Justice Shantanagoudar’s son and offered condolences to the bereaved family on his behalf and on behalf of SC judges. With Justice Shantanagoudar’s death, the SC now has 27 judges against a sanctioned strength of 34 judges, including the CJI. Justice Shantanagoudar had enrolled as an advocate in 1980 and quickly built a good practice in civil and criminal cases. He was appointed as a judge of Karnataka HC on May 12, 2003. He was appointed chief justice of Kerala HC on September 22, 2016, and was appointed to the SC on February 17, 2017. Justice Shantanagoudar is the 13th SC judge, including two CJIs, to die in harness.

---||Chandigarh||Panic over beds, lifesaving drugs||Chandigarh: Besides oxygen, attendants of Covid patients across the state have been making SoS calls for beds and Remdesivir injections for the past two days. This is despite CM Manohar Lal Khattar’s instructions to health authorities to ensure availability of sufficient beds and medicines, acquisition of more beds in private hospitals and creation of more oxygen beds in PGIMS Rohtak and medical colleges. Food and Drug Administration department has been asked to monitor supply and consumption of Remdesivir injections from both depots of Haryana. Contrary to the claims of health minister Anil Vij as well as the chief minister’s office about strict monitoring and judicious distribution of vials, attendants are running from pillar to post to get injectables. Similar is the case of availability of oxygen beds and ICU beds. Worst hit districts are Faridabad, Gurgaon, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Panchkula and Yamunanagar. “Since Friday evening, doctors here have been asking for the injection. We asked hospital authorities, approached the civil surgeon as well as DC office but to no avail. Now, we are trying from other districts,” said Neha, a resident of Karnal, whose mother has been diagnosed with lung infection and is admitted in a private hospital. Nishant, attendant of a Yamunanagar-based woman looking for an oxygen bed or a bed with byepap facility said, “Initially, they asked for home isolation. As oxygen level dipped, they advised us for hospitalisation but there is no facility in civil hospital and no private hospital is ready to accept for want of reference from government authorities. Now we have arranged an oxygen liquidator and search for bed is on.” N K Ahuja, FDA, chief claimed that supply of injections had been streamlined. “Procurement at depots and further supply from dealer and retailer is being monitored. Increased cases might have led to panic buying, else this chain is under control,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/panic-over-beds-lifesaving-drugs/articleshow/82248404.cms||---

The total weight of the seized ganja was 280 kg and the team also seized two cell phones. The two accused have been identified as Tulasiram, 32, a resident of Govindpur thanda in Zaheerabad mandal and B Tukaram, 21, a resident of Ramatheertha village in Nyalkal mandal .“During interrogation, the accused confessed to transporting the ganja from Odisha to Zaheerabad. The value of the seized ganja is about Rs 50 lakh in the grey market,” excise inspector Mohan Kumar said. Investigators are analysing the messages and calls on the seized cell phones to identify the other accused involved in the ganja peddling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sleuths-bust-ganja-racket-seize-contraband-worth-rs-50l/articleshow/82247230.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana government sitting on ACB request to attach properties of IMS fraud kingpin||HYDERABAD: It has been almost a year since Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) wrote to the government asking for permission to initiate proceedings to attach the properties of multi-crore Insurance Medical Services (IMS) fraud accused Dr Ch Devika Rani and her husband Gurumurthy. Though the government granted authorization for three other accused involved in the IMS fraud, it has so far not given the nod to initiate proceedings to attach properties of the former IMS director and her family members. ACB had written to the labour employment training & factories department between June and July 2020, seeking permission to move an application in the court for attachment of properties against four accused in the IMS fraud-related cases. One of the letters was seeking permission to initiate proceedings to attach properties of former IMS director Devika Rani and her family members, including her husband Gurumurthy. “We had cited assets worth over Rs 15 crore, whose market value would be over Rs 100 crore. However, the government is yet to give an authorization. We have received authorizations to initiate proceedings against three other accused,” an ACB official said. It is learnt that ACB has also sent a few reminders to the government seeking authorization to initiate proceedings to attach the alleged disproportionate assets, including a villa at Sheikpet, a flat at Somajiguda, three flats at Sheikpet, a multi-storied building at Tirupati, independent house in Rajendranagar, 11 plots in Telangana and AP, 32.85 acre agricultural land in seven places of Telangana, 16 shops in Hyderabad, an independent house in Vizag, security deposits in construction company and other items, all worth over Rs 100 crore. While government has not accorded authorization to ACB in relation to Devika Rani’s assets, GOs were issued authorising the agency to initiate proceedings before the court to attach properties of other accused, Omni Medi proprietor K Srihari Babu and his family (Rs 162 crore), IMS joint director K Padma (Rs 8.5 crore) and K Nagalakshmi, pharmacist of ESI hospitals (Rs 2.7 crore) between August 2020 and September 2020. Despite repeated attempts, labour minister Ch Malla Reddy, did not respond to calls or message from TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/government-sitting-on-acb-request-to-attach-properties-of-ims-fraud-kingpin/articleshow/82248431.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||India||India approves Asean effort to resolve Myanmar crisis||NEW DELHI: India on Sunday gave a thumbs up to the Asean’s new steps to help Myanmar resolve its political crisis. An Asean leaders’ meeting on Saturday took the most proactive step thus far by appointing a special envoy to work towards some kind of political dialogue. In a statement, the MEA welcomed the Asean initiative and said, “Our diplomatic engagement with Myanmar will be aimed at strengthening these efforts.” Asean has come under a lot of criticism for looking the other way while a coup was effected under its nose. The sustained violence and the military junta’s targeting of Myanmar citizens — over 700 have been killed in military crackdowns — has given the impression that Asean is toothless. “India as a friend of the people of Myanmar, will continue to play a constructive and meaningful role aimed at resolving the current situation in Myanmar. India’s support to the democratic process in Myanmar remains steadfast,” the MEA said. According to reports, Myanmar army chief Min Aung Hlaing has given his approval to participate in the Asean-led dialogue.  A statement after the Asean summit on Saturday called for an “immediate cessation of violence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-approves-asean-effort-to-resolve-myanmar-crisis/articleshow/82249770.cms||---

Hailstorms were also reported in parts of Kalavad taluka of Jamnagar district. The unseasonal rain with gushing wind took the people of Saurashtra and South Gujarat by surprise amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Such was the intensity of the winds that a pandal, erected for patients awaiting admission to the Rajkot Civil Hospital (RCH), was blown away. The administration had installed the pandal at the Choudhary High School ground to give respite to the patients from the scorching heat. “Luckily no one was injured. There were four ambulances waiting under the temporary shelter when the pandal crashed down due to strong winds,” informed a source. Unseasonal rains were reported from Rajkot, Surendranagar, Morbi, Amreli and Jamnagar district of Saurashtra. The parts of south Gujarat also witnessed wet spells on Sunday evening. Unseasonal rains also lashed areas of Dharampur, Kaprada and Pardi of Valsad district. The mango orchard owners of these regions were left worried about the damage to their crop just days before the harvest. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), Ahmedabad bulletin attributed the sudden wet spell to the cyclonic circulation over southeast Rajasthan. IMD has also predicted light rains or thunderstorms at isolated places in Rajkot, Amreli, Gir-Somnath and Kutch districts till April 29. Temperatures are also expected to rise within the next 2-3 days, IMD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/hailstorm-rain-lash-part-of-saurashtra/articleshow/82246363.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Poor migrant workers return to Mumbai, find ration card suspended||MUMBAI: Poor migrants who returned to their villages during the first lockdown and did not avail of subsidised or free foodgrains from the public distribution system in Mumbai and across Maharashtra for nearly five months have had their ration cards suspended. With jobs gone and the lockdown becoming more restrictive, these migrants face a food crisis. Shiv Sena MLA Sunil Prabhu from Dindoshi in a letter to food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal has urged the immediate restoration of all such suspended ration cards to prevent a humanitarian crisis. “I immediately directed the food and civil supplies secretary to ensure nobody who comes to a ration shop for foodgrains will be turned away. If foodgrains are not distributed, it comes back to the government. What will the government do with it? Only those who really need it come to a ration shop and we will make sure they get it,” said Bhujbal. Vishnu Sawant, husband of Sena corporator Vinaya Sawant from Appapada, predominantly a slum area in Dindoshi, first raised the issue with Prabhu. Sawant, who is the Shiv Sena Vidhan Sabha sanghatak, said the migrants returned nearly five months later. “When they found their ration cards suspended they approached us and we in turn approached the shop owner. They directed us to the ration officer, who said the consumers must submit their KYC afresh — Aadhaar card and electricity bills — for verification. Some did, others are yet to do it,” Sawant said. Sawant said for the past few months those whose cards have been suspended have been paying the shop owner or purchasing from the open market. “But owing to the restrictions there are no jobs and no money. We want the government to restore all ration cards at once,” he said. Officials from the controller of rationing said during the lockdown when people were not picking up the grains several ration shop owners sold foodgrains in the black market, with the result that the food and civil supplies department suspended all these ration cards. Activist Ulka Mahajan said instead of suspending ration cards the government should have suspended licences of these shops. “There is a PIL in the Supreme Court over the cancellation of three crore ration cards and the apex court has stayed it. We shall take up the suspension issue with the government,” she said. Kailash Pagare, director, controller of rationing, Mumbai and Thane, said all ration officials have been asked to immediately report on the number of ration cards suspended. Officials have been directed to inform residents to come to the ration shop with their Aadhaar card and ration card when queuing up for rations. FCS officials said around 2,400 cards have been suspended in Dindoshi assembly constituency and these will be restored. Another 1,000 have been suspended in Wadala and Ghatkopar. Officials said cards had been suspended across the state and while the government had issued a GR for a fresh verification of all ration cards, the exercise had to be suspended on account of the second Covid wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-poor-migrant-workers-return-to-city-find-ration-card-suspended/articleshow/82248442.cms||Clara Lewis

In a recent review meeting with marketing department and other officials concerned, civil supplies corporation chairman Mareddy Srinivas Reddy said that the procurement centres would be opened based on the arrival of agricultural produce. The district administration would set up centres based on the local demand, he said. Stating that procurement centres were set up in large numbers in the districts of Nizamabad, Suryapet, Kamareddy and Khammam, he said nearly two lakh metric tonnes of paddy was procured. Procurement centres were being set up in other districts in tune with arrival of paddy stocks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/not-even-50-procurement-centres-opened/articleshow/82247232.cms||---
---||Delhi||Oxygen crisis yet to blow over for Delhi’s hospitals||NEW DELHI: It’s been a week since hospitals in Delhi began facing oxygen scarcity, with even deaths resulting. But on Monday, many hospitals, including Jaipur Golden where 20 people died due to low oxygen pressure, were still having a difficult time with replenishments. Dr D K Baluja, medical director, Jaipur Golden Hospital, said, “We have called our supplier numerous times, but there’s no response. We have gas to last only till 7pm — and this after having already seen a tragedy in our hospital.” Baluja claimed the hospital was supposed to receive new stocks, but it was uncertain whether the vendor had sent out the oxygen tanker. “If the vehicle has started out, we don’t know its dispatch number and details,” he said. Indian Spinal Injuries Centre in Vasant Kunj is another major hospital weighed down by the crisis. The hospital stock was restored a bit on Sunday, but adequate supply and refilling on time was necessary for smooth functioning. Dr K Preetham, chief of medical administration, said, “For seven days, most of us haven’t even slept. Because of the scarcity, we are forced to put two patients on one cylinder and this is a time-consuming process because we don’t have long tubes.” Preetham said the current problem was the uncertainly about refilling of oxygen cylinders. “It takes us 8-10 hours for refill cylinders in Panipat. The other day we had to wait outside the Mundka plant for 28 hours for a refill. On top of this, there is acute shortage of cylinders too,” he said. The hospital bundled cylinders into ambulances and sent to various places in the city, only to find most with ‘No oxygen available’ notices hung outside. “If there can be doorstep delivery of foot and rations, why not oxygen?” he asked. “We waste our time thinking on how to arrange or send out vans and ambulance while our workers stand outside refilling stations for hours and hours,” said Preetham. The hospital hasn’t been admitting new patients unless they are in critical condition due to lack of the gas. Saroj Super Specialty Hospital in Rohini has supply till Tuesday morning and is hoping to receive more cylinders from the government. However, it has not dared take in any new patients for four days now. “The cycle is constant, but we had a meeting on Monday evening and are hoping things will be streamlined from Tuesday. Since we are wary about the shortage of oxygen, we have not admitted new patients recently,” said Dr P K Bhardwaj, chief executive director and head of surgery, Saroj Hospital. Several hospitals met government officials on Monday evening. “We requested the government to set up a digital platform to ease our contact with it,” said a doctor participant. “Till now, there is only one nodal officer for the entire city and so, we have asked the government to include more such officers to enable hospitals call up one with their requirements. A plan has been chalked out with a set limit for various hospitals which will be discussed on Tuesday.” Some other hospitals beset with supply problems recently testified to receiving consistent supply now and faring better than earlier. At Shanti Mukund Hospital, which faced a gas crunch last week, the replenishments have been regular. It got its Monday quota too. Himachal Pradesh to supply oxygen to DelhiAt a time when Delhi is witnessing an acute shortage of oxygen, Himachal Pradesh has responded to the distress call of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and assured emergency supplies of oxygen to the capital from the hill state. After chief minister Jai Ram Thakur agreed to supply oxygen to Delhi, Kejriwal tweeted his heartfelt thanks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/oxygen-crisis-yet-to-blow-over-for-citys-hospitals/articleshow/82264916.cms||---

---||Kochi||Separate strategy for guest worker accommodation||Kochi: Even as the Covid caseload in the district has been steadily going up, only 307 guest workers have tested positive for the virus in one month (from March 22 to April 24). NGOs working for the welfare of guest workers said the number of infected persons among them will increase manifold if they are subjected to mass testing. But questions are raised about the preparedness of the authorities to provide accommodation to those who are likely to turn positive among them. Labour department officials said they are in discussions with national health mission to set up facilities for accommodating the guest workers who test positive for the virus. The officials said the infection among the guest workers is not spreading as fast as it did during the first coronavirus wave. "The national health mission is preparing a separate strategy for guest workers in Ernakulam. A lot many of them who work in companies and construction sites tested positive for the virus in September and October last year, and we managed the crisis well. Such a situation has not arisen now. Not many among them have respiratory illness nor do they require oxygen," said an official with labour department. Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development, an NGO working for guest workers, said it is looking for a facility to lodge the workers who are likely to be advised to go on quarantine as most of them live in cramped conditions. "When we look for a building to lodge those who test positive, the owners often demand a huge amount as rent. Those labourers who do not have an employer to attend to their needs are likely to face more problems," said Benoy Peter, executive director of CMID.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/separate-strategy-for-guest-worker-accommodation/articleshow/82247239.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Only words, no action in ramping up infra at GMSH||CHANDIGARH: If meetings and statements could help in fighting coronavirus, the city stood a mighty good chance of winning the battle! That is probably all it did since the pandemic upended life rather than focusing on ramping up infrastructure in one of its major medical centres— Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16. Thirteen months on, facilities like Covid testing and the number of ICU beds remain the same. Just how seriously the UT took the virus that has now gone out of control, here is a comparison. Before the start of the pandemic, both General Hospital, Sector 6, Panchkula, and GMSH-16, were in the same position — no testing facilities. Panchkula used to send its samples to Karnal, while GMSH relied on PGI. Now: Panchkula has managed to set up its own Covid testing laboratory, conducting around 2,000 tests daily, while GMSH is still dependent on PGI. The administration has not taken any steps to start a laboratory to get quick results. Sources said private laboratories are taking majority of samples and GMSH hardly a few. Here is another shocker. Not a single ICU bed has increased in GMSH since six were set up following the directions of Punjab and Haryana high court around two years back in 2019. The Panchkula hospital has 36 ICU beds, out of which 18 are dedicated for Covid-19 patients. It is 300-bed hospital with 230 beds only for Covid patients. On the other hand, GMSH has 500 beds, but has kept around just 200 for Covid patients. If that is not enough, the administration has refused to share information about oxygen beds and other related information with the media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/only-words-no-action-in-ramping-up-infra-at-gmsh/articleshow/82246357.cms||Deepak Yadav

As part of the procedure, Ashim Das, 40, from Assam having B positive blood, received a kidney from his wife who has A positive blood. “Transplantation across blood groups is complex as antibodies that reject the donor organ must be completely removed or made dormant before the transplant. We managed to gradually reduce such antibodies in this patient and neutralised antibodies by giving medications. This process took almost two weeks and reduced anti-donor antibodies considerably in the patient,” said Dr E Ravi, nephrologist and transplant physician, KIMS Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/docs-perform-rare-kidney-transplant/articleshow/82247237.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was 63 and is survived by his wife, son and daughter. Born on May 5, 1958, Shantanagoudar breathed his last late on Saturday evening in the intensive care unit of Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon. His body was flown to Bengaluru, where the Karnataka government accorded him a state funeral. He was buried as per the practices of the Lingayat Hindu community. CJI N V Ramana, who had been helping out in the treatment of Justice Shantanagoudar for quite some time, expressed grief at the judge’s death. “I was hoping for his speedy and complete recovery and his return to the bench at the earliest. The news of his passing has come as a rude shock. I have lost a valued colleague,” he said. “In the last four years of my association with him in the SC, I have benefited immensely from his amazing legal acumen,” he added. The CJI spoke to Justice Shantanagoudar’s son and offered condolences to the bereaved family on his behalf and on behalf of apex court judges. With Justice Shantanagoudar's death, the SC now has 27 judges against a sanctioned strength of 34 judges, including the CJI. Justice Shantanagoudar had enrolled as an advocate in 1980 and quickly built a good practice in civil and criminal cases. He was appointed as a judge of Karnataka HC on May 12, 2003. He was appointed chief justice of Kerala HC on September 22, 2016, and was appointed to the SC on February 17, 2017. Justice Shantanagoudar is the 13th SC judge, including two CJIs, to die in harness. The first one was the first CJI, Harilal Jekisundas Kania, on November 6, 1951. The other CJI who died in office was Sabyasachi Mukherjee on September 25, 1990. The judges who died in office are Ghulam Hasan (1954), P Govinda Menon (1957), P Satyanarayan Raju (1966), S C Roy (1971), A K Mukherjea (1973), S N Dwivedi (1974), S M Fazal Ali (1985), R C Patnaik (1992), Yogeshwar Dayal (1994), M Srinivasan (2000) and Shantanagoudar (2021).

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: No one to place ‘infected body’ on pyres, no priests, no closure for kin at cremation ground||DEHRADUN: The hospital at Roorkee told them they were not equipped to look after Naresh Chopra, a Covid-19 patient who needed oxygen. Private hospitals in Dehradun did not have any beds. Then, they thought they’d try their luck at a government hospital. In the two hours it takes to get from Jhabrera to Dehradun, Chopra died. But the ordeal did not end there. When his family went to the Raipur crematorium, the staff there refused to touch his body since the body was not wrapped in PPE. “I had to place my father’s body on the pyre myself. I couldn't get Ganga jal to put in my father’s mouth. We couldn’t even get a cremation shroud for him. The cremation ground didn’t have any and the market was shut because of the lockdown,” said Nita Chopra, his daughter. Chopra was initially diagnosed with typhoid. “Later, he got Covid-19. Doctors at the hospital in Roorkee told us on Sunday morning that he had to be taken to a higher centre with oxygen and ICU beds. We called up several hospitals in Dehradun but didn’t get any bed,” his brother Satish Chopra said, adding, “We took him to the Government Doon Medical College. As a government institution, we thought, they might admit him. But in the two-hour journey, he stopped breathing. He was declared dead at the hospital when we got there.” Ashok Dandriyal went through a similar ordeal. His sister-in-law had been at the Military Hospital for 10 days with a Covid-19 infection. Her family had tested positive too. When she passed away, just four from her family — her husband, two sons and brother-in-law — could take her to the cremation ground. “We were told by the cremation ground staff that we had to lift the heavy wooden logs on our own and make the pyre. After waiting for three hours, the body seemed so heavy that we had to practically drag it to the pyre. We cremated the body in the PPE and could not even get a plain white cloth to cover it,” he said. Funerals, with their rituals, mark a sense of closure after a death. But many families whose loved ones died after testing Covid-positive are being denied that. Like Sanjay Sharma, whose mother died during treatment for Covid-19 at a private hospital when she got up to go to the washroom and her oxygen level plummeted. The hospital had not given her a catheter. “She died because of a mistake,” said Ashutosh Kapoor, a family member who took Sanjay and his younger sibling to the cremation ground. Once there, they could not perform the rituals. “There was no priest. We asked some kids to bring two logs of wood and lit the pyre ourselves,” said Kapoor. “When we asked for help, we were rudely refused.” Raipur MLA Umesh Sharma Kau said he, too, had heard of such lapses at the Raipur cremation ground. “I saw people covering the pyres of their loved ones on Saturday when it began raining. I have requested the CM to intervene,” he added. Staff at the Raipur cremation ground, where all three families had gone, declined to comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-one-to-place-infected-body-on-pyres-no-priests-no-closure-for-kin-at-cremation-ground/articleshow/82245900.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Hyderabad||33-year-old hacked to death by husband in Kandukur||Hyderabad: A 33-year-old woman was hacked to death by her husband, who was allegedly drunk in Kandukur on Saturday night. Police said that Saramma got married to Mahender, a labourer, nearly 15 years ago and they have two children. Mahender, allegedly an alcoholic, is accused of harassing his wife and assaulting her. On Saturday, he came to their house in a drunken condition and allegedly beat her. On hearing the commotion, their two children woke up. The accused, Mahender, took both the children to another room and locked them by putting a latch. Later, the accused attacked the victim with an axe and killed her. Meanwhile, the two children raised an alarm by shouting through the window. On hearing their cries, Venkamma, who resides in the neighbourhood, reached out to the children, who informed that their mother faced a threat to her life.

The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA), which is the nodal agency to establish the centre, has made adequate facilities for the patients at the campus situated in Beelwa, Tonk Road, approximately 24km away from the city. But the authorities are waiting for oxygen containers to arrive at the centre An official said, ‘In the first phase, 500 medical surgical unit beds have been made available in the Covid care centre. The campus of RSSB is spread over an area of 10.12 lakh square feet where a facility of 8,000 beds can be developed.” On Sunday, before making the centre operational, preparations were made considering the unprecedented surge in coronavirus cases. The centre will have provision for control room, help desk, out patients department, parking for ambulances and others. An official source said, “The JDA had earlier announced to run the centre on Sunday. However, one more day was provided to make arrangements.” At the centre, the JDA has developed facilities like toilets, power, fans, circuit television cameras among others. The RSSB management would provide drinking water, tea, breakfast to the patients and attendants at the centre.

The administration also deputed three RAS officers and 80 employees to maintain record of oxygen supply and keep track of wastage. Around 800 oxygen cylinders reached Ajmer from Jaipur and were kept in JLN Hospital. But the situation has not improved in Ajmer even after the weeklong lockdown and two weekend curfews. On April 1, there were 90 positive patients and on April 17, at the time of first weekend curfew, there were 347 Covid patients. On April 22, the patient count crossed 600 in addition to several deaths. With rise in cases, testing and samplings have increased in the city with patients reaching the emergency ward of JLN Hospital. Hospital superintendent Dr Anil Jain said the facilty was well-equipped to treat Covid patients and only those who are in serious condition were being admitted in ICUs. Collector Prakash Rajpurohit on Sunday directed all zone commanders to enquire about the condition of positive patients who have been home quarantined. The collector also went out with his team in different areas. The teams also checked whether families of those infected were getting food. Vegetable markets, grocery shops and milk booths were forced to close down at 11am by police and challans were issued to those violating Covid guidelines. Even petrol pumps were closed at noon and there were very few passengers at bus stand and railway station. The timings of all banks from Monday will be from 10am to 2pm. The order will remain effective till May 15. Officials said this arrangement had been made to prevent crowding. On other hand, Ajmer North MLA Vasudev Devnani on Sunday visited Panchsheel health dispensary and Covid care centre.

The latter currently has 15 corporators and is one of the largest civic wards compared to B ward which covers areas of Mohammed Ali Road and Dongri but has only two corporators representing it.The BMC has converted the boys’ hostel into a 280- bed Covid care centre-2 for mild symptomatic and asymptomatic positive patients while the ladies’ hostel is going to be used to house the medical staff that would be required to cater to the patients kept in quarantine. Considering no physical classes are being taken at the institute that has moved on to online sessions, IIP authorities said that they were willing to offer their facility. K East ward has reported as many as 400 cases in a single day during the current second wave.Assistant municipal commissioner of the K East ward Prashant Sapkale said that currently they have two CCC2 facilities but they are not able to house all patients. “We then decided to use the hostel buildings of IIP. These already have the infrastructure—mainly beds—that are needed for patients and we managed to convert them into a quarantine in a matter of 72 hours,” said Sapkale.He added that the Dr Tanweer Alam, director of IIP, offered his own bungalow to their staff to stay. The BMC has so far moved 50 patients into the facility. Alarge number of frontline workers reside in K East ward, with Marol police camp, Marol and Majas bus depots locatedwithin the ward. Many of them have got infected while at work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-andheri-hostel-bldgs-turn-into-covid-care-facilities/articleshow/82248494.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Surat||Methylene blue as an alternative treatment for Covid patients||Surat: While scarcity of life-saving injection including remdesivir and tocilizumab have kept Covid patients and their relatives in tenterhooks, doctors treating infected patients are also prescribing methylene blue injections. “The oxygen carrying capacity of red blood cells increases after being administered methylene blue. We used it last year too during the first wave and are prescribing this time as well because we are seeing good results,” said Dr Umesh Shah who treats Covid patients at a private multispecialty hospital in Adajan. Usually methylene blue is being administered by doctors to patients having mild to moderate symptoms. It is used for methemoglobinemia, a condition of elevated methemoglobin wherein the oxygen is not carried to the tissues. Doctors claim that methylene blue is a century-old blood pressure booster and was even used as an anti-malarial drug. It is mostly prescribed when oxygen saturation level among patients reduces. Doctors claim that those patients who are admitted in the hospital can be administered methylene blue intravenously and those who are in quarantine at home can be prescribed oral medication. “Patients who have kidney ailments, G6PD deficiency and pregnant ladies should not take it. Other patients not having any comorbidities and suffering from Covid-19 can be prescribed methylene blue,” said Dr Hemant Patel, a general physician practising for over three decades now.“It has anti-viral property so it kills the virus inside the body and is more effective on patients who have mild symptoms,” said Dr Mahesh Sutariya, a critical care specialist. Some doctors, however, stop prescribing methylene blue for Covid treatment. “We used to administer methylene blue last year when we were trying to find out which medicines are more effective in coronavirus treatment but we could not find any direct relation which said that methylene blue treated it,” said Dr Nimal Choraria, convenor of IMA Covid Action Committee. Earlier, in September 2020 during the peak of pandemic last year, AIIMS-Delhi and the Union health ministry had come out with a document strictly detailing drugs not to be used in treatment of Covid-19 patients. The list included use of antifibrotics such as pirfenidone (to prevent lung fibrosis) and methylene blue, an oxidation-reduction agent, as these were not "medicines for which robust scientific evidence is available".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/methylene-blue-as-an-alternative-treatment-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82246473.cms||Jay Pachchigar

The DIG suspended assistant sub-inspector, Malayinkeezhu police station, Harish for canvassing and distributing slips supporting the UDF candidate. The DIG also suspended senior civil police officer of Neyyattinkara police station Ajith on similar charges, for canvassing on the social media for the LDF candidate. The actions of both the officers were noted a day before the polling and they were removed from the duty places. A preliminary inquiry was ordered by DIG Thiruvananthapuram range on the same day. The district police chief (Thiruvananthapuram Rural) conducted the inquiry and submitted his report in five days. In his report, the district police chief said that both the police officers were canvassing for the respective political parties. On the basis of the report, the DIG suspended both the officers with immediate effect and also ordered an oral inquiry into the matter. The officers were suspended citing that their actions were in gross violation of model code of conduct and unbecoming of a police officer.

---||Goa||Al Rayyan equalise in final minute to deny FC Goa famous win in AFC Champions League||Margao: Jorge Ortiz kept shaking his head. He was named the Player-of-the-Match, yet could hardly believe how this ended. Dheeraj Singh fell to the ground, dejected, despite making a terrific last-minute save to hand FC Goa another point in the AFC Champions League. When Goa played Al Rayyan and secured a goalless draw in the group opener, fans cheered lustily. The teams met again and finished 1-1 at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Monday night, but nobody celebrated. This could have so easily been a memorable night for Indian football. Goa led through Jorge Ortiz’s third-minute strike against the eight-time Qatar Stars League champions. But with less than a minute of regulation time left on the clock, Ali Ferydoon, the Kuwait-born Iranian striker, equalised for Al Rayyan. The draw leaves Goa in third spot with three points, while Al Rayyan are at the bottom with two points, thanks to their draws against the debutants. Juan Ferrando reverted to his strongest squad, the same that played the opener against Al Rayyan, and Goa looked game for the challenge. It took just three minutes for Goa to open their account, and it was all thanks to a wonderful ball from Brandon Fernandes. The midfielder, who has created all of India’s international goals in the last 18 months, was at it again, this time spraying a long ball that caught the Al Rayyan defence napping. With Brandon smartly playing it long, Ortiz made an excellent run behind the defence. His first attempt – after a fumble from defender Yousif Umar – hit the onrushing goalkeeper’s chest, but the Spanish forward still managed to slot the ball home with his left foot, before Shojae Khalilzadeh could clear. Not surprisingly, the goal stunned Al Rayyan, who have kept just one clean sheet – opener against Goa – in 18 matches. The Qatar side coached by France World Cup winner Laurent Blanc pushed hard with captain Yacine Brahimi and Yohan Boli a constant threat. Boli had an immediate chance as he drove into the box past James Donachie but Dheeraj proved equal to the task with a timely save. Towards the closing stages of the first half, the Goa goalkeeper denied the Ivory Coast forward again, this time from a free-kick. Goa knew Al Rayyan would try even harder in the second half, but they surprisingly had chances of their own on the counter. Glan Martins’ attempt sailed inches over the crossbar from just outside the box and Devendra Murgaonkar missed his footing, even as Seriton Fernandes continued to torment the visitors with his runs on the right. Goa were defending well with centre-backs, Donachie and Ivan Gonzalez, in full flow. But they conceded in the final minute of play. Abdulaziz Hatem was allowed time and space on the left to deliver the ball into the box from the byline. Goalkeeper Dheeraj thought he collected the ball, but spilled it, only for Farydoon to hammer it inside an empty goal and save his team a major embarrassment. When the referee blew the final whistle, Al Rayyan heaved a sigh of relief. Goa were reduced to tears. How the tables have turned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/al-rayyan-equalise-in-final-minute-to-deny-fc-goa-famous-win-in-afc-champions-league/articleshow/82264909.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The control room has received 287 calls till Sunday afternoon, with an average of 100 calls per day. Assistant collector (first) Arshdeep Brar was appointed overall in-charge of the control room, whose numbers are 0141-2205175 and0141-2205176. District-level officers are appointed in three shifts for this control room - from 6am to 2pm, 2pm to 10pm and 10pm to 6am. “Over 50% of the calls we receive at the control room are to enquire about availability of hospital beds and oxygen cylinders. There is a huge demand for these two things in the city. The real-time data about availability of beds in the hospitals is regularly getting updated at the control room. Therefore, as and when we get a call with a demand for bed, we guide the caller depending on the ‘occupancy and vacancy’ updated on the list of hospitals,” Brar told TOI. “We also guide them to the government or private hospital in the nearby areas (closer to their residences). We also call up the hospitals to ensure that there is no shortage or crisis of oxygen cylinders or supply of oxygen. There is a challenge with regard to availability of oxygen in the hospitals. That’s why we list out the names of hospitals where both beds and oxygen are available and direct the patients to the right path,” she added. Brar further said, “We also guide the patients in the right direction who require remdisivir injections following the standard procedure.” Box Joint action against black-marketing of essential items JAIPUR: The officials of food department, legal metrology and food safety officers will carry out joint action against traders found to be involved in black-marketing in the supply of essential items to the consumers, said food and civil supplies department secretary Naveen Jain.

---||Jaipur||Stalled work on oxygen plants resumes in Jodhpur hospitals||JODHPUR: The Covid-19 crisis has prompted the SN Medical College administration to resume the stalled work on oxygen plants, which were sanctioned over six months ago. Three such plants with capacity of 250 cylinders each had been proposed under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), one each at MDM, MG and Umaid Hospitals, but the work did not progress except half-construction of platforms. Now, with the crisis for oxygen deepening, the medical college administration has pushed for atleast one plant at MDM Hospital in order to meet the growing pressure of oxygen for Covid. “We have started the process of setting up at least one oxygen generation plant at MDM Hospital under NRHM considering the pressure at the hospital,” said principal S S Rathore. Under the scheme, the medical college administration was expected to provide land and build foundation while the machines had to be provided by the central government. Covid-19 Incharge for MDM Hospital, Vikas Rajpurohit said that the work on construction of the foundation for this plant has already started and they would be in position to launch it as soon as the generation unit reached. “We are ready with the preparations on our part and we expect to receive the unit in the next 3-4 days,” Rajpurohit said. This one plant, however, will be able to produce gas equal to 250 cylinders per day and if all the three plants would have been ready by now, oxygen requirement from all the plants put together would have been equal to 750 cylinders per day. Admitting a huge pressure on oxygen, Rajpurohit said that the current requirement at MDM Hospital is hovering between 1,200-1,500 cylinders per day. Considering this, the 250-cylinder unit will be abjectly inadequate, but will, to some extent, help in doing away with the dependency of the hospital for gas on other sources. It may be noted that MDM Hospital will be kept reserved for serious Covid patients given the space and availability of resources here. The hospital currently has 492 beds available for Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/stalled-work-on-oxygen-plants-resumes-in-jodhpur/articleshow/82247244.cms||---
---||Delhi||Hindu Rao, 2 other corpn hosps likely to get oxygen plants soon||New Delhi: Facing oxygen shortage at its hospitals, North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Monday got an initial approval from the Centre to set up oxygen plants at Hindu Rao, Rajan Babu and Balak Ram hospitals. The municipal corporation mayor Jai Prakash said the project would be funded by Indian Oil Corporation under its CSR activity, while the plants would be established in 35 to 45 days from the date of approval. Currently, two hospitals have tanks with oxygen capacity of 10,000 and 6,000 cubic metres, which are supplied to beds through pipes. Stating that with new plants the civic body will not have to buy oxygen from outside, Prakash confirmed that files had been sent to the Union ministry, which gave a green signal. “A feasibility study was conducted, and the details were forwarded to the ministry of petroleum and natural gas. The pandemic has made us realise the importance of oxygen plants. The new plants will help strengthen the high dependency units at these hospitals, and hopefully we will be able to increase the number of beds too,”’ he said. The mayor added that a joint survey of the three hospitals with a technical team would be done on Tuesday to finalise the sites for the plants. “We have shared information with the department and will check the status report, following which we will proceed with deciding the project cost and other requirements. The idea is to finalise things soon. We have sufficient space on campuses. If required, will also call representatives from IOC during the survey,” he added. A corporation official said that installing the plants would not take much time once all the NOCs were in place. The civic body has been running Hindu Rao Hospital as 210-bed Covid facility since April 18 and Rajan Babu Institute of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis as 45-bed piped oxygen facility. An oxygen plant has also been planned and approved by the Centre for Swami Dayanand Hospital, said East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Nirmal Jain. “We are not facing a crisis as our officers are regularly contacting suppliers. We have also asked them to invite NGOs, interested people to help in supply of oxygen cylinders till a permanent facility is established,” he added.  Jain said that, at a meeting, the officials were told to prepare a project report, which could be submitted to the Centre. “We will also look forward to a tie-up with some NGO or organisation for establishing the facility, if required,” the mayor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hindu-rao-2-other-corpn-hosps-likely-to-get-oxygen-plants-soon/articleshow/82264932.cms||Vibha Sharma

She got none. The search which began on Saturday morning ended with Prempal’s death in the afternoon. A few hours later, sitting distraught at home amid the sobbing and wailing of her three children, Mamta Rani, 44, readied herself for another daunting search. This one was for a spot in a crematorium in Agra. Again, she got none. The waiting time was more than 24 hours. Mamta told TOI later, “His condition had started deteriorating on Saturday morning. The oxygen level was dipping fast. We did not get an ambulance even after several calls. Then I took him to a private hospital in a taxi with the help of my neighbour and our son. But the hospital staff told me that no bed was available.” She said the situation was the same in other hospitals too. “My husband died at 12:30pm when I reached SN Medical College,” she said. The queue was endless at the crematorium too. “At Agra crematorium, 35 bodies were in the queue for cremation. I was not given any time. Then my relatives called me to Aligarh where they had booked a slot,” she said. Mamta then drove over 90km to reach Aligarh crematorium where Prempal’s last rites were finally conducted on Saturday night. She was not alone to make such an emotionally arduous journey. When contacted, in-charge of the Muktidham cremation ground in Aligarh’s Bannadevi area, Vishnu Kumar Bunty, said, “Many families have come here for cremation of Covid and non-Covid bodies after not getting space in their city. We have started getting bodies from other districts also now.” People from Noida and Delhi are coming here too, he said. Recently, the body of 52-year-old Dubai-based businessman, Hari Om Goyal, who had succumbed to Covid-19 in a Noida’s private hospital, was brought here, the in-charge of the cremation ground said. They came here as no space was available in the cremation ground in Noida, even after waiting for over a day, he said. Goyal’s younger brother Rakesh Goyal, also a businessman, told TOI that his brother got infected on April 11. He died in Noida during treatment within a week. “We contacted the cremation ground there and they asked us to come on April 17 at 7:30am. We reached there on time and waited for over three hours. No one was willing to tell us the exact time when the body will be cremated.

Viewing the number of beds, the health department has constituted two committees at the state-level to ensure proper supply of oxygen to hospitals on time. Currently, 376 hospitals are treating Covid patients in the state. Health minister Raghu Sharma said swasthya mantra helpdesk had started functioning from Sunday where complaints of patients regarding beds, oxygen, ICU and ventilators would be resolved. Anyone can call 0141-2225624 or 2225000 round-the-clock for help. The health department has also increased daily testing. Currently, 81,000 tests are being conducted now. In the state, there are 67 testing labs including 38 government and 29 private labs. Sharma said there is no shortage of oxygen beds, but it depends on its supply from the Centre. “We have received 140 metric tonnes on Sunday, but we require more than 250 metric tonnes. Two teams have been constituted at the state level, which is monitoring the situation of beds and oxygen availability in all the districts,” he added. Besides, the state is receiving 5,000 remdesivir injections daily from the centre. The Centre had allocated 26,500 remdesivir injection for 10 days from April 21 to April 30. But, after health department officials spoke to the Centre, they have agreed to supply 67,000 remdesivir injections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/oxygen-beds-doubled-for-covid-treatment-in-a-year/articleshow/82247251.cms||---

They are also charging hefty amounts for taking bodies of Covid victims to crematoriums. Health department officials now say capping of private ambulances charges is also needed. TOI on Sunday visited various hospitals to know what private ambulances were charging from Covid patients and also for transporting bodies of Covid victims. Though the state government has arranged for free transportation of bodies of Covid victims to crematoriums in addition to free last rites, most people are ignorant about it and are not informed by private hospitals. Also there is a order by district transport officer(DTO) issued on October 1, 2020 in which the prices of private amulances were capped and stated that for first 10 kms they should charge Rs 500, still it has not been complied with. “I lost my father during the early hours. I came at 6.30 am to claim the body. Thereafter, our relatives looked for a private ambulance to transport the body to the crematorium. We were asked to pay Rs 5,000 despite the fact that crematorium was merely 10 km away from the hospital at Jawahar Circle,” said Rameshwar Singh from Aadarsh Nagar crematorium. While talking to relatives of those who lost their kin on Saturday and Sunday, it was learnt that private ambulances are charging Rs 1500 to Rs 6000 to transport the bodies to crematoriums and there was no control on the rates. Also, for bodies to be transported to other parts of Rajasthan, rates were as high as Rs 8,000 to Rs 12,000. ACP (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba said, “In our control room set up to help the public, we are getting calls asking for beds at hospitals, crisis of injections and others. So far people have not approached us on fleecing by private ambulances. If we come across any complaints, we will take action.” Siddhath Mahajan, secretary, medical and health said, “We had capped bed charges, ICU charges and also the charges of life-saving injections. As far as private ambulances are concerned, we too have got such complaints. I will talk to the authorities of the transport department to get it capped too so that people are not fleeced. On the other hand, we have made provisions to transport bodies of Covid victims to crematoriums for free.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ambulances-fleece-kin-of-covid-victims/articleshow/82247256.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Delhi||Delhi: Portal to record oxygen supply, consumption status every 2 hours||NEW DELHI: Amid the oxygen crisis overwhelming the capital’s hospitals, Delhi government has started a portal that will record the status of supply from the manufacturers to the hospitals and that of consumption every two hours.  The portal seeks to ensure that Delhi government gets to know where shortage may occur to divert resources in that direction before any crisis. The hospitals will give their consumption data for the past two hours while the suppliers will disclose how much oxygen was supplied during that period. “Since our oxygen supply is limited, managing what we have is of utmost importance. Efficient management can help save lives,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday. Due to the sudden surge in Covid cases, all hospitals in Delhi, big and small, have been facing an acute oxygen crisis. After 20 Covid patients died in Jaipur Golden Hospital in west Delhi on Friday night due to shortage of oxygen, the Centre on Saturday increased Delhi’s daily oxygen quota from 480 to 490 metric tonne, but the city currently needs 700 metric tonne. In a press conference on Sunday, the chief minister said Delhi had received constant support from the Centre and both governments were working tirelessly to ensure a steady supply of oxygen. But “our daily requirement of oxygen is 700 tonne, and we receive 480 tonne from the central government. On Saturday, the Centre allotted 10 additional tonne, increasing our share to 490 tonnes of oxygen”, Kejriwal said. “However, even this allotment is not reaching Delhi. On Saturday, only 330-335 tonnes of oxygen reached Delhi. As a result, we are receiving only half of what we require, which is a huge impediment in the recovery of Covid-positive patients,” he added. “We are working continuously to ensure oxygen reaches where it is required.” The chief minister underlined that he didn’t claim that all efforts had been successful. “In some cases, we have failed, and in others, we have managed to ensure that oxygen reaches the designated destination,” he said, expressing his “heartfelt gratitude to everyone who is involved in these nightlong efforts”. Saying that the Centre and Delhi government are working tirelessly to ensure a steady supply of oxygen, Kejriwal said Delhi government had received constant support from the Centre. “The coming days should see less confusion and chaos on this matter. We are constantly working to try new avenues of sourcing oxygen over and above what the central government is supplying,” he said. Meanwhile, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday urged hospitals in the capital not to raise alarms unnecessarily over oxygen shortage and appealed to the media to verify such claims before carrying it, reports PTI. Such acts hamper efforts to provide help to hospitals that really need assistance, said Sisodia, who is also the nodal minister for Covid-19 management in Delhi. “This morning, I got an SOS call from a hospital that had 18 kilo litres of oxygen in stock,” he tweeted. The hospital requires 4.8 kl a day and has a storage capacity of 21 kl, meaning it still has three days of supply left, the minister stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/portal-to-record-oxygen-supply-consumption-status-every-2-hrs/articleshow/82248520.cms||AlokKNMishra

Since April 22, a total of 19 hospitals have made available 292 beds for citizens. But a serious problem of arranging oxygen for these new Covid-designated hospitals has cropped up. Senior municipal officials claim that they have been able to gather information on 1,200 cylinders which have been pumped into the existing inventory. All new hospitals that become Covid designated will have to manage the cylinders through this pool. These hospitals are Pooja Hospital in Kankaria, Saffron Hospital near Jashoda fire station, Om Children’s Hospital and Ashirwad Hospital at Gota, SRM Health Care on SG road, Livewell hospital on Drive-in, JP Corporate in Naranpura, Newlife hospital in Akhbarnagar, Devam hospital opposite Sanghavi, Sushrut hospital in Paldi, Sanjeevani Hospital in Nava Vadaj and Prarthana hospital in Krishnanagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/getting-o2-big-task-for-new-hospitals/articleshow/82248510.cms||---

On its way from Hapa to Kalamboli, the train will traverse a distance of 860km. These oxygen tankers were supplied by Reliance Industries, Jamnagar, said railway officials. The officials said that the train will have no crossing and will not be stopped even for passenger trains. To ensure that it gets a clear path, it has been placed in the category of Shatabdi and Rajdhani trains and as it crosses one station it will get the clearance for the next two stations. The railways plans to operate more such trains as and when needed. The officials said that rail transportation will be much quicker than the road option. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/oxygen-exp-leaves-for-maharashtra/articleshow/82248512.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Medical officers told to prioritize Covid-19 treatment of judges, staff||AHMEDABAD: The state health department has informed medical officers of all the districts to give `timely' and `priority' Covid-19 treatment to the judicial officers of district judiciary and court staff as well. The chief personnel officer, health (medical services and medical education) wrote a letter to the state legal department on Saturday informing about directing the medical officers of all districts to give "timely and priority Covid-19 treatment” to judicial officers and court staff. The letter stated that arrangements have been made for coordination and help in Covid-19 treatment for legal officers in all the districts. It also listed out contact details of medical medical officers in all the districts. On basis of this communication, Gujarat high court’s registrar general R K Desai wrote on Saturday evening to all the respective district judges, principal judges of family courts and heads of different courts in Ahmedabad. He informed the heads of all the subordinate courts that all medical officers have been informed by the health department “to make necessary arrangement by coordinating with the principal district judge of the respective district in such a manner that necessary help on the priority basis in the treatment of Covid-19 be provided to judicial officers/staff and retired judicial officers of all the districts”. The registrar general, when contacted, did not comment on the issue. During a hearing last week on a suo motu PIL on the recent surge in Covid-19 cases, the Gujarat High Court Advocates Association (GHAA) had drawn the high court’s attention to the lack of health infrastructure in many districts and how officers of lower judiciary are suffering. Since the lockdown in March end last year, the Gujarat high court and subordinate courts closed courtrooms and started discharging judicial function through video conferencing. After some respite in Covid-19 cases, the HC permitted the lower judiciary to open courtrooms, but the physical hearing was stopped again following the recent surge in Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/med-officers-told-to-prioritize-treatment-of-judges-staff/articleshow/82248516.cms||---

The prevention of crime branch (PCB) recovered three vials of the injection which they were selling at almost 15 times the market price. One of the arrested doctors had purchased six vials from an unidentified person on New Civil Hospital (NCH) campus for Rs 7,000 each. The accused were searching for buyers to sell for Rs 14,000 per vial. Police arrested Dr Hitesh Dabhi and Dr Sahil Ghoghari, Jaimish Jikadra, Bhadresh Nakrani and Jenish Kakadiya. Kakadiya was arrested near Bhagal Cross Road on Saturday night with three vials. During interrogation, he named Bhadresh who was caught from Punagam and later names of other accused were revealed. “Dabhi told police that he went to purchase the injections in NCH when some person came and sold the jab to him. Of the six vials, he used two for his family member and gave four to Ghoghari,” said Sanjay Bhatia, police inspector, PCB.  Police are now trying to verify if Dabhi is telling the truth and who was the person who sold him the vials.  Along with sections of cheating and conspiracy under Indian Penal Code, the accused were booked under relevant sections of The Essential Commodities Act, The Disaster Management Act and The Drugs and Cosmetics Act. The offence is registered in Lalgate Police Station. This is the third remdesivir black marketing racket busted in Surat city over the last one week. In one case, the accused had allegedly filled water in the vaccine bottles and sold them. Before that, 12 injections were recovered from some persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/another-remdesivir-racket-busted-in-surat-5-arrested/articleshow/82246533.cms||---

Elections in Jangipur and Samserganj seats in Murshidabad have been postponed to May 16 following the demise of candidates due to Covid. What is worrying parties is whether the rising pandemic graph will have an impact on voter turnout in the last two phases when the state has witnessed a fairly high poll percentage in the last six rounds. Assembly seats going to the seventh round of polls have a diverse demography. As many as 15 seats spread over Murshidabad and Uttar Malda are those where minorities are a majority. In Malatipur, Ratua, Chanchal, Harishchandrapur, Habibpur and Gazole in Uttar Malda and the nine seats of Farakka, Suti, Raghunathganj, Sagardighi, Lalgola, Bhagabangola, Raninagar, Murshidabad and Nabagram in Murshidabad, the polarisation is likely to go in favour of non-BJP parties. Trinamool and Congress are desperate to bag the major pie of the minority votes. In Sagardighi, Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM is targeting the same population. Abbas Siddique’s ISF is also a contender in Raninagar. BJP can at best hope that the division among minority votes works to its favour. Another important feature is the Murshidabad seats of Suti, Raghunathganj, Lalgola, Bhagabangola and Raninagar, Habibpur seat in Malda and three Dakshin Dinajpur seats of Balurghat, Gangarampur and Tapan all are located along the Indo-Bangladesh border. The Congress vote bank on Adhir Chowdhury’s Murshidabad turf and also in Uttar Malda is at risk because the minorities, insecure as they are, are likely to vote for the party they think would be able to protect themselves. This can make it tough for Congress candidate Mainul Haque, the Congress candidate from Farakka winning the seat since 1996. The situation looks similar for Abu Hena of Congress, winning the Lalgola seat since 1991. It’s again a Congress versus Trinamool battle in Chanchal with BJP eyeing the 30% Hindu votes. Congress is faced with a tough challenge from Trinamool on one hand and Forward Bloc on the other at Harishchandrapur. Trinamool is better placed in Malatipur, which had witnessed an anti-CAA, anti-NRC stir in 2019. BJP is better placed at Gazole though the recent desertions are an advantage for TMC. The BJP is ahead in the race in Habibpur because of its support base among the Adivasis, though a section gathered at chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s recent meeting. BJP has an edge over Trinamool in Dakshin Dinajpur’s Balurghat where the demography is just the reverse. High-profile BJP candidate and economist Ashok Lahiri is contesting from this seat while RSP veteran Biswanath Chowdhury has opted out of the fray. With Chowdhury’s exit from the electoral battle, BJP is banking on a large chunk of RSP voters who might go with it. BJP seniors have been frequenting the nine assembly seats in Paschim Burdwan to consolidate its new-found support in the erstwhile Left bastion. Eyes are also fixed on the Pandaveswar assembly seat from where former Asansol mayor and outgoing MLA Jitendra Tiwari, who dumped Trinamool to join BJP, is contesting. Left Front chairman Biman Bose walked the extra mile for JNUSU president and CPM candidate Aishe Ghosh to win back the Left support the party once enjoyed in this belt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-surge-may-impact-turnout-in-west-bengal-today/articleshow/82249881.cms||---

Though the PWD had informed that it is ready to take over the widening of the road from Kochi corporation four or five years ago, the department hadn’t undertaken the work citing that the local body failed to send a resolution requesting the same. Later, the corporation council passed a resolution requesting the PWD to take over the project and sent the resolution to the government. “The PWD and officials with Kochi corporation conducted a joint inspection prior to the preparation of the DPR. We expect that the project which had been remaining on the paper for decades will gain momentum now,” mayor M Anilkumar told TOI. “We will be taking all proactive measures to see that the project is implemented at the earliest,” he said. The PWD will carry out a lot of work as part of the preparation of the DPR, including drafting a plan for junction improvement. “The agency also plans to conduct a traffic flow survey. The plan for Thammanam Junction improvement also will be part of the DPR,” sources said. After preparing the DPR, talks will be conducted with MLAs representing Thrikkakara and Ernakulam. Negotiation with land owners for facilitating the smooth land acquisition process will be conducted with the help of the MLAs. The width of the road as per the PWD’s initial plan is a minimum of 30m while the corporation is of the stand that the width shouldn’t exceed 22m. “It is after several rounds of talks and negotiations that at least a section of the land owners agreed to surrender their holdings for widening the road to 22m. If the road is to be widened to 30m, land acquisition may be a hard nut for us to crack. That’s why we request the PWD to limit the width of the road to 22m,” sources with Kochi corporation said. At the same time, the PWD wants to increase the width of the road to a minimum of 30m as KIIFB will not provide financial support for “short-term and short-sighted” projects. “Normally, KIIFB provides funding for projects with a long-term vision. If we limit the width of the road to 22m, chances are high for the KIIFB to decline approval for it,” sources said. Once the road widening becomes a reality, it is expected to reduce the traffic snarls in the city to a great extent. There is also a plan to extend the road to the Edapally-Vyttila national highway bypass and connect it to another road proposed from the bypass to Kakkanad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kiifb-likely-to-complete-dpr-for-road-widening-by-june/articleshow/82247300.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

After the autopsy, which was performed on the spot, the body was cremated by his family members near the crime scene. The Vadavalli police, meanwhile, arrested the remaining three accused - N Nandhakumar, 40, of Manapparai in Trichy; S Arulprakash, 33, of Uliyampalayam and P Kapildev, 3, of Kalikkanaickenpalayam - in the case on the day. Police had nabbed the main accused - P Senthilkumar, 38, of Vignesh Nagar at Sundapalayam - on Saturday. All the four were booked under Sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) and 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and remanded in judicial custody on Sunday evening. Police said Senthilkumar was running saloon shop named Green Touch at Dheenampalayam and Kalikkanaickenpalayam. “Kumar was employed with his shop at Dheenampalayam, while Nandhakumar was working at Kalikkanaickanpalayam shop. The two hairdressers were staying in a room behind a chicken shop at Onapalayam.” Few weeks ago, police said, Kumar had joined another saloon shop at Avarampalayam in the city without informing Senthilkumar. When Senthilkumar came to know about this, he asked Kumar to meet him at the chicken shop near his room on April 10. “When they met, Senthilkumar and Nandhakumar assaulted Kumar with a spanner, killing him on the spot. They, along with Arulprakash and Kapildev, later buried the dead body near a stream.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/hairdresser-murder-body-exhumed-3-more-arrested/articleshow/82248521.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Where is med faculty amid Covid battle?||AHMEDABAD: As the state continues to grapple with Covid-19 crisis, a large number of vacant faculty positions in government- and GMERS-run medical colleges with hospital facilities is posing a major challenge to the healthcare department. In all, there are around 900 vacant posts in six-government run medical colleges and nine GMERS colleges in Gujarat. Despite repeated attempts over the past year, the government has managed to fill only a handful of these vacant posts. One of the reasons that few have applied for the posts of full-time professors, associate professors, assistant professors and tutors is that the government began the recruitment drive on an ad-hoc basis and the jobs offered are temporary positions — from six months to 11 months. Also, the government has failed to promote many of the professors for several years now. On March 9, the Gujarat Medical Teachers’ Association, in a representation to deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, who also holds the health portfolio, stated that as against a high court directive for promotion of 400 faculty members by the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC), only 27 got promotions. “These faculty members are very important as frontline Covid warriors in such testing times. Many faculty members are awaiting promotions for about 16 years now. Also, the government’s decision to hire faculty members on an 11-month contract became a detriment,” said a member of the association. In December, the Commissionerate of Health, Medical Services and Medical Education began a recruitment drive for about 494 posts in six government-run medical colleges. These included 68 positions for professors, 109 for associate professors, 216 for assistant professors, and 101 for tutors. The job description called for signing an 11-month contract. “In all 80 candidates had applied. Of these, 30 left midway after they got jobs elsewhere. Today only about 50 positions, representing 10% of the vacant posts, are filled,” said a medical academician aware of the matter. In the state budget earlier this year, the government has allocated a budget outlay of Rs 11,323 crore for the health department. This is about 4.5% of the total state budget outlay for the year 2021-22. In an advertisement last year, the state government had invited applications for 470 vacancies for various faculty positions at the GMERS medical colleges in Sola, Gotri, Valsad, Himmatnagar, Gandhinagar, Patan, Junagadh and Vadnagar. “Only 68 candidates applied. An average of about 30% of the total teaching positions in all GMERS colleges are lying vacant even today,” said sources. This is even as students shell out Rs 3 lakh to Rs 8 lakh per annum for medical education, sources added. The state government’s bid to get super specialty doctors for the Covid care centre at Gujarat University Convention Centre at GMDC grounds has met with lukewarm response too.

---||Chandigarh||Legal fraternity objects to Kunwar’s HC bar assn entry||Chandigarh: After raising questions on the decision of the Punjab and Haryana Bar Council to appoint former IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh as member of the disciplinary committee on the day he registered as an advocate, some of the members of the legal fraternity are of the view that he should not have been given the Punjab and Haryana high court bar association membership. In a letter addressed to the high court bar association’s president, bar association’s treasurer Parampreet Singh Bajwa has urged if Kunwar applies for the membership his application should be rejected on the ground that he has not only tried to degrade the noble profession of advocates but has also raised questions on the functioning of the judicial system. However, if Kunwar wants to practice before the high court he does not necessarily require membership of the bar association as he has been granted license by the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana. Former chairman of the Punjab and Haryana Bar Council Lekh Raj Sharma said, “Once any bar council issues the license to any law graduate, he or she can practice in any court of the country. But after getting a license that advocate needs to clear the All India Bar Examination within two years.” He said that membership of the bar association is not necessarily required to practice in that court. I was needed just to avail other facilities of the bar association like the bar association library or the right of voting or contesting elections of that bar association, he added. “Before joining this esteemed profession of law, Kunwar has used very derogatory remarks about our fellow colleagues in which some senior advocates are also included,” said Bajwa in his letter. He said that Kunwar also raised fingers upon the judicial system and “he tried to teach the Hon’ble court how to work and why the order had not been uploaded on the high court website without knowing the technical defects of the site and he had politicised the matter due to the reason best known to him”. Advocate Bajwa also said in a recent judgment in the Kotkapura police firing case, the high court had also made various observations about Kunwar’s “disreputable character”. The letter further read, “It is clear that Kunwar is not competent to become the member of this esteemed bar association as he had already tried to degrade this noble profession.” Bar Council withdraws Kunwar from disciplinary committee The Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana on Sunday withdrew its earlier decision of co-opting Kunwar as a member of its disciplinary committee while accepting Kunwar’s request. “Some controversy has been reported in the media as well as some complaints have also been received from different advocates that this co-option has been given against section 9 of the Advocates Act, 1961, which is not correct,” reads the decision taken by the bar council. The bar council said, “However, today on April 25, the bar council has received a communication from Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, advocate, that due to some objection published in a section of the media against his co-option, his name from the office of co-opted member bar council may be reconsidered.” Kunwar also mentioned in his letter to the bar council that while he was in police service he remained a co-opted member of the legal education committee of the Bar Council of India, much before joining the legal profession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/legal-fraternity-objects-to-kunwars-hc-bar-assn-entry/articleshow/82248613.cms||---

The order by state health commissioner Jai Prakash Shivahare mentioned that if the doctors fail to report by Monday, an action can be initiated against them under provisions of Epidemics Act. The order is issued for 513 graduates of state-run medical colleges, 136 graduates on bond period from the state-run medical colleges and 593 graduates from GMERS medical colleges. “The state, and country at large, is reeling under unprecedented medical emergency and there is dire requirement of manpower to run the newly-constructed facilities. While physical infrastructure can be created within days, it is not enough without experienced medical professionals. Thus, it’s also an appeal to the students to give their best in these testing times,” said a senior health department official. “We have also brought in doctors under bond period for the Covid duty in 2020.” Officials added that as the students would be getting double the bond period for their Covid duty, they can complete one year period within six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/1242-fresh-mbbs-grads-get-corona-duty/articleshow/82247327.cms||---

Corporates are finding it as an attractive solution to bring down their overheads. Also, if the economy is sluggish, they could move out of a business centre, without any liabilities,” said Monlash Business Centre chief executive Jackson Mathew. A British academic publishing house and the credit card division of one of the largest nationalized banks have decided to leave their own offices and move to Mathew’s business centre. “This trend started just after the first wave of the pandemic, sometime in September,” said Centre A Offices director Joe Francis Alapatt, who introduced the concept of a premium business centre in Kochi. Since then, a French electrical giant and a German pressure-cleaner company moved to Alapatt’s business centre on MG Road. A couple of the existing players have decided to scale up during the pandemic itself. During the third week of April, Incuspaze, a co-working space provider, added 500 seats at their Kakkanad facility, while Vistaara, a similar provider of managed office space, added 12,000 sq ft at their Cannon Shed Road facility. Vistaara CEO P G Gopakumar said that two leading brands in the country — an airline and a credit-card company — moved to his facility, ditching their rented offices. According to Mathew, the concept of business centre or coworking spaces is going to catch up further in Kochi market. “Now there are only five or six organized players in this segment and in the coming years, many might set up facilities here,” he said. When asked whether the corporates are permanently scaling down their operations in Kochi, Incuspaze business partner Sanjay Chatrath said, “The corporates are not scaling down their operations; it is just that due to the pandemic the market has become a little vulnerable. This takes a toll on their businesses, due to which they turn towards coworking spaces to seek more flexible options. We all know the short-term commitments as well as the little investments needed in terms of commercial expenses in the coworking spaces. In such times, these factors make managed offices and coworking spaces a viable solution for several businesses. They provide easy scalability, offer flexible commitments, wider reach, and good facilities even in tier-2 cities”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/coworking-spaces-flourish-in-pandemic/articleshow/82247338.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Agra||Mathura admin caps labour charges for cremation of Covid victims||Agra: In what comes like a relief to the already mourning family members of the people dying from Covid-19, Mathura administration has decided to cap labour charges for cremation of Covid-infected bodies at Rs 2,100. Though, the cost of wood would be charged separately. Confirming this, municipal commissioner of Mathura-Vrindavan corporation Anunay Jha said that the decision was taken in a meeting with members of the committee of cremation grounds in the district after reports of overcharging surfaced across the state. However, no such complaint was received here, Jha claimed. He told TOI that Rs 2,100 would include the labour besides the cost of PPE kits, gloves and sanitiser for persons who would cremate the Covid-infected bodies. However, cost of wood would be charged separately.“Cremation cost of unclaimed bodies and those who can’t afford the price, would be borne by Municipal Corporation upto Rs 5,000. In case, an additional amount is required, the cremation committee will pay.”Jha said that the enforcement of these rules will be supervised by the assistant municipal commissioner and if any worker involved in cremation is found overcharging, legal action will be taken against them. Secretary of Dhruv ghat cremation ground management committee Shashi Bhanu Garg said that Covid bodies are being cremated by a group of youths belonging to the Valmiki community as families are not ready to do it. However, there were reports of overcharging by them. The administration’s decision will curb this practice.Garg told TOI that Maharaja Agrasen Shamshan ghat in Laxminagar is also being prepared for cremation of Covid dead bodies if the situation in town gets worse. “Wood store has been stocked and cremation platforms have been increased to 5 from 3,” he said. There were reports of people charging Rs 12,000 to Rs 24,000 per cremation as compared to the earlier cost of Rs 3,000- Rs 5,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mathura-admin-caps-labour-charges-for-cremation-of-covid-victims/articleshow/82246562.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

They also requested the CJI to urgently hear the Habeas Corpus plea. The letter which was written by MPs-- K Sudhakaran, K Muraleedharan, ET Mohammed Basheer, VK Sreekandan, Ramya Haridas, Benny Behanan, TN Prathapan, Dean Kuriakose, Anto Antony, NK Premachandran, and PV Abdul Wahab-- says, “It is shocking beyond words that such a grave violation of human rights is happening in our India, a democracy.” Kappan and three others were arrested on October 5 last year when they were going to a Hathras village from Delhi to report the alleged gang-rape and murder of the Dalit girl by upper caste youths. Later they were accused of trying to foment disturbance and booked under stringent charges of sedition and UAPA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ensure-humane-treatment-to-journo-kappan-who-is-ailing-chained-to-hospital-cot-kerala-cm-to-yogi/articleshow/82246574.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

While one pillar of the gate was moved on April 17, the other was moved three days later. After the coastal road is done, the pillars of Parsi Gate will be relocated 75 metres northwest of the original location, said a BMC official. “All permissions were secured before moving the pillars,”the official said, adding that the pillars and all material have been preserved safely. Havovi Sukhadwala who had started an online petition to save Parsi Gate said, “Zoroastrians have been paying respects to Avan Yazad (water deity) for over a century at Parsi Gate. Hindus too use this safe access to immerse offerings on Poornima and ashes from Chandanwadi crematorium...” the petition said.

Around 6pm on April 25, Burari government hospital ran out of oxygen and police officers arranged 85 refilled cylinders from a plant in Kanjhawala at 5.30am. Kapil Hospital in Burari ran out of oxygen and five big cylinders were arranged from DTC depot, Rajghat and 25 from Bawana using a green corridor. The 85-year-old father of an inspector was breathless on April 24 as his oxygen levels dipped to 50. The cop then called up ACP Shahdara Rajesh Meena to get his father attended at Shahdara Quarantine-cum-care centre. Within a short time after reaching there, the doctors and para-medics managed to revive him and pushed his oxygen levels to 90%. In the meantime, the patient’s family got a buffer time to arrange for a bed and finally got him admitted to a hospital in Delhi Cantonment. Four hospitals in southwest Delhi sent distress messages about lack of oxygen, following which the police personnel arranged 16 cylinders and filled 17 small ones. Vimhans Hospital, Bansal Hospital, Jeevan Hospital and Delhi Heart and Lungs Hospital were among others that received support from the cops. In North West district, police distributed food, masks and sanitisers to 650 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-take-on-cylinder-supply-duty/articleshow/82264977.cms||---

---||Delhi||CM sends distress signal to top industrialists for O2||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday wrote to prominent industrialists of the country, urging them to support Delhi by providing medical oxygen. Kejriwal said that he would be grateful if the leading industrialists, involved in using or producing oxygen, can help with transporting it in cryogenic tankers in the time of Delhi’s need. In the letter, CM Kejriwal apprised the key industrialists of the oxygen shortage in the capital. “As you are aware, there is a severe shortage of oxygen in Delhi. The capital does not produce any oxygen. Due to an unprecedented rise in Covid cases in the last few days, many hospitals in the capital have run out of it. Daily supplies are woefully short of our requirements,” he wrote. Kejriwal underlined that the central government is also helping in this regard, but the intensity of the spread is so severe that the help is inadequate. “I understand that your organisation either uses, produces or can come in possession of oxygen. I would be grateful if you could provide us any stock, along with cryogenic tankers for its movement. We would also welcome any help in import of cryogenic oxygen tankers from any other country. Kindly treat this as an SOS. I would be personally grateful for your support,” the CM wrote. For almost a week, many hospitals in the city have been sending out SOS messages for oxygen. Such messages have become horrendously common, saying that institutes are left with only few hours of oxygen and dozens of critical patients admitted may lose their life if supply is not ensured before it ends. Delhi is dependent upon other states for oxygen. Recently, the government had accused Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments of blocking oxygen supply meant for the capital. The capital’s oxygen quota has been increased by the Centre, but Delhi government says it is yet to get oxygen as per its demands. On Saturday, Kejriwal had sent an SOS to chief ministers of other states. In a press conference on Sunday, the CM said: “I have written letters to all CMs in the country and asked for aid. If their state or companies in their state have surplus oxygen, we have requested them to divert it to Delhi. The negotiation is on with some states. This is an emergency situation and all of us are working together and hopefully, we will be able to successfully overcome this crisis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-sends-distress-signal-to-top-industrialists-for-o2/articleshow/82248555.cms||AlokKNMishra

A forester said A Thirumoorthy, 26, and V Marisamy, 25, both residents of Kuzhikkadu village near Kalampalayam in Periyanaickenpalayam forest range, had poached a wild boar, which had strayed into a non-cultivatable land near their village on the night of April 22, by using country made bombs. “They shared the meat with their relatives V Kumar, 27, K Vellingiri, 37, M Prasanth, 22, K Velusamy, 50, P Moorthy, 45, A Aravindhkumar, 19, V Kathirvel, 22 and M Gopal, 21, all residents of Kuzhikkadu village, and cooked the same,” the forester said. Periyanaickenpalayam forest range officials and anti-poaching watchers picked up the 10 based on a tip that they had poached a wild boar and shared its meat and registered a case against them on Sunday. “We imposed a fine of Rs 12,500 each on Thirumoorthy and Marisamy, and Rs 3,000 on the remaining eight. We have handed over Thirumoorthy and Marisamy to the Periyanaickenpalayam police to take action against them under the Explosives Act, as they were in possession of three country made bombs.

The government has also started placing orders with companies. Making the announcement on Sunday, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that 3.75 crore people in the 18-45 age group will get the benefit of free Covid jabs. For two doses for the target group, the state government will have to spend Rs 3,000 crore. The decision will help to prevent mortalities in the state due to the virus. The health department is running the vaccination drive efficiently and has taken the state to second position in the country, he said. Health experts at SMS Medical College have claimed that even if those who take vaccines get infected, it would be mild and help in preventing deaths. Gehlot said that he had written to the prime minister urging him to provide free vaccines for those above 18 years just as the Centre had done for those above 45 years so that the financial burden would not fall on the states. But the Centre did not accept the demand. Since the Centre had made a provision of Rs 35,000 crore for Covid vaccination in the Union budget, the states did not do so in their budgets. Now, the Centre has left the responsibility squarely on the states, forcing Rajasthan to reduce funds allocated for development works and social security schemes to provide free vaccination for those in the 18-45 age group. The state has demanded the Centre to provide the jab at Rs 150 per dose, the same amount that the Centre pays to manufacturing firms. But the companies are providing the same vaccine at different rates to Centre, states and private hospitals. Gehlot asked the Centre to intervene in the matter and prevail on the companies to provide vaccines at the same rate for all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/free-vax-for-those-in-18-45-agegroup-3-7cr-to-benefit-in-state/articleshow/82248559.cms||---

Statistics show that as on Friday, 343 patients were admitted under category C. The previous highest number of category C admission was recorded in October — 319. Since then Category C admissions had dropped drastically in the district and touched 112 by March. It was from April 10 that the Category C admissions started increasing rapidly in the district. Between April 10 and 23, the number of Category C admissions nearly tripled in the district and went from 116 to 343. The district, in spite of occasional rise in Covid cases in the past few months, has been able to manage the patient load mainly because Category C admissions were always way below the bed capacity and were always well within the limits. The sharp surge in Category C admissions points at severity of infection, officials said. On the other hand, Category B patient load has been lower than that was recorded during the peak months of September and October. Even with active cases crossing 14,000 in the district, Category B patient admission stood at 365 on Friday whereas it was always above 1,000 in September and October. Patients who have breathlessness, chest pain, drowsiness, fall in blood pressure, haemoptysis (coughing up of blood) and cyanosis (blue discolouration due to poor blood circulation) are grouped under Category C. These are referred to as red flag signs. Children with influenza like illness are also categorised under C if they report high/persistent fever, inability to feed well, convulsions, dyspnoea (respiratory distress), etc. The patient load of Category C is now being equally handled by the medical college hospital (MCH) and private sector. In the earlier months, the MCH used to carry the brunt of Category C and in April, many patients under Category C are resorting to private care. Private hospitals also hold large volume of Category B patients. As on Friday, 41% of Category B patients were being treated in private hospitals in the district. The sharp rise in Category C patients has led to ventilator and ICU occupancy crossing 80%. ICU occupancy in Covid hospitals was 87% as on Friday whereas ventilator occupancy was 82%. The total percentage of active cases in ICU has so far been lesser when compared to previous months. The current percentage of active cases in ICU is in fact half of the total percentage reported in November and December 2020 and even in March 2021. “All those active cases being admitted during these days develop complications in a week or so. The categories are assessed and changed accordingly every 24 hours,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/more-category-c-patients-in-tvm-than-during-1st-wave-peak/articleshow/82247367.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Delhi||DMs told to form spl taskforce to check hoarding of Covid-19 drugs||NEW DELHI: Delhi Disaster Management Authority has asked all district magistrates to constitute a special taskforce to prevent black-marketing and hoarding of life-saving drugs, and for inspecting, checking, raiding and stopping manufacturing of spurious medicines. The drug controllers have also been given similar directions. “Black-marketing and hoarding of the life-saving drugs have become rampant over the past few days, which is creating a shortage in the open market. Therefore, the people of Delhi are facing great difficulties in getting these drugs in time and at the prescribed rates. It is also causing unnecessary delay in timely and effective treatment of the patients,” the DDMA order stated. It underlined that some anti-social elements were involved in manufacturing and supply of spurious drugs under well-known brands, including Remdesivir. TimesViewThose who felt that India had left the days of hoarding and black-marketing far behind were mistaken. During its worst medical crisis in the past 100 years, drugs are being sold at astronomical rates. In some cases, the profiteers have even been nabbed. Constituting a special task force is a good move, although the key lies in its effectivity. There is an urgent need to take stringent action against such culprits.Delhi’s Drugs Controller has been asked to constitute teams to inspect, check, raid and stop manufacture and supply of spurious life-saving drugs. “Drugs Controller shall issue necessary directions to all concerned field functionaries and teams constituted for the purpose for taking strict penal and criminal action against the black-marketeers, hoarders and manufacturers & suppliers of spurious drugs,” the order added. The DMs have been asked to constitute special taskforce with the help of their counterpart district DCPs. The DMs and DCPs have been instructed to issue necessary directions to the field officials. The drugs controller has been asked to submit daily action taken report to principal secretary health and family welfare. The DMs have also been asked to submit a daily action taken report to the office of divisional commissioner, who will send a compiled report to principal secretary health. The principal secretary has been tasked with overall supervision and monitoring of compliance with the directions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dms-told-to-form-spl-taskforce-to-check-hoarding-of-covid-19-drugs/articleshow/82264994.cms||---

Videos of a few candidates having a good time at the resort had gone viral on social media even as the state Congress brass clarified that they had gathered there to firm up post-poll strategies in a quiet setting. But as a senior functionary put it, Rahul's tweet on Sunday put the candidates in an embarrassing situation. "In this crisis, the country needs responsible citizens.

In another case, three people were arrested and seven vials of the drug were recovered. In the first case, the complainant had alleged that online procurement of two doses of the injection cost him Rs 1.16 lakh. DCP (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said a team arrested one of the accused, Sudhir, and recovered two doses of injections. “He disclosed that he had to deliver the drug to a contact for Rs 60,000 for each vial. He also led us to the nurse, who was later arrested,” Tayal said. In another bust, police in south Delhi arrested three men — Likhit Gupta (30), Akash Verma (23), and Anuj Jain (40) — and recovered seven vials of Remdesivir. DCP (south) Atul Thakur said they received a tip-off on Sunday about two men, who were to sell the injections to someone near Indian Habitat Center. “A trap was laid and the accused were intercepted. Four vials of Remdisivir injection were recovered. They were selling the injections for Rs 70,000 each,” Thakur said.

The Saravanampatti police said the body of B Sainath, a native of Jalladiyanpet near Pallikaranai in Kancheepuram district, was first spotted by passers-by, who alerted Chinnavedampatti village administrative officer S R Kalimuthu. “The officer informed us and we sent the dead body to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for postmortem. There weren’t any external injuries on the body. There was a mobile phone in the pocket of his trousers and we contacted his family members,” an investigation officer told TOI. The police officer said Sainath was working as a marketing manager with a construction firm and staying at Ramanathapuram in the city. After the autopsy on Sunday, forensic experts told police that Sainath had sustained an injury to the head and suggested that someone might have attacked him with some object on the head. Police, who had registered a case under Section 174 of the Criminal Code Procedure (unnatural death), are now discussing with the legal experts to alter the case and bring it under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Find Covid bed only via war rooms, parallels spark chaos, says BMC||MUMBAI: The BMC, in a series of tweets late on Saturday, informed citizens of guidelines on how to get a Covid bed at a city hospital. It said that ward war rooms are the only authority to allocate beds, but in exceptional cases, serious patients can approach hospitals for walk-in beds with a Covid- positive report. Using the hashtag, #WarRoomsBattlingCorona, the tweets read, ‘If you need a COVID bed at a hospital in Mumbai, this thread of tweets is for you. If you are promising a bed to someone in need of it, this thread is for you too. With due respect to their concern for their loved ones, we request families to allow doctors to assess patient’s condition and recommend whether an ICU is needed. ICUs are for extreme emergencies. There is now a provision for doctors to visit home and recommend kind of care needed. There are many in need of a bed, as much as the other. Thus, you may have to wait a while. But Ward War Rooms are the only ones who can allocate a bed. If you have a complaint about their service, please escalate. Our humble request. Please don’t create parallel windows for bed allotment because that only leads to chaos and confusion... Please follow MCGM protocols.’ Bandra MLA Zeeshan Siddique who has been helping patients find beds, replied to the civic body said that tweets were in bad taste. “If BMC was doing it all then why would people tag us for help on social media? We appreciate the work the civic body is doing but social workers/activists/influencers/politicians/common citizens-everyone is working together to help the common man. We are all in this together,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-find-covid-bed-only-via-war-rooms-parallels-spark-chaos-says-bmc/articleshow/82248607.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid-down Salt Lake and New Town go for self-help||KOLKATA: With civic authorities in Salt Lake and New Town facing a tough time to tackle the surge in Covid cases and the shortage of vaccines, block committees in Salt Lake, resident welfare associations (RWA) of gated communities and housing blocks in New Town and NGOs have taken up various initiatives on their own, including sanitisation drive in their localities and complexes, helping citizens register and get appointment in Co-Win app and conducting awareness drives in market places. All gated communities and housing blocks in New Town have Covid-affected residents, so the resident welfare associations are taking up sanitisation measures inside their complexes on their own.  “We are conducting sanitisation drive regularly in all the towers of our housing complex, including the lobby and lifts,” said Gobinda Biswas, general secretary of Sunrise Point apartment owners’ association. “Our residents’ association is sanitising the complex regularly. Besides, NKDA is also conducting routine sanitisation,” said Subho Dasgupta, a resident of Moonbeam housing complex. Several gated communities are keeping hand sanitisers at all building blocks for people, especially domestic helps to sanitise their hands before entering. The New Town AE block cultural and social welfare association distributed masks and soaps to adjacent block residents, community market, traders and pedestrians on Sunday along with conducting awareness drive on the necessity to follow the Covid safety protocols. The New Town Forum and News (NTFN), a local NGO, conducted a registration camp at the Biswas Bangla gate’s unbox café from 6pm to 8pm on Sunday, helping citizens register in the Co-win app. Several residents complained that they were facing problems to register and get appointment through Co-Win app and that appointments were getting cancelled. “Our volunteers are guiding people on phone to get registered and appointments in the Co-Win App,” said NTFN chairperson, Samaresh Das. In neighbouring Salt Lake, where several hundreds are getting Covid-affected every day, the AE Block Samaj Kalyan Sangha conducted a sanitisation drive in their locality on Sunday. “We have been conducting the drive by getting the spraying machine and disinfectant with our own funds,” said a block committee member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-down-salt-lake-and-new-town-go-for-self-help/articleshow/82247493.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||India||213 Bengal poll meetings got EC Covid axe on Saturday||NEW DELHI: As many as 213 poll meetings and rallies — of almost all political parties including Trinamool Congress, BJP, CPM and Congress — were cancelled on April 24 across four poll-bound districts in West Bengal over violations or fear of violation of Covid protocols. This is a huge jump over 94 such cancellations till April 23 in the same districts. The cancellations, an Election Commission functionary told TOI, were done either suo motu by the organisers of these meetings/rallies or ordered by the district administration in deference to the EC’s order on April 21 in which it had said that violation of Covid protocols — first issued by the poll panel on August 21, 2020, and reiterated on February 26 and April 9, before being revised on April 16 — by political parties and candidates would invite immediate cancellation of permission for further campaign. On April 22, in another order, the EC had disallowed rallies and public meetings with more than 500 participants. Interestingly, 218 of the 307 cancellations (71%) till April 24 were in Birbhum alone. In fact, 158 meetings/rallies were cancelled in Birbhum just on April 24. As per other statistics cited in a report submitted to the EC on the action taken by district authorities in poll-bound Malda, Paschim Bardhaman, Birbhum, Dakshin Dinajpur, Murshidabad and Kolkata South against violation of Covid norms, 111 show-cause notices were served to various parties till April 24 over violation of EC directives. Of these, 17 notices were issued to different parties in Malda, seven in Paschim Bardhaman, 33 in Birbhum, 37 in Dakshin Dinajpur and 17 in Murshidabad. The show-cause notices issued to Trinamool and BJP matched in number. Also, 75 FIRs were lodged by district authorities under Section 51(b) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code till April 24. While 47 FIRs were lodged in Birbhum, 17 cases were filed in Murshidabad, four in Dakshin Dinajpur, three each in Malda and Paschim Bardhaman and one in Kolkata South. The parties against whom the cases have been lodged include Trinamool, BJP, Congress, CPM, RSMP and Independents. The cancellations by the organisers may be explained by their reluctance to carry on with the rallies with a much-shrunk capacity and, in some cases, their decision to opt for virtual rallies instead of physical meetings. Some meetings were cancelled by district authorities in view of the failure of the political party or candidate organising the meeting to adhere to Covid norms that, as per the April 21 order of EC, require leaders and candidates to demonstrate by personal example and nudge all supporters at the beginning of the rally to wear masks, use sanitisers and maintain social distance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/213-bengal-poll-meetings-got-ec-covid-axe-on-saturday/articleshow/82249921.cms||Bharti Jain

He is likely to be remanded in judicial custody on Monday. The Thadagam police identified the accused as S Vinoth alias Karuppaiah, of Sevagampatti village in Pudukkottai. He was residing in a rental house at Pannimadai near Thudiyalur along with his wife and daughter. According to an investigation officer, Vinoth plotted the robbery after he came to know the elderly woman was residing alone. “He entered her house on the night of April 17, strangled her to death and later raped her. He then decamped with 10 grams of gold ornaments and a mobile phone.” Police didn’t suspect rape in the beginning. However, during the autopsy, doctors found traces of semen in the woman’s private part.

The capital is facing an acute shortage of the pharmaceutical drug. The arrested men have been identified as Alok Tyagi, a resident of Hapur; Abhishek from Ghaziabad and Somel Gupta, a resident of Noida. According to police, the men were selling Remdesivir injections at Rs 40,000 each. During the raid, the cops seized three Remdesivir injections, Rs 1,20,000 in cash, 100 oximeters and 48 small oxygen cylinders. It is being probed how many injections the men had procured and sold till now. The identity of the person who provided them with these injections is also being ascertained. A special investigation unit had intercepted the three accused men when they were travelling in a Brezza car. On searching the car, oxymeters and small oxygen cylinders were found. “A case has been registered against the men. We are investigating further into the source for the injections and other paraphernalia. The car has been seized,” a senior officer said.

---||Chandigarh||Finally, Centre allocates 5k Remdesivir vials to city||Chandigarh: The Centre has allocated 5,000 Remdesivir injections to Chandigarh in its second phase of interim allocation to states and UTs In the first phase, no Remdesivir was allocated to Chandigarh. The administration on April 16 had written a letter to Cipla Limited and requested for 5,000 Remdesivir vials. Sources said the health department officials had raised the issue after the first phase before UT administrator V P Singh Badnore and MP Kirron Kher to push the matter before the central government. Sources said the health department has not received the injections yet. UT administrator V P Singh Badnore has already issued instructions to health department and drug controller to keep a check on hoarding and selling of life saving medicines at higher prices. If anybody found doing this, the strict action should be initiated against the violators, the administrator had directed UT health department. The ministry of health and family welfare in their communication to states and UTs had said these allocations were "interim", made for the period from April 21 to April 30. As there is shortage of Remdesivir and doctors in private and government hospitals writing this medicine in prescription for Covid patient, there is huge demand for this injection. Meanwhile, the administration is also working to find out a legal way to utilise 3,000 antiviral Remdesivir injections seized from the premises of a Baddi-based pharmaceutical company in connection with an illegal deal recently. Sources said the administration has asked the police department to look into the possibilities, which can allow it to use these antiviral injections, which are already out of stock. A stock of 3,000 Remdesivir injections was seized following the arrest of six persons, including the director of Health Biotech Limited pharma company, recently. Doctors at PGI feel that some private doctors are prescribing Remdesivir indiscriminately and people out of fear are hoarding oxygen cylinders and Remdesivir at home, when it is for hospital stay only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/finally-centre-allocates-5k-remdesivir-vials-to-city/articleshow/82243565.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

During the lockdown in March last year, Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, chairman of the IHA Foundation, was approached by Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s top brass to arrange langar (food) for the people who were kept at the temporary shelters in the city. Since then the foundation has been continuously serving people, irrespective of any caste and creed. “The temporary shelters were set up in the areas where beggars, rag pickers and others living on the streets were quarantined. In each shelter, there were around 400 people in the areas like Kalighat, Bowbazar, Dover Lane, Paikpara and others. We started holding langars the next day after receiving requests from the KMC. From one thousand people, we started serving almost 10,000 people every day,” said Ahluwalia. He added that even the migrant workers, who were stuck in the city, were served food. “After some days, we realized that it was difficult for people to reach a particular place where the langar was held. So, we developed the concept of Langar on Wheels that reached the districts like Howrah and South 24 Parganas,” he said.  “The pandemic situation has gone out of control for the last few days. Every other phone call is related to some sort of medical help. We shall continue to help the needy people. We are assisting people outside hospitals, bus stands, railway stations and slums,” said Ahluwalia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/langar-on-wheels-feeds-25-lakh-over-last-one-year/articleshow/82247667.cms||---

So when a citizen showed how responsible she had been by refusing to throw a birthday bash for her friends, the Police responded with a sweet gesture. They surprised her with a birthday cake, delivered right to her doorstep. Ever since the state government announced restrictions on movement, the Mumbai Police have been inundated with queries from citizens. To a netizen who had posed a question online about driving down from Bhandup to Kandivali to meet his friend, the police replied that ‘a friend who respects taking precautions during Covid is a friend indeed.’ Another netizen, Samata Patil, read this conversation and responded to it with a screenshot of a WhatsApp chat between her and her friends. It was Patil's birthday and her friends had been asking for a party, but she had advised them to stay home safe as everything was under lockdown. The police messaged Patil and asked for her contact details so they could appreciate her responsible behaviour. To her complete surprise, the cops sent her a cake with the words ‘responsible citizen’ etched on it so that she wouldn’t miss going out for a celebration with her friends. On April 22, an overjoyed Patil tweeted pictures explaining the series of events and said that the police's gesture made her day. “Your safe celebration today will surely help the city bring in a happy tomorrow. We wish you a happy birthday once again,” the police tweeted back. In another incident, a citizen messaged the police on social media about a dialysis patient from Trombay who had been observing all pandemic related precautions and deserved having a surprise treat at home on her birthday. The Trombay police promptly reacted by visiting the patient, Neena Mailare, with a cake and flowers. Mailare, who has been on dialysis for six years, couldn't stop smiling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-gift-responsible-citizens-birthday-cake-for-staying-home/articleshow/82248640.cms||---

In our age of technology, if served to the needy, at the right time can help thousands navigate this pandemic,” says Ruhani Dalal, 23 a web designer, who teamed up with her school friend Radhe Shah, 23, an MBBS, last Sunday to set up a website, covidahmedabad.in, in two days, to put all available information on Covid management for citizens in Ahmedabad. Basic information like real time bed availability status, availability of oxygen cylinders, tocilizumab, remdesivir, networks and linkages for home services, counselling people on how to recognise early sign of disease and Covid management at home are provided. “All numbers and contacts on our website are verified a number of times in a day by 48 volunteers who have joined this effort. We provide real time linkages to the right people,” says Dalal. She adds, “If people get this basic information, they will know how to navigate. It has been a humbling experience for all of us 50 volunteers. We found that if we could manage the logistics to ensure three to four cylinders per patient and an hourly update on bed availability, we could have eased people’s difficulty,” believes Dalal. Another effort that has gained traction are WhatsApp groups, that have a set of volunteers like Satish Desai, a pharmacist from Naranpura, who makes almost 100 calls a day to verify information on bed availability in hospitals and brings out a fresh list on the group. “I am not the only one making calls. There are 25 more people. We are trying to maintain a real time data on oxygen suppliers, kits that can help families manage the patient at home for a few hours till 108 comes to pick up,” says Desai. Another 22-year-old, Shiv Thakkar and his three brothers from Harij town in Patan district, have been nicknamed the oxygen men. The Thakkar brothers specialise in handling all logistics related to oxygen cylinders, blood plasma requirement, tiffin service and even rushing people to nearby district Covid-designated hospitals and even running Covid awareness drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tech-kindness-young-covid-volunteers-show-the-way/articleshow/82247670.cms||---

Telangana is now among the top five states in the country for vaccine administration. On Friday, the state had administered two lakh doses followed by another 1.9 lakh jabs on Saturday. Over 40 lakh doses have been administered so far. In Hyderabad, over 5.7 lakh doses have been administered. Analysis shows that 10% of the state’s population has taken their first dose while one in every three persons above the age of 60 has been vaccinated. Close to 35 lakh doses of Covishield doses have been administered while a little over 5.8 lakh Covaxin doses have been given. At present, the vaccination rate in the state stands at 6,000 per million a day. Data shows that so far just over five lakh doses of the over 40 lakh administered have been second doses of the vaccine. “Initially there was vaccine hesitancy. We have to understand that those who have taken (the vaccine) may also be infected but the chances of their infection being severe and being hospitalised is very less which is very important to understand in fighting this pandemic. Had we taken doses initially at a faster pace, there would not have a rush now,” said Dr Kiran Madala, an ICMR-certified researcher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-now-among-top-five-for-vax-administration-in-india/articleshow/82247996.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

On Sunday, a total of 8,126 cases and 38 deaths were recorded while the number of active cases stood at 62,929, breaking Saturday’s record of 7,432 cases and 33 deaths. With the latest numbers, the total count of cases so far stands at 3,95,232 while the death toll is 1,999. Taking into account the 3,307 recoveries reported across the state on Sunday, 3,30,304 patients in the state have so far recovered from the coronavirus infection. The number of active cases, which saw a steep jump from 17,791 a fortnight back to nearly 63,000 now, has put a huge burden on the state’s healthcare infrastructure. “Be it the number of oxygen beds, ventilators, commonly used drugs or ambulances, we are getting requests from all around for arranging these. In fact, even hearse vehicles are in short supply,” said the representative of an NGO working with patients. The case fatality rate (CFR) in the state is currently at 0.5%, while the recovery rate continues to drop further. The current recovery rate is 83.57%, down from 98.9% at the beginning of the month — its fastest ever slump. As many as 1,08,602 samples were tested on Sunday. With this, Telangana has completed testing 1.24 crore samples and has reached 3.35 lakh sample testing per million population. The state saw 26 of its 33 districts record over 100 cases on Sunday with Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) recording 1,259 cases, followed by Medchal-Malakajgiri (676), Rangareddy (591 cases) and Sangareddy (201 cases) — together accounting for 2,727 cases in the state count.

On most Sundays, he used to make at least Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000, which was two to three times higher than his earnings on weekdays.But this Sunday, things were different for the likes of him from the Narikurava community (gypsies), as they were forced to stay indoors owing to the complete lockdown.Already hit by the complete lockdown last year, the present move to curb the virus spread comes when things were looking up for them. Many of the community members had resumed their old businesses of selling beads and tattooing, which they had to stop following the complete lockdown, only recently after the government completely relaxed restrictions.E Manikandan, another resident said, “We clock good business only on Sundays, when our customers, who are mainly lower and middle-class people working as weekly or daily wage labourers, will be home. Most of them get their wages on Saturday as well.”Explaining that they had to travel at least 70km to 80km on weekdays to make anywhere between Rs 700 and Rs 1,000, Manikandan said they could earn Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 on Sundays by travelling less distance. “We know we cannot now earn on Sundays and it is going to affect our families. But it is better than the complete lockdown that was in force last year. Most of us are struggling to meet out our daily expenses and we hardly have any savings. We definitely would not be able survive another lockdown.”Another resident, K Chandran, said some of them had been doing business only on three days a week – from Saturday to Monday – as they couldn’t afford to travel for longer distances without any profit. “Now that we have lost one of our busiest days, we have to find an alternative source to make up for the loss.

Those of test positive are more likely to stay under home isolation. Neglecting them at home can lead to sever respiratory problems,” health minister Eatala Rajender said on Sunday. The minister said that Asha workers should check oxygen levels and temperatures of everyone in the household of quarantined patients twice a day. “If there are symptoms of Covid-19, treatment of patients should begin without linking it to testing,” Eatala said. The health minister held a review meeting on Sunday to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the state. He asked officials to monitor treatment being provided to patients in private hospitals. The minister also directed officials to ensure that a check is kept on oxygen requirement of home isolation patients so as to provide them oxygen in a timely manner. He also instructed district-level officials to fill any vacancies among healthcare staff. Eatala stressed that private hospitals are required to intimate government over the number of positive cases in order to provide patients with isolation kits. Insisting on the need to test every symptomatic patient, the minister further said that Telangana has sought more testing kits from the Centre. “...We are setting up government isolation centres for all those who do not have the opportunity to stay at home,” he added. Meanwhile, health secretary SM Rizvi urged people to be vigilant as the number of cases are increasing day by day. “The state is moving forward with the testing, tracking and treatment approach, while the vaccination program runs simultaneously. Everyone with symptoms should get tested,” Rizvi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/officials-told-to-monitor-health-of-those-under-home-isolation/articleshow/82248036.cms||---

The figures were disclosed in a report of the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union on Sunday. The organisation, which comprises cab drivers and delivery executives from various organisations, said that so far four deaths have been reported amongst the workers who have been exposing themselves to the virus while being active on duty. M Kiran Kumar, a 36-year-old cab driver, was among the four people who succumbed to the virus earlier this week. Kumar’s sister, G Surekha said, “My brother has been working as a cab driver for more than a decade. He was the sole bread-winner in the family. There are several people who commute in cabs, and we do not know how and when he was exposed to the virus.” “We first admitted him in a private hospital but since we could not pay the bills, we had to shift him to TIMS in Gachibowli. Neither the government nor the cab company came forward to help us pay the hospital bills or support us in any way till now,” she said. “These workers and their family members who are getting exposed to the virus have no health insurance or any kind of financial assistance from the government nor the companies that hired them. We request the government to advise the app-based companies to provide health insurance and vaccination to these workers and their family members on priority basis,” said Shaik Salauddin, president, Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/495-cab-drivers-delivery-execs-have-tested-positive-for-covid-19-report/articleshow/82248108.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Covid-19 in Telangana: Local variants of virus fueling second wave||HYDERABAD: Local variants of novel coronavirus are fuelling the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in many parts of the country, including Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. This, according to epidemiological data and research studies. While the wild Covid-19 strain from Wuhan in China dominated the first wave of the pandemic in India, strains that have mutated and emerged within the country are dominating the second wave. Epidemiological data shows that local strains or Indian variants are present in more number of positive cases now than the original wild strain that had originated in China in 2019. While the immunity among Indians may have withstood the onslaught of the Wuhan strain, the local variants that are adopted to local conditions with multiple mutations, are causing a spurt in the positivity rate as noticed in several states including Maharashtra, Telangana and AP. A research study by 16 national research bodies including the Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) published in pre-print server BioRxiv on April 24 shows that the continuous increase in positivity could be attributed to signature mutations in the spike protein and functionally significant co-occurring triple mutations in the Indian variants, including the B.1.617 or the so-called double mutant. The researchers, whose focus of study was Maharashtra where B.1.617 is predominant, however, said, “The emergence of such local variants through the accumulation of convergent mutations during the Covid-19 second wave needs to be further investigated for their public health impact in the rest of the country and its possibility of becoming a variant of concern (VoC).” The lineage of B.1.617 has been found to possess common signature mutations (D111D, G142D, L452R, E484Q, D614G and P681R) in the spike protein including within the receptor binding domain (RBD). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 484 and 681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages, the study said adding that the mutations may possibly result in increased binding to the protein (ACE2) and better transmissibility. Consultant for interventional pulmonology and sleep medicine at Yashoda Hospitals, Dr Viswesvaran Balasubramanian, said the double mutant variant is a major cause of concern as it may be more infectious and has the potential to cause severe disease. Although such variant cases of the virus infecting people are negligible in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, it could contribute to increasing infectivity. Head of division for public health nutrition at National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, Dr A Laxmaiah said that over a period of time, the virus mutates continuously and forms new variants, some of which may be more infectious and create more severity. “In fact, we are experiencing the same. Almost over 750 new variants were identified in several countries including in India,” he said. Emergence of new variants with more virulence is responsible for the increase in cases, besides non-adherence to Covid-19 protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/local-variants-of-virus-fuelling-second-wave/articleshow/82247945.cms||Syed Akbar

The decision was taken to rationalize the use of oxygen as the quota for Vadodara has been capped by the state government. Vadodara had been comfortable with both oxygen and ICU beds as people were able to find one after some inquiries. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has now drawn a priority list for supply of oxygen and 164 small hospitals do not find favour in the list. According to a notification issued by officer on special duty (OSD) for Covid-19 Vinod Rao, the government treatment facilities consume 92 metric tonnes (MT) oxygen per day followed by 25 private hospitals with large capacity that consume 35MT per day categorized as Group A hospitals and 50 smaller hospitals that consume around 23MT per day as Group B. The remaining hospitals have been categorized as Group C hospitals. To ensure sufficient oxygen for existing patients and expansion of capacity in large facilities, government hospitals have been asked to reduce consumption by 15% while Group A and Group B have been asked to do so by 10%. Group C hospitals will have to stop admitting new patients needing oxygen. They will be able to admit patients only on their own oxygen concentrators. These hospitals will be able to treat existing patients till discharge. They will also be given a one-time ‘SOS’ stock of oxygen to cater to patients in case they are being referred to higher facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/164-small-covid-hospitals-in-vadodara-left-gasping/articleshow/82246553.cms||---

Speaking to reporters after his visit to the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS), Kishan Reddy claimed that there was not shortage of testing kits, oxygen or medicines in government hospitals. The Union minister of state went on to say that instead of criticising the Union government, the Telangana government should focus on curbing the spread of infection and arranging treatment facilities for people. “Some people, despite testing positive (for Covid-19), are going around by wearing masks. Action should be taken against such people,” he said. Kishan Reddy said that if there was a shortage of funds, the state government should use advance money. He also highlighted that there was a need to recruit more staff at the TIMS hospital. “There are 100 ventilator beds vacant in the hospital,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-shortage-of-kits-or-meds-claims-kishan/articleshow/82248050.cms||---

The key decision was taken by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, and will see the government spend Rs 9 crore on their monthly remuneration. KCR directed district collectors to organise a special recruitment drive keeping in view the emergency situation, conduct interviews, and finish the appointment process in five days. The government also accorded permission for filling-up of contractual services (doctors) through the district selection committee headed by the district collector by walk-in-interviews and for filling-up of outsourcing services through already empanelled agencies. All doctors to be hired on contract basis for a period of three months or whatever time required for extending medical care, will comprise civil assistant surgeons of anaesthesia (27) general medicine (17), pulmonary medicine (6), GDMO MBBS (16), and staff nurses 212 and 28 lab technicians to be hired on outsourcing basis. Among these include assistant professors, anaesthesia (32), general medicine (25), pulmonary medicine (21), staff nurses (315) and lab technicians (56). These doctors, nurses and lab technicians have been allotted to various district hospitals and medical colleges, including Osmania medical College, Gandhi medical College, Kakatiya medical college, GMC Siddipet, GMC Nalgonda, GMC Suryapet, GMC Nizamabad, GMC Mahbubnagar, RIMS Adilabad, Govt ENT Hospital and Govt ENT hospital, Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital, Govt general and Chest Hospital, Institute of Mental Health, MGM Hospital, Govt TB and CD hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-sanctions-750-med-staff-to-counter-covid-surge/articleshow/82248173.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Hyderabad||Case positivity rate near 7.5%, likely to ascend till mid-May||Hyderabad: Case positivity rate in the state has now spiralled beyond the safe range and is likely to increase further till May. The positivity rate had started increasing since the beginning of this month after being well below the one per cent-mark for nearly three months. According to the latest data, the positivity rate was recorded at 7.48 per cent on Sunday, continuing its rise. This number had touched 0.45 per cent on March 14, the lowest since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year. A case positivity rate with three per cent is considered to be a safe limit. However, the recent spiralling of cases has become a cause of concern for authorities. “The current situation may be due to our sharing of state borders with states (with high number of Covid-19 cases) such as Maharashtra, Chattisgarh and Karnataka. The opening up of societies and new variants are responsible for the fast spread of the virus. We are witnessing more cases in border districts near Maharashtra,” said an official from the state health department. Meanwhile, the increased positivity rate means more number of samples are returning positive for every 100 samples tested. This number, as per official figures, increased from 1.49 positives per 100 samples on April 1 to 7.48 positives per 100 on April 25. “It (case positivity rate) will increase further till we will reach the peak and decrease thereafter. As per predictions, India will witness its peak by mid-May and decrease after that,” said in-charge head of department for critical care at Nizamabad Medical College, Dr Kiran Madala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/case-positivity-rate-near-7-5-likely-to-ascend-till-mid-may/articleshow/82248056.cms||Amrita Didyala

He was among the young volunteer blood donors who turned up at a camp in Bhowanipore on Sunday. Many youths like him in the city responded to the call for blood donation. Currently, the state has been reeling under a shortage of blood units. “I have seen my parents donating blood on a regular basis. So the camp organised near my house on Sunday gave me an opportunity to begin my journey as a voluntary blood donor only days after I turn 18,” he said. TOI on April 21 had reported on organisations like Project Life Force (PLF) making an appeal to youths to donate blood in its camp spread over eight locations in the city for three consecutive days that ended on Sunday. “I feel good that I donated blood for the first time and that the unit that I donated could help a patient in need,” said Krishi Lalka, a Class-XII student of DPS School, Ruby Park. “I have a relative who suffers from thalassemia. So, I know how people have to suffer whenever there is a shortage of blood supply. I am happy to have donated blood on Sunday,” said Shalin Vadera, a resident of Hazra. Organised by PLF and others including Lions Blood Bank, Manav Jyot and Bhowanipore Education Society College, 335 blood units were collected during the drive. “We ensured that Covid-19 preventive protocols were followed during the drive.

But, he said, in the wake of this court decision, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh's government was washing away allegations levelled on the Badal family when it came to sacrilege and police firing cases. Cheema said Amarinder, while in power, had done nothing concrete in the case as more than four years had lapsed since Captain's government came to power. “Instead, Captain himself formed a special investigation team and then got a report of the same team quashed in the high court through his advocate general Atul Nanda,” he said. The leader of opposition said all these incidents showed the Congress government in Punjab had colluded with the Badal family. Cheema said Amarinder was completing the term of his government by talking of going to the Supreme Court and was not challenging the high court judgment in the Kotkapura police firing case before a division bench of the high court. Cheema claimed that the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib was carried out under a premeditated conspiracy. He said unidentified police personnel, on the orders of the government, opened fire on Sikhs protesting against the sacrilege incident in which two Sikhs were killed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/court-did-not-give-clean-chit-to-badal-family-cheema/articleshow/82248661.cms||---

Raut, targeting the PM and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, said both are silent on the slowing down of the economy. He said the country needed to be handed over to a Manmohan Singh-like figure during the current crisis. Editor of the party mouthpiece Saamna, Raut through his column ‘Rokhthok’ said, “PM Modi has always said Gujarat is a land of traders… the situation now is that traders are sitting idle.” He said both the PM and FM are silent on the solutions to rebuild the economy. “PM Modi says Mamata Banerjee will definitely lose the elections in WB while union home minister Amit Shah said the Maharashtra government will collapse on its own. These are definitely not the answers to recover from the recession,” said Raut. Citing the example of the US economy in 1930, he said then president Herbert Hoover had failed to anticipate the recession, but Roosevelt who was in the opposition contested the elections and unveiled a successful programme. He won the election and...implemented strategies…I cited an example here, because even we need Manmohan and Roosevelt to bring our economy back on track,” said the Sena mouthpiece.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shed-role-of-tagore-be-a-roosevelt-raut-advice-to-pm/articleshow/82248667.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Chandigarh||No contingency plan, point out experts||Chandigarh: Looking at the condition of Delhi, is the Tricity prepared to handle the second wave of Covid? If public health workers are to be believed, there is no contingency plan and the crisis has already struck. Shortage of antiviral drugs — Remdesivir and Tocilizumab — for severe cases, oxygen cylinders and ICU beds is sending some patients to Punjab to get admission Had these drugs not been kept in a few hospitals, but asked to be issued as per requirement from a centralised agency, things could have been streamlined, experts said. “A central committee consisting of government and private people should procure drugs and distribute as per patient's requirement in a particular hospital according to guidelines issued by AIIMS and WHO,” said Dr R S Bedi, adviser, World Medical Association. He said, “A standard guideline should be issued by convening a meeting of all private and government health facility personnel, so that uniform treatment protocol is implemented.” Despite the absence of most of the drugs in the Tricity, there are patients running around with prescriptions mentioning them. “If Tocilizumab is not available, Bevacizumab has been used in a severe and an uncontrolled fashion like 100 other Covid drugs. They need a randomised trial to prove efficacy,” said Prof Pankaj Malhotra, clinical haematologist, PGI. While the UT administration has yet to devise ways to manage the second wave, doctors feel compartmentalising patient care will not save lives. “We have to save lives and coordinate with the Tricity hospitals for pooling of resources. There can be intensive care specialists taken together from even private hospitals and asked to work jointly. There are so many retired director health services and directors of tertiary care centres settled here. They can be hired as consultants. There is lack of will, not manpower,” said a public health expert. Giving an analogy of war, the expert said, “There is emergency recruitment of soldiers during the war. Why cannot there be such hiring for management of Covid crisis?” Last year, there were hospitals dedicated for mild, moderate and severe Covid cases. Ventilators were taken under PM Cares fund. PPEs and other protective gears were made available for the health care workers. “This time is different as there is no lockdown. The transmission is rapid. We still can have everything on war footing instead of evading the problem,” said a public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-contingency-plan-point-out-experts/articleshow/82245995.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Only MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu, MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Ravneet Bittu have spoken out. Rest of the Congress functionaries are maintaining stoic silence even as attacks on the state government are increasing. Meanwhile, Sidhu is increasing pressure on chief minister Amarinder Singh with direct attacks and only Bittu has questioned back the former cabinet minister. The silence in public maintained by the ministers and most MLAs since the order was pronounced on April 9, is only filled by hushed tone conversations among themselves. Sources in the Congress revealed that most of the MLAs were upset with the performance of state government on the issue.  “They are sharing among themselves the concerns and also the helplessness as they face heat from public and Sikh groups. It is quite apparent on the social media,” said a senior Congress leader. “Full facts must come out as to what led to this situation if the Congress wants to face the people, otherwise our leaders appear defenceless. Akali Dal leaders have gone hammer and tongs against the state government,” said a former minister. “When the high court has raised several questions, former IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh should also answer those specific points,” he added. “Everybody is looking towards the chief minister to see what steps he announces now. The concern among party leaders and cadres is if these steps would be received well by the people. Till a month back, CM appears completely in the saddle even going to the extent of appointment of Prashant Kishor as his principal advisor on his own, showing that he would lead the party in the 2022 elections but in the last fortnight, none from the Congress has come to the defence of the state government. The advisor would also be of little help if state government failed to deliver justice on the issue,” said a party MLA. “Ministers and MLAs are talking among themselves to share their concerns or conveying the feedback from the ground to state party chief Sunil Jakhar. Discontent is brewing and it needs to be addressed,” said another MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kotkapura-congress-silent-but-disquiet-brewing/articleshow/82248668.cms||IP Singh

Some gymnasiums have been conducting online classes along with regular sessions after the government relaxed lockdown restrictions and allowed them to reopen in August. “We learned a lesson the hard way last year. So, this time, we are starting virtual classes straightaway as we do not know how long the restrictions will be in place,” said Nithyanandhini Manoharan, founder of 45 Degree Fitness. “I had stopped virtual classes for local clients three months after the gyms were permitted to function last year. I will soon conduct group classes and personalized training virtually.” Clients of Pink Fitness are making use of an exclusive app that has pre-recorded videos, a representative told TOI. “When gyms are allowed to open, they can use our gym during a certain period depending upon their memberships,” she added. Several customers had migrated from online to offline classes after restrictions were eased, said founder of Bodyzeal Fitworks M Krish Beethovan. “As on last Friday, 30% of my clients continued to attend online classes because of Covid fear. Depending upon their convenience, they can attend either group classes or personalized training from Monday. My trainers will be available to them through phone during working hours.” “As some clients are hesitant to pay fees for online classes, we have fixed a tariff per session. Active members can continue online classes till their membership expires,” Beethovan said. “The number of people joining fitness classes has increased by 40% in the last one year as people are aware about the importance of staying fit during the pandemic times.” Doing workout at gym in front of a trainer is different from doing it at home, said V Vishal, a fitness enthusiast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/gyms-warm-up-for-virtual-sessions/articleshow/82248680.cms||Nivedha Selvam

As Shyam Narain Gupta (74), a Covid-19 patient, gasped for breath at home with blood oxygen level dropping to 81% on Sunday morning, his son Rishabh Gupta, an engineering student, made desperate SOS calls to Integrated Covid Command Control Centre (ICCC) to get a bed in any government or private hospital but failed. “Finally, a non-Covid hospital agreed to admit my father as an emergency case but by the time we reached there, his condition deteriorated and he could not survive,” said an inconsolable Rishabh. Ravi Kumar (70), a multiple myeloma patient, tested Covid-19 positive on April 20. He experienced breathlessness on Saturday. “I went from one hospital to another but all units refused to admit him. Immediate medical attention would have saved his life, but we couldn’t save him despite having all the resources,” said his son Ankit, a research scholar in Lucknow University. AA Ali (70) died at home waiting for a call from ICCC for allotment of a critical care bed for last two days. “Despite using all our resources, we could not get a bed in a private hospital. We contacted the chief medical officer’s (CMO) office on Friday but no help came. He passed away on Sunday morning,” said Ali’s son Ashfaq. The blood oxygen level of SP Srivastava, a resident of Sector A, Mahanagar, dipped to 70% on Sunday evening. However, the family’s SOS to ICCC was not addressed till late night. Family members of Avanti Kumar, 70, who is under treatment at a hospital in Gomtinagar, said his oxygen level dropped to 40 without support and doctors advised that he should be shifted to a ventilator facility. However, no beds were available in any critical care facility. Vivek Singh (54) was admitted to a private hospital in Indiranagar after being diagnosed with Covid-19. However, when his condition deteriorated on April 20, his family sent an SOS to the CMO office requesting that the patient be shifted to a critical care facility. “We are still waiting for a response,” said Vikas, a relative of Vivek. The district administration officers said all efforts were being made to allot beds to patients based on the seriousness of their condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sos-calls-in-vain-patients-die-waiting-for-hospital-admission/articleshow/82248679.cms||Aditi Singh

Additional metropolitan magistrate B H Ghasura pulled up the investigating officer concerned for deliberately neglecting the investigation procedure. The incomplete probe resulted in the acquittal of an accused, with the court extending the benefit of doubt to him. The case involved one Altaf Hussain Vajifdar from Surat district. He was caught at Doha airport while travelling to the UK on the charges of using a fake Italian passport. He was deported and the in-charge immigration officer at SVP International Airport lodged an FIR with the Sardarnagar police station in December 2013. A case was filed for cheating and forgery under IPC sections as well as under the Foreigners (Amendment) Act and the Indian Passport Act. Vajifdar was discharged by the court in 2017 from the offence under the Passport Act because the mandatory prosecution sanction under Section 188 of the CrPC had not been obtained from the authority concerned by Sardarnagar police. The sanction is required because the offence was allegedly committed outside India. A sessions court rejected the government’s revision application against the discharge the next year. The accused was put on trial for the rest of the offences, but the court acquitted him by giving him the benefit of doubt for want of enough evidence. The court felt the evidence could have been gathered had the investigating officer taken the probe in the right direction. The court said that the investigating officer did not obtain prosecution sanction under Section 188 of the CrPC despite the fact that it was mandatory. Moreover, the investigating officer could have brought the evidence on record from Italy under the Centre’s order according to the provisions of Section 189 of the CrPC. But no such effort was evident from the evidence on record, the court said. The court came down heavily on the investigating officer for his carelessness and negligence. The court observed that it appeared he knew about the proceedings under Sections 188 and 189 of the CrPC when the offence is under Section 15 of the Passport Act. The court said: “…but in order to benefit the accused, he deliberately conducted incomplete investigation”. The court ordered the registry to be sent the copy of the order to the DGP and the city police commissioner asking them to train their subordinate cops on how to conduct an investigation in such offences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-slams-cops-for-lax-passport-probe/articleshow/82248683.cms||---

The meeting was crucial because the PM was taking inputs from CMs over how to roll out the Covid management programme. The requirement for vaccines was also discussed with CMs. Mamata Banerjee didn’t bother to attend the meeting. Her ego stood in the way of tackling Covid in Bengal,” Nadda said, turning the tables on the Bengal CM. Nadda pointed to Banerjee’s recent clamour over supply of vaccine and medicines, and said: “How could the CM present data of the daily doses of vaccine if the Centre had not sent them? How can you claim credit for this?” he said. Nadda iterated at the virtual gathering in the Kashipur-Belgachhia constituency that the Modi government had extended the 5kg special rations to 80 crore people across the country, including those in Bengal. “But this time, chal chors of Trinamool can’t take away your rations. BJP is coming to office on May 2 and the state government will distribute rations without cut money,” he said. Nadda futher announced that a BJP government, in its first cabinet meeting, would release the Rs 18,000 arrears for three years to each farmer under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi along with an annual support of Rs 10,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nadda-returns-cms-fire-says-didi-skipped-pm-meet-on-covid/articleshow/82249926.cms||---

---||Delhi||From one crisis to another: Delhi hospitals in panic mode as oxygen supply falters||NEW DELHI: City hospitals continued to gasp for oxygen on Sunday as they struggled to keep patients alive. Through the day, the government and other agencies were flooded with SOSs, warning of an impending doom. The situation was grim for hospitals like Penatamed in Model Town, which had oxygen supply for only 30 minutes at 11am. The hospital had 50 Covid patients and 10 of them were on ventilator support, the management said, adding that all they had got over the past few days was assurances from the administration. Hospital CMO Dr T Haider said that they were being supplied 20-25 cylinders a day against a demand of 100-150 cylinders, and if the situation persisted, they might not be able to save the patients. At 2pm, the hospital stated that it was desperately keeping the patients afloat. Relatives were running from pillar to post to arrange oxygen cylinders at exorbitant rates. In fact, at 1pm, the hospital was making do with 10 cylinders brought in by the relatives. At the time of going to press, officials said that oxygen had not yet reached them. “We are trying to get oxygen for every hour for every hour,” another hospital official added. Delhi government on Sunday said that the capital was still receiving just 335 tonnes of medical oxygen against a daily demand of 700 tonnes. There were similar heart-rending scenes in other hospitals. A day after 20 patients died of lack of oxygen at Rohini’s Jaipur Golden Hospital, the healthcare facility was once again pleading for supply. The hospital was provided 700 litres of emergency top-up by Delhi government around 7.40 pm to keep operating till the delivery time of 9pm promised by the private company. The tanker carrying full supply arrived finally around 9.30pm. Jaipur Golden has 195 Covid patients, 164 of them on oxygen support. “We are being forced to deny admission requests for Covid patients requiring hospital care. The erratic oxygen supply means that we are struggling to provide adequate care to even those already admitted,” an official said. Dr DK Baluja, medical director of the hospital, said they were in constant touch with the authorities and private suppliers. He said the hospital was forever in a panic mode as they were unable to procure the daily quota of 3.6MT at one go. "The authorities have assured us of 900 litres of oxygen every six hours," he said. Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, with 100 patients on oxygen support, said it would not accept more admissions. A notice put up outside the hospital read: "…Will run out of oxygen today. We had timely escalated this impending situation to all authorities and are waiting for promised supply since yesterday." Sir Ganga Ram Hospital found itself in the midst of a severe crisis for the fourth time in the last two days, but the situation was salvaged when oxygen tankers reached with the levels going "alarmingly low". An official said that 3 tonnes of oxygen was supplied by INOX in the evening. "The hospital now has stocks to last till midnight," he added. Shanti Mukund Hospital in east Delhi continued to reel under an acute shortage, with a doctor ruing a rapidly increasing demand and delay in transportation of fresh stocks. "Our requirement has increased to 5,000 litres a day. We produce 1,250 litres daily at an in-house plant, but the remaining supply is often delayed. Our latest refill will last till 9am on Monday," Dr Sunil Saggar told TOI. Dr Saggar said, on average, 30% of the hospital’s in-patients required oxygen support. But the situation is so dire now that this number has shot up to 95%. "Per patient demand has increased from 2-6 litres per minute to 6-10 litres. We need to create green corridors to hasten supply and introduce discipline to control demand," he added. Smaller hospitals were struggling too. Gandhi Hospital in Uttam Nagar, with 60 patients on oxygen supply, sent out an SOS on Saturday night after having "exhausted all options". The facility managed to arrange 70 cylinders from the Mundka oxygen plant at 4am on Sunday. The stock was exhausted by evening. "Emergency SOS Oxygen crisis yet again at Gandhi hospital. Only 30 minutes of supply left. 60 patents life at stake. Please help (sic)," it stated. In east Delhi, Dr Gautam Singh from Sri Ram Singh Hospital & Heart Institute said they had only half an hour of oxygen supply left. "We are trying to arrange oxygen since early in the morning. Our vehicles are stationed in Bawana, Noida, Greater Noida and Faridabad, but we haven’t been able to procure oxygen anywhere. We have 16 patients in ICU and 36 ward patients who are oxygen dependent," Dr Singh pleaded with folded hands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/from-one-crisis-to-another-hosps-in-panic-mode-as-oxygen-supply-falters/articleshow/82248693.cms||Paras Singh

According to the official social media handle of the chief minister of Bihar, a special aircraft arrived from Bihar to ferry the injections. “Hon’ble Chief Minister has ordered to send 14,000 remdesivir medicine from Ahmedabad soon by sending special aircraft,” states the post on the official handle of CMO Bihar. Attempts to reach Dr H G Koshia,commissioner, Gujarat Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA), for comments on the issue did not evoke any response. Earlier this month, a similar consignment of remdesivir was sent to Uttar Pradesh as well. According to stockists, the shortage of remdesivir continues to prevail across Gujarat not just with medicine stockists but private hospitals too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/14000-remdesivir-vials-sent-to-bihar/articleshow/82247780.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Hospital patients breathe easy, but refill queues lengthen||LUCKNOW: The oxygen supply from Bokaro eased some pressure on the Covid facilities in the city, but non-Covid hospitals and individuals continued to grapple with the crisis. Many families are forced to keep Covid-19 patients at home as they could not get oxygen supported beds in hospitals. They have to first arrange for the doctor's prescription required for buying oxygen, then buy a cylinder and line up for refill. Every step in the process is cumbersome and takes hours, they complained. After failing to get admission for his father ailing from Covid-19 in any hospital, Harjeet Singh called several doctors to give him a prescription for oxygen so that he can arrange it to maintain blood oxygen levels of the patient at home. “All refused saying that they cannot write anything without seeing the patient. They were afraid that in case I misused the prescription, the administration will file a case against them. These doctors were also not ready to come home to examine the patient. Finally, a journalist friend helped me in getting a prescription from a private practitioner,” he said. Vishnu Singh, a Telibagh resident, got prescription as he knew several doctors, but while he was standing in the queue outside an oxygen plant at Nadarganj, hoping to get a refill for his 63-year-old father gasping for breath at home, the news of his demise arrived. “My father also had a neuro problem. The cylinder we arranged on Saturday morning finished in the wee hours on Sunday. After failing to get oxygen at refill stations in Alambagh and Chinhat plants, I reached Nadarganj plant at around 4am. Many like me were already standing in the queue. When the plant opened at 7am, employees told us individuals will get the leftover after supplies to hospitals are over. But, by the time, my turn could arrive, my brother called at around 11am to inform me that father is no more,” he said. For some families getting a cylinder was in itself an arduous task. “You need to have a cylinder to get it filled with the oxygen, but I could not find one at any of the agencies in the city. All said that you will have to book, pay in advance and wait for a couple of days. The cost is also staggering – from 10,000 to 50,000 – depending on the size,” said Ganesh Joshi, who arranged a small cylinder for his ailing brother-in-law from an agency in Sitapur with the help of a friend. Some hospitals put the burden of arranging oxygen on the kin of patients. Ambrish Mohanty, a resident of Balaganj, who was standing in the queue at an oxygen plant outside Talkatora for eight hours since early morning said, “A private hospital at Khurramnagar, although non-Covid, agreed to admit my wife as an emergency case, but told me to arrange oxygen.” ADM (East), KP Singh, who is in charge of keeping vigil on oxygen supply in Lucknow, said that after getting reinforcement from Bokaro, covid hospitals in the state capital now have adequate stock for a few days. “The liquid oxygen brought from Bokaro was sent to plants from where after processing the gas was supplied to Covid hospitals. Non-Covid hospitals also have sufficient stock,” he said. Efforts are also underway to meet the requirements of individuals, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hosp-patients-breathe-easy-but-refill-queues-lengthen/articleshow/82248687.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

The residents said that arrangements should have been made for online deliveries of groceries and other essentials if shops were to remain closed. Some of the grocery shop owners claimed that there are hardly any customers during the weekly curfew as people mostly buy groceries during the week and stock milk and other utility goods for the curfew on Saturday and Sunday. Manvendra Singh, a resident of Rajpur road, told TOI, “The shops were shut on both the days forcing people to move out on main roads searching for groceries. If shops in their localities are open it will prevent people from moving out unnecessarily.” Neetu Negi, another resident from Jogiwala, said, “The grocery shops in the localities must be open so that people do not venture out on main roads and defeat the purpose of a curfew. The administration has announced curfew till May 3 and the essential items should be made available in their localities like last year’s lockdown.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/residents-struggle-to-get-basic-necessity-items-due-to-weekend-curfew/articleshow/82246654.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Diploma colleges fear lagging by a semester||AHMEDABAD: Students planning to enroll in diploma studies on the basis of their Class 10 performance this year are likely to be behind schedule by at least one semester. Various private colleges offering diploma courses have raised this concern with the state education department recently. This after the state government decided to postpone board exams for Class 10 and Class 12 students this year amid a huge spike in Covid-19 cases in the state. While the government is yet to announce exam dates, some colleges are of the view that looking at the prevailing crisis in the state it seems unlikely that exams will be held before June. They have also made a representation to the state government on these lines, said a college official in the know of the matter. The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, which had earlier announced that it would hold exams for Class 10 and Class 12 from May 10 and May 25, respectively, will now announce new dates after review of the Covid-19 situation on May 15. “If the exams are taken in June, given that about 12 lakh students are expected this year, it will take another month and a half to declare results. So, admission process for diploma colleges can’t start before August. In this case, admissions are likely to be completed in November-December. By this time, students will be behind schedule by about six months or one semester,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/diploma-colleges-fear-lagging-by-a-semester/articleshow/82247794.cms||---

Compared with the beginning of April, deaths have seen an over 200% jump in the state. The state’s previous single-day high of 773 deaths was recorded just two days before. Maharashtra’s daily case detection saw a marginal dip on Sunday with 66,191 cases reported, down from 67,160 registered on Saturday. For the second day in a row, Mumbai recorded a slide in new cases. The city saw 5,498 new cases after Saturday’s 5,867 detections. In fact, the number of recovery and discharges at 8,478 were more than the new cases registered. Sunday’s tally was the lowest in April that has seen an average addition of 8,000-plus cases through the month. It is also a significant decline from April 4’s high count of 11,206 cases, the highest the city had recorded in both waves. The state caseload has now touched 42,95,027 and the toll has reached 64,760, while Mumbai’s cumulative tally has reached 6,27,644 and deaths have touched 12,790. Active cases in the state reached 6,98,354, including Mumbai’s 75,498. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state’s Covid taskforce said that a significant jump in deaths could mean Maharashtra is heading towards its peak. “In absolute numbers, the deaths are no doubt many. But one must also look at the death rates that are a little over 1%,” he said. He added that delays in seeking care at the right window could become a matter of life and death and hence people must seek medical care at the first hint of symptoms. The positivity rate in the state increased in April from 14.3% on April 1 to 16.68% currently. Mumbai’s positivity rate is around 14% now. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid taskforce, said the city’s testing capacity has reached the maximum level. “But what is important to note is that despite testing in high numbers, we are not seeing that big number of positive cases,” he said. On Sunday, the city tested 40,298 people, though, a dip from the average of 45,000 tests in the first and second weeks. Notably, Solapur district has seen a significant rise, 62 deaths in a day while 1,975 new cases were registered. Active cases in Solapur are nearing a lakh (96,490). A state official said that it could be a cause for concern. “We have seen the rapid progression of the disease in those who are symptomatic. While those are asymptomatic don’t suffer much,” he said. The health department said that of the total 832 deaths reported on Sunday, 360 occurred in 48 hours and 244 in the last week. The remaining 228 are older than a week. Of the total deaths, MMR saw the highest 144 deaths while Pune circle accounted for 141. Only two cities in the state, Mumbai (64) and Nagpur (69), recorded over 60 deaths in 24 hours. Thane city recorded 1,054 positive cases while deaths rose by ten.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/at-832-deaths-in-maharashtra-touch-a-new-high-dip-in-new-cases/articleshow/82248718.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The decision was taken in a meeting by Lucknow divisional commissioner Ranjan Kumar and officiating district magistrate Roshan Jacob on Sunday. Issues like isolation of patients, follow up and increase in number of beds were thoroughly reviewed in the meeting. Talking to TOI, the DM said a 60-bed L1 hospital would start functioning at Mahatma Gandhi Mother and Child Hospital in Chinhat from Monday. She said action would be taken against private hospitals which were seeking referral letter of the chief medical officer (CMO) for admission of Covid-19 patients. “There is no need for referral letter to admit a Covid-19 patient in a private hospital,” she said. She said all government and private hospitals were being logged on to the DSO portal where the medical facilities will fill the details of vacant and occupied beds every day. “People will also be able to check availability of beds for which a public view link is being arranged,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/60-bed-l1-hosp-to-start-ops-in-chinhat-today/articleshow/82248706.cms||---

---||Navi-mumbai||At 832, Covid-19 deaths in Maharashtra touch a new high; dip in new cases||MUMBAI: The country’s hardest hit state, Maharashtra, reported yet another daily record for Covid-19 deaths on Sunday, registering 832 fatalities. Compared with the beginning of April, deaths have seen an over 200% jump in the state. The state’s previous single-day high of 773 deaths was recorded just two days before. Maharashtra’s daily case detection saw a marginal dip on Sunday with 66,191 cases reported, down from 67,160 registered on Saturday. For the second day in a row, Mumbai recorded a slide in new cases. The city saw 5,498 new cases after Saturday’s 5,867 detections. In fact, the number of recovery and discharges at 8,478 were more than the new cases registered. Sunday’s tally was the lowest in April that has seen an average addition of 8,000-plus cases through the month. It is also a significant decline from April 4’s high count of 11,206 cases, the highest the city had recorded in both waves. The state caseload has now touched 42,95,027 and the toll has reached 64,760, while Mumbai’s cumulative tally has reached 6,27,644 and deaths have touched 12,790. Active cases in the state reached 6,98,354, including Mumbai’s 75,498. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state’s Covid taskforce said that a significant jump in deaths could mean Maharashtra is heading towards its peak. “In absolute numbers, the deaths are no doubt many. But one must also look at the death rates that are a little over 1%,” he said. He added that delays in seeking care at the right window could become a matter of life and death and hence people must seek medical care at the first hint of symptoms. The positivity rate in the state increased in April from 14.3% on April 1 to 16.68% currently. Mumbai’s positivity rate is around 14% now. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid taskforce, said the city’s testing capacity has reached the maximum level. “But what is important to note is that despite testing in high numbers, we are not seeing that big number of positive cases,” he said. On Sunday, the city tested 40,298 people, though, a dip from the average of 45,000 tests in the first and second weeks. Notably, Solapur district has seen a significant rise, 62 deaths in a day while 1,975 new cases were registered. Active cases in Solapur are nearing a lakh (96,490). A state official said that it could be a cause for concern. “We have seen the rapid progression of the disease in those who are symptomatic. While those are asymptomatic don’t suffer much,” he said. The health department said that of the total 832 deaths reported on Sunday, 360 occurred in 48 hours and 244 in the last week. The remaining 228 are older than a week. Of the total deaths, MMR saw the highest 144 deaths while Pune circle accounted for 141. Only two cities in the state, Mumbai (64) and Nagpur (69), recorded over 60 deaths in 24 hours. Thane city recorded 1,054 positive cases while deaths rose by ten.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/at-832-deaths-in-maharashtra-touch-a-new-high-dip-in-new-cases/articleshow/82250021.cms||Sumitra Debroy

After him, his family members also tested positive, his elderly grandfather among them. However, he wasn’t able to donate plasma for his grandfather as doctors told him it was too early for him to have developed antibodies. Plasma is extracted from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient and administered to a critical patient so the antibodies in the plasma help them recover. He was also unable to find another donor. Since then, Arya has been raising awareness on social media to get people to donate blood plasma for critical Covid-19 patients. Arya told TOI he had donated plasma for a friend earlier this month and wanted to continue donating. “I got the opportunity to donate plasma this month when my friend was hospitalised after contracting the virus. I did not have any second thoughts, I knew I had to do this. I want to help strangers as well and am willing to donate plasma to whoever might need it,” he said. Arya has also shared his contact on his social media profile, urging people to contact him if they need Oxygen, medicine or meals. Arya said having gone through a harrowing time himself, he wanted to help people fighting the disease. “I was fortunate enough to survive the disease but it was not easy,” he said. “I was initially admitted to Haldwani’s Sushila Tiwari Hospital but we could not pay the charges at a private hospital and the staff there was overburdened, so my family shifted me to a facility in Gurugram. I spent the next couple of days on Oxygen support and finally recovered,” he said. Nainital has consistently recorded one of the highest positivity rates among all districts. On Sunday, 438 of the 1,293 samples collected from the district tested positive for the coronavirus, taking the positivity rate to 33.9% (a 5% positivity rate is considered safe).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/unable-to-get-plasma-for-his-grandfather-covid-19-survivor-now-helps-infected-people-access-plasma/articleshow/82246697.cms||Prashant Jha

Son of a small grocer from the slums of Tajbagh, Khan is the owner of a Rs400 crore worth company. Though the administration has promised to settle his dues, this former autorickshaw driver, who now owns a fleet of 300 trucks, considers the expenditure as his duty-bound donation or ‘zakat’ during the holy month of Ramzan. He has decided not to accept the payment from the government, considering it as his service to humanity. “I can serve the society with my oxygen donations, which would reach across all communities in this crisis time,” he said. “If there is a need, we can also plan airlifting some tankers from Brussels too,” he said. The initiative of Khan, whose rags to riches story is a case study at IIM Ahmedabad, also includes a payment of Rs50 lakh for 116 oxygen concentrators, which he aims to donate to AIIMS, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH). Khan, who manages a network of 2,000 trucks across India with offices in Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan, had to pay three times more to hire two cryogenic gas tankers from Bengaluru urgently. He needed them to transport liquid oxygen from different parts of the country. As high demand for oxygen and increasing death rates started to plague Nagpur, Khan did not stop to bargain down the high price being quoted for the oxygen tankers, and paid over Rs14 lakh for each trip. Featured in TOI’s ‘Nagpur Heroes’, Khan is today voluntarily managing the supply and transportation of medical liquid oxygen on behalf of the district administration and civic body, after Union minister Nitin Gadkari stepped in to salvage the situation. “We have also distributed more than 500 cylinders at different hospitals and another 360 cylinders have been given by the Union minister (Gadkari) for charity,” he said. “Getting tankers is the biggest challenge as of now. I am arranging for tankers from different places and sending them to places like Raipur, Rourkela and Bhilai to get them filled with liquid oxygen for the district and surrounding areas,” said Khan, who employs more than 1,200 persons in his Ashmi Road Carriers Private Limited, which he established around a decade ago. Khan, who attributed his social work to Gadkari, said he has also been sending tankers to Raipur after former CM Devendra Fadnavis made arrangement to source them from two groups in Chhattisgarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/slum-dweller-turned-crorepatis-unique-oxygen-zakat-for-covid-hospitals/articleshow/82247799.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Private Meerut hospital runs out of O2 at midnight, 15 critical patients shifted||MEERUT: A prominent private hospital in the city ran out of oxygen late on Saturday night, causing panic among patients and their family members. Senior administrative officials, including the chief medical officer (CMO), swung into action to arrange for oxygen cylinders. Ambulances were rushed in to transport 15 critical patients to another private hospital in the city. The alert on depleting oxygen at the hospital sent the family members of the patients into a frenzy as several turned up with oxygen cylinders. Later, the administration also managed to ferry 20 cylinders from the plant. According to sources, 173 Covid-infected patients were being treated at the hospital and more than 12 were in a critical condition. “More than 100 patients are on oxygen and that too, high flow. We have already alerted the authorities that in an hour, 17 cylinders are used and we need 409 cylinders every day but we did not get the supply. It is very difficult to work like this. We have been running around the entire day to get the supply,” said Mansi Anand, director of the hospital. The development came hours after state chief minister Yogi Adityanath in a statement, on Saturday evening, claimed there was no shortage of oxygen and ICU beds at hospitals in the state. “There was a shortage of oxygen at the hospital and 15 patients had to be shifted to another facility to bring the situation under control,” said CMO Mohan. Admitting to a short supply of oxygen, he claimed it would take at least one or two days before the oxygen is mobilized and the situation is brought back to normal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/pvt-meerut-hosp-runs-out-of-o2-at-midnight-15-critical-patients-shifted/articleshow/82246699.cms||Piyush Rai
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Hit by Covid pandemic, cottage industry gasping for breath in Bijnor, Amroha||BIJNOR: The lockdown in Delhi and other parts of the country due to the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic has come as a blow to the cottage industries in Bijnor and Amroha. Thousands of artisans involved in the business of weaving, making brushes and dholaks and other handicrafts are now staring at huge losses and a virtual wipe out of their livelihood. Having faced the first wave of the pandemic, the easing of lockdown restrictions in December had ignited hopes of revival. No sooner the artisans had resumed work to fulfill orders that began to trickle in that the second wave of Coronavirus outbreak hit them. In over 100 villages dotting Nahtaur area of UP's Bijnor, the sound of handloom machines was heard in every lane. Most of these looms have now fallen silent. At one time, the sprawling handloom industry of Nahtaur generated an annual turnover of over Rs 250 crore. As demand dipped, the annual turnover declined to Rs 50 crore. Due to the pandemic, it has now shrunk to only Rs 1 crore a year. “All orders have been cancelled by exporters and agents who purchase our products. We used to do a business of Rs 250 crore here in Nahtaur town,” said Nadeem Ahmed, owner of a handloom unit. Ditto is the case of the dholak manufacturing hub in UP’s Amroha district. As dholak manufacturer Sajid Ahmed put it, “Dholak manufacturing got its rhythm back after the first wave of pandemic and orders had started pouring in. The noise of wood being cut into barrel shapes and beats of drum again began to reverberate in the streets of Amroha as the 300-odd dholak-making units resumed work. Now, the situation has gone from bad to worse.” The famed wood handicraft industries of Nagina in Bijnor, selected under the government's “one district, one product” scheme, is now fighting for survival. There are about 20 units having a workforce of 5,000. These industries used to earn about Rs 40 crore in foreign exchange per year through exports. Now, the second wave of Covid-19 has hit demand. Mohammad Ibrahim, a handicraft businessman of Nagina, said exhibition for the sale of handicraft products has been banned. Besides, exports have stopped. Business has dwindled from Rs 250 crore to Rs 25 crore, he said. Work at the 1,200 units making brushes in Sherkot, with an annual turnover of Rs 1,000, has come to a standstill. Unit owners said the supply of raw material -- synthetic fibre, brush hair, roller paint fabric and rollers – imported from China has also come to a halt. Orders have also dried up. The lives of some 40,000 people dependent on the brush industry has been affected. Mohammed Shahnawaz, owner of a brush unit, said, “Last year also, we faced a lot of problems due to the pandemic, which has surfaced again. Our business has collapsed. Now, there are only a handful of buyers for our brushes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/hit-by-covid-pandemic-cottage-industry-gasping-for-breath-in-bijnor-amroha/articleshow/82246704.cms||Harveer Dabas

Four patients, including two from Delhi, admitted to Gurugram’s Kathuria Hospital, died after the facility ran out of oxygen around 2pm. While the hospital management said it kept the district administration in the loop, deputy commissioner Yash Garg said, “Had we been informed, we could’ve helped.” An inquiry has been ordered. In Delhi, the government and other agencies were flooded with distress calls. Jaipur Golden, where 20 patients had died on Saturday, was once again pleading for supply, which it received only later in the night. Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, with 100 patients on oxygen support, said it would stop further admissions. At Ganga Ram, oxygen tankers reached when levels were alarmingly low. Gurugram’s Metro Hospital received supply after it flagged that it was on its “last leg of medical oxygen”. 8 die as hosps in Gurugram , Rewari run out of O2 supplyEight Covid patients — four in Gurugram and four in Rewari — who were on oxygen support in two private hospitals died on Sunday after the facilities ran out of supply. In Gurugram, officials at Kathuria Hospital, Khandsa Road, said they had informed the district administration about the shortage but did not get any help. “ All four patients were on oxygen support and there was no supply,” said Dr AK Kathuria, the hospital's owner. He added that at 2pm on Sunday, the hospital ran out of oxygen. While two of the patients were from Gurugram, the other two were from Delhi. Asked about the hospital’s request, Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said they did not know about the shortage at the facility. “We have not been informed about the crisis at the hospital. We will investigate the matter. We have oxygen in store and if we had been informed, we could have helped them,” Garg said. Later at night, he ordered an inquiry, which will be carried out by the SDM of Gurugram, Jitender Kumar. In Rewari, officials at Virat Hospital reported four deaths and said that their oxygen stock was exhausted. Virat Vir Yadav, the hospital owner, said their staff members had gone to get an oxygen tanker from Bawal around 3pm on Sunday, but they could not get to the hospital by 5pm. Several private hospitals continued facing an acute shortage of oxygen on Sunday as well. While Max and Mayom hospitals in Gurugram had put out an SOS tweet on Saturday stating they have a few hours’ supply left, Metro Hospital posted a similar message on Twitter at 10.38am on Sunday. By evening, the hospital got oxygen supply from Panipat. Officials at Metro said they have 48 patients on oxygen support. Park Group of Hospitals had also tweeted for urgent help with oxygen and tagged the Prime Minister’s Office, home minister Amit Shah, chief medical officer of Haryana, ministers Piyush Goyal, and Anil Vij, health minister Harsh Vardhan and DCP Gurugram. Several hospitals said they need assurance from the government about timely supply of oxygen before taking in fresh patients. Dr PN Kakar, CEO, Park Hospital, Gurugram, said: “We are getting 50% less oxygen compared to the demand. Once we get an assurance that we will be getting adequate oxygen supply, we will increase the number of beds.” Some residents took to social media alleging that hospitals have asked them to shift patients elsewhere because of lack of oxygen. Utpal Borpujari tweeted: “W Pratikha Hospital Sect 56 Gurugram shifting critical patients to other hospitals. citing shortage of oxygen.

---||Nagpur||Covid-19 virulent, unpredictable, highly contagious now: Doctors||NAGPUR: Along with being highly contagious, Covid-19 is virulent and unpredictable in the second wave, as per doctors who are diagnosing and treating positive patients. The district is reportedly witnessing 3-5 times rise in number of moderate and severe patients in the second wave as compared to the first one. Radiologist Dr Rajkumar Khandelwal told TOI, “In the first wave, around 5% patients used to have chest CT score of 9-15 (moderate). This time it has increased to 15%. About 15% patients used to have zero CT score in the first wave. Now, it has dropped to below 5%,” he said. Intensivist Dr Nikhil Balankhe said, “The number of moderate and severe patients has increased 4-5 times in second wave. Condition of around 50% patients starts deteriorating within a week. This time many young patients are requiring ventilators and few are succumbing to the disease. Infection in young patients was very less in first wave,” he said. According to pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, there is steep rise in patients with CT score of 10 or more. “Disease has become virulent. We are seeing patients getting infected rapidly. The condition is deteriorating very fast and recovery period is longer even after oxygen and other support. Virus has certainly mutated and become more dangerous,” he said. Dr Swarnakar, also national secretary of Indian Chest Society, emphasizes that in absence of any definitive cure for Covid, the job of doctors is to give supportive care but it’s the patient’s appropriate immune response that has to win this battle in second wave. “Most of them win it but some with comorbidities like diabetes, and alcoholics fail to survive,” he said. Senior critical care specialist Dr Rajan Barokar said that the disease progressed in a predictable manner, though medicines were limited, in the first wave. “Now, the disease is very unpredictable. Condition of stable patients is worsening in no time. CT scores don’t match with low oxygenation. There are some patients with higher (>15/25) CT score and are absolutely stable with normal oxygenation. At the same time, we have seen patients with CT score < 5 but having lower saturation,” he said. Dr Barokar also said that this time C-reactive protein (CRP) as a marker of severity is also not very dependable. “I have seen many patients whose CRP on presentation or in first 3-5 days was sky high, which doesn't went hand in hand with clinical signs,” he said. He further said that some patients in urban as well as rural areas are being treated at home by local doctors following people’s reluctance to get admitted due to lack of human resource or relatives’ support and finance. “It is leading to misjudgment of the regime in this second wave. Those who do not need Remdesivir are being given it. Condition of those who were wrongly given steroids (without low oxygen) in first 5-7 days, flared up leading to higher mortality in second wave,” he said. In 25 days of April, the district has registered 1,838 deaths which is 2.4 times of March (763) and 1.25 times of September last year (1,465). The second wave is also highly contagious. Positive cases were 48,457 in September last year which was peak of first wave. There were 76,250 cases in March which is 1.6 times of September. In just 25 days of April, the district has registered 1,48,150 cases, which is three times of September last year and almost two times of March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-19-virulent-unpredictable-highly-contagious-now-doctors/articleshow/82247795.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Shinde said three will be set up in Thane, two each in Kalyan-Dombivli and Navi Mumbai, and one each in Bhiwandi, Ulhasnagar, Ambernath, Badlapur, Mira-Bhayander, Vasai-Virar and Panvel. “Each plant will produce two tonnes of oxygen a day, which will be supplied for 200 oxygen beds,” said Shinde. “Agencies involved in production have been selected, and work orders have been issued, which will be operational in few days,” he added. Shinde, also a guardian minister of Gadchiroli district, said five to six plants producing 1 to 1.5 tonnes of oxygen daily were also being set up in that district. He said the state decided to set up the plants considering current and future needs of medical oxygen. Also, two oxygen generation plants will be operational in Jawhar and Palghar talukas soon. The government has released Rs 3.2 crore for the plants, said Palghar district collector Dr Manek Gursal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-14-oxygen-plants-to-come-up-in-mmr-says-min/articleshow/82248748.cms||---

The proposal was first mooted by the then field director NR Praveen on May 14, 2020, and now being carried forward by conservator of forest (CF) and field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar. “We are constructing Boma (enclosure where animals are herded naturally) in Jamni and soon start the process to shift the deer. Jamni was relocated in 2015-16. The mandatory permission from PCCF (wildlife) has been obtained. The permit to capture and release the deer under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, is valid up to August 2021,” said Ramgaonkar. State PCCF (wildlife) Nitin H Kakodkar said, “The permission was granted in September and it is the same proposal mooted by earlier field director. The animals will be soft released in Botezari. As tourism is closed, the situation is conducive for release. I’ve asked the officials to take utmost care and ensure minimum trauma while capture and release of the animals.” On an average, home range of female deer is 1.4 sqkm while that of the male is 1.95 sqkm. Hence, it is not possible for the ungulates to disperse to the Kolsa range on their own. This will be the fourth such major operation. Earlier in 2015 and 2019, attempts to relocate 200 deer from the forest department’s Nara depot on Koradi road to Mansinghdeo and Umred-Karhandla sanctuaries and Navegaon national park and in Ambazari biodiversity park in Nagpur failed miserably. The original TATR proposal was to breed deer in a big enclosure and later release them in phases. However, Ramgaonkar said, “We will not breed them and directly soft release them in Botezari. The basic idea is that due to lack of adequate prey, tigers move out of their natural habitat and engage in conflict with humans by way of cattle kills or attacks.” TATR deputy director (core) Nandkishore Kale said, “Our idea is not to multiply the deer. The site has been chosen due to meadows that have come up after relocation. We have staff as the elephant camp has also been shifted there and hence better monitoring can be done.” What is Boma techniqueThe forest department will catch deer with Boma technique. It is believed to have originated in Africa. It is a funnel-like setup made of wooden or metal frames and heavy plastic or canvas walls. It starts out with a wide opening and becomes narrow towards the end. Curtains are pulled shut once the animal passes through particular points to prevent them from turning around and running back once they enter the Boma. The technique minimizes physical handling of the animals and therefore there is no stress during release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tadoba-to-herd-100-deer-at-jamni-relocate-in-kolsa-range/articleshow/82247801.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

We have nothing much, only sanitiser and face masks, to protect ourselves,” said Suresh Singh, an assistant teacher on poll duty. The third phase of the panchayat polls in Uttar Pradesh is scheduled to take place on Monday. The voting will be held from 7 am to 6 pm in several western UP districts of Shamli, Meerut, Moradabad, Pilibhit, Kasganj and Firozabad. Meanwhile, polling officers have started arriving at their respective polling stations in buses in Moradabad district with Covid kits — face masks and sanitiser — to conduct voting amid the pandemic. Moradabad district has been divided into 17 zones and 210 sectors and the voting will be conducted at 2,437 polling stations, where 23.7 lakh voters are expected to cast their vote. Shubhkamna, a primary school headteacher, said, “We are risking our lives, but we appeal to the voters to maintain social distancing and follow the Covid guidelines.” During the earlier two phases, many polling officers had failed to report to their duty due to Covid infection or Covid-like disease. An assistant teacher, who wished not to be named, said his wife was asking him “not to go on the election duty”, but he persuaded her and left for his polling station. He was carrying with him a face shield, sanitiser, masks, homemade food, and the blessings of his parents, said the teacher. Manoj Kumar, the nodal officer, said, “All polling parties have been dispatched to their respective polling stations with the required polling and sanitisation kits. We have sensitised them on maintaining social distancing and sanitising their hands after regular intervals. Besides, the presiding officers of all polling stations have been provided with the necessary medicines. Four officials have been deputed at each polling station.” Moradabad superintendent of police (city) Amit Kumar Anand said, “We have adequate security measures at all polling stations. Besides, mobile forces will be active and flying squads will be visiting the polling stations to ensure peaceful and fair elections. All Covid guidelines will be followed to keep the officials and voters safe from the infection.” During the distribution of election kits, however, Covid guidelines were violated as most of the officials could be seen flouting the social distancing norm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/with-only-sanitisers-face-masks-to-fight-covid-fearful-presiding-officers-leave-for-polling-stations-for-3rd-phase-of-up-panchayat-polls/articleshow/82246734.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Delhi||Covid-19 in Delhi: Panic usage of oxygen can lead to shortage, say doctors||NEW DELHI: Remdesivir is no “magic bullet”, said AIIMS director Randeep Guleria, stating that there is no need to panic if one gets infected. The director said that Covid-19 is a mild infection that leads to common fever, cold and throat infection in most cases and for 85-90% patients, much medicine isn’t required. Speaking at a live session with other senior doctors, Guleria stated that 10-15% require oxygen, steroids and other medicines and even ventilators. “We should not worry and if we all start to be admitted in hospitals and use oxygen, then this would lead to oxygen shortage.” The AIIMS director said the WHO trial on the drug revealed it neither saves lives nor reduces a patient’s stay in the hospital. “Patients who are in a stable condition at home and whose oxygen saturation is over 92% should avoid Remdesivir as it could harm them,” he said. Guleria said that many patients panic if their oxygen saturation level goes down from 98 to 97%, fearing it may drop more. “It is not necessary to use oxygen at that point, as you blood is still saturated. Panic using oxygen like this would lead to shortage of oxygen and beds,” he said. Cardiac surgeon of Medanta, Naresh Trehan, suggested people should consult their local doctor with whom you’re in touch as soon as you get a positive RT-PCR test result. “All doctors know protocol and will begin your treatment accordingly. 90% of patients can recover at home if given correct medicines on time.” He explained that oxygen requirement in hospitals went from 1,500 -2,000 tonnes to 7,000-8-000 tonnes daily, which led to the oxygen reduction. He also suggested that people practice yogic breathing exercises like Anulom Vilom that helps expand lungs. “Go to a hospital only when you need intravenous drugs or when oxygen levels go down,” Trehan said. Trehan also advised double masking, and using N95 with surgical masks. “If you have cotton masks, then tighten its straps,” he said. Director general, health services, Dr Sunil Kumar asked people to not fall for everything that circulates on Whatsapp and only watch credible news. “ Follow responsible behaviour. This behaviour has to be followed by you, doctors, society as well as the media.” Adding that there were many rumours regarding vaccines, he said there were negligible side effects to them. “Vaccines and Covid-appropriate behavior are the two things that will help us break the chain,” said Kumar. Dr Naveet Wig, HoD of medicine at AIIMS, suggested all district officials to monitor their district's positivity rate and aim to keep it below 1-5%. “Mumbai had a 26% positivity rate at one point, but after severe restrictions, it came down to 14%. Delhi is struggling at 30%. We must impose strict restrictions here as well,” he said. Wig also stressed on the need to protect healthcare workers. “Many healthcare workers are testing positive. If we save them, then only they can save other patients, “ he said. “If we can save them both, then only we can save the economy.” He asked everyone to get the vaccine from May 1. “There should not be even a 1% apprehension for vaccines. Go and take the vaccine and stay hydrated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/panic-usage-of-oxygen-can-lead-to-shortage-say-docs/articleshow/82247908.cms||---
---||Pune||Avoid oral steroids ‘in mild or home-isolated patients’||Pune: While inhaled steroid (asthma inhalers) has been included as an experimental drug against mild Covid-19, experts have said that oral steroid tablets should only be used to treat moderately or severely ill patients who are hypoxic (with blood oxygen levels below 93). Doctors said patients with mild illness — mainly those recovering at home — do not require oral steroids. In fact, they warned that these drugs could be harmful for the patients. It’s feared that there are scores of mildly mill, home-isolated patients in the PMR who have been prescribed oral steroids. During the pandemic last year, the cheap and easily available oral steroid, dexamethasone, was falsely considered a ‘magic drug’ — just like how remdesivir has been positioned now during the second wave. Treatment guidelines formed later cut down irrational use, but these oral steroids’ use in home-isolated patients has become concerning, experts said. “Inhaled steroids like budesonide, which halts progression of disease, have benefited patients with mild Covid. Oral steroids like dexamethasone mainly benefit hypoxic Covid patients who are moderately ill,” said chest physician Sundeep Salvi, director of Pulmocare Research and Education Foundation.But oral steroids' early use in mild patients may, in fact, compromise immunity and even boost viral replication. “Also, it (oral steroid) can lead to high blood glucose levels, and contribute to increased post-Covid fungal and bacterial infections,” said infectious diseases expert, Parikshit Prayag.Prayag added that for patients with mild Covid-19, symptomatic therapy with paracetamol and blood thinners to prevent clotting are sufficient, along with immunity boosting medicines and vitamin supplements.Critical care specialist Kapil Zirpe said, “Worryingly, oral steroids are being rampantly prescribed in Pune to treat home-isolated patients with mild Covid infection. This is just wrong. General practitioners and family physicians need to be immediately sensitised.”Zirpe, chief intensivist of the Ruby Hall Clinic, added, “Oral/injectable or intravenus use is indicated only among admitted patients who require oxygen support and those who have raised bio-markers (blood inflammation tests) and have considerable lung involvement.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/avoid-oral-steroids-in-mild-or-home-isolated-patients/articleshow/82247819.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Pune||Corporators demand decentralized nCoV hosps||Pune: Elected members across the civic areas are demanding opening of jumbo Covid-19 hospitals and care centers in different areas of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in an effort to decentralise treatment. A jumbo hospital is being developed at Baner, which will have 150 oxygen beds. Another proposal has been tabled to convert an e-learning school at Sinhagad Road into a hospital. The three-storey municipal school is not being used currently. According to civic officials, the Covid hospital at Baner will be set up with mayoral funds. “The number of positive patients is very high currently as compared to the first phase. The PMC is planning to set up the facility to make sure that the second wave of the pandemic is controlled,” said mayor Murlidhar Mohol. PMC officials said the project is being carried out at Survey number 33 in Baner. The land is reserved for commercial use and parking in the development plan. The hospital has 150 are oxygen beds while 62 are assigned to the ICU. Mohol said that work on oxygen generators will be carried out at the site of the jumbo hospital. Four plants for producing oxygen will be set up at this location. A liquid oxygen tank will also be fitted on the campus itself. Corporator Manjusha Nagpure has written to the civic administration stating that a jumbo hospital can be started at Sinhagad Road. “Health infrastructure is falling short when it comes to dealing with rising cases. Citizens are struggling to get medical assistance. In such a scenario, setting up the hospital at the existing and vacant e-learning school premises is possible,” said Nagpure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/corporators-demand-decentralized-ncov-hosps/articleshow/82247837.cms||---

On April 23, the Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories had recorded 36.9°C and 37.8°C, respectively while the same on April 24 increased to 38.6°C and 39°C, in that order. A senior met official said, “Due to clear skies in the morning hours, the day temperature has increased in the last two days. A similar weather condition is expected to remain for the next few days. Hence, the Pune and Lohegaon day temperatures are expected to hover between 38°C and 39°C, respectively.” The IMD on Sunday also forecast light to very light rain on Tuesday and Wednesday with thunderstorms and lightning. Also, the city would experience cloudy conditions in the afternoon hours from Monday to Saturday. “There is a trough line between Marathwada region to South costal Tamil Nadu. There is also the presence of upper air circulation over the Madhya Maharashtra region, which includes Pune. There is a chance of moisture incursion as well. Due to these weather conditions, some pockets of Pune and adjacent areas are expected to get very light to light rainfall on April 27 and 28 with thundery activity and lightning in the evening hours,” the met official said.

---||Delhi||Cops suggest ways to boost oxygen distribution in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police is learnt to have written to Delhi government, flagging lapses in the manner in which oxygen is being transported and distributed in the capital and has also offered solutions to fix them. The communication is based on the reports received from the field officers on the ground. The helpline number 011-41400400, the cops said, is mostly found engaged due to less number of lines and the response is poor. The number of incoming lines needs to be adequately increased, police have suggested. “Several hospitals running out of oxygen are making frantic SOS calls to station house officers (SHOs). When the same message is passed on to the helpline, it is not prepared to receive the call. The management of oxygen plants where tankers are being filled — all of whom are located outside the capital — is not up to the mark,” said an officer from the operations unit. The officer said that nodal officers in Delhi need to coordinate with the cops in a better manner so that the tankers are filled according to the queue. Policemen have also observed and reported that bigger hospitals are provided liquid oxygen in tanks, but smaller hospitals are provided cylinders that are refilled at stations in the city. “The quota allocated, probable time of reaching of tankers/issue of cylinders, along with location should be electronically displayed for the knowledge of all concerned. This will let all the stake holders, including police, know when the oxygen is arriving,” the police have suggested, adding that GPS systems may installed in oxygen tankers to facilitate tracking. According to police, oxygen tankers are sometimes being taken to weigh bridges and precious time is being wasted in weighing. In such dire circumstances, this can be avoided. The cops on ground have also reported that nodal officers are allegedly accounting for oxygen demand of bigger Covid hospitals, but smaller hospitals are getting it in an adhoc manner. “Designated filling centres are not getting enough supplies to refill cylinders for smaller hospitals and general public. There are long queues at these places. It has also been reported that oxygen supply to various hospitals are being diverted to other hospitals without any schedule, causing panic. It is advisable to make a roster on the basis of actual need/urgency of hospitals by the DM or nodal officer concerned. The supply schedule should be shared with police to avoid panic and ensure hassle-free movement,” the police said The cops also raised an issue of nodal officers at oxygen refilling centers not being available at night, saying it becomes difficult to handle the situation in the absence of a representative.

---||Delhi||Delhi to stay locked down till 5am, May 3||NEW DELHI: The current lockdown in Delhi has been extended by a week — till 5am, May 3 — as Covid-19 continues to ravage the city. Announcing the extension of the lockdown, which started on April 19, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday, “The lockdown is the last resort and last measure imposed in any fight against Covid, and Delhi’s situation was such that imposing a lockdown had become necessary. However, the rise in cases has not come to a halt and they continue to climb at an alarming rate. In this context, it is the desire of the people as well that the lockdown should be extended.” “In order to contain the spread of virus and further break the transmission chain, curfew needs to be extended... except for essential activities/services, as an emergency measure,” Delhi Disaster Management Authority stated in its order. “During this lockdown, the positivity rate touched 36-37%. This is a new statistics for Delhi,” Kejriwal said. The rate has reduced a bit in the past two-three days and stood at below 30% on Sunday, but “this is not to say that the disease is ebbing, though that is the hope. It may increase or decrease in coming days, but our efforts will always be directed towards controlling the spread of the virus”, he added. During the extended lockdown, all non-essential movements, including those of domestic workers, are prohibited and non-essential public places will remain shut. Public transport like Delhi Metro, DTC and Cluster Scheme buses, cabs and autos will continue to follow the restricted seating capacity norm while carrying only exempted people, such as government officials, police and healthcare personnel, and mediapersons. Movement of individuals for wedding-related gatherings, restricted up to 50 people, is allowed on production of a soft or hard copy of the invitation card. Only up to 20 people can attend a funeral. All other gatherings remain prohibited. Bars and restaurants are closed but home delivery is allowed. All goods can be transported without any e-pass. Courier services, services provided by self-employed people such as electricians, plumbers, and educational book shops can operate against production of e-passes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-to-stay-locked-down-till-5am-may-3/articleshow/82247842.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||Delhi: Parks and parking lots turn into cremation grounds||NEW DELHI: With the load on Covid-designated crematoria rising exponentially, new pyre platforms are being set up in parking lots, empty grounds and even green belts abutting some major facilities, such as the one at Sarai Kale Khan. The three municipal corporations are desperately searching for additional sites to cater to the additional rush as several crematoria are operating on a day-and-night basis and way over their capacity. At least 50 new platforms are being constructed in the green space near the Sarai Kale Khan cremation facility in anticipation of an even heavier load. “The situation is dire and we are continuously trying to raise the capacity of the cremation grounds. The second biggest cremation facility of the city — the one at Punjabi Bagh — has been reserved for Covid victims alone,” an official told TOI. The spurt in Covid deaths over the last few days has stretched the city’s funeral grounds to the brinkThe Ghazipur cremation facility, too, has added 20 platforms in its parking lot even as 10 platforms were added in Wazirabad on Sunday. East Delhi mayor Nirmal Jain said that the rise in the number of deaths was so huge that the pressure on the crematoria had increased tremendously and new pyres were being added on a war-footing. Earlier, Seemapuri Shamshan Bhumi was also allowed to start cremations in an empty ground used as parking. The number of daily Covid protocol cremations crossed the 650 mark on Sunday though the number of fatalities might be much higher due to many dying at home, municipal officials overseeing the funeral centres said. The Covid-reserved funeral capacity has been revised four times in the last two weeksThe Covid protocol funeral reports from the three civic bodies stated that 666 Covid protocol funerals took place till 6pm on Sunday, of which 272 were carried out at nine sites under the South Delhi Municipal Corporation. Nigambodh Ghat received the maximum 114 bodies of Covid patients. The spurt in Covid deaths over the last few days has stretched the city’s funeral grounds to the brink with several sites ordered to operate on a 24x7 basis. Data from the three corporations shows that 3,472 Covid protocol cremations and burials took place in the facilities designated for this purpose across the city. Municipal records state that 585 such funerals took place on Saturday, 539 on Friday, 483 on Thursday and 432 on Wednesday. The Covid-reserved funeral capacity has been revised four times in the last two weeks and now 733 bodies can be cremated in a day. On the other hand, the Covid section of the biggest burial ground catering to the Covid victims at ITO is also on the verge on being exhausted. The scale of the increase in the inflow of bodies can be gauged from the fact the Nigambodh Ghat — the main crematorium of the city — which was witnessing an inflow of 30-40 bodies in the beginning of April, now cremates more than 200 bodies a day. “We are operating even during night and new platforms have been added along Yamuna,” an official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/parks-and-parking-lots-turn-into-cremation-grounds/articleshow/82247852.cms||Paras Singh

They did not get a hospital bed and also the proper treatment, the family alleged. Rohitash Gupta, 36, used to live with his wife and two children in a rented house. It is also being alleged that he was forced out of his house by his landlord after he came to know about his Covid-19 status. Rohitash, who ran a news portal, then moved to his mother’s house, and she too got the infection. On Saturday morning he breathed his last at home. His mother had died a few hours earlier. Rohitash had a cough and congestion in chest since he went out to cover panchayat elections. Later, he was tested positive for Covid-19. When his landlord came to know about it, he was asked to vacate the house as there was a common entry to the house, sources said. When asked why Rohitash and his mother did not get the treatment, Bareilly’s chief medical officer Dr Sudheer Kumar Garg said, “They contacted the hospital at the last moment. And by the time the ambulance reached, both of them had died.” Another media person Nootan Saxena (42) passed away during treatment in Bareilly. Several journalists and policemen including SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan were also tested positive in the district during panchayat elections. Sajwan is still under treatment. A total 984 people were tested positive for the virus on Sunday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/local-journo-mother-die-of-covid-19-at-home-in-bareilly/articleshow/82246761.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: City gets 1.6L doses, all 132 centres can give vax today||Mumbai: The city received over 1.6 lakh Covid vaccine doses on Sunday, which will allow all 132 public and private centres to carry out the inoculation drive from Monday. The last week saw a significant decline in daily average vaccinations as most private centres didn’t get stocks, while public ones had to scale down. BMC chief I S Chahal said vaccination could run smoothly for three days with the fresh stock. “We have received 1.5 lakh doses of Covishield and 8,000 doses of Covaxin,” he said. The drive on Monday could start late at certain centres as they would be collecting the doses late on Sunday or early on Monday, the BMC said. Chahal added that since Covaxin was in short supply, preference will be given to those due for their second doses at select centres. JJ Hospital in Byculla and BKC jumbo are some of the centres that could have Covaxin, but civic officials have said people must enquire before reaching the centres. The BMC said the doses would be disbursed from the newly built regional vaccine storage centre at Kanjurmarg that can hold over a crore doses. However, even as doses have arrived, there is confusion over online appointments. “Co-Win has practically stopped giving appointments for the first dose. Even for second doses, only limited centre choices are available,” said Samir Shah, a Vile Parle resident. Vaccination centres are already expecting huge queues on Monday since many, who are due for second doses, couldn’t get it last week. Sanjay Vohra posted on Twitter: “I am getting jittery on how to take my 84-year-old mom for vaccination in the next 10 days… (she was Covid positive earlier) as she cannot walk properly, still has weakness and can't stand in queues.” Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of BKC jumbo centre, said they stopped vaccinations around 4pm on Sunday after running out of doses. “Last week, we vaccinated 7000 people in a day. If we have doses, we can scale up,” he said. On Sunday, Mumbai could vaccinate only 23,419 people, down from its average of 44,000 the previous week. Across the state, only 2,17,244 people could be inoculated on Saturday, because of shortage of doses. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said the civic body would hold the first round of meetings about the rollout of the next phase of vaccination from May 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-gets-1-6l-doses-all-132-centres-can-give-vax-today/articleshow/82248775.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Besides, jewellers say, buying jewellery pieces is a matter of touch and experience.“Jewellery isn’t generally sold online. Purchases on our online platform are usually small ticket in nature. People prefer to come to our stores, experience and look at the jewellery in real life,” said Amit Modak, CEO of PN Gadgil and Sons.Modak added that they are also offering hedges to customers at current gold rates, as uncertainty in the economy is driving up prices of gold in the market. PN Gadgil, as well as some other jewellers, are charging an advance from customers to ensure that as the economy and jewellery outlets reopen, they can purchase at older, lower prices later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jewellers-take-their-baubles-online-in-a-bid-to-survive-these-trying-times/articleshow/82247856.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Goa||Goa’s health infrastructure crumbles as state crosses 1,000 deaths||PANAJI: The state’s fledgling healthcare infrastructure was on the verge of collapse as Goa witnessed a record 2,293 fresh cases and 24 deaths on Sunday. As the state’s death toll crossed the grim 1,000-mark milestone and with a test positivity rate of almost 40%—two of every five tests positive—the healthcare system is unable to deliver even the basics like accessible testing, results on time, and adequate monitoring of patients in home isolation. “People don’t get a report for five to seven days. So, we have cases rising and mortalities going up at an alarming level,” a government doctor said. With an average 17 daily deaths and infections spreading across the state, health experts raise serious questions about the state’s preparedness in handling the pandemic. Beds are full, and the waiting period at the casualty of the South Goa district hospital can go up to six hours. People who can’t afford to test at a private facility either visit a government hospital or wait till the nearest government primary health centre opens. Health centres are closed for testing on Sundays. Only the flu OPD is open 24x7, the government doctor said. But chief minister Pramod Sawant sought to explain the surge as a “clearance of backlog”. “The increased number of Covid-positive cases today (Sunday) is due to the clearance of backlog, and the same is expected to continue for the next two days,” he said. Goa conducted almost 6,000 tests on Sunday. “Home isolation monitoring has really become a joke,” a senior government doctor said. One of those who died on Sunday was a 25-year-old man with no comorbidities. He was in home isolation for 10 days and was shifted to hospital in a critical condition. He died less than half an hour after treatment started. In fact, as many as seven of those who succumbed on Sunday died within 24 hours of admission. An illustration of the state’s failed home isolation system was during the Margao municipal polls, when candidate Arthur D’Silva, who was Covid-positive, was caught canvassing for votes. An FIR was later filed against him. “We were not prepared for the second wave to hit in such a severe way. The virus is very virulent and has been progressing faster. The worry is healthcare workers collapsing, getting infected and being morally down,” said senior pulmonologist and past IMA president Dr Anil Mehndiratta. The government has finalised a new standard operating procedure for Covid patients, after health secretary Ravi Dhawan had a meeting with health experts on Saturday, where it was decided that treatment of a patient who got tested will be started without his test result. But this new protocol is yet to come into force. Dr Praveen Bhat, a senior pulmonologist and director of Horizon hospital, Margao, said the message must be “loud and clear” that people should get themselves tested at the earliest. “Patients with non-classic symptoms like backache or body pain or just feeling unwell delay getting tested. Having Covid-19 does not necessarily mean cough and fever,” Bhatt, who was part of the expert committee chaired by Dhawan, said. Another expert said that “estimating a possible rise in cases during the next three weeks, the state should not only break the chain of infection, but on a war-footing make oxygen beds available along with adequate manpower”. GMC dean and in-charge of the state’s Covid hospitals, Dr S M Bandekar, said that they’re aiming to open the super-specialty block with 500 beds for Covid patients on May 1. Bandekar said that they would “manage” the manpower shortage by posting doctors from other departments, while more nurses will be hired on a contract basis. Pathologist Dr Anan Jaiswal said that everyone took things casually after the first wave ended. “Only the mask will protect, and the government should have dealt with defaulters with an iron hand. Instead, the government was sending out mixed messages to people, trying to protect tourism,” he said. A senior health official said that the district collectors should invoke the disaster management plan. “This way, all the IMA doctors, army and navy doctors can also come on board and the government would have control of the situation,” he said. Sawant, who had a meeting with IMA representatives on Saturday, has requested them to help in terms of manpower. He told them to manage the MPT-Covid hospital. The IMA is expected to respond on Monday. However, a Panaji citizen said the government shouldn’t have the audacity to attribute deaths to people coming in late. “It is ridiculous and irresponsible for the government to say this. If the test results don’t come on time, how can you blame deaths on the people coming in late?” she asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-health-infra-crumbles-as-state-crosses-1000-deaths/articleshow/82248781.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Delhi||How these young guns are scripting a rescue act||New Delhi: Like any other 22-year-old, Sanjana is forever glued to her cellphone. Only, for the past two weeks, she has been busy attending to calls from Covid-hit people asking for help. The college student claims to have handled over 500 calls and text messages in that short period of time. For many in need of oxygen cylinders, ICU beds, medicines and other requirements, Sanjana is a godsend.“Last year, when things started to go downhill, I volunteered to teach the underprivileged children who could not attend online classes. However, when the situation worsened to such an extent that I couldn’t even go to the nearby park to teach them, I decided to help people in dire need. After word spread, I have been getting non-stop requests from people,” Sanjana told TOI. My heart aches to see what’s happening to my city. Many people have got back and profusely thanked me for the effort. Their blessings keep me going,” she added.Many other students are devoting a chunk of their time to save lives. Tushar Arora (21) attends online classes in the first half of the day. The rest of his time goes into responding to pleas on Twitter and WhatsApp. “There are so many families who are asking for help through the social media and some even reach out personally to me on WhatsApp. I get around 100 requests a day and I try to respond to each and every message from them. I share with them all the verified sources of information that I have,” said Arora.The stress and despair are, obviously, taking their toll. Ayushi Garg (22) said she hadn’t been getting enough sleep as she couldn’t get the cries of the helpless people out of her head. “I am arranging oxygen cylinders for the Covid-positive patients. I have been getting many calls and messages on Instagram. Of course, at the end of the day, you find some satisfaction in helping people out, but the sadness is overwhelming,” she said.For Raghav Sharma, who is also the founder of an NGO for underprivileged children, the days seem to never end. “I have been running this NGO for a long time and had never imagined that we would see such terrible times. We are trying to arrange regular meals for daily wagers. My friends and I have also formed a ‘Covid warriors team’, which is providing authentic information about plasma, oxygen cylinders and ICU beds. We are providing financial help to poor patients as well,” said Sharma, just 22. Abhishek Chowdhry is the same age as Sharma. He has been working for the welfare of the Covid-affected families for months now. “No matter how positive I try to stay, I feel terrible about the distress around me,” he said.Muskaan Kataria, another college-going girl, said she was juggling studies and welfare work. “These are desperate times. There are many people who want to work, but don’t have verified information. My friends and I try to bridge that gap,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-these-young-guns-are-scripting-a-rescue-act/articleshow/82247867.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

---||Delhi||Centre-Delhi in a war of words over delay in installing O2 plants||New Delhi: Amid growing demand for medical oxygen, eight pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants are being installed in Delhi by through the PM CARES Fund. These plants will increase the city’s capacity of medical oxygen by 14.4 metric tonnes.Of the eight plants, one was already installed at Burari Hospital, Kaushik Enclave, on March 17 this year. Four plants— one each at DDU Hospital, Lok Nayak, Rohini’s Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital and Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital at Ashok Vihar—are expected to be completed by April 30.Central government sources said Delhi government had delayed readying hospital sites despite weekly reviews with them since November 2020. “For Ambedkar Nagar Hospital, the site was readied as late as April 19 by the Delhi government and site readiness certificate of Satyawadi Raja Harishchandra Hospital, Narela, has not been submitted yet,” a source said.However, Delhi government said Centre was giving false statements to hide its abject failure in setting up PSA plants in Delhi. “It is well known that Union health ministry through PM CARES Fund had decided to set up 162 PSA plants across India and issued tenders in October 2020. All these plants were supposed to have been installed by December 2020 and handed over to state governments. However, Centre gave the contract for 140 of these plants to a single vendor, who ran away. As a result, not even 10 plants have been made operational till date across India,” the state government stated.In Delhi, 7 of the 8 plants were to come up at Delhi government hospitals and one at Safdarjung, a Centre-run hospital. “After follow-ups with Centre, only one plant has been made operational. We’re shocked to learn that Centre is making the excuse of site certificate. The fact that the plant is not even operational at Safdarjung shows the Centre is caught in the web of its own lies,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-delhi-in-a-war-of-words-over-delay-in-installing-o2-plants/articleshow/82247872.cms||AlokKNMishra

Remaining 55% people have only four days to take the jab without much trouble as the vaccination centres are likely to witness rush from May 1. As per data of state’s public health department (PHD), around 15,81,800 people are in 45-plus age group in the district and eligible to get vaccine. The government had rolled out vaccine for 60-plus and 45-plus with comorbidities from March 1, followed by all in 45-plus age group from April 1. As per PHD’s data, 3,55,305 people from 45-59 years age group and 3,53,095 from 60-plus, for a total of 7,08,400, have taken the jab in the district as on Sunday. The coverage is 44.78%. Now, 8,73,400 eligible people are yet to take the jab. The government has allowed vaccination for all above 18 years from May 1. Looking at past experience when inoculation started for 60-plus in the district, there is likely to be crowding and long waiting period from May 1. According to activist Narayan Ahuja told TOI, less number of beneficiaries have turned at vaccination centres in last 15 days. “There were hardly 10 beneficiaries at GMCH when I went there with family for second dose in the evening a day ago. People above 45 years should take the jab before May 1 as there will be less crowing. It will also ensure less burden on vaccination centres,” he said. Only 13,916 people from 45-59 years age group and 30,335 from 60-plus have taken second dose in the district. As on April 20, 41.48% of total eligible people from 45-plus age group have taken the jab in Bhandara district, which was second among 35 districts in the state after Kolhapur. Nagpur was on third position.

---||Delhi||Covid-19: After grievous loss, no closure for kin||NEW DELHI: Grieving relatives of Covid-19 victims in the city now have an additional wait — due to the widespread corona infection and the lockdown, they can’t even carry out the rituals of immersing the ashes immediately. With the asthi grah or the lockers keeping ashes having no more space, funeral managers at the Covid crematoria are advising families to keep the ashes at local temples/gurdwaras. “The managing committee had ordered new trays to keep more ash urns but the number of daily cremations is so high that they too got filled. Instead of ritualistically immersing the ashes in the Ganga, some families are now choosing upstream Yamuna locations where water is still clear,” an official overseeing the cremation rituals at the Nigambodh Ghat facility said. Due to high pollution, the Yamuna in the city is no longer preferred for immersion, he added. Before the pandemic hit, the Nigambodh Ghat crematorium had 228 lockers where the families could keep the urns before taking them in a day or two, mostly to Haridwar or Kashi. “All of these lockers are now occupied. We are telling relatives to keep the urns in their cars or local temples. We have ordered 70 more trays,” an official said. The time allowed for ashes to stay on funeral platforms has been reduced and the families are asked to collect it on the same day. The biggest cremation ground in the capital has 120 traditional funeral pyre platforms and six CNG furnaces. “In the recent memory, the need to expand the platforms or the asthi grah has never arisen but this calamity has pushed us to the extreme point,” a funeral priest said. To expand the capacity, 20 funeral platforms have recently been added along the Yamuna and the six CNG furnaces have been asked to operate even at night. On Sunday till 6pm, the Covid-protocol funeral crossed 114 while non-Covid cremations also continue. The second biggest crematorium in Delhi, Punjabi Bagh, has two lockers where 120 and 100 ash urns can be kept — both are now overflowing. “The managing committee has put up a notice asking people to make arrangements for these urns,” an official said. A manager said families had been advised to immerse the ashes at Majnu Ka Tilla gurdwara and Gang Nahar early in the morning. Those who want to go still farther have been suggested Gadhganga. Similar reports have been received from the Lodhi Road and Seemapuri cremation grounds, both of which are running beyond their capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-grievous-loss-no-closure-for-kin/articleshow/82247886.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||Crowd with rods forces bodies to be diverted in Delhi||NEW DELHI: While more than a year has passed since the controversy that occurred while cremating Covid patients’ bodies initially in March 2020, some people remain apprehensive about such cremations in their area. Another instance of local resistance to Covid-protocol cremations has surfaced in south Delhi’s Dakshinpuri. While larger crematoria in the city run day and night to deal with the additional load of bodies due to Covid surge, new sites are also being added to the Covid-designated list. A south corporation official said that when 10 bodies of Covid patients were taken to the Dakshinpuri cremation ground at Sanjay Camp on Friday, several hundred people—some armed with sticks and stones—gathered at the site and did not permit the funerals to take place. “We called the police, but the situation could not be brought under control and ultimately, the bodies had to be diverted to three other Covid-designated cremation grounds,” an official overseeing the Covid funerals in the area said. A similar incident had taken place at the Madanpur Khadar burial ground last year, after which the site was dropped from the list of Covid- designated funeral centres. On Friday, five new platforms were set up at the cremation ground, which is run by Niswarth Shamshan Sudhar Samiti, for the funerals. Shankar Chugh, who heads the NGO running the crematorium, said that people were armed and prepared to attack the teams, so he had to intervene. “We were not informed by the zonal officials that the site will be used for Covid-protocol cremations. People were not taken into confidence, which led to such a violent situation,” Chugh said. He added that priests were also not willing to carry out such cremations. Chugh, who is looking after the facility owned by SDMC since 2003, argued that there were several problems in carrying out Covid-protocol cremations at such a densely populated site. “The ground also has a park where kids play,” he claimed. A civic official said that the crematorium belongs to the corporation and it only managed by the NGO. “The fears are not based on scientific facts and there is a lot of pressure on main cremation grounds because of this,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/crowd-with-rods-forces-bodies-to-be-diverted/articleshow/82247892.cms||Paras Singh

---||Nagpur||High O2 demand leads to low pressure alarms keeping doctors on toes||NAGPUR: Hospitals handling Covid patients are facing a technical hassle with oxygen cylinders these days: frequent drop in pressure of oxygen being administered to patients. This is a new problem faced in the second wave, say doctors. Apart from shortage of oxygen in general, this also has something to do with the laws of physics. Covid patients these days are requiring a higher amount of oxygen, as compared to normal levels. This leads to fast flow of the gas from jumbo cylinders. When all the vents are drawing oxygen from cylinder at a higher flow rate, the pressure gradient in the cylinder drops soon, said doctors. It happens even when the cylinder is nearly half full, and the alarms start ringing to indicate low pressure. This is followed by the exercise of either changing the cylinder or increasing the pressure, if possible. This ends up consuming valuable time, which can be critical for some patients, said doctors TOI spoke to. Even as it’s difficult to get spare cylinders, hospitals in Nagpur have been able to manage the situation successfully without any untoward incident, said doctors. “Take the example of a balloon from which air is released through a small opening. It comes out fast initially but soon stops, even if there is some air left in the balloon. This is somewhat comparable to decrease in pressure in the cylinder. Even if half the oxygen is left, it cannot come out like that in the balloon,” explained Dr Sameer Paltewar of Meditrina Hospital. The flow rate is so high that pressure gradient in the cylinder quickly drops. Like remaining air in the balloon can be released by widening the opening, in the cylinder, advanced regulators can do the job. Or else the entire cylinder has to be changed, even if it has enough gas left, he said. Paltewar said at his hospital they have already made the changes in the system by getting better pressure management gadgets. Some of the Covid patients are already on the edge and even a small delay could be dangerous, he said. Dr Ashok Arbat of Krims Hospital, president of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA), also admitted having faced drop in pressure from time to time. “It becomes a crisis when it happens in the night. There begins a scramble for oxygen cylinders, we have to borrow from other hospitals.” He also agreed that the flow of oxygen has gone up for Covid patients. Orange City Hospital’s Dr Anup Marar, also convener of VHA, too agreed there was a problem. “There is as much as 40% oxygen left in the cylinder but it has to be changed as the pressure cannot be maintained. As this takes time, the hospital has to resort to rationing. Patients on ventilator are given the preference at such times,” he said. “There have been a number of times when we had to rush to borrow cylinders from other hospitals and also lend to others during such situations,” said Dr Anand Sancheti of New Era Hospital. “The staff has to be on constant watch, As soon as the alarms ring, they rush to regulate the pressure so that the oxygen flow continues. There are fears that the pressure gauge may malfunction due to frequent drop in pressure. It’s difficult to get any new equipment related to Covid health care during these times,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/high-o2-demand-leads-to-low-pressure-alarms-keeping-doctors-on-toes/articleshow/82247876.cms||Shishir Arya

The state also recorded 24 deaths. Seventeen of these took place at GMC and seven at the South Goa district hospital. Seven expired within 24 hours, GMC dean Dr S Bandekar said. “Common to all of them is that they were symptomatic for a minimum of three days,” he said. “The youngest who expired was 25 years old, and was symptomatic for ten days prior to his day of death.” One death was reported in the surgical unit of GMC, which was a case of road traffic accident with severe head injury. “The Covid test was done and it was positive. The actual cause of death is awaited after the post-mortem of this medico-legal case,” Bandekar said. The state’s positivity rate continued to remain high at 38.5% despite 5,946 samples tested. The day saw 135 patients hospitalised and 547 opt for home isolation. The state’s recovery rate has fallen drastically to 81%, with 658 recovering over the past 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-new-high-state-records-over-2-2k-new-cases-in-a-day/articleshow/82248791.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Third phase of UP panchayat polls today; focus to be on Amethi, Unnao districts||LUCKNOW: As panchayat elections enter the third phase on Monday, the political focus will be on key districts like Amethi, the former stronghold of Congress which was wrested by the BJP in Lok Sabha elections, and Unnao, the nerve centre of upper caste politics which has been under the influence of expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar. The penultimate phase of panchayat polls will have contests in 20 districts, including those in politically crucial east UP region – Chandauli, Deoria, Balrampur, Siddharthnagar and Ballia. The grass roots level electoral battle will also be held in some of west UP districts like Moradabad, Shamli, Meerut, Firozabad and Kasganj. Other districts going to polls are Mirzapur, Hamirpur, Barabanki, Fatehpur, Pilibhit, Jalaun, Kanpur Dehat and Auraiyya. These 20 districts have 746 zila panchayat wards on which 10,610 candidates are trying their luck. Polls will also be held in 18,530 Kshetra Panchayat wards where 89,149 candidates are in fray. This phase will also have contest in 14,379 gram panchayats where 1,17,781 candidates are in fray. In all, over 3.05 crore voters will exercise their franchise in 49,789 polling booths in this phase. Ballia has the highest 58 zila panchayat wards, followed by Barabanki and Deoria which have 57 and 56 wards, respectively. Deoria also has the maximum 1,185 gram panchayats. A keen contest is expected to be witnessed in Unnao from where BJP was earlier planning to field Sangeeta Sengar, wife of Unnao rape convict Kuldeep Sengar. The BJP, however, could not sustain candidature of Sangeeta Sengar, the former chairperson of Unnao zila panchayat, following criticism from party ranks. Later, BJP gave ticket to a local BJP functionary, Shakun Singh. The BJP will also seek to establish its supremacy in Amethi, the parliamentary constituency of Union minister Smriti Irani, who defeated Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in the otherwise pocket borough of the grand old party. A senior BJP leader said the party seeks to strengthen its position in Amethi ahead of assembly elections. In 2017 assembly elections, BJP had won four of five assembly seats in Amethi – Tiloi, Salon, Jagdishpur and Amethi. Only Gauriganj was won by Samajwadi Party’s Rakesh Pratap Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/third-phase-of-panchayat-polls-today-focus-to-be-on-amethi-unnao-dists/articleshow/82248787.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Nagpur||Slight dip in calls to hosps, HRCT scan centers may be beginning of end of 2nd wave||NAGPUR: In some relief from the Covid onslaught, hospitals and private practitioners in the city have observed that calls for admission and number of sick patients have dipped by 10% to 20% in the last couple of days. Though daily cases continue to go northwards, medical colleges have seen a decline in the rush at Covid OPDs as compared to a week ago. IGGMCH officials said serious patients continue to be admitted but the flow of mild to moderate patients seems to have gone down. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande too said the inflow has slightly decreased and mild to moderate cases have dipped. “The number of serious cases in admission or being rushed to casualty is as it is. Perhaps, other cases are getting accommodated elsewhere,” he said. A similar dip in percentage of footfall at clinics and CT scan centres too has been seen. As on Sunday, the district’s positivity rate was 31%. This was 26% a week ago but sporadic decline in certain testing labs is evident. For example, positivity rate at CSIR-Neeri lab has come down to 40% from 46% a week ago. Similarly, GMCH lab’s rate has slipped to 46% from 50% in the same period. Some big hospitals are yet to see any shift in patient flow but some are getting less admission queries. Kingsway Covid team in-charge Dr Harshvardhan Bora said it could be a false impression. “Many patients stay back at home only as they get tired of searching for a bed. Hospitals are unable to take them due to lack of oxygen and Remdesivir shortage. We are expecting a surge in Covid OPD patients. ICU and ventilator demand is only going up by the day because patient is deteriorating during the time his relatives find a bed,” he said. Niranjan S Joshi, senior manager, marketing & corporate communication, Alexis Multispeciality Hospital, said the rush in OPDs is same. “But maybe because of non-availability, queries for beds have gone down by 10 to 15%. Patients have complaints of common Covid symptoms. Some 90% are Covid related and 10% are post-Covid or other illness in the OPD,” he said. Chest physician Dr Syed Tarique said the rush has gone down at his clinic. “I would attribute it to lockdown. Following movement control measures for a week has shown good results,” he said. Dr MA Biviji, consultant radiologist, MRI and CT Centre in Dhantoli, said there is a slight decrease in footfall of patients coming for HRCT chest in the last two days. “This we could take as an indicator of declining trend of the disease,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/slight-dip-in-calls-to-hosps-hrct-scan-centers-may-be-beginning-of-end-of-2nd-wave/articleshow/82247899.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Lucknow||‘Complied with court, didn’t want elections’||Lucknow: The state government on Sunday said it didn’t want to conduct panchayat elections in UP in view of coronavirus pandemic but had to do so following the Allahabad high court’s order which directed it to complete the poll process by May 10. “The elections were due in December last year. The pandemic led to delay in reorganization and delimitation of panchayats. The writ petitions and subsequent decision of the high court compelled the state government to hold the election,” a state government spokesperson said. “In a writ petition filed by Vinod Upadhyay against the State of Uttar Pradesh, the Allahabad high court in its order dated February 4, directed the State Election Commission to complete the election process for panchayats by April 30. In compliance, the state government initiated the process of reservation and allotment by March 15,” the spokesman said. The state government said the panchayat polls were being conducted in keeping with Covid-19 protocol issued by the State Election Commission. The four-phase panchayat elections started on April 15 and counting of votes and declaration of result will take place on May 2. The spokesperson said the state government was committed to ensuring the safety of voters. For proper cleanliness, sanitization and prevention of infection in gram panchayats, special sanitation drive was underway in villages. “Under special sanitation drive, cleaning, sanitization and fogging is being carried out across all the revenue villages in 75 districts of the state,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/complied-with-court-didnt-want-elections/articleshow/82248794.cms||---
---||Goa||Shortage of hospital beds spikes demand for domestic oxygen kits in Goa||PANAJI: With private and government-run hospitals filled up and a long line of patients waiting for beds, the demand for medical oxygen for home care has surged phenomenally. Relatives of Covid-19 patients are on the hunt for oxygen, often lugging bulky cylinders even at midnight to prevent their loved ones from gasping for air. Goa’s oxygen manufactures, who have already stopped supplying to industrial units, are scrambling to meet the demand and have begun procuring liquid oxygen from neighbouring states to meet the increased demand. Unlike states across the country which are reeling from a severe oxygen shortage, in Goa the demand for oxygen is fuelled by the shortage of beds. As Goa continues to rack up Covid-19 cases and deaths, people are left with no other option but to procure medical oxygen on their own when oxygen levels drop. “We get lot of calls, our phones are continuously ringing,” said a representative of Scoop Oxygen. “Even during the peak of the first wave we would get just one or two calls per day. In the last few days we get 20 to 30 calls for oxygen every day.” Goa has three major industrial oxygen manufacturers and suppliers, while a fourth manufacturing plant at Cuncolim, which was shut after an industrial accident has resumed production for medical purposes. With the second wave proving far more vicious, over 135 people had to be hospitalised on Sunday. Panic has gripped patients and their relatives and this can be reflected in the shortage of oxygen regulators, oximeters and other associated equipment. While oxygen supplies are adequate to meet the demand, it does not help matters that some wealthy people start hoarding oxygen cylinders. “We have to take care and see who we give the cylinders to. There are people who take a cylinder and hoard it for two months and three months. Our cylinders get locked and those who need the oxygen do not get it either,” said a reputed oxygen supplier. While the price of oxygen varies from Rs 250 to Rs 800 per cylinder, the cost of the high pressure cylinder itself is Rs 10,000 and with all oxygen kits and spares coming from Maharashtra, Karnataka and other states, suppliers are worried about their cylinders. All the oxygen manufacturers have their production units open 24x7. “People are coming at midnight, 2am to collect oxygen,” said the official at Scoop Oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shortage-of-hospital-beds-spikes-demand-for-domestic-oxygen-kits/articleshow/82248795.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Remdesivir budget forces small pvt hosps to scrimp||Mumbai: Smaller private hospitals are having to take a difficult call every day on who of their admitted patients get Remdesivir and who must wait for the next lot to arrive. Under the state’s new system of allocation of the drug through the collector’s office, many hospitals claimed they were receiving only 40%-50% of the required doses. The state Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given the collector’s office a formula to allocate Remdesivir to Covid hospitals. As per the formula, each hospital will get doses equivalent to 10% of active cases admitted there. However, hospital authorities said it is a flawed formula that doesn’t consider that most beds are now occupied by ‘moderate’ to ‘severe’ patients. TOI found out that bigger private hospitals didn’t have any issues as they were allocated adequate doses. Dr Shilpa Ambekar, head of LifeLine Medicare Hospital in Kandivli, said they were allocated only 25-35 vials against their daily requirement of 70. The hospitals are supposed to send a list of patients to the collector’s office which then approves of doses and allocates to hospitals. “When we are getting only 50% of doses, our doctors naturally have to triage patients. Whoever needs it the most gets it first,” she said. There is also no uniformity of brands, said another hospital head from Dahisar. “Some patients have got six doses from six pharma companies. But at least they have got it so nobody complains,” the doctor added. Dr Prince Surana, who heads mid-level hospitals in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, said they are allocated 20-40 vials despite sending a request for 70-80 vials to the collector’s office. “We try to fill the gap by sourcing from distributors and leftover doses from anybody, but it’s a daily struggle,” he said. On Saturday night, he had over 40 patients waiting for their dose of Remdesivir till midnight. “We try to prioritise those who have a higher CT scan score, higher oxygen dependence, comorbidities and possibility of worsening,” he said. Dr Rajaram Sonagra from Ghatkopar’s Sonagra Hospital said against their daily requirement of 25 vials, they receive only 10. Another hospital head from Dadar said because of the flawed way of allocating doses, they have no choice but to involve families to arrange for doses, knowing well that it was not available in the open market. “Many manage to source it by paying 3-5 times,” he said. The state’s estimated daily need of Remdesivir is 60,000 vials, but it received 20,000-40,000 vials daily last week. On Saturday, the state got a supply of only 20,000 vials, an FDA official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-remdesivir-budget-forces-small-pvt-hosps-to-scrimp/articleshow/82248799.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Goa||Goa: With health systems stretched, people struggle to get tested||PANAJI: With the state’s healthcare system overburdened by the unrelenting intensity of the second wave, Covid testing has become yet another worry for those with symptoms. A South Goa family with Covid symptoms who sought to get tested at their primary health centre on Saturday, were told that no testing happens over the weekend, and to return on Monday. “We inquired again on Sunday about what time to get tested on Monday, and they told us to come at 2.30pm as they would be busy with vaccinations in the morning,” the head of the family told TOI. He decided not to go to the district hospital as the queues there were too long, and he feared he would contract Covid while waiting in the queue if he didn’t already have it. Meanwhile, as they watched their symptoms worsening, the family was unsure about what treatment to begin, with all the doctors they contacted asking them to get tested first. “A private doctor advised us to get tested and start medication from the home isolation kit,” he said. “But if getting tested itself is so difficult, when will we ever get our reports and the home isolation kit. It’s maddening. We are panicking at home.” Private labs also told them that results are only possible after 72 hours. The scene in urban Goa isn’t very different. The state’s capital’s urban health centre too was a chaotic scene, with healthcare workers flooded with people trying to get tested. A citizen who got tested there on Friday said it takes a minimum of one and a half hours with multiple queues. “The entire process needs to be sped up,” said Viresh, who sought a test there. “I had to stand in one queue to make a ‘green paper’ where my details were taken down, after which I was permitted to join another smaller queue to see the doctor who recommended what test I take. After that, I was sent to another queue for my swab to be collected where my details were taken down again by a separate team. These different bureaucratic processes need to be cut down and something needs to be done to digitise the process.” People who arrived late were asked to come back at 2.30pm to fill in their details on the green paper to get a coupon, and then show up the next morning for testing. The sign put up says testing only takes place from 10am to 12 noon. “More testing centres can be put in place, or even a facility for drive-through testing in places where the demand is huge,” he suggested. In another instance, a symptomatic mother went to get tested at the health centre at Balli and had to wait in the heat in a long line for two-and-a-half hours. “It was a horrible experience for us. There is too much pressure on the staff. There was such a long queue, with people shouting and complaining. This has been happening for a year now, but the government can’t seem to get it right. They’re focussed on elections.” TOI also reported the delays caused in people getting their reports after testing, resulting in delays in treatment, after which the government advised people to begin treatment without waiting for the test results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-health-systems-stretched-people-struggle-to-get-tested/articleshow/82248831.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Pune||Hospitals appeal for onboarding final-yr nursing, medical students||done Pune: Big hospitals in the city are seeking deployment of final-year medical and nursing college students to take the burden off the existing staff in their facilities. These students can help doctors and nurses in basic procedures like checking the temperature and most importantly, in doing paperwork. The hospitals say there is a huge load on them to document everything, including updating bed availability in Covid-19 wards on the dashboard which can be done by these students. Bhomi Bhote, chief executive officer at Ruby Hall Clinic, called it a war situation where conventional norms need to be broken and timely decisions are necessary. “We have about 500 beds, but we don’t have the medical staff to support this capacity. We need to get the final year medical, nursing and paramedic students to work in the hospitals. When you fight a war, you don’t look at the qualifications, but you see the reserves and check how best you can use them. At least, they can assist others. There is so much paperwork, documentation and data entry jobs these students with medical backgrounds can do. Nurses and doctors can do their jobs. This will reduce the burden on them. If the government can pass such an order diverting at least final-year students to hospitals, it can really help,” he said. Norms in the Pandemic Act must restrict nurses from going abroad during a pandemic. “The burden on nurses has gone up by over 3-4 times and on top of that half of the nursing staff is testing positive for Covid. The availability of nurses has gone down by 50%. We need to increase this number. We run a college of nursing and all of them go abroad after two years of training. There should be guidelines saying that all medical staff need to work. No one should be allowed to stay home. We need all able hands,” he said. Vijay Natarajan, CEO at Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre, said the lack of adequate medical staff has stretched their capacity. “In the ICU, we had a 1:1 ratio of nurses and patients. Now, for non-invasive ventilation, we are doing 1:2 one nurse for two patients. In the wards, we had 1:6, but now it is 1:10. One of the reasons is attrition. Nurses are flying off to the Gulf or other countries. Even these countries are relaxing their norms and other eligibility conditions so that nurses can easily get jobs. The salaries offered by them are 10 times higher than what we give. We can have some guidelines so that nurses cannot resign unless they provide proof that they will be going to another Indian hospital to treat Covid patients. Currently, we are exporting our trained nurses when we are facing a shortage,” he added. He also felt that final-year nursing and medical students should be roped in for paperwork and services which will lessen the burden on the staff, leaving them more time to attend to patients. Ground Demands And Concerns Resident doctors’ associations say they are facing academic loss as they are diverted to Covid-19 duty Faculty members and senior doctors, apart from the core branch, are not sharing the responsibility in the Covid-19 centres Increased manpower to share the load, channelising all practising medical practitioners and nurses to work in Covid-19 units Making a dedicated Covid-19 unit post the surge so that resident doctors can focus on their own domain and non-Covid patients are attended to All resident doctors are diverted to Covid-19 duty which means soon there will be postgraduate doctors without expert domain knowledge quote These are unprecedented situations, but the administration can streamline the work by calling all doctors and nurses registered in the state to work. Their data is readily available. Secondly, while resident doctors are all working in Covid-19 ward, faculty members and non-core branch senior doctors are not. Most of them are not sharing the responsibility of Covid-19 patients, making postgraduate students work continuously Prashant Munde I Current advisor, former general secretary of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospitals-appeal-for-onboarding-final-yr-nursing-medical-students/articleshow/82247905.cms||Ardhra Nair

The ruling TRS has upped the ante against the opposition Congress and BJP. Ministers T Harish Rao, Satyavathi Rathod, V Srinivas Goud, Errabelli Dayakar Rao, Koppula Eshwar, Puvvada Ajay Kumar, Mahmood Ali among others stepping up the campaign in Greater Warangal, Khammam, Siddipet and other municipal bodies. While TRS is banking on welfare schemes and development done by the KCR-government, Congress is highlighting the failures of TRS and BJP governments in dealing with the Covid-19 situation. BJP is blaming the TRS government for not informing the people about the Centre’s financial contribution to the welfare schemes and development projects in Telangana. In view of a surge in Covid-19 cases, the state election commission has curtailed the campaigning days. As a result, campaigning will end at 5pm on April 27 instead of April 28. The polling is on April 30 to two municipal corporations, five municipalities and by-polls to nine other wards in various civic bodies. Transport minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar, who is leading the campaign for TRS in Khammam, said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has allotted over Rs 1,800 crore for development of the town, and appealed to the people not to get carried away by the misleading campaign of the opposition parties. BJP state president Bandi Sanjay, who campaigned in Khammam, said even the LED street lighting in the town was done with central funds. The Modi-government has been sponsoring several schemes and projects in Telangana but the TRS government is not informing the people. TPCC working president, Ponnam Prabhakar, said the TRS government in Telangana and the BJP government at the Centre have failed to rein in the corporate and private hospitals from fleecing Covid-19 patients. “Whatever development is visible in Khammam, the credit goes to previous Congress governments,” he said. Panchayat Raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao exuded confidence that the development and welfare programmes being implemented by the state government will help the party win the Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation polls. Welfare ministers Koppula Eshwar and Satyavathi Rathod too hit the hustings in Warangal on Sunday. Harish called upon the people to vote for the party, which has developed Siddipet as a model town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parties-scurry-to-make-most-of-curtailed-campaign-period/articleshow/82247902.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Lucknow||Govt nod to MLALAD funds for medical infra, O2 plants||Lucknow: The state government on Sunday allowed spending of MLA Local Area Development (MLALAD) funds on medical infrastructure, including setting up of oxygen plants in hospitals to firm up Covid care in the state. In an order issued on Sunday, principal secretary (rural development), K Ravindra Naik, said, MLALAD funds could be utilised for procurement of ICU ventilators, high-flow nasal cannula (HNFC), pipeline for oxygen in medical colleges and government hospitals, purchase of oxygen concentrator and machines for conducting RTPCR tests. Funds can also be utilised to set up additional beds in government hospitals and state medical colleges. The development comes days after a number of BJP MLAs, including cabinet minister Brijesh Pathak and Ayodhya MLA Ved Prakash Gupta, expressed willingness to dedicate a part of their MLALAD funds for treatment of Covid-19 patients. Last year, the state government had suspended the MLALAD to mop up Rs 2,500 crore for Covid care. This year, the state government decided to allocate MLALAD funds and released the first instalment of Rs 1.5 crore each for all legislators. According to the order, proposals of the MLA will be taken up by a district-level empowered committee. The usage of MLALAD for purchase of medical equipment vis-à-vis Covid care will be subject to directions and rules of the Union ministry of health and family welfare in terms of technical specifications and cost. The CMO of the district will be nominated as the custodian of the equipment. The purchase will also be subjected to mandatory audit on the direction of district authorities. Funds can be made available to Banaras Hindu University (BHU) and Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). The government order said arrangement would be for financial year 2021-22 only and would not be extended, while relaxing the condition that limits spend up to Rs 25 lakh for single work under MLALAD fund, in case of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-nod-to-mlalad-funds-for-medical-infra-o2-plants/articleshow/82248824.cms||---

The cases in April so far are almost double than that registered in March this year. In a new development, the city on Sunday received a mobile testing laboratory of SpiceHealth. The lab promises to increase the number of tests in the city and deliver quick results. In what was the second highest-ever spike in a day, the district reported 7,771 new cases on Sunday. Record 7,999 cases were registered just a day ago. The district had registered new high in cases for four consecutive days. The trend was broken was Sunday.

Swab samples of 57 were tested using RT-PCR. Of them, 12 came positive. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) in association with NGOs and public representatives should test all such people to contain spread of the disease,” said activist Amit Heda who had organized the camp with civic body’s help at Shivaji Nagar Hall . Since NMC did not enough RT-PCR kits at the camp, others took Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) and all came negative. The sensitivity of RAT is around 40%. The district on Sunday saw 87 deaths, increasing the toll to 6,936. It is for the eight consecutive day the district has district over 80 deaths.

The government re-introduced the digital pass system for travel as a measure to curb needless movement and contain the spread of the coronavirus. Deputy commissioner of police Shrinivas Ghadge said, “We have so far rejected 5,097 applications as the nature of travel cited in the pleas was trivial. We are in the process of deciding 2,500 applications. As of now, the travel purpose in 338 applications has lapsed.” People travelling by road in their personal vehicles for emergency/essential purposes within Pune city, district, inter-district or inter-state locations can secure permission from the city police by applying on covid19.mhpolice.in. Ghadge said, “We are trying our best to study and process all applications at the earliest. As of now, 16 police teams are working round-the-clock to process the applications. In most cases, people want to travel due to a medical emergency and are uploading medical certificates. Secondly, people want to travel to different places to attend the last rites or funeral of relatives. We are granting permissions on these reasons on priority.” “Some people even seek passes for trivial reasons, which are denied straight away, because in such cases people can just tell the reason for their travel to the personnel involved in the nakabandi operations and move on,” he said. People involved in emergency services, like hospital staff, doctors, bank officials, milk, fruit and vegetable vendors, medicine suppliers, government employees, are exempted. However, these persons must carry their identity cards with them while commuting, police said. While applying for e-passes, people must upload the necessary documents, like medical certificates or documents and, in case of the death of a relative, they must mention the relationship with the deceased person. In case of a wedding ceremony, people must upload a photograph of the invitation. If someone is traveling to board a train or flight, s/he can upload their ticket on the website to secure the permission, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-police-grant-over-3300-requests-for-e-pass-in-4-days/articleshow/82247911.cms||---

One of the men began hurling abuses at the hospital staff and reportedly pelted a stone that left the receptionist injured. Sources said that the hospital had asked the relatives to shift the patient to other Covid facility for treatment. There was reportedly some delay in bringing the patient out of the hospital which angered the relatives who resorted to violence. The hospital staff informed the cops who rushed to the spot. The district administration had recently asked the police department to deploy some staff at the hospitals to tackle such situations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/hospital-ransacked/articleshow/82246568.cms||---
---||Nagpur||That lockdown was positive, this one depressing: Citizens||NAGPUR: April 2020 was fully under lockdown and so is April 2021 so far. But there is a fundamental difference between these two lockdowns. The April 2020 nationwide lockdown had hope, positivity and sense of achievement. Unlike the April 2021 lockdown which is full of depression, fear and a sense of bereavement. “That (lockdown) was an initiative, while this lockdown is an obligation,” said Prof D Prasanna. “For me, it was a learning experience to conduct online classes, something I had never dreamt of. But this year, I’m missing the face to face interaction with students,” he said. Many from the field of education say they believed the phase last year would be temporary and that everything would be fine this session. “My son never went to school and reached Class II,” said Aparna Bhagat, a homemaker. “It has now become a challenge for parents to manage kids at home. They have become aggressive and have also stopped missing school and their friends. I wonder how my 8-year-old will react when schools reopen someday,” she added. For professionals who work from home, the 2021 lockdown is turning out to be quite irritating. “I have been working from home since more than a year now. We were hoping to start work from office in the next financial year. Instead, we got another year of WFH,” said software engineer Vinit Patel. Hrushikesh Niwal, who owns an automobile spare parts shop, said that the year has been tough. “We literally enjoyed last year’s lockdown as a relief from my packed schedule. I had a really good time with my family. But now I realize how devastating the shut-down is, especially for a person who runs a non-essential shop like me,” he said. People complained that they received some financial relief like the EMI waiver during the 2020 lockdown, but nothing like that was given this time around. For doctors, the present lockdown is psychologically upsetting. “In fact, we were unaware of the protocol and treatment last year. Still, there was hope and enthusiasm. This year, doctors too are exhausted,” said Dr Niraj Bhalawe, a resident doctor. Psychologist Anagha Pathak said people are mentally drained. “This lockdown is tougher than the last one. In April 2020, people were talking about the clean environment, low pollution levels, birds chirping, family life, and much more. This time, you don’t see anyone talking about such things any more despite the lockdown being as strict as last year,” she said. “This is because people are suffering from depression, helplessness, financial problems, uncertainty, guilt, phobia, alcoholism, disharmony in the family, internet addiction and many such psychological problems,” said senior psychiatrist Dr Vivek Kirpekar, who addressed a Covid Samvad on April 23. “There is fear among many that Covid-19 will affect them too. To overcome this fear, embrace positive thinking, engage in different activities, cultivate your hobbies, take children for some fun events that will create interest,” he said. “Today, I see many worries and fears about what will happen to the family if I get Covid, how to get hospital beds, what if I don't get oxygen. This fear and anxiety affects our body. This can lower your immune system. So, it is important to stay positive,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/that-lockdown-was-positive-this-one-depressing-citizens/articleshow/82247915.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The CM also ordered immediate availability of lifesaving Remdesivir injections to critical patients, while announcing the requisition of 1 crore vaccines from two firms to expedite inoculation. Yogi, who issued these directions after presiding over a high-level meeting through video conferencing to take stock of the pandemic, also announced the state would bear cost of treatment of patients, essentially in government hospitals. And for those in private hospitals, the government would foot the bills through Ayushman Bharat scheme. Expressing regret at the loss of lives in the pandemic, Yogi said, the government would bear the funeral cost of those who die of Covid. The CM said, the government’s order of 1 crore vaccines from private firms was over and above the Centre’s allocation to the state. This comes a week ahead of the vaccination of citizens above 18 years of age. He added the state government will ensure the new drug by Zydus Cadila, Virafin, which got approval of Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), is made available in Lucknow, Prayagraj and Varanasi. While asking officials to crack down on people spreading false information on social media to spread panic, the CM directed health and medical education department to take steps for raising number of beds in hospitals. “There should not be any shortage of beds,” he said, adding DMs and CMOs will be held accountable if any Corona patient is left in the lurch. Yogi said, the Covid hospital should make public availability of beds at least twice a day and strict action should be taken under Epidemic Act against private hospitals who charge more than stipulated cost. The CM maintained the supply of oxygen was normal and asked officials to ensure the higher allocation by the Centre for UP be piped to the state as soon as possible. This comes a day after Oxygen Express reached the state with 30,000 litres of lifesaving gas. Yogi also said, oxygen was also being airlifted and stocks replenished in the state. “No government or private hospital will face shortage of oxygen,” he said. The CM also asked the transport department to step in and help the government to raise number of tankers to ferry oxygen. He reiterated the government’s move to set up oxygen plants in hospitals with more than 100 beds be fast-tracked. Yogi said, the Centre has increased the allocation of Remdesivir injection to 1,60,000 vials and the state government would coordinate with private manufacturers to increase availability of vials, while reiterating that no Covid hospital in the state had a shortage of Remdesivir. It is available free of cost in government hospitals, while private hospitals can get the injection at a cost fixed by the Centre, he said. The CM insisted that distribution of the drug should be done in a transparent manner. At the same time, Corona patients in home isolation are provided medical kits comprising key medicines for a minimum period of seven days, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hosps-cant-refuse-patients-1cr-vaccine-order-given-cm/articleshow/82253855.cms||Pankaj Shah

Rawat, who was the chief minister during the first wave, said the state must first aim to bring down the daily spike of cases from 5,000 to 3,000. He also said that while he did not support a total statewide lockdown, which would result in unemployment and food crisis, the state must not hesitate to impose lockdowns in certain areas reporting a high number of cases. “Aaj ki sakhti humko kal hasayegi, aaj ki dhilai kal humko rulayegi (Today’s strictness will make us happy tomorrow, today’s reluctance will make us cry tomorrow)” the former CM said. “I have shared with the CM that the first aim should be to reduce the daily number of cases to 3,000 or situation the hills, with its limited health infrastructure, will spin out of control. The CM should ensure no one enters Covid care centres without a PPE kit. Social distancing should be followed everywhere. All Covid guidelines should be strictly implemented by police. The government should focus on hill districts that are witnessing a high positivity rate, like Champawat, which recorded a positivity rate of 30%. Testing should be increased and those that are tested should immediately be isolated, without waiting for results,” Rawat told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bringing-daily-cases-down-from-5k-to-3k-in-uttarakhand-should-be-priority-former-cm-trivdenra-rawat/articleshow/82246898.cms||Ishita Mishra

The party slammed Sawant for launching a publicity campaign on his birthday. Congress functionaries also questioned the government’s seriousness in curbing the spread of coronavirus, pointing out that tourism minister Manohar Agjaonkar was seen dancing in close proximity with people in a video being widely circulated on social media platforms. Calling it “irresponsible and insensitive” behaviour, the party said it shows how serious the state administration is about the pandemic. State Congress president Girish Chodankar said that Sawant released publicity material on his birthday to “hoodwink people” about the state government’s achievements. “The chief minister is just announcing measures, which are not getting implemented seriously. Night curfew is the best example which is not adhered to in the state,” he said. Congress vice-president Amarnath Panjikar said that Sawant has tried (by his address to the people) to imitate Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who he said is also obsessed with cheap publicity and self glorification. “It is shocking that the defective chief minister did not even leave his own birthday to take the opportunity to display his defects,” Panjikar said. Chodankar said the state government should take a cue from the Chhattisgarh Congress government where an indoor stadium at Raipur had been converted into a 360-bed hospital with ventilators and an oxygen plant. Further, he said Congress is ready to coordinate with Chhattisgarh and seek help for Goa. Meanwhile, Congress has announced its control room and helplines under the chairmanship of GPCC vice-president Dr Pramod Salgaocar. The people in need can call Everson Vales 7066196131 or the toll free number 02249558099.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govts-steps-to-mitigate-covid-crisis-only-on-paper-cong/articleshow/82248851.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||T shifts focus, more tests on symptomatics||Hyderabad: In a new strategy to tackle the surge of coronavirus, Telangana health authorities have been asked to focus on testing all symptomatic cases on top priority and thoroughly check secondary contacts for any symptoms, before conducting tests on the latter. According to the revised plan, health authorities said the first contacts, the family members (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and symptomatic first contacts will be tested on priority, while secondary contacts will be dissuaded from going to test centres, where they have a chance of contracting the virus. At present about 13 per cent of the tested people are secondary contacts. Reflecting on the testing pattern in place now, health minister Eatala Rajender during a teleconference instructed the health officials to test all the symptomatic people first. “Please test the symptomatic people irrespective of the area they come from. We have also written to the Centre, seeking more testing kits,” Rajender said at the conference. After it was observed that many asymptomatic people and secondary contacts largely gather at the PHCs and other test centres, health department has given the revised plan to the districts, officials said. “While all the required people will be tested, antigen tests will be conducted at the primary health care centers after the staff verify the symptoms of suspects,” said one official. Till the beginning of the second wave, the state conducted 40,000 to 50,000 tests everyday, both in government and private sectors. After the second struck, the government ramped up the testing and conducted more than one lakh tests daily. The revised antigen plan has 51,000 rapid antigen tests per day target for all the districts, with Hyderabad having a target of 8,500, while Rangareddy, Medchal, Nizamabad, Warangal Urban, Bhadradri have been given a target of around 2,000 tests daily. “People are not hesitant to get tested but panic should be avoided, we have enough test kits,” said an official. Each Primary Health Care Centre (PHC) has been given a limit to conduct 100 daily tests. The state has a capacity to conduct about 35,000 RT-PCR tests, in addition there will be tests in private sectors. “While It is very important to get tested even if slightest symptoms show up, but running hurriedly for testing centres and increasing the load on system and exposing themselves is not good,” Dr Ramesh Verama, a senior physician said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-shifts-focus-more-tests-on-symptomatics/articleshow/82248855.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Reminded of the pandemic situation, he said: "In our months of sitting on the Delhi borders, we have lost not a single farmer to Covid. The government should look into the election rallies in other states. Why are those being allowed?" Asked why the march to Parliament was called off, Charuni said: "To avoid any vilification of the farmers and their protest, and to not give the government a chance to accuse us of spreading Covid-19." Asked about the Ambala event, Charuni said: "The Bahujan society organised it to bring the country’s exploited people on a single platform. The agitation is not of farmers’ alone. The labourers and shopkeepers are also in it. It is of those who grow the grain and those who consume it." Charuni claimed that poverty and social discrimination had increased in the country, and "the entire business is being handed over to the corporate houses by amending the Constitution and silencing dissent." Reminded that the second wave was too serious, Charuni said: "We started the agitation in the corona period and we’d prefer to die protesting. If the government cares actually about our health, let it accept our demands and we’ll go home."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-free-to-take-jabs-but-no-forced-testing-charuni/articleshow/82247924.cms||---

He was admitted to Delhi’s St Stephen Hospital after he developed heart complications along with Covid-19. A recipient of Padma Bhushan, he was part of the famed vocalist brother duo of ‘Pandit Rajan Sajan Mishra’. Trained in the khayal style of Indian classical music by his grandfather’s brother Bade Ram Das Ji Mishra and father, Hanuman Prasad Mishra, Rajan and his younger brother Sajan performed extensively in India and abroad. Growing up in his ancestral house at Kashi’s musical lane — Kabirchaura — which housed legendary artistes, including Pandit Kishan Maharaj and Gudai Maharaj, he moved to Delhi with his brother Sajan in 1977, but never lost his association with Kashi and the Banaras Gharana. Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled Pandit Rajan Mishra’s death, saying the singer left his impression in the world of classical music. “Loss of an exponent from Banaras Gharana is an irreparable loss to the music world,” the PM tweeted. UP minister of state for tourism, religious affairs and culture Neelkanth Tiwari also expressed grief, saying music lovers in India and abroad are in shock. Also tutored in the classical style by their uncle and sarangi virtuoso, Gopal Prasad Mishra, the brother duo began performing in public while in their teens.

Their first performance abroad was at a concert in Sri Lanka in 1978, before they toured countries across the world, including Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria, USA, UK, The Netherlands, Russia, Singapore, Qatar and Bangladesh. They launched 20 music albums of the khayal style, semi-classical tappa and bhajans. The brother duo was conferred with Padma Bhushan in 2007, Sangeet Natak Akademi award in 1998, Gandharwa National Award in 1994-1995 and the National Tansen Samman 2011-12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/padma-bhushan-vocalist-rajan-mishra-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82248862.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The Southern Command in Pune stated that to ensure a safe and secure environment in civil society, it undertook the operation “Visphotak Mukt Bandargah,” involving disposal of the unexploded ordnance that had possibly been collected inadvertently by some factories and steel scrap yards over the last few years in Mumbai, Kanpur, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Gujarat. The Army launched the operation on the directions of the ministry of defence to ensure a safe environment for all citizens settled in and around the identified locations. “Over 8 lakh kg of unidentified explosive objects (UXO), with a total explosive content of over 2,000kg of RDX and TNT, was disposed of by the team across various locations in Mumbai alone,” a senior Army officer said. Most of these explosives were either used by private agencies for construction works or were seized by the customs, police and other security agencies, he added. As it could pose danger to the lives of the public, the ministry of home affairs made a plan for disposal of the unexploded ordnance through the Army, the officer said. The command had carried out a similar operation in the industrial areas of Tamil Nadu in the recent past and had cleared hundreds of acres of land of the UXO, another Army official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/army-disposes-of-1600-metric-tonnes-of-unexploded-ordnance/articleshow/82247938.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Goa||BJP’s priority was polls, not people’s lives: Digambar Kamat||PANAJI: Flaying the state government for its failure to prepare for the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, opposition leader Digambar Kamat on Sunday said that it was time for people to take control of their own health as no help could be expected from the state government. Kamat also criticised chief minister Pramod Sawant for constantly ignoring the suggestions and recommendations made by the opposition and the medical experts. “People should stop expecting and counting on this government for help and should instead take steps to protect themselves,” Kamat said in an online broadcast message to the state. The broadcast comes a day after the chief minister addressed the state. Stating that it is time for the government to introspect, Kamat said that though the BJP government at the Centre and in Goa had a year to prepare for the second Covid-19 wave, the country’s situation proves that the BJP did nothing in the last one year. He also slammed the state administration for ignoring calls for a task force with experts from civil society and the Army Medical Corps to be set up to tackle the pandemic. Blaming the BJP for wrong priorities, he said that the BJP had focused on elections, celebrations and token gestures instead of investing in health care infrastructure, employment and industrial growth. “The opposition has been demanding a white paper on Covid-19, on the state finances and Mhadei, and many other demands were made before the government, which this government has ignored. This government only makes statements and announcements but nothing is implemented,” the Margao MLA said. Urging the state government to get its act together, Kamat urged Sawant to control and monitor the people who are entering the state. “There needs to be control on the influx of people. The government needs to make it compulsory to have Covid-19 negative certificates while entering Goa,” he said. The Congress MLA also made a fervent appeal to the candidates for the municipal council elections and their supporters to avoid crowding and gathering on Monday when the election results for five municipal councils will be announced. “The municipal election results will be announced and I humbly ask all the supporters and candidates not to crowd around. Please don’t take out victory marches,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjps-priority-was-polls-not-peoples-lives-kamat/articleshow/82248865.cms||---

The event was organised on behalf of Palwan village and was attended by BKU state youth wing president Ravi Azad and district BKU president Azad Singh Palwan. BJP cancelled its programme as farmers and members of the Dalit community threatened to oppose it. Addressing the gathering, Ravi Azad said BJP state president O P Dhankar, Hisar MP Brijendra Singh and education minister Kanwar Pal Gurjar were expected to attend an event to be organised by the ruling coalition of the BJP and JJP to mark Ambedkar Jayanti in Jind. They said even though Ambedkar Jayanti was celebrated on April 14, ruling party leaders could not arrive on the scheduled day. BKU Azad Singh Palwan said, “We have dared them to enter Jind district as farmers’ organisations had given the call to boycott ruling party leaders. BJP leaders failed to turn up after farmers declared to oppose them.” Ravi Azad said that they would continue to oppose events of ruling coalition leaders till the three agriculture laws were scrapped. Several leaders of the SC community said they would not allow BJP to divide the society. They said the saffron party is trying to crush the agitation by dividing people on caste and religious lines. “We have a strong bond with farmers for a long time and will continue to support them till their demands are met,” said Kamal Chauhan, Sagar Singhal and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-protesting-at-toll-plaza-celebrate-ambedkar-jayanti/articleshow/82247934.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Hemkund Yatra postponed due to rising Covid-19 cases||DEHRADUN: Amid spiralling Covid-19 cases, the officials of Gurudwara Shri Hemkund Sahib Management trust on Sunday decided to postpone the Hemkund Yatra indefinitely. The shrine, where Guru Gobind Singh is said to have meditated, was earlier scheduled to open from May 10. The Gurudrawar trust, in a letter issued on Sunday, maintained that the next date for the opening of the shrine has not been decided and the trust will inform the Sangat (congregation) as and when it is done. Last year too, the opening of the portals of the Hemkund shrine was postponed to September from May. Situated at a height of over 15,000 feet, the shrine is visited by Sikh devotees from across the country and abroad. During winter, the area remains snow-clad and the thick cover of snow starts melting after April. Hemkund Sahib witnesses thousands of pilgrims every year. According to the tourism department data, the shrine witnessed 2.83 lakh devotees in 2019, 1.5 lakh people in 2018, 1.3 lakh in 2017, 1 lakh in 2016, 70,816 in 2015, 37,458 in 2014, and 78,051 in 2013.

---||Amritsar||Punjab: Gram panchayat booked for forcing Dalit to leave village||BATHINDA: A case has been registered against a village panchayat for forced eviction of a Dalit over allegations of burglary. Ram Singh, a Dalit who was banished from Virk Kalan village, had approached the Punjab State Scheduled Castes Commission for help after the panchayat issued a notice last February, asking him to leave the village in seven days. Police registered the case on Saturday, following the commission’s April 19 order to the Bathinda deputy commissioner and the SSP to initiate disciplinary action on the complaint. Bathinda SSP Bhupinderjit Singh Virk said the case has been registered as per the recommendation of the commission. As the SC/ST Act is not made out against persons belonging to Scheduled Castes, it will be investigated how many panchayat members are Dalits and those from the general category will be booked. Filed under Section 3(1)(z) of Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015, the case pertains to forcing or causing a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe to leave his house, village or other place of residence. The commission has also directed the social justice, empowerment and minorities department to provide compensation to the victim under the compensation policy. The commission’s two-member team had visited the village and found the facts of the complaint to be true. Ram Singh, who worked as a labourer, used to do sewa at the village dera, from where an ox was stolen on the night of February 10. A case was registered against him and an unknown person. Ram Singh was arrested and sent to judicial custody. In the meanwhile, the village panchayat issued a written notice on February 29, 2020, asking his family to either leave the village in seven days or face forced ouster. As Ram Singh was in jail, his wife, daughter, and son left the village on March 5 and began staying at Jawaherewala village in Muktsar. Since his daughter was pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer applications and his son was in Class XII, they had to face harassment in continuing their studies. After getting bail, Ram Singh filed complaints with the district administration and the commission. “We suffered a lot during this one year and studies of the children too were badly disturbed. The family had to face a stigma and stay away from home,” he said. Village sarpanch Gurcharan Singh said the panchayat members and villagers had collectively taken the decision after Ram Singh was accused of theft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/gram-panchayat-booked-for-forcing-dalit-to-leave-village/articleshow/82247933.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad scientists: ‘Double mutant’ virus split 3-way||HYDERABAD: The double mutant, B.1.617, which is predominantly found in Maharashtra and to a lesser extent in other parts of the country, has diverged further to give three sub-lineages. These sub-lineages are now technically called B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3, top scientists said on Sunday. City scientists, who studied these new sub-lineages or mutants, however, say that more research is required to find out if they are more potent or dangerous as compared to other variants now in circulation. Besides Maharashtra and Kerala, the ‘double mutant’ is present in Telangana and AP, where its percentage in Covid-19 positive cases varies from 5 to 10 per cent. In Maharashtra, it is present in about 70 per cent of the cases registered of late. Health experts attribute the spurt in cases in Maharashtra and other parts of the country to the new local variants, including B.1.617, but scientists point out that more research is needed to link the sudden rise in positivity and severity of infections, including high mortality. Stating that the lineage B.1.617 has now been divided into three sub-lineages as B.1.617 has further diverged, Divya Tej Sowpati, a top scientist at the city-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, tweeted “at present, I am not aware of these sub-lineages being associated with any epidemiological or clinical significance”. Explaining the main differences among the three sub-lineages of the B.1.617 lineage, he said B.1.617.1 is the largest sub-lineage and has both the original mutations of concern, L452R and E484Q. Even the subset of samples with the third mutation of concern, V382L, also fall into this lineage. Referring to the second sub-lineage B.1.617.2, Divya Tej tweeted “this sub-lineage has "lost" one of the two mutations of concern, E484Q, and mutated back to the original. While not as large as B.1.617.1, these sequences are also in large frequency (about 19% of all B.1.617 sequences…)”. The third lineage, B.1.617.3 was originally assigned into the lineage B.1.596, presumably because of the mutation N:P67S. The B.1.617 is characterized by more than 15 mutations but it got dubbed as the “double mutant” because of two spike mutations, L452R and E484Q, which were mutations of concern because of their immune escape properties, and possible high infectivity. “What's more, there are several sequences of B.1.617, which don't have the E484Q mutation, now sampled in India and elsewhere. This means it's not even the “double mutant” anymore. About the so-called triple mutant, he said it is a misnomer because it has many more defining mutations. “Dubbed triple because in addition to the two mutations, it also has V382L in its spike. This is a sub-lineage of B.1.617, found mainly in Maharashtra samples and a bit in other states. The extra mutation, V382L, is just a mutation of ‘interest’ at this point,” he added. He said given the behaviour of “triple mutant”, it is probably less likely to be “destructive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-scientists-double-mutant-virus-split-3-way/articleshow/82248868.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Nagpur||People who get Covid between shots can get second vax dose after 2 months||NAGPUR: Some people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 after receiving their first shot of the vaccine and before receiving their second shot. Such people should first recover from Covid-19 and then wait for at least 8 weeks before taking the second dose, said experts. While the number of people testing positive after first dose is very less, the same is significantly high in the second wave, especially in Vidarbha. Many people who have taken first shot are testing positive before the due date of second shot. It is very much possible as vaccination is not protection from the infection, but protection from severe disease. “One should wait for two months, after 14 days of isolation from time of first symptoms, to get the second jab,” said Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist. “Vaccines protect against moderate or severe disease and hospitalization. Most such mid-way infections are mild,” said Dr Shinde. According to him, the Covid-19 standard cycle is of 14 days. So, one should wait for two months after the completion of 14 days to get second jab of vaccine. At present, there are two vaccines available in India and both have different time frame between first and second jab. For Covaxin, second jab is to be taken 28 days after first while for Covishield, it is advisable to wait up to 8 weeks for the second jab. The chances of getting infected in between are always there. “As 18+ citizens start getting vaccines from May 1, it’s always possible that some youths, who behave irresponsibly after taking vaccine may get infected before second jab,” said Dr Anjali Agrawal. “We must tell such people that they have to wait for more than 75 days for their second jab, after which they will be considered as fully vaccinated,” she added. Fully vaccinated certificate could become a necessary document soon for travels and job purposes. So, it would be better for 18+ youths to strictly follow Covid appropriate behaviour after first dose and avoid getting infected in between, said the experts. Doctors also said there are chances of people getting infected even after second dose too. “But, this infection will be very mild and recovery is assured,” said Dr Agrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/people-who-get-covid-between-shots-can-get-second-vax-dose-after-2-months/articleshow/82247952.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Rather than pointing to the shortcomings of the government, we should all come together to overcome this pandemic,” said NIT Goa director Gopal Mugeraya. During the first wave, the NIT Goa hostel facilities were used to house asymptomatic patients along with the hostel facilities of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Goa. “The last time around, the building was taken over in a hurry to house the patients and we did not have time to spruce up. This time, we decided to be prepared with better facilities for the patients. We have painted the building, installed new bathroom fittings, made provision for drinking water facilities and have sanitised the spaces,” Mugeraya said. The hostel is located at the temporary premises of the NIT at Farmagudi in Ponda. “To be able to provide better environment to those housed at NIT Goa hostel, open common areas will be available to patients to breathe in fresh air as well,” he said.

He said BJP leaders were spreading falsehood, claiming that there was no shortage of oxygen. Akhilesh tweeted to demand free tests, free vaccination and free treatment of all Covid-19 patients across the state. “Reports of rampant black marketing of medicines and medical equipment only reflect the failure of the government in handling the crisis,” he said, adding that instead of pushing for uniform pricing of vaccination, the government must ensure free vaccination of everyone. He questioned the government for handling negligent senior officers with kids gloves. “Those who failed to warn the government of the impending crisis should be taken to task and punished to send a message to the administration that such criminal laxity will not be tolerated. But the government has chosen to look the other way,” Akhilesh said. “Instead of threatening people who are already facing such hardships the government should reach out to them with medicines and oxygen cylinders,” said SP leader Rajendra Chaudhary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dont-gag-people-give-them-relief/articleshow/82248869.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Mayor Jai Prakash said the civic body was under tremendous financial crunch. Civic employees, especially medical and sanitation personnel, are putting in their best efforts day and night in fighting the pandemic and contain the spread of the virus, he said. The corporation is running two Covid hospitals — Hindu Rao and RBI PMT — with around 260 beds. During a pandemic, it is a matter of deep concern that the corporation is not in a position to pay salaries, said Jai Prakash. “Doctors, nurses and paramedical staff have not been paid their salaries for the past two months; even safai karamcharis have not received their salary for February and March. They are carrying out their duties despite great risks to their lives,” he added. The mayor said he had requested Delhi government to release the grants in aid for the first quarter of the current financial year. “Civic officials have personally pursued the case with different departments, including urban development department, and requested them to release the funds on priority. But as on today, not a single penny has been released,” he added. The mayor said the city could not afford to have health and sanitation workers with low moral at this juncture. Stating that the north corporation’s financial situation is in dire state, Jai Prakash sought chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s timely intervention to immediately release the first instalment of the grants in aid for the financial year 2021-22. The mayor said the immediate release of Rs 460 crore would help the north corporation tide over the current crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/reeling-under-cash-crunch-covid-corpn-seeks-funds/articleshow/82247974.cms||---

The Chandigarh administration offered and showed two sites to the Army officers so that any one site could be selected. “The Chandigarh administration has shown Sector 24-based Indira Holiday Home and International Hostel, situated on the PU campus, Sector 14, for setting up the hospital. Since key modalities like manpower, infrastructure and facility to critical patients on the level of the Army are yet to be decided, things are on deliberation mode and will be finalised soon,” said a senior UT officer. The India Army has set up a hospital in New Delhi and is in the process to setting up more in other cities too. The Army officers of Chandimandir had met the senior UT officers a few days back. Not only this, deliberations are also being done on the level of the administrator also so that this exercise can be materialised. Sources in the UT administration revealed that since manpower is the biggest issue for them, the UT is expecting adequate manpower from the Army so that with this new 100-bed hospital, they don’t face any manpower issue. “We will provide possible infrastructure and other related facilities, but manpower is a major issue and we require it from the Army. Moreover, as our hospitals are also getting occupied fully, we are hoping that they will also help us in this matter too,” said sources.

Taking serious note of rising cases in the taluka, Sattari Mamlatdar Dasharath Gawas recently convened a joint meeting and directed the local authorities to take strict action against those violating SOPs and health guidelines. During the meeting the plan of action and safety precautions to be taken in the wake of drastic rise in Covid cases in Sattari taluka was discussed. Mamlatdar Dasharath Gawas directed police to monitor wedding venues to ensure that Covid norms are not violated and to depute personnel in market areas in the mornings when a large number of labourers assemble looking for odd jobs. He also directed the secretaries of panchayats and officials of the municipality to revoke licences of public halls if any functions are held without adhering to Covid norms. “Shops will be closed at 10 pm and inspection will be done by police, intensify the curfew at night and implement strict measures. Fine those not wearing masks and caught flouting norms enforced by the state authorities,” Gawas said, even as he urged people to follow the guidelines and help the authorities to flatten the Covid curve. Joint mamlatdar Sanjivini Satardekar told the elected representatives to assist the authorities in tracing and testing family members of positive patients. “We will be sharing a list of positive patients with all the elected representatives so that their family members remain under supervision. Village temple committees should be asked to avoid large gatherings for any rituals,” Satardekar said. In-charge of the Valpoi Community Health Centre, Dr Shyam Kankonkar said that cases were increasing rapidly in Valpoi and other parts of Sattari due to people’s negligence. “The entire system is working tirelessly, but people are taking it very lightly,” Kankonkar said. Meanwhile, Valpoi police have collected over Rs 2 lakh in fines for not wearing face masks or following social distancing norms in public places, till date. The Valpoi Municipal Council has collected around Rs 10,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sattari-to-crack-down-on-covid-norms-violations/articleshow/82248901.cms||---

A sharp increase in the number of critical cases has pushed the demand for ventilators to an all-time high. While private hospitals continue to turn away patients saying there are no beds, the three Covid-designated government hospitals -- Gandhi Hospital, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS), and King Koti hospital -- had a long waitlist for ventilators. “There is not a single ventilator free. Although many get vacated through the day, there are at least 5-6 more patients waiting for each of those ventilators. Beds get filled up in minutes,” a top doctor from the Gandhi Hospital said. “In fact, waiting for a ventilator to get free when a patient dies has become a norm now,” he said. Telangana has an estimated 4,000 ventilator beds in both private and government sectors. On Sunday, the state had an active caseload of 63,000, and the health ministry says close to 2% of the infected patients require ventilators. Private hospitals, be they small or large, too, are in the same boat, but they have a shorter wait list as their patients approach multiple hospitals at the same time. “When the condition of my uncle suddenly deteriorated three days ago, we were asked to shift him and we started looking for a ventilator bed. It took us one day and Rs 1 lakh in cash to get an assurance from one of the hospitals. It was the only option among 8 hospitals we visited. After reaching there we waited for nearly 12 hours, before a ventilator got free when the patient died,” Subhash Kumar, the relative of a patient, said. In addition to the patients coming from various other hospitals in the city, majority of the critical patients from districts are redirected to city hospitals and tertiary care centres of the government. “While many district hospitals have ventilator beds, they are unable to use them due to lack of other supporting departments and are forced to send them to Hyderabad. As a result, there is a persistent shortage of ventilator beds,” Dr Sashidhar Reddy, president of Junior Doctors Association (JUDA) at Gandhi Hospital, said. Studies comparing the first and the second wave show that the percentage of Covid patients becoming critical is similar. “The issue here is the sheer volume of patients, which has increased exponentially and suddenly. Our healthcare infrastructure was already fragile and is completely overwhelmed by the volume of critical patients. Moreover, there has not been any significant increase in the number of oxygen, ICU, or ventilator beds now, compared to the first wave and as a result we have this huge shortage leading to several patients waiting for one ventilator,” Dr P Raghu Ram, public health expert and director of KIMS Ushalakshmi centre for breast diseases, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/infra-overrun-5-patients-wait-for-every-ventilator-bed-in-hyd-hosps/articleshow/82248892.cms||Amrita Didyala

Found across the Himalayan belt, southern China and southeast Asia, the rare rodent species is found at elevations of 1,800m and above. But in what has surprised wildlife experts, a pair of red giant flying squirrels was spotted at Thal town in Pithoragarh at a low 880-m altitude. “It is a nocturnal species. But on Thursday, I saw them during the day, scurrying around in trees near the forest here,” said Chhabi Pathak, who spotted the pair and took photographs. “It is commonly found between 1800m and 2200m. It is a surprise that it was spotted at an elevation of 880m,” said Jyoti Prakash, a research fellow at the Uttarakhand forest research wing, which is working on a project on the species. Its name comes from the “gliding” motion it appears to move in between trees, spreading the skin between its limbs. “It is one of 13 flying squirrel species found in India, of which four (this one, woolly flying squirrel, Indian giant flying squirrel and white bellied flying squirrel) are found in the hills of Uttarakhand — Pithoragarh, Nainital, Tehri and Uttarkashi,” said Prakash. “This species is nocturnal and wanders about 2-3 sq km in search of food at night. It feeds on pine cones, ficus tree fruits, nuts and leaves.” Prakash believed the sighting at Thal indicates “altitudinal variation and adaptation” of the species. Uttarakhand chief conservator of forests Manoj Chandran said, “The presence of dense forests at low altitudes may have drawn it down … Flying squirrels are very important to the forest ecosystem. They play a significant role in the expansion of forests by facilitating seed dispersal and pollination.” He added, “At present, the population of this species is decreasing because of indiscriminate felling of trees, causing habitat loss.” Logging, agriculture, dam construction and urbanisation have also been threatening its habitat, according to IUCN. It is also harvested for pet and fur trade in parts of south Asia. As part of a conservation plan, the Uttarakhand forest research wing has been studying its habitat distribution pattern. “It will help us come up with comprehensive strategies to conserve the species,” Uttarakhand chief conservator of forests (research) Sanjeev Chaturvedi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rare-flying-squirrel-spotted-in-ukhand-town-more-than-1000m-below-habitat/articleshow/82246960.cms||Prem Punetha

The local station house officer (SHO) wasted no time after he was told about the social media post. Head constable Ajay arranged an ambulance and also counselled the duo who seemed depressed over their condition. The cop shifted them to a hospital. More such instances of Delhi Police extending an helping hand were reported on Sunday. They made a green corridor to ensure Dharmshila Hospital in east Delhi received 20 big oxygen cylinders in a short time. ESI Hospital in Vivek Vihar had around two hours of oxygen left, when SHO Ajay Kumar arranged some cylinders from a private hospital and more through Delhi government officials. A truck driver carrying oxygen for Safdarjung Hospital said farmers had blocked his usual route. The cops reached Sector 62, Noida and used the wrong carriageway to help him reach the hospital when it was left with just 10 minutes’ supply. Twenty-nine cylinders were arranged for Jeevan Hospital in Sunlight Colony. The Greater Kailash police also got a cylinder for a dentist and his son, and 60 for Batra Hospital. Delhi Heart and Lungs Hospital on Panchkuian Road was low on oxygen when the cops managed to get cylinders from Naraina. Another 44 cylinders were provided to NKS Hospital in Gulabi Bagh and a tanker was escorted to St Stephen’s Hospital. Police also got food for 650 people in collaboration with Nirankari Mandal in north Delhi’s Mukherjee Nagar. Food packets and masks were also distributed in Shalimar Bagh, Azadpur and Model Town. They also performed the last rites of an unidentified man found dead in Lajpat Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-help-people-oxygen-cylinders-reach-hospitals/articleshow/82247990.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: From crowded jails, prisoners walk out to isolation and hunger||When 55-year-old Amol* walked out of the gates of Taloja Central Jail in April last year, he had his priorities in place: see his wife, find a job and settle back into the landscape he hadn’t seen in almost a year. His joy was short-lived. When everyone went into ‘lockdown’ last year, things were different for people locked in prison. To depopulate the country’s infamously overcrowded jails and curb the virus spread, states decided to set free convicts and undertrials on temporary bail. While that sounded like good news at first, the newly liberated found themselves thrown into the wilderness at a time when nature wasn’t very welcoming. Being released early meant that prisoners like Amol did not have time to prepare for their freedom. “It was so sudden that my family did not know of my release nor did I have any money to continue my journey back home. I walked for more than 10kms to reach Panvel station, only to find that there were no trains to board either so I spent the night on the platform and hitched a ride on a tempo to get home,” narrates Amol, who was arrested for the alleged theft of a car. In a year, since his release, Amol has lost and found at least five jobs and been struggling to sustain his family while keeping them safe. Omar* on the other hand was more than 100 kilometres away from his home in Mahad when he was released. Soon after, the 31-year-old was shunted out twice — first from a fellow inmate’s house where he sought shelter on the first night and then by locals in his own village fearing that he might be carrying the virus. He wound up at a shelter in Kalamboli. “Most people like Omar are barely literate and unskilled so finding a job too became impossible in the lockdown. Out of anxiety and isolation, he’s started drinking and veering towards antisocial ways again,” rues Manohar Pansekar, a social worker at Taloja Jail. While the release has turned out to be more punishing for the likes of Amol and Omar re-entering a bewildered world with home, food, job, and medical care tougher to find, the pandemic has hit anyone who has served time, especially hard. A recently published rapid assessment study conducted between May and July 2020 by Prayas (a field action project of the Centre for Criminology and Justice at TISS) that interviewed 503 persons affected by the criminal justice system in the country aged 15-75 years — released prisoners, families of prisoners, children and youth in conflict with law, and women discharged from shelter homes — revealed that “a staggering 88% lost their source of income during the lockdown”. Given that 45% of them lived in rented housing and did not have continued earnings after the lockdown, finding a home to shelter in emerged as a major crisis putting many at risk of “being thrown out or threatened to be thrown out by their landlords.” “Within five days of the lockdown we started getting desperate calls from people we work with that they had no food or livelihood. Apart from providing immediate relief we felt the need to capture the experiences of these people — an invisible group that gets processed by the criminal justice system — and by virtue of that get stigmatised,” said TISS professor and Prayas project director Vijay Raghavan describing how reentering society after days behind bars has always been a tough transition for former prisoners. Often regarded as social exiles undeserving of help, the pandemic has only “exacerbated” the myriad challenges of unemployment, lack of housing, income and other hardships they face. “Many said that when organisations came to distribute rations in their area, they came to know after the distribution was over,” adds Raghavan. The study also drew attention to the distinctive struggles of women ex-offenders during the lockdown. Out of the mere 12% of respondents with continued income, only 26% constituted women, forcing the majority of them to take loans. “Which clearly indicates the risks involved for women respondents who might be driven to destitution, sexual exploitation, or illegal activities, due to economic pressures,” reads the report. Furthermore, women released from custody — in their attempt to ward off stigma — remain hidden from public view and often miss out on supportive services. The report also highlights the heightened anxiety of prisoner families during this period due to the stoppage of mulakat or prison visits, delays in trials and difficulty in meeting legal expenses. Warm, stable relationships that can often be an antidote to crime, evade them too. “No one wants to marry people with a history of incarceration. Even those who have family lack a strong bond. It’s worse for women prisoners. Neither parents nor in-laws want to accept them,” says Chandrakant Shinde, who works with male youth offenders in Maharashtra prisons. With greater social exclusion and barrier to basics, the propensity of young offenders to spiral back into a life of crime is higher, fear social workers as the pandemic rages on. Vivek* was 26 when he faced his first criminal charge: a string of robberies. “I got into bad company and committed a crime that I regret,” recalls Vivek who spent seven years at Mumbai Central Prison before ageing out of the system. “I started working for the disabled, did an electrician’s course, took up cable fixing jobs... but no matter what I did, neighbours remained wary of me and no girl wanted to marry me. When Covid struck I became lonelier than I already was. I’d lost my parents, had no work, no earnings and old gang members started blackmailing me to join them,” says Vivek, now 45 who fled his Nalasopara home and found refuge in a shelter for the urban homeless in Dombivli. “Vivek stayed the course but young prisoners are vulnerable to the complex atmosphere of jails where they befriend offenders with the wrong kind of influence,” explains Shinde. “During insecure times like these, they tend to fall back on those old mates and find recourse in illegal activities for easy money.” To stave off a postprison life of destitution, exploitation or crime, “collaborative efforts between government agencies and civil society” apart from coping strategies like skill training, monetary assistance for self-employment and subsistence kits, the report stressed, was the need of the hour. *Names changed on request||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-from-crowded-jails-prisoners-walk-out-to-isolation-and-hunger/articleshow/82247993.cms||Mohua Das
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra will give 18-45 group free vaccination at govt, civic hospitals: NCP||MUMBAI: Cabinet minister Nawab Malik of the NCP on Sunday announced free Covid-19 vaccination for all citizens in the 18-45 age group in government and municipal hospitals across the state. Later in the day, cracks appeared to develop in the MVA government on the issue. Environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted: “The official policy of the vaccination will be declared by the empowered committee and we must await its recommendation for a fair policy for all sections of society.” Earlier in the day, Thackeray had endorsed the statement on free vaccination by Malik, who is also the spokesperson of the NCP. Free vaccination: State govt may announce its final decision soonNCP minister Nawab Malik and the public health department on Sunday estimated Rs 4,800 crore would be the bill the state would have to foot if free Covid-19 vaccination is conducted for six crore persons in the 18-45 age group. The government expects to secure a dose for Rs 400. A final decision on whether the vaccine shots will be free is expected soon. Earlier in the day, before Shiv Sena minister Aaditya Thackeray had tweeted that the decision on free shots was best left to an empowered committee, Malik had gone ahead and announced free vaccination. “The NDA government [at the Centre] has taken the responsibility of free vaccination of all citizens above 45,” Malik had said. “We felt that as a responsible state, we should take care of citizens in the age of group of 18 to 45.” On Saturday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had declared in Pune that his government would invite global tenders for the supply of vaccines and the antiviral remdesivir injections and that a committee headed by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte would draft a comprehensive action plan for the procurement. Pawar had taken the view that those who can afford the vaccine should pay for it. A bureaucrat said Kunte had presided over the first meeting of the high-powered committee and worked out an action plan for the global tenders and provision of free vaccines. The committee may negotiate with leading vaccine manufacturers on prices. When the cabinet took up the proposal to provide free vaccines to the 18-45 age group, there was a discussion on whether the state should still keep the photograph of PM Narendra Modi on the final vaccination certificate. Malik objected to the photo, saying if the state was bearing the full vaccination cost, it would be apt to replace the PM’s picture with one of CM Uddhav Thackeray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/free-vaccination-maharashtra-govt-may-announce-its-final-decision-soon/articleshow/82248920.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Chandigarh||Family dumped newborn girl to hide minor’s pregnancy: Police||Fatehabad: Police here have arrested the grandmother, father, uncle and an aunt of a minor girl for allegedly dumping her newborn child near Barseen village on April 23. As it has unfolded that the newborn’s mother is a minor, police would be investigating the rape angle in the case. The family had abandoned the baby to keep the minor’s pregnancy a secret. After the police were informed that a newborn girl was abandoned, a case was registered. Police said Rajesh Kumar said the earlier FIR only had the charge of Section 317 (exposure and abandonment of child under twelve years, by parent or person having care of it) of the Indian Penal Code, and now Section 376 (rape) of IPC and sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act will be added to the FIR. Police investigation has revealed that on April 23 morning, the girl’s family members went to a private hospital and told a doctor there that the girl had a stomachache. When the doctor examined her, it was found she was pregnant and she was about to deliver the baby. The doctor asked the family to take the girl to a gynaecologist, but the family said she had a stomach ache and nothing had happened, police said. After this, the family did not take her from the hospital. It has been claimed that the girl delivered the baby in the hospital toilet. The family then wrapped the baby in a cloth and took it out of the hospital. They then used a bag used for packing cement from an under-construction building, put the newborn in it and dumped her. The minor is with her family and police will take her statement soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/family-dumped-newborn-girl-to-hide-minors-pregnancy-police/articleshow/82247980.cms||---
---||Nagpur||No problem in taking Covid-19 vaccine even during periods: Doctors||NAGPUR: Misconceptions and fake news have already started spreading about vaccine for all 18+ citizens. Apart from regular WhatsApp forwards holding vaccine responsible for impotency, DNA change, and cardiac arrest, the latest and most circulated one is about the vaccination for women during their menstrual cycle. Experts have debunked all these theories. “Don’t take vaccine before and after 5 days of your periods because immunity will be very less during periods. Doses of vaccine first decrease immunity later it builds immunity. So, there is a high risk of attack for one who is vaccinated during periods,” reads the message being circulated on social media platforms across the country. Gynecologists are getting a lot of queries because of this post. TOI spoke to expert doctors, who out right rejected the claims in it. “There is no scientific basis to support this. Don’t fall for rumours. There is no reason not to get vaccinated during periods. No guidelines list menstruation as a reason to put off the vaccine,” said Dr Vaidehi Marathe, former president of Nagpur Obstetrics and Gynaecology Society (NOGS). “This change of immunity with menstruation is very theoretical and never proved. The link that is being circulated with this message is not even a scientific journal and written by a freelance journalist and not a doctor or a research scientist,” she clarified. “If immunity is so much of concern then how people with all comorbidities, patients who had organ transplants, and who are on immunosuppressive medication are being vaccinated?” asked Dr Alka Mukherjee, president of NOGS. “It takes a huge amount of work for arranging vaccination, especially in remote areas. Vaccination teams, administration teams, vaccine carriers etc needs huge system involvement. Such controversial messages may hamper the vaccination program if women refuse jabs just because of being in periods,” she added. “Under the circumstances, vaccination is very important and this controversy should not have upper hand or cause confusion,” said Dr Sushma Deshmukh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-problem-in-taking-covid-19-vaccine-even-during-periods-doctors/articleshow/82247986.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||India||Active cases may peak at 38-48 lakh in mid-May: Experts||NEW DELHI: With the huge number of daily Covid-19 cases showing no signs of easing in the next two-three weeks, IIT scientists working on a mathematical model to predict the course of the pandemic on Sunday revised both the timing and value of peak cases, saying the peak for ‘active’ infections may touch 38-48 lakh cases during May 14-18 while the peak for ‘new’ infections hitting 4.4 lakh in the next 10 days. “I have now computed a range of values for peak value and timing and the final numbers should be within this range. Reason for this uncertainly is that the parameter values for the last phase continue to drift,” tweeted Manindra Agrawal of IIT-Kanpur, involved with the national ‘super model’ initiative, while referring to the updates on peak timing and peak value.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); “Peak timing: May 14-18 for active infections and May 4-8 for new infections. Peak value: 38-48 lakh for active infections and 3.4-4.4 lakh for new infections,” Agrawal tweeted on Sunday. He had told TOI last week about the importance of such prediction despite the risk of going off the mark, noting that such an exercise through mathematical model was important for preparing policymakers for a proper response mechanism in terms of medical preparedness, supplies and facilities. Read AlsoCovid-19: Second wave has shaken country, says PM ModiThe second wave of Covid-19 infections has shaken the country and is testing the patience and limits of people but the government is utilising its entire might to give a fillip to efforts of state governments to overcome the crisis and beat back the disease, PM Narendra Modi said on Sunday.Referring to the model, called Sutra, Agrawal had explained that one should not confuse the two different peaks — one of daily ‘new’ cases which are more commonly observed and another of total number of ‘active’ infections which will come roughly 10 days after the peak for ‘new’ cases. Update on prediction of peak timing and value means the number of ‘active’ cases in India will keep increasing roughly till mid-May before showing a decline. If the current model shows the trend correctly, the mid-May peak will now be around four times higher than the first peak of over 10 lakh ‘active’ cases witnessed on September 17 last year. India’s total ‘active’ caseload on Sunday reached 26,82,751.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Coronavirus: Live updatesOn April 1, the model had predicted the peak of ‘active’ cases somewhere between April 15-20 at around 10 lakh — the same level as what the country saw in September last year.

We were seeing significant drift in parameter values for India in our model and so the (previous) modelling was not accurate.”  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); He said the parameter values kept changing due to new data from states and that’s why the peak value kept shifting.

The admiralty suit seeking compensation has been filed on behalf of boat owner Mamantakath Jaffar against the owners of the container vessel APL Le Havre at the Karnataka high court. Advocate C Unnikrishnan who filed the petition on behalf of the boat owner said that the owners of the foreign ship have come forward for talks regarding the compensation. “As the shipping firm had filed a caveat in the court, when we filed an admiralty suit in the court, they were provided a copy of our petition and they approached us and asked whether we are ready to hold discussions regarding compensation. Now talks are underway regarding providing compensation to the affected persons,” said Unnikrishnan. He added that the case was filed in Karnataka high court as the waters where the incident took place fell under its jurisdiction. Unnikrishnan said that the overspeeding ship had hit the fishing boat from behind. “It is learnt that the ship was speeding and was moving at a speed of 19 knots as against the safe speed of 18 knots,” he said. Kerala Boat Operators Association state vice-president Karichali Preman said that the boat owner had suffered losses of over Rs 1.3 crore. “Also, of the 14 fishermen in the ill-fated boat, six persons have lost their lives and six others are still missing and two have survived,” he said. The boat IFB Rabah, owned by Jaffar, had set off sail from Beypore on April 11 night with 14 migrant fishermen hailing from Tamil Nadu and West Bengal on board. The boat had overturned after being hit by the ship around midnight the next day. Two fishermen were rescued by the crew of the ship.

Kappan, who had been lodged in Mathura jail for the last six months, was admitted to a private medical college in Mathura on Wednesday after he collapsed in the bathroom of his jail cell on April 20. Kappan and three others were arrested on October 5 last year when they were going to Hathras village in Uttar Pradesh to report the alleged gang rape and murder of a Dalit girl. They were booked for sedition and under sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The MPs in the letter said that Kappan who sustained serious injuries after he fell unconscious in Mathura jail is presently suffering from Covid-19 and is admitted to a medical college in Mathura. “His condition is serious and he needs better treatment. We therefore implore you to save Kappan’s life by giving him an urgent hearing in the matter, requesting for the issue of necessary orders to shift him from Mathura Medical College hospital to AIIMS, Delhi,” a letter said. The MPs said that Kappan was unable to consume food and was denied right to a toilet for four days, and he has become extremely weak. “It is shocking beyond words that such grave violation of human rights is happening in our country, a democracy,” the letter said. “Therefore, we beseech you sir, as guardian of the Constitution, to examine this matter time sensitively and to provide an interim relief to Siddique Kappan until the disposal of his habeas corpus application,” the MPs said. The signatories of the letter included MPs K Sudhakaran, K Mureleedharan, E T Mohammed Basheer, V K Sreekandan, Ramya Haridas, Benny Behanan, T N Prathapan, Dean Kuriakose, Anto Antony, N K Premachandran and P V Abdul Wahab. Meanwhile, Raihanath, wife of Kappan wrote to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath seeking his intervention to ensure a more humane treatment to him and steps to get him shifted to a medical facility like AIIMS, Delhi. “Yesterday, we received information that he is at the KM Medical College in Mathura, and he is facing immense difficulties. He is chained to the bed and is not even allowed to go to the toilet. He is a frail person with high sugar and other complications. If the present situation continues and his health deteriorates, we are afraid that it would end up in a terrible tragedy,” she wrote. Earlier in the day, Raihanath had urged chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to intervene in the matter and had asked what was preventing the CM from making an intervention to ensure proper care to her husband at least on humanitarian grounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/11-udf-mps-write-to-cji-seek-urgent-hearing/articleshow/82246179.cms||---

This is being done under a plan to show less number of infected people. However, Covid cases have continued to rise and imagine if more than one lakh tests were carried out now, what would be the true picture of the crisis in Delhi,” Bidhuri said in a statement, adding that the plan was to hide the government’s failure in controlling the Covid situation. Bidhuri said Delhi government should increase the number of tests, which is considered one of the most effective ways to fight Covid. The high number of tests will help to track, trace and treat Covid infected people. There was no reaction from Delhi government on the matter.

---||Mumbai||2nd wave effect: Only 30% occupancy in CR outstation trains from Mumbai||Mumbai: The second wave of Covid-19 seems to have taken its toll on Central Railway passenger traffic from Mumbai to other parts of the country, except Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. Trains to these three states are running at full capacity. CR authorities said the average occupancy in outstation trains departing from Mumbai is 30%, and for intra-state (within Maharashtra), around 10%, for bookings till April 30.Usually, summer is considered a peak season with people struggling to get berths for which bookings open 120 days in advance. “But the fear of contracting the virus is forcing people from travelling to their hometowns,” said a CR official. “Several states have made RT-PCR test mandatory or are forcing people to undergo strict quarantine period. This is perhaps why people are not keen to travel to or from Mumbai.”Passenger occupancy in LTT-Nizamuddin train is around 18%, CSMT-Hyderabad 22.5%, LTT-Habibganj 24%, and LTT-Coimbatore 30%, said officials. Kurla resident Prasad V said, “I cancelled my train booking to to my hometown in Trichur as I do not want to put my elderly parents at risk.”In Maharashtra, intra-state passengers have to undergo a mandatory 14-day home quarantine, which has brought down CR bookings till April 30 to 7-12%. CSMT-Nagpur train has around 8% occupancy, CSMT-Latur train 9% and CSMT-Kolhapur 11%, said officials.Borivli resident Omkar Sawant cancelled his trip to Kankavli in Sindhudurg due to the intra-state travel guidelines. “As per the rules, I cannot return till I complete my 14-day quarantine period. Who will spend so much time in isolation? It is better to not go at all,” he added.  Since April 1, the number of CR passengers arriving in Mumbai has also seen a drastic decline. The CR official said, “The average number of arrivals stood at 49,981 between April 1 and 14. In the subsequent week, the number fell by 26% to 36,729.” Maharashtra is carrying out rapid antigen tests on railway stations and arriving passengers who test positive are sent to hospital, which discourages travel, the official said. “With the stringent restrictions and subsequent loss of employment, very few people are returning to Mumbai from labour-supplying states,” he added.The average passenger occupancy in Howrah-LTT train is 62%, Darbhanga (Bihar)-LTT 60% and Varanasi Junction-CSMT Mahanagari Express 55%. Despite the dipping passenger occupancy, CR officials said that they do not want to cancel trains yet, as many would want to travel for “unavoidable reasons”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2nd-wave-effect-only-30-occupancy-in-cr-outstation-trains-from-mumbai/articleshow/82248952.cms||Manthank Mehta

While Shinde is an import-export code (IEC) licence-holder, Rajput and Rao facilitated the smuggling. They were produced before the chief judicial magistrate court at Kamrup Metro, Guwahati, and brought here on transit remand. Rao’s lawyer Ravi Hirani said his client had been wrongly arrested. “He submitted documents provided by the importer, he had no knowledge about smuggling of silver,” he added.Last month, DRI had arrested Andheri importer Mohammed Nurani and jeweller Manish Birawat for smuggling 612kg of silver, declaring it as 194kg.DRI had got information that silver jewellery was being smuggled via air cargo at Sahar and the consignment was to be delivered to June Apartment at Andheri Gaothan Road. On March 19, officials examined pallets cleared out of air cargo purportedly covered under bill of entry in the name of AAR Enterprises. The weight of two pallets was 612kg. An examination resulted in recovery of 453kg of silver jewellery and a package of empty watch cases, as against the declared description of “ABX MT case and spring bars”. When DRI officials summoned Nurani and Birawat, both admitted to importing the contraband and spilled the beans on Rao.“Considering the gravity of the offence, and its pre-planned and conscious manner, financial investigations are on as we suspect the syndicate cleared past consignments,’’ officials said.Sources said Rao, Shinde and Rajput tampered with evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dri-nabs-three-bizmen-for-misdeclaring-rs-4-5cr-silver/articleshow/82248028.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Aurangabad||Action against schools for holding exams upto ClassVIII during pandemic||Aurangabad: The Education department of Aurangabad zilla parishad on Sunday issued an order asking schools not to hold any exam or screening of students up to Class VIII due to the current pandemic situation. ZP education officer S P Jaiswal said that it has come to notice that a section of schools were carrying out exams and screenings of students from Class I to Class VIII. “While the question of offline exam is out of question, schools should not even carry out online or virtual tests or any form of screening as asked by the state government. All the students up to Class VIII need to be promoted in next class directly,” he said. The ZP education department, in its order, has warned schools that any violation of its directives would lead to stern action. The decision has generated mixed reactions with a section of schools and parents stressing for the need of formal assessment of students through virtual platforms. Renuka Ratnaparkhe, a parent, said that formal assessment at the end of every semester is very essential for students. “The RTE Act 2009 is against failing students up to Class VIII but it does not prohibit schools from carrying out continuous evaluation. While nobody is in favour of actual conduct of exams during the current outbreak of Covid-19, we support online assessments as it prepares students for what they have learned in the entire semester,” she said. SBOA school principal Surekha Mane said that schools will have to abide by official directives. “We were ready with exam preparations and set to carry out the assessment in virtual manner. Many parents had also responded to the proposed schedule well. However, as per revised guidelines, we will promote students and declare their performance using formative and summative assessment,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/action-against-schools-for-holding-exams-upto-classviii-during-pandemic/articleshow/82246991.cms||---

Departments which are to function without any restrictions are police, health, home guards, civil defence, fire and emergency services, disaster management, prison, treasury, district administration, forest and municipal services. In Canacona, teachers and staff of primary, secondary and higher secondary schools who fall under group C, said they have been forced to work on a regular basis, which is against the GAD’s inter-office memorandum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/education-depts-circular-irks-teachers-in-canacona/articleshow/82248953.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: ‘Dev Doli’ snan at Kumbh held symbolically||NAINITAL: The ‘Dev Doli’ snan, an integral Maha Kumbh ritual that involves local residents carrying palanquins of their village deities for a dip in the Ganga at Har-ki-Pauri, and then showcasing their local culture in the form of pageantries, was initially planned to be held on a grand scale in Haridwar. Thousands were estimated to come for the event but in light of the Covid-19 situation, the event was held symbolically on Sunday with only three dev dolis and less than 100 attendees. “It was estimated that 250 dev dolis and around 50,000 local residents would congregate at Har-ki-Pauri. The palanquins carrying village deities like Lakshmi, Saraswati and Kali, were planned to be dipped in Ganga, followed by a grand showcase of local culture by villagers accompanying the dolis. However, only three dev dolis were allowed this time and just around 50-60 people came to the ghat,” said a mela official. Satpal Maharaj, the state tourism and culture minister, had on Saturday said that the dev dolis would take a symbolic holy dip in view of the present crisis. On April 17, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appealed to seers to keep the rest of Kumbh “symbolic” to strengthen the fight against the pandemic. Following this, most of the sanyasi akhadas had left their camps at Kumbh site. “Hundreds of people from villages wanted to come here and showcase their culture, as is the tradition but because of the Prime Minister’s appeal for a symbolic Kumbh, we decided against it,” said president of Devbhoomi Sanskrit Virasat Shobhayatra Samiti Mohan Singh Rawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dev-doli-snan-at-kumbh-held-symbolically/articleshow/82246175.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Mumbai||Bridge courses to plug learning gaps in schools||MUMBAI: Last academic year, education boards cut syllabus by up to 30% owing to loss of school hours amid the Covid-19 pandemic. As students coped within the silos of their homes, some progressed better than others. Now as they all prepare to be promoted to the next class, there is an urgent need to bridge the gaps that many experience in learning. In the pre-pandemic years, all students up to class VIII were promoted to the next class under the Right to Education Act. However, schools would conduct in-house tests and low scorers would be provided remedial teaching. Now that a rigorous assessment is not possible, schools are looking at other ways to help those who need to catch up. Raising the entire class to a common minimum acceptable level is paramount, said a principal. “We sent out video lessons and tests, hosted multiple sessions with parents but some didn’t take learning seriously last year. We had students not paying attention during online class and skipping exams to attend family events. And those not privileged with digital access were impacted as well. While worksheets and textbooks were home delivered, they did not have their teachers or their peers to learn from,” said the principal. As students begin to prepare for the next academic year or a return to the classroom in the near future, many institutions have bridge courses in place. EuroSchool and Billabong High are offering a pre-preparatory course for pre-primary section going to class I and for up to classes I to V if parents request. Spread over two months, the course will include modules based on literacy, language and mathematics and will be delivered online. “This will help children learn important concepts and revisit fundamental topics in an engaging and fun-filled manner. The goal is to ensure children are mentally, emotionally and academically prepped up for the new academic year,” said Rahul Deshpande, CEO of the two schools. Similarly, at NL Dalmia School, Mira Road, teachers have spent the last few weeks providing remedial teaching to those who have found it difficult to cope. Principal Seema Saini said, “For the toddlers, we had intended to give them a few days in their old classroom before moving to the next grade but with the surge in cases that has been put on hold. We had planned to recap the concepts of the year, so they feel more prepared for the next class. For the elder students since we can’t provide in-person bridge courses, we identified students who need the extra attention and they are being tutored online by the teachers.” While individual schools have already begun work, the state too is planning to provide learning material for students after the schedule for this academic year ends. School education minister, Varsha Gaikwad said, “Class IX and XI are the basis for board exams next year so we want that the concepts taught in these classes are clear and students don’t suffer in their crucial year. If we can’t reopen schools, we will use e-learning networks to send content before the next academic year begins.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bridge-courses-to-plug-learning-gaps-in-schools/articleshow/82248043.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar

City-based ophthalmologist Dr. Shrirang Deshpande said that the clinicians were an authority on treatment protocols for Covid-19, but related experts are needed to take care of preventive and other aspects of fighting the disease. “The task force, therefore, must have epidemiologists, virologist, microbiologist and doctors who have done specialization in community health. Having such professionals on the task force will give an edge to the think-tank which has a key role in charting out health policies during the current pandemic,” he said. Health experts have also questioned omission of State Director of Health Services from the task-force which currently is 12-member body with director of State Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) as its ex-officio member. Echoing similar concerns, expert member (Health) of Marathwada Development Board Dr. Ahsok Belkhode said that the task-force for Covid-19 does not have representation from Vidarbha and Marathwada. “The Covid task force largely has representation from Mumbai and other metros. Having resource persons from different regions on board will be advantage in gauging Covid situation across the state and charting out health policies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/reconstitute-covid-task-force-health-experts/articleshow/82247016.cms||Prasad Joshi

MSEDCL public relations officer for Aurangabad zone Dnyaneshwar Ardad said that the window for such submission was recently increased to four days. “The outbreak of Covid-19 and curbs associated with it may prevent MSEDCL staffers for noting down meter reading in Covid hotspots, among other areas. Therefore, the state power utility appeals to consumers to use the official mobile application or website for submitting their meter reading,” he said. As a part of centralised billing system of MSEDCL, low-tension consumers, including residential consumers, can send their meter reading during a specified window between upto 25th day of every month. “Consumers can get an SMS requesting self-submission on their registered mobile number, following which desired formality can be completed in four days. Besides mobile app, the official website www.mahadiscom.in can be also used for self-submission of meter-reading,” Ardad said “Consumers who submit meter reading on their own have multiple benefits. Firstly, they will have a regular check on their meter and its reading. They can also confirm whether their monthly bill is in accordance with the meter reading and lodge complaint in case of any discrepancy.” The mobile app concerned is available for free download on PlayStore and other downloading platforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/msedcl-encourages-self-submission-of-meter-reading/articleshow/82247019.cms||---
---||Delhi||Benaras gharana exponent Rajan Mishra dies of Covid||The elder of the beloved musical brothers, Rajan and Sajan Mishra, passed away on Sunday night from Covid-related complications in Delhi. He was 70. The Mishra duo was known for braiding the lilting vibe of Benaras with the khayal style. Mishra was admitted to St Stephen’s Hospital with a heart condition and was in dire need of a ventilator. On learning of his passing, musicians expressed regret and anger at a system that was not able to help him in his time of need. Earlier, social media had been filled with cries for help to get him a hospital bed. “We have lost a great artiste,” said sitar player Shujaat Khan. “Shame on our government who spends precious resources and money building stadiums, statues and parliaments when we could have had thousands of hospitals all over the country…. Sad sad sad!” Singer Shubha Mudgal said, “Not only do I grieve for him, his family and disciples, but I also lament the fact that he could not get a ventilator bed and adequate care… The lucky among us will survive Covid, but we will not be able to bring back artistes of this brilliance and stature.” Born and raised in Varanasi, Rajan and Sajan Mishra learned music from their father Hanuman Prasad Mishra, their grand-uncle Bade Ramdas Mishra, and their uncle the sarangi virtuoso Gopal Prasad Mishra. When Rajan Mishra was a young man, he started working as a management trainee in Delhi. In a twist of fate, the Sikh Namdhari guru Jagjit Singh, for whom music mirrored spirituality, heard the young Rajan sing and recognised his talent. He pushed him to changed his trajectory and pursue only music. Rajan and Sajan Mishra both kept up close ties with the Namdharis and taught numerous children in Bhaini Sahib, Ludhiana. The brothers, who have received the Padma Bhushan and Sangit Natak Akademi awards, were inseparable – on stage and in their personal life. Besides the depth of their music, they were both known for their inimitable Benarasi sense of humour. “They were the life and soul of any room. All the artistes would go to them for a proper paan and a good laugh,” says Natasha Nandini, a family friend. “They had such incredible humility. They would say, you can’t sing a raga thinking that you know more than the raga….I say ‘they’ because they truly were one voice." Saptak Festival organiser Manju Mehta who regularly invited Rajan and Sajan Mishra to perform at the Ahmedabad festival remembers him as being multifaceted personality with a great zest for life. “His music had so much depth that he left audiences in a trance and tears, especially when he rendered bhajans,” she said. A close friend and student once asked Rajan what he did if someone didn’t act well towards him, he said, ‘I would look inside myself to find out why’. She added, “He believed that love was the answer to all life’s problems.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/benaras-gharana-exponent-rajan-mishra-dies-of-covid/articleshow/82248046.cms||Namita Devidayal

State chief minister Amarinder Singh also allowed use of the CM Covid Relief Fund for meeting the vaccine requirements of the poor people. Capt Amarinder directed the health department to immediately place order for the 30 lakh doses with the Serum Institute of India so that the supplies could start coming in at the earliest. As per information provided by the central government, the delivery of vaccines for the 18-45 age group is not expected before May 15. Besides the CM Covid Relief Fund, corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds should also be tapped into to ensure free vaccination of the poor in government hospitals, said the chief minister. The ESIC should be asked to support the vaccination of industrial workers covered in the scheme, and the board for welfare of construction workers for those working in the construction sector, he added. The chief minister requested the experts’ group, led by Dr Gagandeep Kang, to submit the strategy for prioritisation of the 18-45 years group (vulnerable groups in high risk areas-high transmission, high mortality including construction workers and industrial workers) in its first report by April 29. Amarinder said the state government would not compromise on vaccination of 45+ age group. He added the state government would consider approaching Astrazeneca (India) directly to allow the Punjab government to avail the lower price of Rs 162 per dose available to the global community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-to-order-30l-covishield-doses-for-18-45-age-group/articleshow/82248032.cms||---

However, at some places, the second dose of Covaxin was carried out.While speaking to the civic authorities, Patil said there will be a rush of beneficiaries at the vaccine centres from May 1. The KMC has sought approval from the state health department to set up centres in over 300 polling booths across the city to cope with the rush.Patil said, “The KMC must start an e-token facility. Those registering for the vaccine shot will get the online token, then they can go to their nearest vaccine centre on the specified date. For the elderly beneficiaries, the tokens can be issued offline. The KMC must ensure that the beneficiary turnout is not more than the available vaccine stock on a particular day.”The KMC is already drawing flak from citizens for the non-availability of vaccines at most of its centres. So far, over one lakh citizens have received the first dose of vaccines in the KMC-run centres. The district has crossed 8.5 lakh vaccinations for both doses.“We are communicating with the state and Centre to ensure maximum availability of vaccine doses. There is a need to follow social distancing at the vaccination centres to avoid spread of the infection. To avoid chaos, there has to be ground-level management so the KMC has been asked to deploy more staff to take care of it,” said Patil.Currently, the eligible citizens can register on spot at the vaccination centres, which is likely to be scrapped if the e-token facility is rolled out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/start-e-token-facility-for-vax-beneficiaries-kolhapur-mla/articleshow/82245807.cms||---

It said the circular is yet another indication that the state government remains clueless about handling the pandemic.Strongly condemning the government, Goencho Avaaz said that chief minister Pramod Sawant’s “callous and anti-people approach” will lead to a further increase in Covid-19 cases. “The modus operandi of the Goa government right from the beginning of the pandemic has been akin to that of a headless chicken scrambling desperately with no idea of where it is going or what it is doing,” said convener of Goencho Avaaz captain Viriato Fernandes. Goencho Avaaz has urged the government to adopt decisions and policies that are directed towards containing the pandemic. “The government is consistently proving that saving lives and getting a grip on this pandemic is non-existent on their list of priorities. We implore the government to prioritise the health of its people and to ensure that the lives of school staff will not be put in jeopardy. The cascading impact of this ill-thought decision will be devastating for Goa,” said president of Goencho Avaaz Swapnesh Sherlekar. Goencho Avaaz said that Sawant is using every opportunity, including the pandemic, to get into election mode with empty promises, instead of prioritising the pandemic. “Let us not forget how the government has been using teachers for election duties in the past. Appointed as presiding officers, these women teachers had to stay overnight and sleep on benches in the classroom. Even when the pandemic just hit, the government tasked the teaching fraternity with conducting a door-to-door survey last year,” said vice president of Goencho Avaaz Roshan Mathias. Strongly condemning the government, Goencho Avaaz said that the chief minister ’s “callous and anti-people approach” will lead to a further increase in Covid-19 cases||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/directorate-of-edu-circular-proves-govt-is-clueless-goencho-avaaz/articleshow/82248961.cms||---

Justice K Haripal quashed the chargesheet filed by Kodakara police in the FIR filed in February 2019 after considering a petition (Crl. M.C. No. 5765/2020) filed by the man through advocate Abraham Mathan. Names and addresses of the victim and the accused were withheld by the high court to protect privacy. The victim was a 17-year-old when the FIR was registered, on Feb 21, 2019. The case was initially registered as a man-missing case, under Section 57 of the Kerala Police Act, on a complaint filed by the girl’s father. After investigation, police added offences of repeated rape of same woman, under IPC Section 376(2)(n) and aggravated penetrative sexual assault under Sections 4 read with 3(a) and 6 read with 5(1) of the Pocso Act. Other offences charged were house trespass and kidnapping. In the petition to the high court, the accused stated that he married the girl on November 16 last year. The matter has been settled between the parties and he and the girl are now living as husband and wife, the petitioner contended while seeking to quash the proceedings. The girl and her father, named as respondents 1 and 2 in the petition, filed affidavits stating that they have no objection in quashing the proceedings. In the judgment, the court said, “In the light of the fact that, they have entered into matrimonial relationship, there is no purpose in continuing the proceedings. Even if the trial court is allowed to proceed with the trial of the case, it is sure that material witness who are respondents 1 and 2 are not going to support the case. That means, it would be a futile exercise to continue the proceedings.” While allowing the plea to quash the case, the court further said, “The Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that in such cases courts should always take a pragmatic view. When the parties themselves settle the dispute and approach the high court for quashing the proceedings, the high court cannot refuse to invoke its inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of CrPC. For the well-being of the couple also, it is only expedient to terminate the proceedings. The proceedings is quashed, no public interest is going to hamper.” Section 482 gives the high court the power to issue orders to prevent abuse of the process of court or to secure ends of justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/accused-weds-survivor-hc-quashes-case/articleshow/82246190.cms||---

They will now be available for hospitals struggling due to a scarcity of health workers to treat Covid patients.The varsity’s examination department declared the results on Saturday, barely a week after the completion of the answersheet assessment. The department is aware that many Covid hospitals need health workers, so they declared the results with urgency. The theory exams for the nursing courses had started on March 8, which were followed by the practicals.Ajit Pathak, the MUHS controller of examinations, told TOI that hospitals can hire these fresh graduates as they have already completed their mandatory internship while undergoing the academic course.“We made all efforts to declare the results as fast as possible so that more nurses can be available to hospitals during these trying times. The examination department’s staff at the colleges ensured that the examinations took place without any hiccups. Many of them were involved in Covid treatment themselves and yet they took out time to evaluate the answer scripts,” he said.State medical education secretary Saurabh Vijay, director of directorate of medical education and research (DMER) Tatyarao Lahane, MUHS acting vice-chancellor Nitin Kalmalkar and varsity’s registrar Kalidas Chavan guided the examination department in declaring the results at the earliest. According to Pathak, 961 students had appeared for the final examination — 543 in basic BSc nursing course and 252 in post-basic BSc nursing course. While all the 543 students passed the basic BSc nursing examination, 142 have cleared the other examination. The evaluators were told to prioritise checking the answer scripts, Pathak said. Dr Sameer Chandratre, the joint secretary of the state Indian Medical Association, lauded MUHS for declaring the results so quickly. “But I would strongly advocate that all these fresh nurses get the Covid vaccine before they start their work as frontline health workers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/685-fresh-nursing-graduates-available-for-covid-hospitals/articleshow/82245820.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Binu George, the resident, got inspiration from her teenage son Rohan who had raised Rs 50,000 similarly last year for village students and schools to enable them to initiate online learning during the lockdown. “I saw my son raise funds for village students and that inspired me to do the same for the hospital, and with the support of residents and well-wishers, we have raised a sizeable sum,” she told TOI. “More than 300 people from Mussoorie and abroad have donated funds. People from all walks of life have pooled in resources with contributions ranging from Rs 95 to several thousand dollars,” she said, while thanking the contributors for their support. The funds are to be deployed for ventilators, oxygen concentrators and other equipment to enable the hospital to treat Covid patients. AC Kurian, teacher at Wynberg-Allen School, said that the whole community, including a number of past pupils of the school, supported this fundraiser. “I am happy that we were able to do our bit for LCH which has been doing great service for the local community. With the necessary equipment it would be able to serve the people even more effectively,” he added. George Clarence, a doctor at LCH, said that “the crowdfunding was driven by a well-wisher who decided to support the hospital with advanced medical equipment to enable us to cater to contingencies and to serve communities in a better manner.” He added that LCH was serving people from Tehri Garhwal, Uttarkashi and Dehradun districts since the past eight decades. The concept of the hospital was initiated in 1931 by the missionaries working in the area while the hospital was constructed in 1938.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/landour-hospital-raises-rs-29l-via-crowdfunding-in-3-days-for-purchasing-ventilator-other-equipment/articleshow/82246191.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Delhi||Delhi: Apathy of residents pushing wastepickers to Covid’s door||NEW DELHI: As the numbers of Covid-19 cases continue to shoot through the roof, anxiety has peaked for waste-pickers who continue to work in unhygienic conditions. Even during the pandemic, the workers have to pick through unsegregated waste without any protective gear. Plastic masks tear too easily while working the entire day and reusable gloves come at an unaffordable price of Rs 150. The sanitation workers also argue that in spite of repeatedly asking people to segregate their garbage, leave it at gates and put used masks and gloves in a separate packet, residents don’t care to follow these simple guidelines. This puts the pickers at risk while going through the garbage to separate recyclable waste such as plastic bottles and packets. Jai Prakash Chaudhary of Safai Sena said that the organisation’s workers are provided certain equipment and safety gear, but the government makes no efforts to help people in the unorganised sector. “Some RWAs or residents give the workers masks and gloves, but most people are least concerned about the circumstances they work under,” Chaudhary said, adding the organisation has been asking the government to vaccinate such workers on priority, but there has been no response yet. With the rampant surge in the number of Covid cases, these workers are even more fearful of visiting houses to collect waste. “We have no other option. The recycled product collected after segregation is our only source of income. If we won’t work then how we will feed our families,” asked Manbara Begum, a waste collector who stays near Netaji Nagar. Begum’s husband Mohammad Nazeer, who is also a waste collector and scrap dealer, stated that even the segregated waste is not getting sold in the market these days due to the lockdown. “Waste pickers’ lives are in a pathetic state. There is no demand for recyclable products due to shutting of markets and it is becoming difficult to earn a livelihood,” he said. In times of crisis, like the pandemic, we are clearly able to see the essential services provided by the informal workforce, said Chitra Mukherjee, head for advocacy and policy at NGO Chintan. “The apathy to their situation is shocking. Not only are citizens unwilling to segregate waste, the workers are not even provided safety gear,” she said. “The government must ensure that waste pickers are treated as frontline workers and get priority vaccination at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/apathy-of-residents-pushing-wastepickers-to-covids-door/articleshow/82248098.cms||Vibha Sharma

Since the announcement last week, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad has been consulting various stakeholders to chalk out a plan to evaluate students and issue mark sheets. But teachers feel that it is important to hear from the ground. “Students and schools across the state have varied learning levels, access to digital learning, and admission patterns for junior college. It would be critical to hear from teachers on how they can best evaluate the child’s progress through the year. We must be included in the consultations,” said a teacher of a Zilla Parishad school. Shivnath Darade of teachers’ group Shikshak Parishad concurred that stakeholders, including teachers, must be consulted while drafting an assessment module and the state must take into consideration the impact on junior college admissions. CBSE and CISCE are also yet to declare their evaluation criterion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-teachers-want-to-be-heard-in-ssc-exam-assessment-process/articleshow/82254944.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar

In his letter to the UP chief minister, Vijayan said that after testing positive, Kappan has been admitted to KVM Hospital, Mathura, where he has been chained to his bed even when his health condition is precarious. The chief minister said that he is having diabetes and heart ailments, and immediate intervention is required to ensure that a humane treatment is accorded to him. Expert healthcare, necessary for him, may also be seriously considered by shifting him to another super-specialty hospital, where modern life-saving facilities can be ensured. People in general, and the media fraternity in particular, are anxious to know about his predicament and human rights, and are very much concerned about his plight, the chief minister said. Kappan, a freelance journalist, arrested by UP police last year, is facing charges under unlawful activities prevention act (UAPA) alleging that he had conspired to create social unrest. He was arrested while going to Hathras in Uttar Pradesh to report about the alleged gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pinarayi-writes-to-up-cm-over-kappans-health/articleshow/82246199.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: As patients wait for oxygen, hospitals queue up at industries in Manesar||MANESAR: Hospitals struggling with oxygen shortage have started seeking help from industries in Manesar. On Sunday, ambulances from several smaller hospitals in the city were found parked outside Star Special Air Gases Private Limited, which is refilling cylinders free of cost. “I am waiting for hours to get oxygen cylinders refilled as many lives are depending on this,” the driver of an ambulance told TOI at the spot. Vehicles from Mayom, Pushpanjali and Chiranjivi hospitals were also seen in the queue. The hospital officials could not be reached for a comment. Initially, some industrial units had started helping individuals with oxygen supply but they are now having to support smaller Covid hospitals as well. One of the organisers told TOI that they are getting calls from government officials too. “We are getting many calls from hospitals and we have to help them in this situation,” said Pawan Yadav, president, IMT Manesar Industrial Association. In an order issued on Sunday evening, the state government has prohibited all oxygen manufacturing units from supplying the gas to industries till further orders. “It is further directed that these units will provide their entire production oxygen for medical purpose. These units are also directed to produce oxygen to their maximum capacity. All the oxygen producing units will maintain a record of manufacturing and distribution record on daily basis. The record will be made available for inspection of the state government,” additional chief secretary, health, Haryana government, Rajeev Arora, has said in the order. Individuals in need of oxygen are also turning up at the units from other NCR cities. “I have come all the way from Ghaziabad because I could not get oxygen anywhere else. My relative is in a hospital and the facility has only six hours’ supply left,” said Lalit Gautam, who queued up at Star gases, a manufacturer of different types of gases. Ashish Kumar from east Delhi said his eight-year-old niece has Covid and the child needs oxygen. “We came here on Saturday and managed to get a cylinder. Now, we need more oxygen and hence, I am here again,” he said. Deepak Shami, managing director of Star Special Air Gases Private Limited, said in a recent statement: “If we can ever come to work in saving someone's life, then that day will be the biggest for me. ... If any of our efforts can save the lives of hundreds of people and it will not be a big thing for my life, I think my life has become meaningful.” Other industries and industrial associations in the city are also trying to pitch in. “We managed to get around 20 oxygen cylinders and passed those on to patients who needed them. Now, we are trying to source more empty cylinders so that we can fill those up and give to those who need it urgently,” said Deepak Maini, general secretary, Federation of Indian Industry. At least three more industrial units, one in Manesar and two in Gurugram, have started offering oxygen for medical use against a fee.

---||Kolkata||All airport staff to get jab from next month||Kolkata: Covid vaccination drive for the entire workforce of Kolkata airport and air-line staff is set to begin early next month on the Kolkata airport premises. An inoculation drive at Kolkata airport has been underway from April 7 for 4,000-odd employees above the age of 45. From next month, those between 18 and 45 years of age will be inoculated on the premises once the process begins in Bengal. “The moment vaccination for adults under 45 begins in Bengal, we will start vaccinating our staff as well. There is still some ambiguity surrounding the prices of vaccines, but whatever price is fixed, we will continue with the inoculation drive at the airport for all persons employed at the airport,” said Kaushik Bhattacharjee, the Kolkata airport director. Officials said the NSCBI airport has been a front runner in vaccination drives amongst Indian airports where 700 odd employees above the age of 45 have already be-en vaccinated.  “The drive is set to continue wherein those who have received the first dose, will get the second jab and all other employees between the ages of 18 and 45 will also be inoculated here itself. We have requested the state health department to continue with the existing vaccination centre run on the airport premises,” said Rahul Wadhwa, chairman of airlines’ operators committee (AOC). The vaccination at Kolkata airport is managed by Charnock Hospital, which also runs a medical unit on the airport premises. The airport has around 4,000 employees above 45 and around 9,000 employees — combining airport staff, airline staff and contractual workers — in the 18-45 age group. Doctors and paramedics of Charnock Hospital currently organize the vaccination drive between 10am and 5.30pm every day. Officials said, around 60 to 70 employees are vaccinated at this centre per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/all-airport-staff-to-get-jab-from-next-month/articleshow/82247042.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Pune||Pune Metropolitan Region’s vaccine coverage plummets amid shortage||PUNE: The Covid-19 vaccination drive in the Pune Metropolitan Region hit a record low number of beneficiaries on Sunday with just over 10,000 vaccinations. Officials said over 400 vaccination sites were forced to stay shut because of the ongoing vaccination shortage. On Sunday, only 10,397 people received their jabs, including senior citizens, healthcare workers and frontline staff. In Pimpri Chinchwad, where the PCMC had better vaccine reserves, more than 7,000 people were vaccinated. The PMC areas were next with 1,706 recipients and in Pune rural 1,364 got their shots. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said a Covishield supply, which should have landed early on Saturday, arrived only by around Sunday 11am. Many vaccination sites were unable to launch sessions due to the delay. "On Sunday, we received 1 lakh doses. Of which, 55,000 have been distributed to Pune rural due to their high coverage levels. The PMC has been given 35,000 doses and the PCMC, which was given 10,000 doses on Saturday, has been allocated 10,000 more," Deshmukh said. Besides the Covishield supply, the district health services has also distributed nearly 8,000 Covaxin doses — Pune rural got 4,000 doses, PMC got 3,000 and 1,000 doses were set aside for the PCMC. The current stock, Deshmukh said, will be enough for drives till Tuesday. He said the district will get another batch of shots on the same day. As for the May 1 launch of drives among those over 18, he said officials were still waiting for guidelines from the state government. Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner, said inconsistent vaccine distribution has led to reduced response in several areas. In Pune rural, Ayush Prasad, the CEO of the zilla parishad, said vaccine scarcity was the key reason for Sunday's meagre coverage. This entire weekend has been bad for vaccine coverage in Pune district. On Saturday, the daily number of beneficiaries covered was just over 24,000 with as many as 217 vaccination sites left unable to hold sessions. Saturday's district total of 24,157 was the lowest since April 9, when 23,776 beneficiaries received their shots. By the end of Saturday, the Pune rural administration was left with just 3,520 doses of Covishield. The PMC had only 866 of the shots in its reserves and the PCMC had 1,058. Many hospitals said they were continuing to give only the Covaxin second dose and holding on to their low Covishield reserves. The ongoing weekend curfew has also impacted turnouts. Many citizens said they have been unable to step out and search for vaccination sites with shots due to the curbs. Scores of Covishield recipients — from the elderly to those over 45 — are due for the follow-up shot across the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/regions-vaccine-coverage-plummets-amid-shortage/articleshow/82248079.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Most of the 200-odd shacks in the tourism hub are already winding up operations in the midst of a record fresh surge in Covid-19 cases, which has resulted in a precipitous drop in the arrival of tourists. Calangute-Candolim has more than half of all the beach shacks in the state. The beach shack season normally ends on May 31. Last year the season had come to an abrupt end in the third week of March when the lockdown was announced. While many shack owners at the main Calangute and Baga beaches did good business during this season despite the uncertainties, others at isolated spots with no proper road access, specially at Candolim, did very poor or negligible business, beach shack owners said. Talking to TOI, president of the Traditional Shacks Owners Association Manuel Cardozo pointed out that the beginning of the season was very hazy, with no clear picture of foreign charter tourist arrivals or even of domestic tourists. “Most of the shack owners did not want to put up their shacks because there would be no business. But they were forced to pay the shack licence fee amount and put up their shacks because the government said that otherwise their licenses would be cancelled and they would be blacklisted,” Cardozo said. “So they paid the licence fees and erected the shacks, but there was no business for most of them, except for those at the main Calangute and Baga beaches,” Cardozo said. “The season was very bad for them.” A shack owner, asking not to be named, said he put up his shack “for the sake of putting it up as otherwise my license would have been cancelled”. He pointed out that his clientele is almost exclusively foreign charter tourists. After putting up his shack, he did not operate it at all. “I had to incur a huge loss to put up the shack,” he said. Baga-based John Lobo, general secretary of the Shack Owners Welfare Society, said that being in Baga, his shack did good business. “Most of the shacks have already been dismantled and the remaining will also go by the end of this month. The Covid situation is becoming worse by the day and with the lockdowns in some states, very few tourists are coming. In Goa also, though there’s only a night curfew, that could soon become a lockdown, so there’s no point in keeping the shacks,” Lobo said. Cardozo urged the state government to take a more considered approach in the next season after the debacle of this season. “At least for the next season, the government should not force the shack owners to erect the shacks if the situation is still bad,” Cardozo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/north-goa-shacks-begin-winding-up-business-ahead-of-season-end-as-covid-19-cases-continue-to-surge/articleshow/82248972.cms||Joseph Zuzarte

This was the first housing complex in the city to hold a vaccination camp after tying up with a private hospital that provided the vaccines, doctors, nurses and medical assistants, while the complex arranged for space as per specifications. Around 350 residents were vaccinated on the first day in the camp that started at 10am and ended at 3pm. There will be another round to mop up those who are still left to get the jab. That apart, the second dose will also be provided at a designated date at the spot. “A week ago we had given the go-ahead to hospitals to start vaccination camps inside housing complexes. They have tied up with several complexes and are keeping us informed. However, ensuring a safe delivery of the vaccines to residents is primarily the responsibility of the private hospital or clinic that is setting up the camp,” said Ajay Chakraborty, director of health services. Residents at Urbana were extremely happy as many said that they were finding it unsafe to go out to the hospitals or clinics for vaccination. Take the case of 79 year old Janaki Swaminathan, who is paralyzed from stroke and a broken knee cap. She came down in a wheelchair for the jab. “This is God sent,” she said. At Upohar Complex, hectic preparations are on to get the facility up at the activity room of Tower 10. “We have been given the requisition by the private clinic that is holding the camp and accordingly we have fixed up a registration area, a waiting area, an enclosure for the jab to be given,” said Sudeep Ganguly, convenor of the committee helping make the camp possible.  A vaccination facility has been readied at Siddha Pines at New Town. “Some people had started taking the jab at NKDA, but the facility stopped soon thereafter since the premise got converted into a safe home. Hence the tie up now with a private hospital,” said Manav Mehera, president of the complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccination-camps-start-in-housing-complexes/articleshow/82247032.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Taps run dry in Chas as water treatment plant develops snag||BOKARO: More than 50,000 people in Chas township are faced with water crisis for a week owing to a snag in the water treatment plant on Damodar river. The Bokaro Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCCI) has written to deputy commissioner Rajesh Singh, asking him to step up efforts to solve the crisis. BCCI president Sanjay Baid said, “People here are faced with a water crisis but the administration doesn’t seem to care.” Chas Municipal Corporation’s CEO Anil Kumar Singh said, “Repair work on the two damaged motors in the plant is underway on a priority basis. For the time being, we have asked the people to use the toilets under our jurisdiction. We have 33 toilets which are equipped with modern facilities.” The civic body is also supplying water to the residents through tankers but the latter alleged that it is not enough to meet their demands. One Sujit Kumar, who resides in ward 21, said, “Most of the time we are having to purchase water. Sometimes we take the water supplied by CMC but it’s not always feasible to do that. When the tankers arrive in our locality, every one jostles to get his/her share of water, which is risky considering the current Covid situation where maintaining social distancing is mandatory.” Those who have their own deep boring machines are able to manage though. There are 168 deep borings in Chas Township, majority of which are defunct as the groundwater level has gone down. Water is supplied through pipelines in more than 6,000 houses across the township, which comprises 35 wards with a total population of 1.25 lakh people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/taps-run-dry-in-chas-as-water-treatment-plant-develops-snag/articleshow/82247066.cms||---

Seven other workers from the state are also injured in the incident. Among those who died, four each are from Dumka and Khunti districts, two from Ranchi and one from West Singhbhum. Among the injured, four are from Khunti and three are natives of West Singhbhum. Sharing the details through an official communication to the state government, Chamoli district magistrate Swati S Bhadoria said of the seven injured, five are currently undergoing treatment at a hospital in Joshimath and two have been admitted to a healthcare facility in Dehradun. “All the dead and those injured from Jharkhand were engaged in road construction work by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in Sumna region under Joshimath tehsil of Chamoli. Following rescue works and identification, they were identified as natives of Jharkhand,” Bhadoria informed on Sunday in her letter to the state disaster management department secretary Amitabh Kaushal. Condoling the deceased, chief minister Hemant Soren said in a tweet that his government is in touch with its counterparts in Uttrakhand to chalk out further modalities for the affected people. “The state government stands with the families of the affected persons and deceased in this hour of grief. We are in touch with authorities in Chamoli to extend possible assistance to those who are currently under treatment,” Soren tweeted. A senior official in the disaster management department said they are in the process of finalising further steps to bring back the bodies of the deceased and the injured soon. “The government is evaluating the situation based on the interactions with our counterparts in Uttrakhand and authorities of BRO. We hope the latter makes arrangements for sending the bodies back,” the official said. The recent glacier burst at a remote place on the India-China border is the second such disaster after the one in Chamoli in February this year, in which 14 people from Jharkhand had lost their lives. Four of the deceased hailed from Ramgarh, nine from Lohardaga and one from Bokaro.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/all-11-deaths-in-apr-23-chamoli-glacier-burst-from-jharkhand/articleshow/82246983.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Dumka administration withdraws doc FIR after social media backlash||DUMKA: The district administration on Sunday withdrew an FIR it had filed against a local doctor who cited deficiencies in Covid-19 treatment at the government-run Phulo Jhano Medical College and Hospital (PJMCH). The authorities took the decision after they faced a heavy backlash on social media for filing the FIR. The doctor, Manish Kumar, was part of a meeting chaired by Dumka deputy commissioner Rajeshwari B over the Covid-19 situation in the district. During the meeting, Kumar raised the issue of lack of ventilators, among others, at the medical college. This, reportedly, irked the DC and she admonished Kumar alleging that he was trying to create panic. Later, an official release issued from the district IPRD department had informed that an FIR was filed against Kumar by SDO (civil) Maheshwar Mahto under the Disaster Management Act and other sections of the Indian Penal Code. Kumar is a private medical practitioner. Reacting to the development, he said, “I just referred to the unavailability of ventilators in the ICU ward of PJMCH, where I gone a couple of days ago to call on one of my relatives who contracted Covid-19. My intention of flagging off the problem was misconstrued by the deputy commissioner.” “The FIR against Dr Kumar has been withdrawn considering the prevailing need of medical practitioners to deal with Covid-19 cases,” the SDO said, adding that the doctor had furnished a bond undertaking that he would desist from ‘rumour mongering’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dumka-admin-withdraws-doc-fir-after-social-media-backlash/articleshow/82247139.cms||---
---||Ranchi||‘Bring back quarantine centres for better mgmt of +ve cases’||RANCHI: BJP’s Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth demanded the Hemant Soren government to restart institutionalised quarantine centres across the state on a priority basis to prevent the further spread of Covid-19, which in its second wave is already on rapid surge infecting thousands on a daily basis and also taking several lives. Drawing Soren’s attention towards the ongoing influx of migrant workers from several places to Ranchi and elsewhere in the state, Seth said lack of quarantine facilities and shoddy on-spot testing is also why cases are multiplying rapidly. Although, there aren’t composite figures available so far about the number of returnees in the recent weeks from different places amid fears of lockdown, several special trains have reached Ranchi in the last two weeks. Similarly, other districts with rail links too are witnessing regular arrival of migrants and many are even travelling via road and air routes. “In such a situation, it is highly important to ensure that any infected person doesn’t go undetected as he/she may transmit the virus down the trail. It is the time when rural areas are to be secured from the surge and hence government must immediately set up quarantine/isolation centres at district and block levels for better surveillance and monitoring of infected persons,” said Seth. During the first wave, the state had set up thousands of quarantine centres and had stepped up surveillance system at key transit points. But with overwhelming cases in Ranchi, Jamshedpur and few other districts on a daily basis now, that system seems to have been derailed. Seth maintained that even at the railway stations, there were regular reports of improper health scans, which is a cause of concern for Jharkhand, which till Sunday night reported 45,592 active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bring-back-quarantine-centres-for-better-mgmt-of-ve-cases/articleshow/82246974.cms||---

Notably, this area is located near the Kadma market containment zone. Kadma area SDO Nitish Kumar Singh in a letter to Tata Steel said people living in its 81 quarters have refused to undergo the test and it is illegal under the Epidemic Act. Most residents living in the quarters are family members of Tata Steel employees. Appealing to the residents to underdo the test in the next 24 hours, Singh said only after testing the chain of infection can be broken. Kadma is one of the hotspot zones of East Singhbhum from where the maximum number of infections are reported following which the market has been declared as a containment zone and sealed from all sides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/take-cov-test-or-face-legal-action-kadma-sdo-to-residents/articleshow/82247149.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Mishap, quarrel delay oxygen supply to Palamu||DALTONGANJ: The supply of oxygen cylinders to Palamu from Ranchi was disrupted amid the Covid-19 crisis after two freak incidents, district administration sources said on Sunday. In the first incident, a pick-up van with a load of 89 empty cylinders and heading towards Ranchi from Daltonganj on Saturday night for refilling turned upside down after hitting a tree near Lahlahey on NH-75, Satbarwa police station officer-in-charge Karam Pal Naag said. Naag said, “The pick-up van rammed the tree around 11.30 pm. Police immediately rushed to the site and retrieved the injured driver of the van. He was rushed to Medinirai Medical College Hospital in Daltonganj. We then collect the scattered empty cylinders which to prevent it from getting stolen.” Amit Prakash, the nodal officer for the supply of oxygen cylinders in Palamu, said 89 cylinders were loaded in another van on Sunday morning and sent to Ranchi. “The mishap has delayed the oxygen supply by almost a day,” he said. In another incident, the driver of another van carrying 74 empty cylinders returned to Daltonganj empty from Ranchi without refilling. Prakash said, “In Ranchi, the driver reportedly got into a quarrel with the refilling personnel and after spending the whole day there on Saturday returned to Daltonganj this morning with the empty cylinders.” The nodal officer added the vans and their drivers belonged to the medical oxygen cylinders supplier of the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mishap-quarrel-delay-oxygen-supply-to-palamu/articleshow/82247114.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Section of nurses on strike returns to work at city hospital||RANCHI: A day after 50 community health officers (CHO), deputed from different blocks of Ranchi district to nurse Covid-19 patients at the Ranchi sadar hospital, allegedly went on strike to demand outstanding incentives, a section of them rejoined duty on Sunday after deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan assured to release their payment soo. The CHOs, who have been deployed over and above the staff nurses of the hospital, allegedly went off duty without informing the hospital management, acting civil surgeon Dr Vinod Kumar said. “We landed in a soup and had to pull out our health workers from different services to manage the Covid-19 wards since last night,” Kumar claimed. At present, the sadar hospital has 240 general beds and 60 ICU beds earmarked for Covid-19 patients. The hospital management is aiming to add another 100 beds by the end of this week. “The existing nursing staff was insufficient to cater to so many patients. Hence, the CHOs were brought in and allotted duties in the three floors of the Covid-19 wing as per a roster. But last night (Saturday), only two of them turned up for duty at the third floor ICU while four were on duty,” a doctor in the hospital said. The CHOs are provided a monthly incentive of Rs 15,000 over and above their monthly salaries as a special allowance for rendering services during the pandemic. But they claimed that their incentives of last three months are due. Speaking to a section of the agitating nurses, Ranjan urged them to rejoin their duties, following which a few returned to work. “Even then, the situation has not improved as many will rejoin only on Monday,” Kumar told TOI. Meanwhile, the management of Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) on Sunday began training 100 constables of the India Reserve Battalion (IRB) in handling oxygen cylinders. The IRD jawans will be deployed outside Rims trauma centre, which has been converted into a Covid-19 facility, for administering oxygen to incoming patients. The IRB will handle the patients in need of oxygen support till the time they are admitted to the Covid 19-ward. “Since there is a shortage of manpower to cater to patients in need of immediate oxygen support upon arrival, the jawans have being roped in. It will help save lives and provide relief to the patients,” Rims additional director P K Waghmare said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/section-of-nurses-on-strike-returns-to-work-at-city-hosp/articleshow/82246921.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Goa||Goa: Objections, suggestions to draft coastal plan ready||PANAJI: The state government has completed compiling the objections and suggestions to the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) submitted by village panchayats. “The compilation of objections and suggestions will be placed before the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) to decide the further course of action,” senior officer said. Objections, suggestions related to khazan lands will be sent to the water resource department (WRD), objections pertaining to fishing zones will be sent to the fisheries department, the officer said. Recently, the high court of Bombay at Goa disposed of cases questioning the public hearing conducted by the North Goa collector for finalising the draft CZMP after the petitioners agreed to file appropriate proceedings before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) at New Delhi. In March, the high court had restrained the government respondents from proceeding further on the basis of the minutes of the hearing on March 7, 2021, for a period of three weeks or until further orders, whichever is earlier. The high had passed the interim order and observed that the PIL ought to have been filed before the NGT. But they were hearing the petitioners as the western zone bench of the tribunal at Pune has not been functional. The public hearings of March 7, 2021, for the CZMP was shunned by people, terming it as a farce, as the state government restricted the number of registrations citing Covid protocols and each speaker was allotted just five minutes.Amid angry protests inside and outside the venues, with a huge posse of police personnel guarding it, the state government claimed to have successfully concluded the hearings. There was utter chaos as hundreds of people came out against the CZMP demanding wider consultation, even as the coastal zone management authority carried out the exercise at Panaji and Margao through the district collectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/objections-suggestions-to-draft-coastal-plan-ready/articleshow/82248245.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: 19 walk away from quarantine over poor facilities, return on being booked by cops||NAGPUR: Nineteen inmates of a Covid quarantine centre in Ghatanji taluka of Yavatmal district walked out on Saturday, and went back home to Ambadi village, around 10km away. They returned after police registered offences against them, and claim to have left because of poor facilities at the centre. The group had been found positive after a testing camp was held at their village. They were sent to the premises of an Industrial Training Institute (ITI) at Ghatanji, which has been converted into a quarantine centre. However, all 19 of them went back home the same day. They only returned after police action was taken and offences registered against them. One of the inmates TOI spoke to said they had left the centre because of poor facilities. He also stressed that none of them had escaped but openly walked out without any resistance, due to confusion on whether it was mandatory for them to stay there or not. “We had reached the centre voluntarily on our motorbikes instead of being taken there, and we rode back on the same. There was utter confusion, there were no beds or any other arrangement. There was an impression that we don’t need to stay there, so we went back. Now we have ended up with offences slapped against our names by the police,” said Yashwant Rathore, one of those now back at the centre. “We only realized that something has gone wrong when news about us started doing the rounds,” he said. Sanjay Dambhare, a local resident and Kisan Congress leader, said a camp was held at the village in which 230 persons were tested, out of whom around 20 were found positive. One more round of tests had been held before that too. Dambhare says the situation is bad in the area. There are still a number of patients who are not coming out to get tested. There may be a number of homes having patients with fever and cough, but they are simply avoiding tests. There is a general reluctance towards getting vaccinated also, he said. Devanand Pawar, a Congress leader from Yavatmal said patients in the rural areas need to be put in quarantine centres instead of being confined at home. The idea of home quarantine would not work in villages as houses are small with hardly one odd room. Pawar also too did not rule out the possibility of hidden cases in the villages. Gram sevak Santosh Mahure, however, said the cases have now been identified after the two testing camps and things are under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/19-walk-away-from-quarantine-over-poor-facilities-return-on-being-booked-by-cops/articleshow/82248473.cms||Shishir Arya

This was after a 14-hour long search conducted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) at his residence-cum-office earlier in the day. Deshmukh and his team returned from Katol in the wee hours of Sunday. There was speculation regarding Deshmukh’s scheduled visit to Katol on Saturday as the CBI officials were at his place from 8am to 10pm. Deshmukh, in his 70s, left for Katol at around 7pm shortly after the CBI team left his house. In a dramatic manner, the CBI team returned within 15 minutes following which Deshmukh too had to rush back home. It was another two hours after the CBI team finally left the place. The NCP MLA from Katol too walked out barely after two minutes and sat in his car to leave for Katol at 10pm. It’s learnt, Deshmukh visited Katol to review the facilities provided at the new 50-bed Covid care centre there. He later also visited a Covid care centre being developed at a Nagar Parishad school. “The ex-minister (Deshmukh) checked the facilities at the two places before sharing his suggestions with the medical and support staff. He has instructed the district collector and revenue department team to provide adequate facilities to both the facilities,” said a source. Deshmukh, who spent an uneventful day at home on Sunday, is expected to leave for Mumbai on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-seeing-off-cbi-team-deshmukh-reviews-covid-facilities-at-katol/articleshow/82248517.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||Line producers demand action against taxi drivers in Goa||PANAJI: There is a need to embrace technology in taxi cab operations in Goa, said the association of line producers on Sunday and demanded action against cab operators who threaten guests that come to the state for film shootings. “All the line producers are following SOPs and there was no issue all this while. All of a sudden now, there is a problem,” Sandeep Kotecha, line producer and president of the association, Goa said. Citing videos being circulated online of cabbies stopping Goa Miles vehicles and passengers, the line producers said “it will be disastrous for Goa to bow down to pressure tactics of banned technology and banned aggregators.” They also said that there are 30-line producers in Goa and currently there are about 10-12 film and TV shootings in progress in Goa. They further said that this behaviour is affecting the hotel industry as well in Goa. “In the last few days some guests were stopped from travelling in taxis of their choice, videos of which are viral. Just 300-400 people cannot take Goa for ransom. This is uncalled for,” said line producer Nilesh Newalkar. “Miscreants cannot spoil the image of Goa. The things happening are uncalled for and must be stopped immediately. The transport industry must be regulated using meters and customers should be entitled to select their mode of transport from wherever they want,” he said. Line producer Atish Fernandes said that the operators are intimidating their drivers by coming on two-wheelers or walking or sending women to take down numbers of their cars and drivers. “This is a Naxalite way of attacking our business. This is a problem created because they don’t want technology and fare regulation. We urge the CM to listen to our complaint and register the same.” he said. Jack Sukhija, vice president, (North Goa), Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) said, “The film business is one of the few businesses that is operating in Goa. The taxi operators want to force customers to use their vehicles only. There have to be other aggregators that need to come into play and there has to be competition. The taxi union should understand that there are various players in this eco-system,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/line-producers-demand-action-against-taxi-drivers/articleshow/82248523.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Now, Bevacizumab seen as a substitute for Tocilizumab||Nagpur: Bevacizumab, an injection used for treating cancer and eye diseases, is gradually gaining ground as a substitute for Tocilizumab, which is in short-supply and not expected to be available before April 30. Tocilizumab is considered as the last resort in Covid treatment but only 20 injections are being allotted for Nagpur district as of now. The injection, priced around Rs41,700 per vial, has been in short-supply ever since it gained popularity as a life-saver for critical Covid patients. Bevacizumab, priced between Rs37,500 to Rs39,000, is readily available in the market with some physicians already prescribing or administering it to their patients. With reports that the more popular substitute for Tocilizumab, like Itolizumab (Alzumab), would be available in Nagpur only by May 5, a frenetic search started to find another alternative as fatalities are soaring with each passing day. People in the know-how of city’s pharmaceutical market are of the view that Tocilizumab will be out of reach of commoners whenever it becomes available as only the rich and influential class can afford it. Senior physician Dr Jay Deshmukh said Bevacizumab has ‘similar action’ as Tocilizumab. “Both the drugs reduce the Interleukin-6 (endogenous chemical) which is manifested in the Cytokine storm. Interleukin 6 is the outcome of the hyper immunity response. It’s the cytokine storm which leads to fatality,” said Deshmukh. Dr Deshmukh added that the Bevacizumab acts as the ‘Interleukin (IL-6) inhibitor’ which is being used as a potential drug in US along with Remdesivir and steroids. “When there is nothing much to try, especially in absence of Tocilizumab, we are administering Bevacizumab,” he said. Dr Manoj Purohit of Radiance Hospital said he too has recently started the use of Bevacizumab following a study describing the efficacy of the drug. “Various studies have stated that Bevacizumab has been successfully used to overcome the cytokine storm. So, we administered it to some critical patients at our hospital,” said Dr Purohit. “Though a repurposed drug, the key role Bevacizumab plays as an ‘IL-6 receptor inhibitor’ can make it effective in the long run,” he said. Dr Pinak Dande of Dande hospital too is set to introduce the drug in his treatment protocol. According to a senior pharmaceutical market expert, Bevacizumab’s demand has increased across Maharashtra and in key pockets in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. “Bevacizumab is now regularly going to other neighbouring states from Nagpur,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-bevacizumab-seen-as-a-substitute-for-tocilizumab/articleshow/82248527.cms||Soumitra Bose

If any DySP fails the exam in three attempts, the incumbent will be reverted to the post of PI, the rules notified by the Goa government state. Under secretary (personnel) Maya Pednekar said that every candidate selected and appointed as a junior scale officer in the Goa Police Service shall attend training for a period of 12 months at a police academy or training college as decided by the government.

She said that after completion of the training, the DySp shall attend 45-day departmental training at Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development (GIPARD). The DySP will have to appear for a departmental examination conducted by GIPARD before completion of 15 months from the date of appointment. Those who do not clear this examinationm will get another chance to appear for the same within three months. For those who don’t manage to clear it, a third opportunity will be available before completion of 23 months from the date of appointment as DySP. “The probationer (DySP) who fails to clear the said examination even after three attempts will be considered as being unable to complete the probation period successfully and his/her services will be terminated,” Pednekar said Recently, the GPSC had rejected the government’s proposal seeking exemption of certain requirements for promotion from DySP to superintendent of police (SP).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-dysps-will-have-to-clear-exam-to-keep-job/articleshow/82248551.cms||---

The second wave of Covid-19 has wreaked havoc in Chandrapur with exponential rise in number of cases and deaths. While district administration is under immense pressure to build more Covid facilities, the GMCH is faced with a daunting task of starting the 400-bed facility promised earlier. While necessary material to set up the facility is ready, the biggest hurdle is of finding doctors to treat patients. Despite all the efforts GMCH has been able to start only a 72-bed facility in the women’s hospital. GMCH dean then floated an advertisement for walk-in interview for the post of 10 MD physicians, 10 anesthetics and 20 junior resident doctors. While nobody came forward for the post of physicians despite offering a salary of Rs2 lakh per month, four anesthetics have joined through walk-in-interview. “Our students from the first batch that cleared the final year last year have joined the duty after appearing for the walk-in-interview,” said Dr Humne and added, “These junior resident doctors will be paid Rs1 lakh per month salary for their services.” According to the dean, the increase in manpower has allowed them to add 42 more beds at the Covid treatment facility at women’s hospital. Currently, there are 131 beds available at the women’s hospital. They include 42 ICU, 76 oxygen and 10 general beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/boost-for-chanda-gmch-as-20-former-students-join-covid-fight/articleshow/82248542.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Business||Oil, steel companies divert 4k MT of oxygen to hospitals||NEW DELHI: The oil and steel sectors are diverting close to 4,000 metric tonnes (MT) of liquid oxygen to hospitals treating coronavirus patients on a daily basis, accounting for over 60% of the 6,600 MT currently available in the system. “The message has gone to companies to ensure transportation and augmentation of supplies in whatever way possible. Refineries and steel plants have maximised the production of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) by reducing their own demand for industrial use,” petroleum and steel minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. While the oil sector is currently diverting 965 MT of LMO daily, steel companies are contributing 2,500-3,000 MT. On Saturday, the steel sector produced 3,474 MT of LMO against a capacity of 2,834 MT. Supply for medical purposes nearly doubled to 2,894 MT on Saturday, compared to 1,500-1,700 MT a week earlier. The government is tapping all sources to increase the supply of medical oxygen and on Sunday initiated fresh measures to ensure that liquid oxygen was not consumed by industrial units. A bulk of the additional 1,500 MT that will now flow into the system will also come from the two sectors. The petroleum ministry said oil PSUs are also in the process of setting up Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen generation plants at 93 locations across the country to facilitate captive facilities at hospitals to strengthen availability and supply of medical-grade oxygen. While 28 of them will come up in Karnataka, 12 will be in Uttar Pradesh and nine in Bihar. Indian Oil is tasked with handling bottlenecks in the transport of LMO and is procuring cryogenic tankers. “Nine tankers have been contracted, software and an app to manage the movement is under progress for rollout,” the petroleum ministry said. Private sector companies in the two sectors are also doing their bit, apart from SAIL. For instance, a large Covid-care facility is coming up near JSW Steel’s plant in Dolvi, Maharashtra, which will also reduce the need to transport oxygen in tankers. On Sunday, JSPL chairman Naveen Jindal said that the company’s tankers will reach the capital from Raipur and provide oxygen to Batra, Medanta and Akash hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/oil-steel-cos-divert-4k-mt-of-oxygen-to-hospitals/articleshow/82250003.cms||---

Over the years the number of people who qualify for this allowance has seen a steady increase. It’s a narrow segment, and that skill has to be in demand,” said Apparao V V, chief HR officer. It introduced skill-based allowances some three years ago. The C Vijayakumar- led HCL has identified 25-30 hot skills. “Based on 18 months data, we have geared up our engine in terms of certifying and training these people so that we can fulfil a large part of the demand internally. If 100 positions are required, we can fulfil 55 positions internally,” Apparao said. HCL is hiring 20,000 campus graduates in FY22, compared to 14,500 in the previous fiscal. “We have demand for 17,000 people from different businesses and this year we are targeting 20,000 new recruits. Our offshore hiring has increased dramatically as the business mix has changed due to visa policies, the Covid situation,” Apparao said. As of March 31, HCL’s headcount was 1,68,977. It added 18,554 people last year. Attrition came down to 9.9% from 16% a year earlier.

Nagpur Municipal Corporation-run (NMC) testing centre officials said daily they come across persons who queue up again within a couple of days of getting their first result. They said a curb on such persons can bring down the daily case numbers, which are surging every day. However, a civic official, who is entrusted with data compilation, said such cases account for less than one per cent cases. He said the repeat testing is not making much of a difference in daily figures. “Even if someone gets tested again, the case is removed as ICMR portal detects it. However, this is subject to the person filling in same spelling of name, address and mobile number,” he said. The repeaters include persons who are not happy with a negative report as well as those who doubt a positive report. A large number of people are also getting frequently tested as a mandatory workplace requirement for a Covid negative certificate. These include positive patients who get themselves tested after 10 days, though as per ICMR norms this is no longer required to declare a person Covid-free. An official said a referral system must be put in place to ensure the needy get priority and cases reflect the actual daily count of cases. A positive patient getting him or herself tested again within a week is added in the long list of positive cases, zone officials said. Centre officials said the repeaters often given different mobile numbers, make certain changes in address or their name spelling. “People testing after 10 days have a high chance of showing false positive. Some go for a private lab if they are stopped at public testing centres,” the civic official said. Even if one percent are repeaters, the testing centres are reeling under immense pressure of workload. The district has been performing 20,000 to 25,000 tests daily. Another testing centre official said people fight if they ask what is the need to get tested again. “As there is no system, we have to test whoever is waiting in line. We are forced to test everyone. It will lead to delays if we are to check for repeaters among all 300 to 400 people at our centre,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/officials-want-citizens-to-stop-doing-repeat-tests-for-covid/articleshow/82248646.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

According to GVMC officials, the building had encroached upon space earmarked for construction of a highway. As officials started demolishing the building, heated arguments ensued between them and Palla Srinivasa Rao. Finally, the civic body, with help from local police and revenue authorities, pulled down the building. Meanwhile, giving the incident a political colour, Palla Srinivasa Rao alleged that the state government was targeting him for refusing an offer to join YSRC. “How can they demolish the structure without issuing any notices? I will approach the court,” he said. TDP chief and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu issued a statement alleging that the state government is resorting to ‘diversion politics’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/civic-body-tears-down-tdp-leaders-building/articleshow/82246626.cms||---

The discoms are supplying 17.2 million units of electricity per annum to hospitals and Covid care centres. State energy secretary Srikanth Nagulapalli said that power utilities were on the forefront in the fight against the pandemic even during the first wave. "Electricity employees had served as warriors at field level, ensuring uninterrupted power to all hospitals in the first wave, and won accolades from the general public," said Srikanth. The energy secretary, who conducted a review meet on power supply to hospitals, requested the utilities to put all efforts in this second wave of the pandemic and turn out to be the champions of service. “The time has come for all of us to show our grit and commitment in rendering top class service to electricity consumers as was done last year. Power utilities should always be ready to offer immediate service to any request from the hospitals. No employee shall avail holidays in this exigency. The government and the utilities assure the employees that if anyone is infected with Covid-19, complete medical facilities and care would be offered on a war footing basis,” said Srikanth. The energy secretary further said that discom revenues from the industrial and commercial sector took a major hit in 2020 on account of the pandemic. “In this crucial period, the state government has come to the rescue of the power utilities that incurred a loss of around Rs 4,300 crore in the form of subsidy to the tune of Rs 17,904 crore in 2019–20. Perhaps no state government in the country has supported utilities like this. The sales of the discoms came down by almost 15% whereas the revenue also plummeted to an equal level,” said Srikanth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/power-utilities-ready-to-support-hospitals/articleshow/82246628.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Start ayurvedic Covid-19 hospital in Nagpur too, demands NIMA||NAGPUR: In order to fight against the bed and medicine crisis in the second wave, the authorities have now shortlisted many ayurvedic medical colleges and hospitals to turn them into Covid hospitals. Ayurveda practitioners and students in Nagpur have demanded that Covid hospital, if started in Ayurveda Medical College, must have an option for patients to be treated with ayurvedic medicines and treatment. One such experiment is already underway in Thane. In Thane, the municipal corporation had decided to start Covid-19 hospital in the Arogyadhaam Hospital. Here, they have allowed doctors to treat patients using ayurveda treatment. Patients will get both options – modern medicine and ayurveda — here. The Maharashtra Covid-19 task force has allowed this integrated approach in this hospital. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and state health department are currently in the process of starting Covid-19 hospitals at two ayurvedic colleges in city. The National Integrated Medical Association (NIMA) has demanded that patients should be given ayurveda as treatment option here. “If it can happen in Thane, then why not in Nagpur?” asked Dr Mohan Yende, senior office-bearer of NIMA. NMC has planned 200-bed Covid hospital in Government Ayurvedic College and 100-bed facility in Mulak Ayurvedic college so far. Proposals have been invited from many other ayurveda colleges in and around Nagpur, and soon they will also start Covid-19 treatment. Member of Maharashtra Covid task force Dr Shubha Raul said ayurvedic treatment has proved beneficial for thousands of patients. “We have been demanding this from Maharashtra government since last 14 months. Patients should have freedom to choose pathy to be used on them. This will also release burden on modern medicine and will help reduce crisis of medicines and injections,” she said. Ayurveda practitioner Vaidya Nandan Narlawar said even modern medicine doctors are treating Covid-19 patients only in symptomatic way. “There is still no medicine for Covid-19 in allopathy. Ayurveda at least has a proper treatment mentioned in it. We have thousands of testimonials. Patients are ready to be treated with ayurveda. Government should allow this in Nagpur,” he said. TOI tried to contact NMC health officials about this demand, but they said that final decision will be taken by the Covid-19 task force and state government’s health department. INTEGRATED APPROACH Many ayurvedic doctors are treating Covid patients with their own medicines They have testimonials in Nagpur with patients claiming they recovered with ayurvedic medicines At least 4 doctors in city have become so popular that they see hundreds of patients daily At least 2 ayurvedic medical colleges will be become Covid-19 hospitals in next 2 weeks Doctors have demanded that they should get permission to treat patients with ayurvedic medicines||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/start-ayurvedic-covid-19-hospital-in-nagpur-too-demands-nima/articleshow/82248665.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Goa||Goa: Irked over dust, noise pollution for road work, seniors take on PWD||PANAJI: Taking cognizance of a complaint filed by a group of senior citizens residing in a colony at Bambolim, the Goa State Human Rights Commission (GHRC) has issued a notice to the public works department (PWD) over the noise and dust pollution, which the senior citizens said they have been exposed to due to the ongoing ‘ill-planned’ highway expansion work at Bambolim. The residents of Palmar Colony, all senior citizens, have also filed a complaint with the Old Goa police station. The complainants said that at the time of purchasing the plots in the colony 25 years ago, the developer had retrieved the cost of construction of a road for the colony from the purchasers. They said the ill-planned highway expansion work has now resulted in light and heavy vehicles plying through this internal road, creating noise and dust pollution. They have told GHRC that RTI documents show that PWD has altered its original highway expansion plan to save only one commercial building in Bambolim from demolition. Further, they alleged that PWD has taken up the ongoing work without approval for the revised plan. The residents said that their complaints to the Old Goa Police Station, the town and country planning department and the flying squad under the deputy collector had yielded no results. Unnecessary hill-cutting and excavation had been carried out by PWD as per the original highway expansion plan, which led to dust and noise pollution. With the plan altered, the excavated land area is now being filled up, which means the residents endured dust and noise pollution in vain, they told GHRC. The group has requested the commission for an appropriate order so that the original plan of the highway is maintained and the use of the St. Cruz-Bambolim road is restored as a two-way road, and public traffic through their residential colony is stopped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/irked-over-dust-noise-pollution-for-road-work-seniors-take-on-pwd/articleshow/82248690.cms||---

The EU last week released a new policy aimed at stepping up its influence in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China’s rising power. The Philippines on Friday protested to China over its failure to withdraw what it called as “threatening” boats believed to be manned by maritime militia around the disputed Whitsun Reef, which Manila calls the Julian Felipe Reef and Beijing calls Niu’E Jiao. “Tensions in SCS, including the presence of Chinese vessels at Whitsun Reef, endanger peace and stability in the region,” a EU spokesperson said. China rejected EU’s accusation that its ships had endangered peace.

People for Animals (PFA), Goa, has identified social media handles through which these events are being organised and has demanded that a committee be set up with the district SPCAs to investigate and enforce the ban on bullfights in Goa, failing which they said they would take the matter to court. “It is disheartening to see many young boys participating in these fights, both as handlers of bulls and spectators. As we head into further lockdowns because of the second wave of the pandemic, we fear a dangerous repeat of last year,” PFA president Norma Alvares wrote in a letter to the chief secretary, joint police commissioner, the animal husbandry department and the SPCA of both, North and South Goa. The letter further states that there have been social media accounts of dhirio organisers uploading “fresh videos of bullfights from across the state” in the past few weeks. “A committee needs to be set up immediately with the district SPCAs to investigate and enforce the ban on bullfights. We also need to build constructive dialogue through campaigns and social media to educate people,” Alvares wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/set-up-panel-to-enforce-ban-on-dhirio-animal-welfare-group-says/articleshow/82248712.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Cricket betting racket busted in Guntur, Rs 12 lakh cash seized||VIJAYAWADA: Police arrested three persons including a realtor and a chartered accountant for organising a cricket betting racket at Guntur on Sunday. The accused were identified as Potla Srinivasa Rao (39), Kancheti Surya Teja (31) and Shiek Nagul Meera Vali (31), all from Guntur city. Guntur Urban SP, RN Ammi Reddy said that Rao used to be in the real estate business. After he incurred losses and was unable to earn enough to support a lavish lifestyle, he started organising cricket betting with the help of Surya Teja, a chartered accountant, who used to work with him. The duo used to run the betting racket with the help of mobile applications. They hired Meera Vali as a collection agent. He used to collect the money from punters who lost the bets and also used to deliver the money to those who won the bets. While organising the racket, the duo had differences with Meera Vali over collection of money. After finding Rs 37 lakh short in the accounts, both Rao and Surya Teja started pressurising Meera Vali for money. On April 24, the duo went to Meera Vali’s home and allegedly beat him up, demanding he cover the amount that was falling short in the accounts. Meera Vali lodged a police complaint against Rao and Surya Teja. Based on information they received from Meera Vali, police conducted a raid at a secluded place near ZP quarters and found Rao and Surya Teja conducting cricket betting operations in a car. They were both arrested and the car and Rs 12 lakh cash seized from them. While Meera Vali was also arrested for his involvement in cricket betting, a separate case has been registered against Rao, Surya Teja, Rehan and Raju for beating Meera Vali under section 307 of IPC for attempt to murder. Rehan and Raju are yet to be arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cricket-betting-racket-busted-in-guntur-rs-12-lakh-cash-seized/articleshow/82246703.cms||---

The deceased was identified as Ammulu. Another person, her cousin Prakash, was injured in the accident. Police say that the bus driver lost control over the vehicle which first ran over the woman then hit four two-wheelers parked along the road and then rammed into two telephone poles before stopping at a third, an electric pole. Tirupati (east) sub-inspector Nagendra Babu said that the 30-year-old Ammulu and Prakash had come to Tirupati from Paleru to avail treatment as Ammulu was suffering from fever for the last three days. They were on their way to a hospital when the accident occurred. The sub-inspector said: prima facie it appears that rash and negligent driving by the bus driver, S Gopal, is the cause of the accident. The driver was purportedly glancing at some documents when he lost control of the vehicle. Fortunately, the bus hit two telephone poles but stopped before hitting the electric pole. Had the bus hit the electric pole, there would have been more damage as there were around 20 passengers on board, the sub-inspector said. A case has been registered against the bus driver under Section 304A.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rtc-bus-runs-over-30-year-old-woman-in-tirupati/articleshow/82246713.cms||---
---||Chennai||Lyricist who wrapped a message in a song||By R RangarajA poet, author, Carnatic vocalist, songwriter for films and a communist at heart, Trichy Tyagarajan was a man of varied tastes and interests. His philosophy seeped into his music too as is seen in the thought-provoking lyrics of "Sindhithaal Sirippu Varum" in the film ‘Sengamalatheevu’, reflecting his anger towards an exploitative society. In the song, he points out that while birds and animals lived happily and did not die of starvation or hunger, man, though endowed with a sixth sense, did nothing of credit and his acts caused massive shame ("maaperum vetkamadaa"). Few could intersperse lyrics of film songs with personal ideologies, making Trichy Tyagarajan, one of the gems of the Tamil film industry in the 1960s to 1970s. From 1959 to 1974, Tyagarajan worked in 28 films and contributed 38 songs, working with maestros like K V Mahadevan, S Rajeswara Rao, S M Subbiah Naidu and T K Ramamutrthy, besides Shankar Ganesh. It is sad to note the centenary of a man who made his audience pause and think went by without a remembrance by the industry.Born to Govindaswami and Varadammal at Veereswaram near Trichy-Srirangam, Tyagarajan after completing his schooling tried his hand at a job in Bombay and later in the railways and also took part in the freedom struggle. He started writing poems, releasing his first book of 78 poems called ‘Isaiyaruvi’ in 1950, but he realised he had an urge to write for films. HMV company invited him to write songs on Tirupathi Venkatachalapathy but he turned it down as he was not inclined to write Bhakti songs. A keen interest in music led him to learn Carnatic music from Radhakrishna Pillai and T K Lakshmanan. Through common friends, Tyagarajan met Chidambaram Rajaraman, principal of Thiruvaiyaru Music College, who introduced him to Carnatic vidwan M M Dhandapani Desikar. Having sound knowledge of Carnatic music by then and endowed with a good voice, Tyagarajan impressed Dhandapani Desikar with an original composition "Thaamarai Pootha Thadaagamadi" set in Sindhubhairavi raagam. Desikar appreciated Tyagarajan's talent. This song, set as a private album, became popular later. Tyagarajan wrote his first film song in 1959, "Pon Vilaiyum Bhoomi", which spoke about workers toiling hard in the field. The song sung by C S Jayaraman to music by K H Reddy, had his ideological references which made people take notice.Around the time, the songwriter had also written the book titled ‘Sengeetham’ (Red Music) which contained songs on communism. However, he later developed ideological differences with the left movement and quit active politics. Later Tyagarajan went on to release a number of books including ‘Kalaivirundhu’, ‘Sindhanai Selvam’ and ‘Velicham’.It was noted singer T M Sounderarajan who introduced him to producer M A Venu, and thus Tyagarajan went on to write for four productions of MAV Films –‘Sengamalatheevu’, ‘Thulasi Maadam’, ‘Ullaasa Payanam’ and ‘Thanga Valaiyal’. Impressed by Tyagarajan's powerful poems, former DMK chief M Karunanidhi too got him to write songs for ‘Avan Pithanaa’, ‘Marakka Mudiyumaa’ and ‘Vaaliba Virundhu’. MGR too liked his work and engaged with Tyagarajan for "Vatta Vatta Paathikatti" featuring K R Vijaya in ‘Thaazhampoo’ (1965), which went on to be a hit and for a film titled ‘Rickshaw Rangan’, which got shelved.Among his popular romantic songs were "Malarai Parithaay Thalaiyil Vaithaay", sung by P B Sreenivos and L R Eswari and composed by K V Mahadevan for ‘Sengamalatheevu’ 1962. The easy lyrics of this song made it popular and was often heard on All India Radio. Among his popular melodious numbers are those sung by M Balamuralikrishna (who played the role of Narada) in ‘Baktha Prahlaadha’ 1967.But his signature was songs with a message. He wrote for children too, "Chinna Chinna Paappaa" sung by P Susheela for Sowcar Janaki, which a hit number from the film ‘Maanavan’ (1970). Through the song, Tyagarajan listed some don’ts such as sleeping during the day, being slow and stubborn and forgetting one's duty of service to society). In the song "Naan Unnai Kaetkinren" sung by TMS for the film ‘Selviyin Selvan’ starring Ravichandran and Vijayakumari, Tyagarajan's lines "Poyyai Nambi Poizhaippavan Veettil, Neyyum Paalum Manappadhaa" (Should there be the fragrance of milk and ghee at a house of a liar) stimulate thought.Tyagarajan never abandoned his conscience or compromised on his principles and ideals, and always stood for the downtrodden with the hope that one day things would change for the working class.

---||Chennai||Politicians question Centre over missing Tamil version of NEP||CHENNAI: Political parties in Tamil Nadu, including an ally of the AIADMK, kept up the pressure on the Centre over the missing Tamil version of the new education policy document. The Centre had released it in 17 different languages, but not in Tamil. DMK president M K Stalin and MDMK general secretary Vaiko had questioned the Centre over the issue on Saturday. On Sunday, MNM president Kamal Haasan and PMK youth wing president Anbumani Ramadoss joined the issue. “Boycotting Tamil by the Centre, which has brought out the New Education Policy document in several languages, is not acceptable. It looks like quoting Thirukkural and Bharathiyar poems in public addresses is only a drama to indicate the love towards Tamil. In reality, waging of a war against Tamil culture and cutting off the rights of Tamils continues,” Kamal said on Sunday. In a statement, PMK youth wing president Anbumani Ramadoss asked the Centre to release the new education policy document in Tamil too. While the new education policy was passed and adopted in July last year, the Centre has now released the document in 17 languages, but not in Tamil. Several aspects of the new policy were questioned by political parties and others in Tamil Nadu. “There is no justification for avoiding Tamil and in fact, the document should be released in all 22 official languages in the eighth schedule,” Anbumani Ramadoss said. Earlier, on Saturday, Stalin said since the new education policy was seen as a mode to promote Sanskrit. Even educationists had opposed it on various grounds. “The BJP government at the Centre, which is functioning contrary to the norms of the Indian Constitution and against the plurality of the Indian society, and pushing ahead with its new education policy has shown its dominant stance on language through the translations it has released.,” Stalin said. NTK chief coordinator Seeman said, “This attitude arises out of the absolute power it holds at the Centre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/politicians-question-centre-over-missing-tamil-version-of-nep/articleshow/82257800.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chennai||Foreign medical graduates oppose 2-year limit to clear test||CHENNAI: With the Foreign Medical Graduates Examinations (FMGEs) recording a poor pass percentage, graduates and education consultants say the proposed two year limit for clearing the screening test, mandatory for practising in India, isn’t practical. Every year, around 3,000 students from Tamil Nadu who have completed medical degrees in foreign universities appear for the FMGE that is held twice a year. Only 19.4%ofn foreign medical graduates cleared the screening test held in December 2020. The National Medical Council’s draft regulation 2021 for foreign medical graduates, released on its website, gives only two years to clear the test. It also proposes an additional paper in pre and para clinical subjects. Many students say they prepare for the test only in the final year or pre-final year and that the new rule will add to the pressure. M Vignesh, a final year student at Xinjiang Medical University in China, said he could not write the test in December 2020 due to a delay in getting a provisional certificate. “As per the proposed regulation, students get only four attempts. Foreign medical graduates usually face delays in getting certificates and will need time to prepare. If they miss one or two attempts, it will put them under enormous pressure,” he said. Nirosha, who cleared the test in December 2020 with a score of 179 (students need to score 150 of 300 to be eligible to practise in India), said students have to prepare well in all 20 subjects. “The difficulty level varies for each test which makes it difficult to clear in one or two attempts.” Education consultants said admissions in foreign universities will be affected. “The proposed regulations are against students,” said C Ravichandran, managing director, Study Abroad Educational Consultants. “They [students] go out of the country only because they fail to get a seat here. They travel abroad at a very young age and return to serve people in their country. The new regulations will discourage them from going abroad,” he said, criticising the move to introduce an additional paper. A Mahendran, managing director of Foreign Students Study Centre in Trichy, said it was unfair to fix a two-year limit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/foreign-med-grads-oppose-2-year-limit-to-clear-test/articleshow/82250041.cms||---

After two hours, when doctors didn’t evaluate her, the woman was so tired that she returned home. Sasha’s isn’t an isolated case in the city. As cases surge, the screening centres that are equipped to handle around 150 patients a day have to deal with 200-300 people. In fact, the screening centre at Adyar handles about 450 cases a day. Patients come from even Valasaravakkam and Alandur as these zones do not have a screening centre. In KK Nagar, Rashmi*, a resident, said she took her parents aged 80 twice to the screening centre but had to return without an evaluation both times. “They are 80 years old and have tested positive. They have symptoms such as body pain and tiredness. The weather is also very hot. It is not possible for them to wait for so long. And both times, we waited for at least an hour,” she said. They were thinking of getting the blood test done at a private diagnostic centre now, she added. A resident from Valasaravakkam who didnt want to be named said the staff members were courteous and corporation officials helpful. “But it is extremely crowded. We are very scared as we may pass on the disease to others and also since we have symptoms, it is not good for us to spend so much time outside,” said the resident. “To avoid crowding and to ensure better patient management, we are planning to open 18 more screening centres in the coming week. This would mean each zone will have two centres,” said a senior corporation official. Each screening centre has two doctors, two lab technicians, and two x-ray machine operators, besides two paramedical staff to manage the crowds. Greater Chennai corporation commissioner, G Prakash had said the patients would not have to spend more than 45 minutes at the 12 screening centres in the city to be screened and evaluated. “If we get two screening centres per zone, it will not take more than 30 minutes for each patient to get evaluated,” said a senior official. “Since schools are closed, we will convert them into screening centres. We have the required medical equipment at the UPHCs. We just need the manpower which will be alloted by the state government,” said an official.

---||Chennai||People in Chennai struggle to reach home from railway stations||CHENNAI: The first Sunday shutdown left stranded people who arrived in the city by early morning trains at Egmore and Central. They came out to deserted roads, with hardly any cabs or autorickshaws in sight. The few drivers around kept an eye out for the cops. At Egmore railway station, families were seen waiting with bags at around 7.45am. There were no autos available at the pre-paid counter. People who had to go to Sowcarpet managed to get some vehicles arranged by their relatives after a wait of around half an hour. Some people who had to go to Ekkattuthangal were seen bargaining with a few auto drivers who were hesitating to drop them fearing police crackdown. A TOI photojournalist saw around 15 groups of people including families waiting outside the station for vehicles. A few who lived nearby decided to walk. A woman and two children waiting with heavy bags said "We are coming from Madurai and expected autos to be available at the pre-paid counter.” The woman said she had called her husband who would bring his motorcycle and was try to arrange another vehicle." The three finally had to travel on the bike with bags after they could not arrange another vehicle. A few autos that drove by quoted exorbitant fares while a few others refused to ride. "I do not want to take a risk because I do not have an excuse to tell the police when I return after dropping the passengers," said an auto driver. There were not many autos and cabs at MGR Central either. Thankfully, the number of passengers was also low as many people did not travel in view of the lockdown. The state government had exempted autorickshaws and cabs ferrying railway passengers from the restrictions. However, many autorickshaw drivers did not ply their vehicles fearing harassment by the cops. The railways too did not arrange enough vehicles at the stations. A railway official said "We have asked the state government to exempt vehicles coming to the railway stations from the restrictions.”The official said there was a shortage only early in the morning and that autos and cabs were available at Egmore and Central later in the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/people-struggle-to-reach-home-from-railway-stations/articleshow/82250054.cms||---

The discussions have begun and the tentative locations – Guindy trade centre for south, Kilpauk indoor stadium for central zone and K P Park for north zone – have been selected. The preparations to convert them into Covid care centres have already begun. For the provision of oxygen the state government will decide, said an official. “It’s not easy to manage oxygen pipelines and the supply. Only trained medical staff can manage all that. For now we only have asymptomatic patients at these centres. However, if the state government decides, we will be ready to install them,” said a senior corporation official. The K P Park facility shut in February, will reopen this week. “It was popular among patients for its facilities last year. Since four blocks have been allotted to beneficiaries, we have other four blocks that can be converted into covid care centre. But only two of them will be opened now,” said an official. Presently, of the 11,645 beds available at 13 covid care centres, 2,410 beds are occupied. The civic body has tied up with medical colleges and hospitals for all of them to get doctors and nurses. At Jerusalem Engineering College, Mohammed Sathak Nursing College and St Josephs, staff will be allotted this week after which these will also be open to public. Meanwhile, to ensure better facilities at these centres, the civic body is planning to call patients and also conduct inspections. “The public health department and the hospitals will be incharge for the medical equipment and medical staff. We are responsible to provide food, house keeping and other infrastructure. Quality in food and cleanliness is being closely monitored but we plan to conduct frequent inspections to ensure they are good,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-corpn-to-open-500-bed-covid-care-centre/articleshow/82250066.cms||Komal Gautham
---||World||In US, millions skipping their second doses of Covid vaccines||Millions of Americans are not getting the second doses of their Covid-19 vaccines, and their ranks are growing. More than five million people, or nearly 8% of those who got a first shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, have missed their second doses, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is more than double the rate among people who got inoculated in the first several weeks of the nationwide vaccine campaign. The CDC’s count of missed second doses is through April 9. The reasons vary for why people are missing their second shots. In interviews, some said they feared the side effects, which can include flulike symptoms. Others said they felt that they were sufficiently protected with a single shot. Another hurdle has been surprisingly prevalent. A number of vaccine providers have cancelled second-dose appointments because they ran out of supply or didn’t have the right brand in stock. In Arkansas and Illinois, health officials have directed teams to call, text or send letters to people to remind them to get their second shots. In Pennsylvania, officials are trying to ensure that college students can get their second shots after they leave campus for the summer. South Carolina has allocated several thousand doses for people who are overdue for their second shot. Mounting evidence collected in trials and from realworld immunisation campaigns show that compared with the two-dose regimen, a single shot triggers a weaker immune response and may leave recipients more susceptible to virus variants. Cases remain high in US Vaccination rates are falling in the US, despite the spread of highly contagious virus variants. More than 50,000 new US cases were reported on Saturday, and case rates are similar to those of the second wave last summer. But the average number of vaccine doses being administered each day, which rose for months and peaked at 3.4 million, has now fallen to 2.9 million, its lowest level since March 31, according to data from the CDC. The vaccination rate stopped climbing on April 13, when health officials recommended pausing the use of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine to allow researchers to examine a rare blood-clotting disorder that emerged in six recipients. The FDA lifted the pause on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/in-us-millions-skipping-their-second-doses-of-covid-vaccines/articleshow/82250069.cms||---

To combat the situation, both district authorities have prescribed testing of suspected Covid-19 cases, quarantine, isolation, social distancing, and other public health measures in the micro-containment zones. Rapid response teams comprising medical officers, ASHA workers and others will investigate the outbreak and initiate control measures by assessing the situation. The health of sick people in these areas will also be checked through mobile check-up vans and the local authorities have been instructed to oversee those in home isolation. House-to-house surveillance by special teams will be constituted for this purpose. In North Goa, the health officer at the Chimbel primary health centre has been tasked with ensuring contact-tracing and screening of close contacts of those found to be infected. In South Goa, the chief officer of the Mormugao Municipal Council has been instructed to deploy staff to sanitise the area with assistance from the fire and emergency services, while the Mormugao mamlatdar has been appointed as duty magistrate to maintain law and order round the clock. Public movement within the containment zones will be restricted and such areas will be sealed by deploying adequate police force and setting up a number of ‘nakas’. “Any violation shall invite criminal proceedings under the relevant provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and Indian Penal Code, 1860,” the orders state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-micro-containment-zones-declared-near-panaji-one-in-vasco/articleshow/82248793.cms||---

The temple’s managing committee said that the district magistrate issued the instructions in view of the pandemic.“Devotees are requested to cooperate with the management till further notice. We urge one and everyone to avoid gatherings, wear face masks, follow social distancing for the safety and well-being of all mahajans, devotees, pujaris, employees, etc, so that we can collectively tide over this crisis,” the temple management said in a notice. Established in 1818, Shree Mahalaxmi temple is the oldest place of Hindu worship in Panaji. Officials in the North Goa collector’s office informed that the temple has made the announcement based on the district magistrate’s orders imposing restrictions under Section 144. “Institutions of all religions have been told that only the priests should carry out the daily rituals without the assembly of devotees. The temple has issued the public notice accordingly. No separate orders besides Section 144 have been issued, only the assembly of five or more persons is discouraged,” said an official. In March last year, all major temples across Goa, including the Shree Mahalaxmi Devasthan in Panaji, had voluntarily decided not to allow visitors during the pandemic to help prevent the spread of Covid-19, even before the instructions to this effect came from the central government. Shree Mahalaxmi temple reopened only in July 21, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citys-mahalaxmi-temple-closes-till-further-notice/articleshow/82248818.cms||---

They were reacting to a controversy caused by a viral online message claiming that Delhi Police would take “action” against people for sharing such material, reports Anam Ajmal. TOI has screenshots of such a “warning” received by volunteers on instant messaging apps. However, Delhi Police have denied issuing any such directive. “We take strong objection to such motivated and unsubstantiated allegations… and hope the media will not lend any credence to such rumours,” they said in a statement shared by PRO Chinmoy Biswal. The statement added that the propaganda was being spread by some “vested groups that thrive on misinformation.” Advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation shared a screenshot of a message on Sunday that claimed the government had invoked the DM Act. IFF, however, called the message fake. Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC) legal director Prasanth Sugathan had said the message about taking action against accounts has caused panic among volunteers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fake-warning-to-online-covid-volunteers-causes-panic/articleshow/82250079.cms||---

Wearing PPE kits, about 15 social work faculty students danced on a song ‘zindagi ki yahi reet hain, haar ke baad he jeet hain’ in the Covid ward, trying to inject spirit into the dejected atmosphere. “We have seen patients and relatives crying on video calls. Our performance was meant to give them some respite as well encourage them to think positively,” said Urvi Rana, one of the students. Another student, Yukti Modi said that being students of social work faculty, it was their duty to help others in crisis. Many patients were seen clapping and enjoying the performance in the Covid ward. The hospital staff too was full of praises for the students who have been helping them in the Covid ward for many days. Some days ago, the staff of Parul Sevashram Hospital too had performed a musical dance to motivate patients admitted in their Covid ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msu-students-dance-lifts-infected-patients-mood/articleshow/82246520.cms||---

Panaji resident Shruti Chaturvedi, together with a team of 20 volunteers, is putting together a toolkit comprising hospital contacts with updates on bed availabilities, home-cooked meal services, suppliers of oxygen cylinders, etc, to help Goans navigate their way in the face of adversity. “I was preparing a toolkit for Ahmedabad and, meanwhile, started getting panic calls from Goa. We therefore decided to start something for Goa on priority. The list has different things that a Covid patient needs - right from pharmacies to plasma donors,” Chaturvedi told TOI. No sooner did she tweet about the list of requirements, she was swarmed with volunteers stepping forward. Together they are now reaching out to pharmacists to create an inventory on the available drugs. For hospitals, they do not have a real time sheet as of now, but by frequently speaking to government and private hospitals and coordinating with the district collectors and district health officers, they are able to find out where beds are available. Restaurants and home cooks have been selected based on their ability to provide high protein nutritious food exclusively for Covid patients. In the absence of delivery services, the volunteers are willing to deliver the food to the homes of patients. After compiling all the data, Chaturvedi will be soon putting out an open sheet for people to refer to. All the services - except food and delivery - will be free of cost, she said. The volunteers are putting together an army of influencers to use their social media platform to amplify their voice for this cause. “We are also putting together a group of doctors who can communicate from homes or hospitals to give advice to patients. We are, however, struggling to find plasma donors because are there are not enough of them aware of our initiative. We need recovered Covid patients to come forward and volunteer,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panaji-womans-covid-toolkit-lists-hospital-contacts-beds-available-oxygen-suppliers/articleshow/82248858.cms||Nida Sayed

Counting will commence at 8am but the official announcement of the results may take some time. An average polling percentage of 66.7% was registered for the five civic bodies. Election authorities have issued an advisory to all candidates and political functionaries that there should not be any gathering of five or more persons outside the counting venues, as per section 144 of the Crpc to curb the spread of Covid-19 The office of collector has also issued directives to candidates that there should not be any victory procession after the counting process is over and results declared. “All contesting candidates are hereby appealed to refrain from organising any rally, procession or meeting after counting of votes. No permission shall be issued for such rallies and any contravention will be viewed seriously,” a deputy collector said. Of the 402 candidates in the fray, Mormugao tops the list with 136 candidates while Mapusa has 95, Margao 115, Quepem 62 and Sanguem 43. BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade has exuded confidence of winning all five municipalities. Political observers said that while BJP has already swept the zilla panchayat election, as well as six out of seven urban local bodies, including the Corporation of the City of Panaji, the results of the five municipal councils are equally important for the party. The stakes are high in Margao as BJP has been trying hard to wrest control of the commercial capital’s municipality. The BJP-supported panel is pitted against the one floated by Congress’ Digambar Kamat and Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco and Goa Forward Party’s Vijai Sardesai. Political observers said that it is important for BJP to win maximum municipalities before facing assembly elections next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/results-of-5-municipal-polls-today-no-victory-rallies-candidates-told/articleshow/82248142.cms||---

The Bangladesh inter-ministerial committee’s decision will suspend movement of people across the border. Export and import, however, will continue through the land border, an official said. Vehicles carrying goods from India will need to be properly sanitized, and drivers and helpers need to maintain Covid safety protocol. A Bangladesh official said movement of all foreigners through the land border will remain suspended for 14 days from Monday and hence no visa will be issued during this period. The air link to Dhaka had already been suspended due to the worsening Covid situation. The Indian high commission in Dhaka is issuing medical visas only in cases of extreme emergency. According to the official, the land ports of Petrapole-Benapole in North 24 Parganas, Burimari-Changrabandha in Cooch Behar and Akhaura in Tripura will remain open only for Bangladeshi nationals who are in India and want to return home once their visa expires. For this, they need to apply to the Bangladesh deputy high commission for permission that will allow them to cross the border, along with a Covid-negative report. The local administration will ensure necessary quarantine procedures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mounting-cases-bangladesh-shuts-land-border-to-people-but-trade-will-continue/articleshow/82248672.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On Saturday, the Maoists arrived at the construction on a motorcycle and asked the labourers to stop work immediately, following which they set the vehicle on fire and beat up the workers before fleeing the spot. This comes 18 days after seven vehicles of a road construction company were set ablaze by ultras in Lanji village. Earlier on March 4, three Jharkhand Jaguar jawans were killed in the same village when a bomb, planted by the rebels, triggered off. On Friday, a 29-year-old man named Dom Chaki was shot dead in Kudaburu village under Sonua police station area in West Singhbhum by suspected Maoists for being a police informer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/maoists-torch-truck-thrash-4-labourers-at-w-sbhum-construction-site/articleshow/82246994.cms||---
---||Kolkata||People want to hear ‘Covid ki baat’, not ‘Mann ki baat’, Didi tells Modi||Behrampore: Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Mann ki Baat’ radio address, chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday said “no one wants to hear your ‘Mann ki Baat’ now, talk ‘Covid ki Baat’ instead”. Banerjee also said if the BJP loved Bengal like it claimed, it should ensure the state got enough vaccines. “Talk about Covid first. Ensure we get vaccines, medicines and oxygen,” the CM said. “They provided three lakh vaccines (on Saturday). It will only help to vaccinate 1.5 lakh people. Bengal has a 10-crore population. Even under these constraints, we have vaccinated 1 crore people. We have asked for 1 crore more vaccines,” the CM said. “Why are truckloads of vaccines being transported to Gujarat? I have nothing against Gujarat but what about other states? You are discriminating against Bengal and giving lectures at poll meetings,” she added. “To mitigate the crisis of lack of oxygen and medicines, the Bengal government has already procured 5,000 oxygen cylinders. Industrial oxygen is being diverted for medical use. We have urged medical facilities to earmark 60% of their beds for Covid treatment. Safe houses are being set up,” the CM said. Banerjee claimed Covid had reduced in Bengal only to spike during the polls. “During the third phase (April 6), sensing the Covid surge we had repeatedly urged for reducing the remaining phases. They stopped campaigning, but why couldn’t the phases be reduced? They had planned these eight phases. In their bid to capture Bengal, they didn’t pay attention to the country. They have pushed the country to a disaster,” she said. Speaking on “BJP’s plans to rig elections”, Banerjee said: “Amit Shah has deployed all central forces for BJP leaders. These BJP-sheltered goons, along with central forces, are threatening and intimidating voters. They plan to do the same in Burdwan East.” Questioning the role of special police observer Vivek Dube, the CM said, “Once we come to office, we will move the Supreme Court. Why will retired officers be brought in for polls? They are identifying Trinamool Congress workers and putting them under preventive detention. This is illegal. No one should go to police stations on getting such calls and sit tight till the voting exercise gets over. No one can take away your right to exercise franchise. In their WhatsApp chats, they are referring to Trinamool Congress goons. So Trinamool is goons and what is BJP to you, an asset? I would urge people not to go to police stations, if asked. Seek reasons, lodge complaints and move court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/people-want-to-hear-covid-ki-baat-not-mann-ki-baat-didi-tells-modi/articleshow/82248662.cms||Sukumar Mahato
---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Bengal crosses 1 crore jab mark as vaccination drive trips on low supply||KOLKATA: Bengal on Sunday crossed the 1-crore vaccination mark, the figure covering nearly a sixth of the state’s adult population. The milestone, however, is not reflective of the total number of people who got the jab, just the total number of doses administered. In reality, vaccination has covered 83 lakh people, of whom 17 lakh have received the second dose. The symbolic milestone, achieved in three months and 10 days, brought little joy as the inoculation drive has floundered in recent weeks due to vaccine shortage. On Sunday, too, several vaccination centres across Kolkata, Salt Lake and New Town were shut due to low stocks. “The vaccines being sent are insufficient,” CM Mamata Banerjee said on Sunday. On Monday, a further 3 lakh shots of Covishield are set to reach the city. Though vaccine consignments arrived in April after a two-month gap, they are inadequate in meeting the demand, and has led to the daily vaccination count trickling down to well below the 1-lakh mark. Worse, many who are now due for the second dose have been refused and asked to wait. A health department official said the target for April was to administer 5 lakh shots a day, but the plans had been derailed because of the short supply. “This month, 23,43,700 shots of Covishield and 4,64,380 shots of Covaxin reached Bengal. Together, they make up just over 28 lakh shots. Over a 25-day period, that is just over 1 lakh doses a day, not nearly enough when Covid cases are increasing rapidly and people are desperate for the vaccine,” said a health official. With the inoculation programme set to expand to all adults from May, the demand for vaccination is expected to substantially increase. While additional consignments can be ordered by state government and private hospitals, there are still many niggling issues that need to be sorted out before orders are placed. The Bengal government has committed Rs 100 crore, which will fetch 25 lakh shots of Covishield at Rs 400 a shot. “There is total chaos,” said New Town resident Soumyajit Mahapatra, adding, “My slot got cancelled. Now, I cannot even reschedule in my PIN code area.” Many vaccination centres suspended vaccination because of want of vaccines. After the initial hiccup with the Co-WIN app when the vaccination drive took off in mid-January, the momentum had picked up and was maintained in the first two months, with the state even administering 3 lakh shots on some days. But the drive slowed down shortly after reaching the peak of 4.3 lakh doses on April 5, when depleting vaccine stocks made state authorities hold back and prioritise those who had taken the first dose six to eight weeks ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-crosses-1cr-jab-mark-as-vax-drive-trips-on-low-supply/articleshow/82249019.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||J P Nadda returns Covid fire, says CM Mamata Banerjee skipped PM’s meet on pandemic||BELGACHHIA/MANIKCHAK: BJP national president J P Nadda has come down heavily on chief minister Mamata Banerjee for passing the pandemic management blame on to the Modi government. “Mamata Banerjee gave a miss to the meeting the PM held with CMs on Covid on March 17. The meeting was crucial because the PM was taking inputs from CMs over how to roll out the Covid management programme. The requirement for vaccines was also discussed with CMs. Mamata Banerjee didn’t bother to attend the meeting. Her ego stood in the way of tackling Covid in Bengal,” Nadda said. The BJP chief pointed to Banerjee’s clamour over supply of vaccine and medicines, and said: “How could the CM present data of the daily doses of vaccine if the Centre had not sent them? How can you claim credit for this?” Nadda iterated at the virtual gathering in the Kashipur-Belgachhia constituency that the Modi government had extended the 5kg special rations to 80 crore people across the country, including those in Bengal. “But this time, chal chors of Trinamool can’t take away your rations. BJP is coming to office on May 2 and the state government will distribute rations without cut money,” he said. Nadda added that a BJP government, in its first cabinet meeting, would release the Rs 18,000 arrears for three years to each farmer under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi along with an annual support of Rs 10,000. “Landless farmers will get an annual support of Rs 4,000,” he said. With his focus on women, Nadda narrated how Bengal topped all states in rape cases, domestic violence cases and in human trafficking. At a press conference in Kolkata, BJP’s Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya heaped corruption charges on the Trinamool government over procurement of grain. “We made an RTI application on how many farmers got prices of paddy from the government at MSP rates declared by the Centre. The state drew a blank because it doesn’t have any records,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nadda-returns-covid-fire-says-cm-skipped-pms-meet-on-pandemic/articleshow/82248697.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: 75-year-old fighting cancer slays Covid, now helps others defeat it||VADODARA: Yusuf Hotelwala’s family got the biggest scare of their lives when the 75-year-old, who was already waging a battle against cancer, tested positive for Covid-19 too. But that was nearly a year ago, and the septuagenarian proved to be mightier than coronavirus which he could slay with ease. Today, he is up and about helping many others recover from the grip of Covid. “After I recovered from Covid within a week, I started getting many calls from Covid patients or their relatives. They were curious as to how I managed to defeat the virus despite being a cancer patient. So, I decided to counsel the Covid patients who approached me,” said Yusuf, who used to make a living by driving an auto. “Most of the calls I get are from those who are suffering from serious diseases and have contracted Covid. Having heard that those with co-morbidities get severely affected by coronavirus, they want advice about food and other measures to be taken for recovery. Relatives of some of the patients also visit my house,” Hotelwala told TOI. “I tell them to have a positive approach and eat healthy vegetarian food apart from following the other Covid guidelines. The virus does take away your energy, but a strong will to survive helped me recover quickly. Many of those who came to me for advice have recovered from Covid. I am glad I could help them during the crisis,” Hotelwala, a resident of Wadi, added. “Yusuf uncle who gave a pep talk to my 71-year-old father who was admitted to hospital on April 2 after being infected with Covid and had very low oxygen level. Uncle gave his own example of recovery and that helped my father recover within a week and is now back home,” said Najma Lambawala, a resident of Wadi. Hotelwala was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma, a rare type of cancer, in July 2019 and has been on chemotherapy since. When he was detected with cancer, doctors had said that he had maximum six months of life. “But I never gave up as I always had a zest for life. So, despite being infected with Covid, I was always cheerful even in the hospital,” he said. In fact, after recovering from Covid, Hotelwala’s health has started improving and his weight has also increased. “My chemotherapy cycle has also increased from 21 days to 30 days and I feel healthier,” Hotelwala added. He ensured that his four daughters got good education before he quit being an auto driver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/75-year-old-fighting-cancer-slays-covid-now-helps-others-defeat-it/articleshow/82246505.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Kolkata||Covid spike may affect turnout as Bengal polls enter 7th phase today||KOLKATA: The sharp rise in Covid cases across Bengal poses a challenge for voters in the seventh round of Bengal elections in which 34 assembly seats are going to polls on Monday, including four in south Kolkata. Elections in Jangipur and Samserganj seats in Murshidabad have been postponed to May 16 following the demise of candidates due to Covid. What is worrying parties is whether the rising pandemic graph will have an impact on voter turnout in the last two phases when the state has witnessed a fairly high poll percentage in the last six rounds. Assembly seats going to the seventh round of polls have a diverse demography. As many as 15 seats spread over Murshidabad and Uttar Malda are those where minorities are a majority. In Malatipur, Ratua, Chanchal, Harishchandrapur, Habibpur and Gazole in Uttar Malda and the nine seats of Farakka, Suti, Raghunathganj, Sagardighi, Lalgola, Bhagabangola, Raninagar, Murshidabad and Nabagram in Murshidabad, the polarisation is likely to go in favour of non-BJP parties. Trinamool and Congress are desperate to bag the major pie of the minority votes. In Sagardighi, Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM is targeting the same population. Abbas Siddique’s ISF is also a contender in Raninagar. BJP can at best hope that the division among minority votes works to its favour. Another important feature is the Murshidabad seats of Suti, Raghunathganj, Lalgola, Bhagabangola and Raninagar, Habibpur seat in Malda and three Dakshin Dinajpur seats of Balurghat, Gangarampur and Tapan all are located along the Indo-Bangladesh border. The Congress vote bank on Adhir Chowdhury’s Murshidabad turf and also in Uttar Malda is at risk because the minorities, insecure as they are, are likely to vote for the party they think would be able to protect themselves. This can make it tough for Congress candidate Mainul Haque, the Congress candidate from Farakka winning the seat since 1996. The situation looks similar for Abu Hena of Congress, winning the Lalgola seat since 1991. It’s again a Congress versus Trinamool battle in Chanchal with BJP eyeing the 30% Hindu votes. Congress is faced with a tough challenge from Trinamool on one hand and Forward Bloc on the other at Harishchandrapur. Trinamool is better placed in Malatipur, which had witnessed an anti-CAA, anti-NRC stir in 2019. BJP is better placed at Gazole though the recent desertions are an advantage for TMC. The BJP is ahead in the race in Habibpur because of its support base among the Adivasis, though a section gathered at chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s recent meeting. BJP has an edge over Trinamool in Dakshin Dinajpur’s Balurghat where the demography is just the reverse. High-profile BJP candidate and economist Ashok Lahiri is contesting from this seat while RSP veteran Biswanath Chowdhury has opted out of the fray. With Chowdhury’s exit from the electoral battle, BJP is banking on a large chunk of RSP voters who might go with it. BJP seniors have been frequenting the nine assembly seats in Paschim Burdwan to consolidate its new-found support in the erstwhile Left bastion. Eyes are also fixed on the Pandaveswar assembly seat from where former Asansol mayor and outgoing MLA Jitendra Tiwari, who dumped Trinamool to join BJP, is contesting. Left Front chairman Biman Bose walked the extra mile for JNUSU president and CPM candidate Aishe Ghosh to win back the Left support the party once enjoyed in this belt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-spike-may-affect-turnout-as-bengal-polls-enter-7th-phase-today/articleshow/82248664.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Peace and growth should guide use of democratic right: Asansol cleric||Asansol: As one enters Asansol, a huge billboard welcomes visitors to the “city of brotherhood”. In election season, residents want the old bonhomie restored to the cosmopolitan city’s social fabric. Imam Imdadullah Rashidi of Noorani Mosque in Asansol North, who lost his teenaged son in a communal flare-up three years ago, has appealed to locals to exercise their democratic right judiciously but not let elections create a divide. “Vote for peace, tranquillity and development. Elections are like a festival of democracy. People should apply their rights judiciously. The issues should be peace and development. There should be no violence during poll or after ,” Rashidi appealed. His 16-year-old son Mohammad Shibghatullah had died in a communal flare-up in March 2018 but Rashidi had refused to identify any suspect and issued a public appeal to maintain peace, failing which he would leave Asansol. In 2011 and 2016 assembly elections, Trinamool Congress had won this seat with a comfortable margin. In 2016, Bengal law minister Malay Ghatak had won with a margin of nearly 24,000 votes. But in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, following a series of communal flare-ups, Trinamool trailed by 20,000 votes. BJP candidate Krishnendu Mukherjee is expecting polarization to work again. He is banking on the “double-engine government” promise and TMC’s “misrule”. Development and peace are key issues in the campaign. A lot of perceivable development took place in the last 10 years such as road, university, community centre and park. But issues of water, medical facility, flyover and an Urdu girls school persist. Ghatak said: “I am contesting poll on the issues of development and peace, led by Mamata Banerjee.” He alleged that “candidates from BJP and ISF have criminal records” but “let people decide. We are hopeful”. Asansol North has a sizeable Muslim population of 43%; candidates of ISF and MIM are eyeing to gouge out a substantial chunk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/peace-and-growth-should-guide-use-of-democratic-right-asansol-cleric/articleshow/82248649.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Rs 8,000 home O2 cylinders go for Rs 25,000-Rs 65,000 in black market||KOLKATA: Even as large parts of the country are gasping for oxygen supplies in the middle of a devastating second wave of the pandemic, the price of the life-saving gas, meant for home use, is selling at extortionate rates in the black market in Kolkata, though there is no shortage yet in hospitals. A 1,400-litre oxygen cylinder meant for domestic use, which used to leased out at Rs 8,000-9,000, is often being rented out for as much as Rs 25,000-Rs 65,000 by several pharmacies and oxygen providers in the city, despite repeated pleas from the government, while portable oxygen cans, which used to cost Rs 250-Rs 400, are now going at Rs 2,500.  Desperate to provide relief to their gasping kin, customers are forking out the astronomical sums. Most of the bigger hospitals say they are sufficiently equipped to handle their oxygen demand, adding that the problem is only with smaller nursing homes, as of now. “We called up some three dozen oxygen suppliers and pharmacies in the city in the last two days while trying to arrange oxygen cylinders for two patients. But in most places, they either demanded an exorbitant amount or claimed to have run out of stock,” said Satyaki Majumdar, who is part of a voluntary Covid-care group, adding, “There is a shop in Keshtopur that even demanded Rs 65,000 for a 1,400-litre cylinder.” Majumdar says he came across a shop in Jadavpur, near the KPC Hospital, which was renting cylinders out at Rs 25,000, more than two-and-a-half times the original charge. “I informed the Jadavpur police station and later learnt that they had visited the shop. The shop owner has apparently stopped charging a premium,” he says. Over the past week, TOI has been writing about an oxygen crisis looming large on the city, but prices have simply gone through the roof. “Even four days ago, we could provide oxygen to those in need at a modest premium, as we had to also source it at a higher price,” says Aryan Shaw, an oxygen supplier in Dum Dum. “But now, even those stocks have dwindled. This has opened up the opportunity for hoarders and black marketers,” adds Shaw, who says he is still providing refilled cylinders at the regular price to those in need. Another seller said some pharmacies were hand-in-glove with doctors and other bigger pharmacies. They give the phone numbers of unscrupulous suppliers to patient parties. When they call and give the reference of the pharmacy, an astronomical amount is quoted. In most cases, the patient party has no choice but to pay. TOI called up several such numbers after receiving complaints of overcharging, some of whom agreed that they have been selling at a premium. Others said they were out of stock and would quote a price only when fresh stocks arrive. A pharmacy owner in north Kolkata admitted to selling 10-litre oxygen canisters for Rs 2,500. Non-branded 10-litre cans of oxygen are usually available at Rs 150-Rs 300 and branded ones at Rs 350-600. Usually, for a 1,400-litre oxygen cylinder with a regulator and mask, apart from the usual monthly cost, there is a daily rent, usually between Rs 5 and Rs 7, and a refill charge of Rs 200-Rs 250. For patients requiring high-flow oxygen, one such cylinder does not last more than 12 hours, a doctor said. Larger cylinders of 7,000 litres are leased out at Rs 15,000, mostly to hospitals. Making the most of the crisis, while smaller cylinders are going for Rs 25,000-Rs 65,000, the larger ones are going for Rs 50,000-Rs 1 lakh in the black market. Not all, however, are keen on making a killing from others’ misery. “I don’t have a cylinder at present but if you can get me an empty one, I will refill it even for free,” offers Pradip Gupta, a pharmacy shop owner in Phoolbagan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rs-8k-home-o2-cylinders-go-for-rs-25k-rs-65k-in-black-mkt/articleshow/82248993.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Ranchi||350 infected in Ranchi railway division, 13 dead||RANCHI: The Ranchi railway division of the South Eastern Railways (SER) has been hit hard by the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Within the span of three weeks, as many as 350 railway personnel in the division have been infected while 13 have died. Of all the 13 casualties, three railway men died in the past 24 hours. Among the dead are Tangarbasli station master Subhash Minj and Y D Kindo, a guard at the Hatia railway station. Among the infected are senior officials, loco pilots, RPF personnel, station masters, signalling personnel, booking clerks, train ticket examiners and operating department personnel. However, despite the setbacks, the division is running with full steam. “Unlike last year, when we had less than 100 infections, this year’s infectivity rate is very high. Our operations were closed for several months last year, but this time, special and regular trains are operating,” a senior official said requesting anonymity. Neeraj Ambasth, the divisional railway manager (DRM), contracted Covid-19 along with his family members last week and was moved to a private hospital in the city for oxygen support. The division’s chief commercial manager and head of signalling are the other two senior-most officials who have tested positive. Recently, the Ranchi chapter of the All India Loco Staff Running Association (AILSRA), the umbrella union of loco pilots of the Indian Railways, demanded adequate hand sanitizers, face masks and rotational duty rosters to minimize the risk of transmission among loco pilots. The AILSRA also wrote to Ambasth on April 17 and pointed out that loco pilots, who are turning up at the divisional railway hospital in Hatia for vaccination, are being turned back. The hospital came under fire after its doctors initially were reluctant to admit Covid-19 patients from the division. However, with cases rising, the hospital has been converted into a 40-bed Covid facility with oxygen support. However, three of the hospital’s doctors have tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/350-infected-in-ranchi-railway-division-13-dead/articleshow/82246988.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly elections 2021: CM Mamata Banerjee’s charges against EC officials ‘baseless’, says panel||KOLKATA: The Election Commission on Sunday said the allegations levelled by chief minister Mamata Banerjee against its officers and observers regarding directive to arrest “TMC goons” were absolutely “baseless, false and misleading”. The poll panel in a press statement said: “No such instructions have been given by any Observer, Chief Electoral Officer or Officer of the Commission to act against workers of any parties.” On Banerjee’s allegation of “preventive detentions” of Trinamool Congress workers, EC said: “No court case has so far been reported to CEO, WB’s office or the Commission where any instance of preventive action against a non-criminal has come to notice. Misleading narratives apart, leave alone any court case, no specific instance of illegal preventive action against any worker of party has been reported till 25.4.21.” The EC further said: “Conduct of free, fair, intimidation free and violence free election requires close monitoring of all miscreants and history-sheeters who have the potential to vitiate the polls. Preventive actions under relevant provisions of CrPC, IPC are taken by all law enforcing agencies to ensure they are prevented from creating any mischief.” On Saturday, the CM had said she would move the Supreme Court’s Constitution bench after Bengal polls over how Election Commission can be insulated from political interference. Releasing documents that she claimed were WhatsApp chats between poll observers (she even named a high-ranking EC official) and district officers, Banerjee accused EC observers of “ordering” and “planning” preventive detentions, under CrPC Section 151, of Trinamool workers, branding them “trouble mongers”, ahead of polls. The EC reasoned: “There are standing instructions for law enforcing agencies of all poll-going states to ensure compilation of list of miscreants based on criminal history, including involvement in election related crime in the past. Action is taken and must be taken against such miscreants.” It added that officials “review and ensure that such lists are compiled timely and acted upon in an impartial manner”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cms-charges-against-ec-officials-baseless-panel/articleshow/82248671.cms||---

On Saturday, the Maoists arrived at the construction on a motorcycle and asked the labourers to stop work immediately, following which they set the vehicle on fire and beat up the workers before fleeing the spot. This comes 18 days after seven vehicles of a road construction company were set ablaze by ultras in Lanji village. Earlier on March 4, three Jharkhand Jaguar jawans were killed in the same village when a bomb, planted by the rebels, triggered off. On Friday, a 29-year-old man named Dom Chaki was shot dead in Kudaburu village under Sonua police station area in West Singhbhum by suspected Maoists for being a police informer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/maoists-torch-truck-thrash-4-labourers-at-w-sbhum-construction-site/articleshow/82256094.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Eight on oxygen support die as hospitals in Gurugram, Rewari run out of supply||GURUGRAM: Eight Covid patients — four in Gurugram and four in Rewari — who were on oxygen support in two private hospitals died on Sunday after the facilities ran out of supply. In Gurugram, officials at Kathuria Hospital, Khandsa Road, said they had informed the district administration about the shortage. “We had informed the nodal officer and the SDM about the crisis. But we failed to get any help from the district administration. All four patients were on oxygen support and there was no supply,” said Dr AK Kathuria, the hospital's owner. He added that at 2pm on Sunday, the hospital ran out of oxygen. “We have 30 Covid patients but we are not getting regular supply,” Kathuria said. While two of the patients were from Gurugram, the other two were from Delhi. Asked about the hospital’s request, Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said they did not know about the shortage at the facility. “We have not been informed about the crisis at the hospital. We will investigate the matter. We have oxygen in store and if we had been informed, we could have helped them,” Garg said. Later at night, he ordered an inquiry, which will be carried out by the SDM of Gurugram, Jitender Kumar. In Rewari, officials at Virat Hospital reported four deaths and said their oxygen stock was exhausted. Virat Vir Yadav, the hospital owner, said their staffers had gone to get an oxygen tanker from Bawal around 3pm on Sunday, but they could not get back by 5 pm. “We did not have oxygen for the patients,” he said. Many private hospitals continued facing acute shortage of oxygen on Sunday as well. While Max and Mayom hospitals in Gurugram had put out an SOS tweet on Saturday stating they have a few hours’ supply left, Metro Hospital posted a similar message on Twitter at 10.38am on Sunday. By evening, the hospital got oxygen supply from Panipat. Officials said they have 48 patients on oxygen support. Park Group of Hospitals had also tweeted an SOS seeking urgent help with oxygen and tagged the Prime Minister’s Office, home minister Amit Shah, chief medical officer of Haryana, ministers Piyush Goyal, and Anil Vij, health minister Harsh Vardhan and the deputy commissioner of police, Gurugram. Dr Manoj Dutta, medical director, Metro Hospital, Palam Vihar, said in the afternoon: “We have oxygen for a little over one hour.” Till 2pm on Sunday, the hospital did not get liquid oxygen and hence, it depended on oxygen cylinders. Around 4.30pm, liquid oxygen came in from Panipat. “It was not from our own vendor. The district administration arranged for it,” said an official at the hospital. Several hospitals said they need assurance from the government about timely supply of oxygen before taking in new patients. Dr PN Kakar, CEO, Park Hospital, Gurugram, said: “We are getting 50% less oxygen compared to the demand. We have 18 patients in NICU and 30 patients are on ventilator support. We have increased the capacity of our backup oxygen tank from 2,000 to 6,000 liters but we are not getting enough oxygen from the government. Once we get an assurance, we will increase the number of beds.” Some residents took to social media alleging that hospitals have asked them to shift patients out for of lack of oxygen. Utpal Borpujari tweeted: “W Pratikha Hospital Sect 56 Gurugram shifting critical patients to other hospitals. citing shortage of oxygen. Please help hospital in oxygen supply and prevent shifting”. More O2 for Haryana On Sunday, the government issued an order on oxygen allocation. From now, the state will get 164 metric tonnes oxygen per day. Earlier, it used to get 162 metric tonnes. While 100 metric tonnes will be supplied from Air Liquide, Panipat, 9 metric tonnes will be from Jindal Steel Limited, 25 metric tonnes from Air Liquide, Roorkee, 10 metric tonnes from MSME ASU, Hisar, and 20 metric tonnes from Inox Air Bhiwadi. Gurugram has been allotted 15 metric tonnes oxygen daily from Panipat and 20 metric tonnes from Bhiwadi. The city’s oxygen requirement was 7 metric tonnes in the beginning of this month. It rose to 14 on April 19 and then to 35 metric tonnes on April 23. Haryana will set up a round-the-clock helpline to monitor oxygen availability, officials said. The number for reporting shortage is 9888489236.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/8-on-o2-support-die-as-hosps-in-ggn-rewari-run-out-of-supply/articleshow/82249044.cms||Ipsita Pati

They are providing food to relatives of Covid patients, especially of those from other cities, who have to spend days waiting outside the hospital. “Covid patients are under treatment in the hospitals and are getting facilities. But there isn’t anyone to help their relatives,” Manish Baxi, CA, told TOI. He said that while the friends were discussing about people’s plight about a fortnight ago, an idea of providing them free food packets for dinner during night curfew came up. “We immediately contacted other CAs in our group and help started pouring in,” Baxi added. “Every shop and restaurant closes by 8 pm, leaving many attendants of such patients, particularly outsiders, not able to arrange for food at night. Many of them had to go to sleep hungry,” Baxi added. The group of CAs gives away over 300 food packets every night to patients’ relatives in Gotri GMERS, SSG Hospital and the Samras facility in Polytechnic College. For Muslims observing roza, they provide fresh fruits too. “Every day, we visit these places, distribute food and ensure that all the needy get help. Fortunately, there has been no paucity of funds as our members have donated generously.

---||Chennai||Cancel order to send 80 tonnes of oxygen to Andhra Pradesh, Telangana: Tamil Nadu CM to PM Modi||CHENNAI: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to immediately cancel the order to divert 80 tonnes of oxygen produced in Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. With the number of active cases crossing one lakh, the state’s requirement for medical oxygen will increase significantly in the coming days, the chief minister said. In a letter sent to the PM, chief minister Palaniswami said the state is taking all efforts to reduce positive cases but considering the current trend, the state would require 450 tonnes soon, which would be more than Tamil Nadu’s current production capacity of 400 tonnes. In the latest national medical oxygen allotment plan, the allocation for Tamil Nadu has been fixed at 220 tonnes and based on this wrong allotment, 80 tonnes of liquid oxygen was diverted from manufacturing facilities located at Sriperumbudur to Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, the CM said. “As per Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisations (PESO) data, the consumption of oxygen in Tamil Nadu has already reached 310 tonnes, as against the inadequate allotment of 220 tonne made to the state,” Palaniswami said. The chief minister said, “Compared to the maximum active cases number of 58,000 during the surge in 2020, the active caseload has already increased to over a lakh today. This has increased the oxygen demand. All efforts are being made to provide uninterrupted and adequate oxygen supply.” Further, the states to which the allotment has been made have fewer active cases than Tamil Nadu and also have major steel industries located within their state/ close to their states. Hence, the diversion from the Sriperumbudur plant, which supplies Chennai city that has the second biggest caseload in South India, seems to have no justification. This needs to be immediately corrected, the chief minister said. “While Tamil Nadu has never imposed any restrictions so far and is always ready to support other states, such mandatory diversion of liquid oxygen from the needs of our state can lead to major crises in Chennai and other districts. Hence, I request that diversion of 80 kilo litres from Sriperumbudur plant may immediately be cancelled,” Palaniswami said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cancel-order-to-send-80-tonnes-of-oxygen-to-andhra-pradesh-telangana-tamil-nadu-cm-to-pm-modi/articleshow/82250264.cms||---
---||Chennai||20% jump in campus jobs at top Tamil Nadu engineering colleges||CHENNAI: Top engineering colleges in the state have witnessed a 10% to 20% jump in campus placements for the year 2020-2021 amid a raging pandemic, a slow start to the job drive, and a shift to remote hiring. Due to digital hiring, the number of companies going for campus recruitment has increased significantly compared to last year. Some top companies that were reluctant during the initial days, are planning to go for a second round of campus hunt to match the demand for freshers. Besides top colleges, including Anna University, SSN College of Engineering and RMK Engineering College, tier-2 colleges have also had a good year in terms of placements. Deemed universities, too, received good response from IT and IT product companies and witnessed a significant jump in pay package offered to students. Companies are mainly hiring freshers to train them in niche areas. Supaul Chanda, vice-president of Experis, Manpower Group’s IT staffing company, said the hiring increased due to pent-up demand and digitalisation of operations by IT companies.  “Due to digitalisation, a lot of people in new areas are required and that is why hiring of freshers has gone up,” he said.  “I think the demand will be there till the end of 2021,” he said. Anna University registered a 20% increase in campus placements compared to the previous year. “This year, a majority of them were placed in IT product companies. As many as 39 companies have recruited from the university for the first time,” professors from Anna University said. Walmart Labs, KPMG, Royal Enfield, Zoom were among the new recruiters to the university this year. The placement season will likely extend till May as many companies are still showing interest in hiring. SSN College of Engineering in Chennai had 250 companies scouting the 600 students who attended placement this year. This is 50 more companies compared to last year. “We were apprehensive of the pandemic at the start of the placement season. Due to the shift to digital mode, more companies have participated in the campus placement this year,” said V E Annamalai, principal of the college.  The online mode was convenient for both recruiters and students. While average salary of students increased from Rs 5.6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh, 150 students have received offers above Rs 10 lakh. One student has received an offer of Rs 64 lakh per annum, the highest. RMK Engineering College in Chennai had 20 new companies this year. “The number of students receiving Rs 5 lakh and above offers increased by 30% this year. Some companies are hiring students even from the previous batch,” said R M Kishore, vice-chairman of the college. Some colleges in tier-2 cities, such as Saranathan College of Engineering in Trichy, also had a spurt in placements. “We have witnessed around 10% hike in our placements compared to last year. Among the eligible students, 72% have been placed so far,” said principal D Valavan. It was a good placement season for deemed universities as well. Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) had the highest number of students placed during the 2020-21. As on date, 640 companies have visited its campus and 5,200 students have been placed. The students have received more than 8,000 offers. “This is an increase of 10% compared to last year. The drive will go till June and we expect at least 60 more companies to visit our campus this year,” said V Samuel Rajkumar, director (placement and training), VIT. Companies such as Accenture, Cognizant are planning a second round of campus placement. “The logistics required for second campus visit is less due to virtual hiring,” he added. S Vaidhyasubramaniam, the vice-chancellor of SASTRA, said campus placement was very good during 2020-21. “The number of offers for premium skilled jobs increased up to 12% and students have received 3,500 offers from 150 companies,” he said. “Internships offered to a majority of recruits have almost doubled this year as the recruiters tried to bring them closer to the workplace before graduation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/20-jump-in-campus-jobs-at-top-tamil-nadu-engineering-colleges/articleshow/82250307.cms||A Ragu Raman
---||Chennai||It will take 6 months to up oxygen production in Tamil Nadu||For Tamil Nadu, where the number of Covidpositive cases is surging every passing day, the immediate focus would be to judiciously use oxygen and retain the production capacity. Government officials said capacity addition would take at least six months, building infrastructure to convert industrial oxygen for medical use would take up to three months. “Our cumulative present capacity of all oxygen producers is around 400 tonnes per day. Even though there are around 20 pure play oxygen producers and two bottlers in the state, only four of them – Inox, Praxair, Sicgil-Sol and TN Oxygen – are the major producers,” said an official who did not want to be named. But the state is giving a push to ramp up production capacity to meet the growing need for oxygen. According to sources, the per day requirement of medical oxygen has touched 350 tonnes and is set to go up in the next few days. “We could face a crisis in the next one month. Hence we need to stock up on oxygen,” the official said. Inox is establishing a new oxygen plant at Hosur with a capacity to produce 140 tonnes per day. “The company has received the consent, and it will take six to nine months for the unit to start production. SicgilSol too is setting up a new unit at Ranipet for which it has been allotted land. The unit with a capacity of around 60 tonnes per day could become operational in about nine months,” the official said. The state is also tapping the possibility of utilizing part of CPCL’s oxygen capacity to supply hospitals. “We had a round of discussion and have scheduled another round of talks on Monday. CPCL could emerge as a source for supply of oxygen soon,” the source said. Companies such as JSW produce industrial oxygen which is not used for medical purposes. Only a portion of it could be used for medical purposes, since there is a need to purify and compress it. “If one has to establish a plant to convert them by installing a compressor and storage tanks, the process will need a lead time of three to six months. Even if we do it, only a portion could be available since industries need oxygen for their own processes,” the official source added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/it-will-take-6-months-to-up-oxygen-production-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/82250328.cms||D Govardan
---||Chennai||People across Tamil Nadu play by the rules on first lockdown Sunday||Streets across the state looked empty on the first complete lockdown Sunday to reduce the impact of the Covid-19 second wave. A majority of the public stayed indoors and those venturing out were out visiting hospitals and pharmacies and were stopped and checked by police. All shops except pharmacies and fuel outlets were closed. Some hotels were functioning in Coimbatore, but they offered only takeaways. Food delivery personnel were also on the streets as the government permitted delivery during fixed timings. As many as 500 police personnel were deployed across Coimbatore. Hundreds of guest workers had, however, gathered at the Coimbatore Railway Junction on Saturday night and were waiting for Dhanbad and Gorakhpur Express. Mohan Prasad, 21, of Basti district in Uttar Pradesh, who has been working for a pump manufacturing company at Thennampalayam for the past eight years, said he decided to return as his parents were worried about his safety. “I won’t get any work in my hometown. I will rear cattle and sell milk, and return when the situation becomes normal,” he told TOI. “We are allowing people to attend funerals, ones going to hospital and people involved in essential work. Action was taken against only those who ventured out for fun,” said a police officer posted at Goripalayam junction in Madurai. But the lockdown did not go well for the homeless as they couldn’t find food. People responded well to the total lockdown in the other southern districts as well. The Tirunelveli city police monitored various localities using a drone. Those, who were roaming on the streets were advised to return home. The Tenkasi city police distributed food to homeless people as they were deprived of food due to total lockdown. In Trichy, all the commercial streets were completely deserted. “Arterial roads did not witness even 1% of the usual buzz. This is the most successful lockdown we have enforced since the pandemic began last March,” a police officer in Trichy city said. Those attending weddings were seen carrying the wedding invitations to avoid penalties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/people-across-tamil-nadu-play-by-the-rules-on-first-lockdown-sunday/articleshow/82250358.cms||---
