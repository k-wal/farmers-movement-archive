Manjunath Hegde, who often goes on safaris, says, “Most visitors to the reserve are amateurs who click pictures for their personal collections. These days, everyone owns a decent camera, but not everyone sells their photographs. Capturing wildlife in a picture is about getting a feel of nature. The revised prices are higher than that of any other wildlife sanctuary in the country. The authorities say the revenue generated will be used for forest conservation, but with the new charges, the frequency at which enthusiasts head there will reduce. There is no guarantee that you will get to capture great pictures, or even see wild animals on every safari. Do they expect us to come back and try our luck again by paying this hefty fee?” Wildlife enthusiast Amal George has started an online petition against the fee hike “The forest department has been collecting fees for camera use since 2017. To what end has this money been used so far, if they now claim that the new charges are going into wildlife conservation?” he asks. Rahul Taranath, also a wildlife enthusiast, adds, “The increased tariff is to combat rising fuel and maintenance costs. Yet, through the years, the amenities provided to visitors have been below average and continue to be so.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/camera-fee-hike-in-bandipur-irks-wildlife-enthusiasts/articleshow/82031351.cms||Vinay Lokesh
---||Allahabad||Coronavirus in Prayagraj: High pathogenicity, infection rate worry health dept||PRAYAGRAJ: Officials of the district health department in Prayagraj district are perplexed and worried after noticing higher pathogenicity and high infection rate among the residents in the second wave of coronavirus pandemic. Officials said the latest trend amid rising Covid-19 cases reveals that more than two or three members of the same family in the city are testing positive in the second wave, while one or two at most had tested positive in the first wave. Moreover, more young people, in the 18 to 45 age group, said to be having good immunity, are getting infected this time, signaling a higher pathogenicity of the Covid-19 variant causing a second wave. Additional CMO and nodal officer (Covid-19) Dr Rishi Sahai told TOI, “The Covid surge this time and analysis of cases and trends reveal a higher pathogenicity and infection index in the city. It is a dangerous trend and so we are focusing on extensive testing to contain the spread of the disease. We have scaled up our testing target to around 20,000 per day.” "We are roping in 200 lab assistants for testing and studying the cases for deciding the further course of action," Dr Sahai added. Revealing infection trends in the district, the nodal officer said around 70% of Covid cases are being detected from urban pockets and the rest from rural areas. “The health department has decided to conduct around 15,000 tests daily from Wednesday onwards and will increase it to 20,000 by next week,” said Dr Sahai. “The contract tracing of the infected will also be increased since this variant is more infectious. Now, we will be tracing at least 20 contacts of a Covid patient and testing would be done at doorstep,” he added. In a more significant development, officials are compiling the data of cases where the CT (computed tomography) scan report of patients revealed both lung infection and pneumonia even though both antigen and RT-PCR tests had been negative. In the second wave, the number of Covid cases in Prayagraj has crossed the 7,000-mark. “Over 70% containment zones are in urban pockets compared to Trans-Ganga and Trans-Yamuna areas. This shows that infection is spreading more in urban pockets,” he added. Officials are now specifically focusing on areas from where more cases are being reported and have initiated corrective measures to curb infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/coronavirus-in-prayagraj-high-pathogenicity-infection-rate-worry-health-dept/articleshow/82037041.cms||Kapil Dixit

A police source said, “The accident took place on Thathri-Gandoh road near Piyakul village, approximately 42km from Doda township, when the driver of the minibus lost control over the vehicle while negotiating a sharp curve and it fell into Kalnai river.” Six persons died on the spot and four critically injured were rescued and shifted to nearby hospitals. The deceased were identified as Yaser Hussain of Dhrouth, Shakur Din of Kahara, Kalee Bagum of Pykul Bhalesa, Anjoo Devi of Challer, Sudhesha Devi of Suhanda Shiva and Bhim Chand of Challer Bhalesa. “Four critically injured were airlifted to Jammu. However, a woman succumbed to her injuries on the way to Jammu during airlifting and was declared brought dead. Another injured person was shifted to Doda hospital,” a police officer said. Doda SSP Mumtaz Ahmad said, “Death toll has risen to seven as a woman succumbed to injuries after being airlifted to Jammu. Police and locals had rushed to the spot and launched a massive rescue-cum-search operation.” Meanwhile, a defence spokesperson said that an IAF helicopter from Jammu was pressed into service to rescue those critically injured in the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/seven-die-as-mini-bus-falls-into-gorge-in-doda/articleshow/82038170.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||Mumbai||How Japanese forest therapy transformed Mumbai's green cover||MUMBAI: A canopy of kanchan, karanj, neem, jamun and palash trees casting a 20-feet high shade on the Central Railside Warehouse is barely reminiscent of the cement bags, construction debris and toxic air particles that once defined this corner of a massive cement storage facility in Jogeshwari until even a year ago. Hemmed in by the concrete chaos and smoke-belching motor vehicles zooming past its busy roads, the 23,000-sq ft of dusty wasteland is now a foliage-rich micro forest with over 7000 kinds of medicinal and fruit-bearing trees with bumble bees and butterflies feeding on its nectar and pollen. This curious patch of lush jungle-like greenwood, smack in the middle of Mumbai’s urban sprawl is the first urban forest that the city watched sprout to life in 2020 when Pradeep Tripathi of Green Yatra, an environmental NGO, used the Japanese Miyawaki planting technique to recreate in one year, a natural forest resembling a 10-year-old one. “A green wall,” is what Tripathi calls this bulwark against heat, dust, carbon and concrete that the city is constantly heaving under. At least 50 such miniature fast forests have been popping up in unorthodox spots in the city — dumping yards like Nisarga Udyan, busy arterials road like Chembur’s Eastern Freeway and in barren wastelands such as Bhakti Park’s industrial ward — ranging in size that could be as small as a tennis court or as dead as a landfill site. Developed by Japanese vegetation ecologist Akira Miyawaki in the ‘80s and adapted on a war footing by urban cities like Singapore, Kenya, New York, and now Mumbai, crafting these DIY forests require saplings with well-developed roots of 20 to 50 different species planted closely together in a random mix like one would find in the wild. The trick lies in their proximity — three to five saplings per square metre — that pushes them to compete with each other for water and sunlight thus accelerating its growth. Advocates for the method say these micro forests “grow 10 times faster, 30 times denser and are 100 times more biodiverse” than those planted by conventional methods. Two years of watering, weeding, monitoring and they convert into a self-sustaining forest. If Tripathi has already sown nearly seven lakh saplings in and around Mumbai and gearing up to plant another lakh across Navi Mumbai before the monsoons, BMC swung into action and planted 2.21 lakh trees to fill 43 tiny Miyawaki forests over the past year, the first of which bloomed at Narayan Pujari Nagar near Worli this January. “Urban greening is emerging as a tried and tested approach to mitigate some of the impact of climate change. The BMC, in its budget for the years 2020 and 2021 allocated Rs 20 crore to plant at least 3.75 lakh trees using the Miyawaki method and the fact that most of these trees have reached a height of 5 to 7 feet in just one year is a sign that the forests are growing properly and can become the city’s lungs,” said Jitendra Pardeshi, BMC’s superintendent of gardens who likens it to the centuries-old tradition of Deorai, a practice common among locals in the Western Ghats to conserve small patches of forest as “sacred groves”. While such forest therapy as a fitting response to the city’s building boom, rampant tree felling and vulnerability to extreme weather shifts makes Miyawaki particularly attractive to many environmentalists, it can be expensive at the nascent stage. A would-be forester would need to bear a high initial cost for the intensive process of surveying the natural vegetation of the area, testing the soil, digging pits, building nutrients into the soil and judiciously plotting out a mix of trees. “It can cost you upto Rs 500-800 per sapling depending on the need to excavate the land, throw debris and buy new soil for replacement,” says Tripathi. But is creating mini forests across the city enough to salvage the city’s traditional tree cover? Urban planner Pankaj Joshi, principal director of Urban Centre Mumbai feels, while Miyawaki afforestation of critical stretches with large infrastructure projects may be a good way to heal sore plots of land and a great alternative to “farcical” tree transplantations that don’t survive, “Care has to be taken that most of the species planted are indigenous,” he says pointing at the silver oaks brought into Panchgani between the ‘20s and ‘40s. “It’s been 100 years and even now birds don’t sit on those plants nor do birds eat its fruits. It’s important that these trees don’t just perform as a plant but the entire ecosystem responds.” Tripathi agrees. Just a shade of green does not mean biodiversity. “The flaming red Gulmohar from Madagascar, rain trees native to South America or the yellow peltophorum from southeast Asia that you get to see in Mumbai these days are all non-native with hardly any birds nesting in them,” he says. At the same time, it’s not just about planting random indigenous plants. “One should not attempt a forest unless they’ve visited a virgin forest in the neighbouring area. One must survey the forest, study the distribution of trees and follow that same pattern when planting an urban forest.” And though Miyawaki forests cannot replace natural ones — “carbon content in an individual tree is less compared to one growing in a natural forest and they score less in hydrology due to a lack of deep roots” points out Subhash Ashutosh, director general, Forest Survey of India — the pros outweigh the cons. “Miyawaki forests can still be effective as a quality reforestation process because their total biomass content is high and so is their nutrient uptake due to their dense 1000-tree cluster of different species compared to natural forests with not more than 250-300 trees,” reassures Ashutosh. Apart from being an antidote to urban woes by lowering temperatures, reducing noise, supporting local wildlife and sucking carbon from the air, "Their potential to restore degraded habitats is a great advantage,” says Tripathi who has been using the Miyawaki technique to inject green into “dead and damaged land”. He recently planted 40,000 saplings at Nisarga Udyan in Koparkhairane that will transform the three-acre landfill site into the largest urban forest in the MMR region. “No land is a bad land anymore,” he smiles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/how-japanese-forest-therapy-transformed-mumbais-green-cover/articleshow/82038169.cms||Mohua Das
---||India||J&K will soon unveil new policy to attract filmmakers: LG||SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir will soon roll out a new policy to attract filmmakers and bring back the lost golden era of filmmaking in the Union territory, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha said here on Monday. Addressing the two-day virtual conference on ‘Tapping the Tourism Potential of Kashmir — Another Day in Paradise’ at SKICC on the banks Dal Lake, Sinha said the J&K government has almost finalized the new film policy “which will be announced within 10 days from now”. “The policy entails a road map on how we can bring back Kashmir’s golden era on the silver screen in the 70s and 80s. We have been reading and hearing that Kashmir used to be the favourite destination of Bollywood filmmakers. We as a team will work to bring back that lost era,” Sinha said. He also said that there are many unexplored destinations in Jammu and Kashmir, but his administration is taking steps to bring them on the tourist map. “We are focusing on putting in place a better infrastructure at new spots so that tourists can enjoy them hassle free. For this, we have invited private players as well,” he said. Sinha said despite Covid-19 pandemic, Kashmir witnessed the highest number of domestic tourist arrivals among all states since December 2020. “This of course helped to revive the tourism industry in Kashmir,” he said. He said the number of arrivals has helped decreasing the unemployment rate in the UT. “Thousands of people associated with the industry have got employment opportunities. The unemployment rate in J&K in the month of September last year was 16.1%, but it has dropped to 9% as per the latest data in the month of March this year,” he said. “The unemployment rate at many tourist destinations like Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Goa is much more than J&K. I believe that the tourism sector is the biggest contributor to this achievement,” he said. The LG highlighted that several steps have been taken to ensure ease of travel for tourists. “There are night flights operating from Srinagar airport. There is a direct flight from Srinagar to Bengaluru now,” he said, adding tourists are coming to Kashmir not just to explore the places, but to connect with the people of the Valley as well. The LG expressed hope that in coming days, tourist arrivals to the UT would increase further which would in turn generate more employment opportunities and help the economy to grow.

---||World||Pak condemns UK move to add it to list of high-risk countries||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan condemned on Monday the United Kingdom’s decision to include Pakistan in the list of money-laundering and terrorist-financing high-risk countries, saying London’s decision was not based on facts. Pakistan’s foreign office expressed hope that the UK would review its regulations in light of facts on the ground and avoid “politically motivated” and “misplaced” measures. A day earlier, Britain had included Pakistan in its list of 21 high-risk countries for lacking checks and balances on terrorism financing and money laundering. The British government said the exchange of illegal money between Pakistan and Britain continues. “Pakistan has a robust AML (anti-money laundering(/CFT (combating the financing of terrorism) regime in place,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri said in a statement. He added that over the last two years, Pakistan has taken “unprecedented measures through a series of legislative, institutional and administrative actions in the domain of anti-money-laundering and countering financing of terrorism”. “These actions, which have also been reported to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and shared with the European Union, have been widely acknowledged by the international community,” the statement read, adding that the near completion of the FATF action plan through 24 out of 27 action items “is a testament to Pakistan’s commitment and tangible actions in the AML/CFT domain.” Pakistan has been on the FATF’s grey list for deficiencies in its counter-terror financing and anti-money-laundering regimes since June 2018. In February this year, the FATF had observed during its plenary session that serious deficiencies still remained in Islamabad’s mechanisms to plug terrorism financing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pak-condemns-uk-move-to-add-it-to-list-of-high-risk-countries/articleshow/82038224.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Kolkata||How pet parents keep exotic breeds healthy in summer||The hot and humid summer months are here. And it’s a time when even the average Indian mongrel seeks out shade to stay cool. Imagine the plight of exotic breeds from cold regions of the world. No wonder they need special care to get through these months. We spoke to a few exotic breed owners in Kolkata about the special care and diet these dogs need during summer. While the hot, sultry days of summer are aching for almost all breeds, you need to give special care to the exotic breeds from the cold region. There are several such breeds in Kolkata and let's find out how their parents are taking care of them. Read on… Tibetan MastiffOrigin: TibetTwo years ago, Sourav Roy (above), an engineer and an animal lover brought two pure Tibetan mastiffs home. According to Sourav, the biggest challenge faced by Tibetan mastiff parents in Kolkata is the weather. “They like dry and cold weather and Kolkata is exactly the opposite,” he said. He has no option but to keep the dogs in air-conditioned rooms 24/7, 365 days a year, except when they are being exercised. They are regularly taken out for walks between 3 am and 5 am. Diet: Red meat, bone broth, goat milk and rice or barley. Cleaning and grooming: Spray and sponge with herbal solutions. The dogs also have to be brushed at least once every day. Chow Chow Origin: China Sutirtha Mitra (above), a businessman, fell in love with this breed a few years ago and now, he has three. As the breed has a very dense double coat and a blue tongue, Sutirtha said they need a special diet during summer and a cool living space. So, from March to September, they are kept in an air-conditioned room for about eight hours a day. “They are taken out for walks twice every day, once early in the morning and once after sundown,” Sutirtha said. Diet: The dogs eat twice a day and just like their exercise, Sutirtha likes to feed them before sunrise and just after sunset. “Curd is one of the most important parts of their diet during summer. Other than that, they eat dog food and chicken rice,” he said. Cleaning and grooming: To maintain their thick and delicate coat, Sutirtha brushes them at least once a day. The dogs take bath once every month. American AkitaOrigin: Japan/the US Koushik Sarkar (above), a Howrah-based businessman, found the dog breed closest to his heart a couple of years ago. He loves American Akitas not because they are ferocious protectors, but also because of their image of being a ‘spiritual dog’. “They have their own independent thought process and they don’t like to be dishonoured. At the same time, they are extremely loyal,” said Koushik. During summer, Koushik keeps his three Akitas in an AC room during the day and takes them out for early morning walks. Diet: Other than curd and rice, Koushik feeds them dry dog food along with boiled meat. He also adds seasonal fruits to their diet. Cleaning and grooming: The Akitas don’t like baths and turn aggressive whenever Koushik tries to give them one. So, Koushik honours their choice and gives them dry baths at regular intervals. American Cocker SpanielOrigin: The US/the UK Pallab Saha first came in contact with this small, hunting breed a few years ago and couldn’t help but fall in love with it. At present, he has eight American cocker spaniels and all of them are equally loved and cared for. During summer, Pallab keeps them in AC rooms for 14 hours a day. Diet: The dogs are fed in the morning and the evening. In summer, each dog gets 100 grams of curd and 100 ml of water with dry food. In the evening, they eat dry food with rose oil, rose water and apple cider vinegar. “In summer, their metabolism rate decreases and that’s why I decrease the amount of food,” Pallab added. Cleaning and grooming: Properly groomed, the long coat is the main attraction of an American cocker spaniel and because of that Pallab takes extra care of the coats. “They are given a bath once every week and in the night, I spray a special medicinal liquid on them to keep their body cool,” he said. Moreover, the dogs are brushed multiple times every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/how-pet-parents-keep-exotic-breeds-healthy-in-summer/articleshow/82034299.cms||Bishwabijoy Mitra

BJP's student wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) could not open its account. The NSUI had swept the SSU students' union polls last year as well. In 2018 and 2019, however, ABVP candidates won the president's post. The NSUI candidates won the posts of president, vice-president, general secretary and library secretary. Krishna Mohan Shukla was elected the president while Ajit Kumar Choubey the vice-president. The other winners are Shivam Choubey (general secretary) and Ashutosh Kumar Mishra (library secretary). According to election officer Prof Sudhakar Mishra, the NSUI’s Krishna Mohan Shukla, bagging 442 votes, defeated ABVP’s Ajay Dubey by a margin of 136 votes, while Ajit Kumar Chaubey polled 411 votes and defeated his rival Chandramauli Tiwari by a margin of 68 votes. Similarly, Shivam Chaubey, bagging 485 votes, defeated Gaurishankar Gangele by a margin of 219 votes, and Ashutosh Kumar Mishra, who got 415 votes, defeated his rival Vivekanand Pandey by a margin of 77 votes. Out of 1,732 voters, including 1,649 males and 83 females, 771 voters including, 742 males and 29 females, took part in voting. Vice-chancellor Rajaram Shukla administered oath to the newly elected office-bearers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nsui-sweeps-student-union-elections-at-varanasis-sampurnanand-sanskrit-university/articleshow/82039406.cms||Binay Singh

Chronic public interest litigant-cum-advocate M L Sharma made an impassioned plea before the bench headed by CJI Bobde for early listing of the PIL citing his ill-health and self-prophesying that it could be the last PIL in his career as a legal professional. Though the fourth batch of fully-loaded Rafale jets have landed in India, taking their numbers to 14 from the 36 purchased by India through a government-to-government contract inked with France in 2016, Sharma cited media reports quoting findings of Agence Francaise Anticorruption (AFA) to claim that French manufacturer Dassault had paid one million euros to one Sushen Gupta as commission to clinch the deal for sale of Rafale fighter aircraft to India. Making PM Narendra Modi as respondent No.1 in his petition, Sharma alleged that the payment of commission in a so-called government-to-government deal has vitiated the purchases that inexplicably had veered from Eurofighter jets to Rafale. A Paris-based website Mediapart had said Dassault Aviation allegedly paid 1 million euros (Rs 8.63 crore) to Gupta soon after the Rafale deal was inked in September 2016. It said Dassault was unable to satisfactorily explain the payment after it was discovered by French anti-corruption agency AFA during an audit in 2018 which, however, decided not to recommend prosecution. The media report said Dassault claimed the money, entered into its 2017 accounts under the heading ‘gifts to clients’, was paid to Defsys Solutions run by Gupta in order to make 50 car-sized replica models of the Rafale. Dassault could not furnish any proof or documentary evidence, including photographs, to show the models were actually made, it said. Defsys Solutions is one of the several sub-contractors of Dassault for discharge of the 50% offsets in the 7.8 billion euros (Rs 59,000 crore) Rafale contract. “This (Dassault) invoice, which related to 50% of the total order (1,017,850 euros), was for the manufacture of 50 models of the Rafale C, with a price per unit of 20,357 euros,” Mediapart said, quoting the AFA report. The Rafale deal was first challenged in the SC through a PIL jointly filed by former minister Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie along with activist advocate Prashant Bhushan. The court after detailed hearing had dismissed the petition in December 2018. When the general elections neared, the threesome filed a petition seeking review of the verdict and the court in a rare gesture allowed open hearing of their plea for reconsideration of the judgement giving clean chit to Modi government. In May 2019, the SC reserved verdict on the review petition. In October 2019, India received the first batch of Rafale jets. In November 2019, the SC had dismissed the petition seeking review of the December 2018 decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-to-hear-new-rafale-pil-after-bobde-retires/articleshow/82039944.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The final approval by the Drug Controller General of India is expected latest by Tuesday, official sources said. Once approved, Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy's Labs will initially import the vaccine to supply to the government. The Centre is in the final stages of negotiations for procurement. “The government will procure Sputnik V from Dr Reddy’s Lab for the national Covid vaccination programme but it will be in small quantities initially. The stocks will increase with local supplies that are expected by June-July,” a senior official told TOI. Coronavirus: Live updatesSputnik V will be a welcome addition to Covishield and Covaxin that are being used in India and will improve supplies once local production begins. It will over time, along with increased production of Covaxin, lessen India’s dependence on Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and made in India by Serum Institute of India. At present, around 70 million shots of Covishield and Covaxin are being produced every month.

Officials said so far there has been no Indian variant as only a double mutation has been found inAt least five Indian companies have already partnered Russia's sovereign wealth fund RDIF (Russian Direct Investment Fund) to locally manufacture the vaccine in a few months and it is also likely to bring down prices of the anti-Covid shots. Sputnik V has been developed by Russia’s Gamaleya National Reseatch Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology with funding from RDIF and has a proven 91.6% efficacy and has been approved for use in 55 countries. Dr Reddy's Labs — which is also conducting bridging studies with the vaccine in India on 1,500 participants to test safety and efficacy in local population — will initially only distribute the vaccine locally. However, companies like Hetero Biopharma, Gland Pharma and others have agreements with RDIF to manufacture around 850 million doses of Sputnik V. There are also some companies that are in talks for manufacturing the vaccine in India for export purposes. The approval of the vaccine assumes significance in the wake of increasing footfall to receive vaccine doses, mainly after the government opened Covid vaccination for all those above 45 years. Also, the rapid rise in Covid-19 cases across the country has pushed people to seek vaccination, which prevents severe disease and mortality. While supplies are limited with only Covishield and Covaxin being administered so far, many states have complained of potential shortages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/expert-panel-clears-sputnik-v-for-emergency-use-drug-regulators-nod-expected-soon/articleshow/82040068.cms||Sushmi Dey

Officials said so far there has been no Indian variant as only a double mutation has been found in Maharashtra. It requires multiple mutations for a new variant to be recognised as such and to make a discernible impact. So far, three “imported variants” — UK, South Africa and Brazilian — have been detected in India. During genome sequencing of samples, the total number of cases with these variants of the Covid-19 virus adds up to 948 till Monday evening.

And later found a few more like him? As the second Covid-19 wave lashes the country, many are going for the double-mask approach to keep the virus away, with experts saying its “advisable” and an “established way to stop transmission”. “One can wear a surgical mask and a cloth mask or two cloth masks. However, with N95 masks, doubling is not needed,” says Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine department at Delhi’s Max Saket. “A double mask is advisable when a person is going to crowded places where social distancing is not possible,” he says. Coronavirus: Live updatesMany masks don’t fit perfectly on the face. Wearing double masks reduces the risk of droplets from an infected person escaping through the sides while breathing in and out, say experts. The double-masking recommendation is based on a study conducted by the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC conducted experiments to assess two ways of improving the fit of medical procedure masks — fitting a cloth mask over a medical procedure mask, and knotting the ear loops of a medical procedure mask and then tucking in and flattening the extra material close to the face. Each modification substantially improved source control and reduced wearer exposure, it found.

While people may feel it impedes breathing, its regular use could ease the discomforts,” said Maharashtra Covid taskforce member Dr Shashank Joshi. Joshi recommends using a medical three-ply mask covered by a cloth mask or vise-versa for maximum protection. “Double masking can prove to be effective in crowded places, rooms where there is lack of proper ventilation or places where social distancing can be a challenge such as a local train compartment,” added Joshi added.

He said Mamata was "not talking sense (abol-tabol bolchhen)" as she knew she had been "clean bowled" in Nandigram and BJP had already crossed the 100-seat mark, with four phases of polls still to go. "Those who died in Cooch Behar were all sons who had mothers. Didi instigated them, told them to gherao the central forces and loot them. They listened to Didi and snatched weapons from security forces, leading to the firing. Didi, they would not have died had you not instigated them," Modi said in Burdwan, also referring to the lynching of a Bihar Police officer during a raid in Bengal’s North Dinajpur. All these incidents were part of a desperate Trinamool attempt to disrupt the poll process in keeping with Mamata's "chhappa vote master plan", the PM said at Barasat in North 24-Parganas. "Has Didi ever appealed to voters for peace? Has she ever warned those disrupting polls? She has not because she has started sensing that the high polling is going in the BJP’s favour." In Nadia district's Kalyani, Modi said "the countdown to Didi’s exit begins on Bangla Nababarsha", referring to Poila Baisakh on April 15. "People scored boundaries and over-boundaries in the first four phases, taking the BJP tally to 100. This is making her angry. Her people are abusing Scheduled Castes and Tribes because they are voting for BJP," the PM said at all three election meetings in Burdwan, North 24 Parganas and Nadia. All three districts have a substantial chunk of SC/ST voters. Trinamool "crossing all lines" is an indication of its fear of losing, Modi felt, referring to a statement attributed to its Arambag (Hooghly) candidate, Sujata Mandal. "A Trinamool functionary said the other day that Scheduled Caste people were like beggars," he said without mentioning Mandal. "It is a great humiliation for BR Ambedkar’s legacy when the country is getting set for celebrating his birth anniversary. Why is Didi silent? Humiliating the Dalits is Didi’s biggest mistake." The PM addressed Namasudra sentiments at the Kalyani meeting by pointing to the CM’s jibes at him for his visit to Matua guru Harichand Thakur’s birthplace at Orakandi in Bangladesh. "A Matua friend told me I was the first PM to visit Orakandi. It gave me inspiration to serve you. But Didi is angry with me," he said. "Didi, during her 10-year rule, has improved her bhaipo's (nephew and MP Abhishek Banerjee) lot. But what has she given Bengal’s youth except a long wait for a job?" Modi asked, attacking the CM and her "khela hobe" slogan. "Didi has become so arrogant that she has begun to believe that every game starts with her and ends with her winning it. But, in a democracy, people start the game. Khela to sesh hoye gelo (The game has ended), Didi. People will ensure Didi’s defeat," the PM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/didis-instigation-caused-cooch-behar-firing-pm-modi/articleshow/82040519.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||India||Memories of historical events emerge in poll talks||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday compared the ongoing assembly elections to the Banga Bhanga (partition of Bengal) movement to drive in her points that BJP is dividing people in the name of religion and this is not Bengal’s culture. Such references to historical events and facts have re-emerged as a topic of discussion in poll-bound Bengal across political parties as well as common people. While the official pages of BJP have not mentioned the 1946 Great Calcutta Killings, its supporters are posting pictures, writings on this particular event on social media to polarize Hindus before the remaining four phases of the elections. Asking Hindus to vote wisely, the posts refer to Suhrawardy’s role during the riot, in the context of the promotion of Muslim politicians and officials by the BJP’s rivals, sending out an overt, or sometimes implied, message that the disastrous days could be back again. Assistant professor at the Institute of Development Studies in Kolkata, Anwesha Sengupta says, “The attempt is to reinstate fear in public memory by dragging the episode of 1946 because Calcutta has a history of being a riot-torn city. In a region which has suffered partition, it is like opening the old wounds because many families have personal memories of communal violence and BJP is banking on it to consolidate votes.” In several poll campaigns, BJP is invoking Syama Prasad Mookerjee to shed away TMC’s ‘outsider party’ tag. According to BJP’s Mohit Roy, “It is an attempt to remind the Bengali Hindus that it is for Syama Prasad Mookerjee that they are living in a safe homeland, otherwise, it would have been Bangladesh.” TMC minister Bratya Basu says this is “communal” politics and an attempt to incite Bengali sentiments. Several Facebook users recalled how Bina Das and Ila Mitra single-handedly prevented riots on Prince Anwar Shah Road and the Park Circus area, the role of Manikuntala Sen and Renu Chakravartty in mobilizing a mass movement during the 1943 Bengal Famine and providing relief to the famine victims. Activist Kasturi Basu shared a poster which states ‘Banglar Maayera Meyera Sokolei Muktijoddha’. She wrote “it is time to build resistance against the fascists who try to distort history and erase them from collective memory”, hinting at Narendra Modi’s claim that he did ‘satyagaraha’ for the freedom of Bangladesh. A YouTube channel — Counter Communalism — launched a video where activist Sumit Chowdhury discussed the story of Muhammed Ali Jinnah’s ancestors, who were Hindus, to counter divisive forces. Filmmaker Saumitra Dastidar feels these stories need to be re-told. To make people aware of the imminent dangers like farm laws, NRC and CAA, Hathras rape case, a video series ‘Amader Kotha’ by No-Vote-To-BJP campaign is citing memories from the past. In one of the videos, a middle-aged Bengali homemaker recalls the stories of the 1943 famine that her grandmother told her and is skeptical whether the farm laws will again pave way for hoarding and lead to another famine-like condition in Bengal. CPI(ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya says, “Implementation of farm laws will bring back ‘Company Raj’ just like the times of East India Company.” He posted sketches of the Tebhaga movement by Somnath Hore, which stood for its peasant militancy and communal harmony. To evoke memories of hunger and food crisis, CPI(ML) is drawing Chittaprasad's sketches of famine-ravaged Bengal as poll-graffiti in rural Bengal. CPM’s slogan ‘Haal ferate ferao laal’ evokes memories of the Left-Front government in Bengal. “The election has now become an event of fear but in my childhood, it was a festival of democracy, when I used to accompany my grandmother to the booth,” reminisces Sanjukto Morcha’s candidate from Bally, Dipsita Dhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/memories-of-historical-events-emerge-in-poll-talks/articleshow/82040633.cms||Dipawali Mitra

While the Flipkart-Walmart alliance will give US retailer Walmart a leg-up on arch rival Amazon in India’s closely contested e-commerce battle, it will also pit the new partners against Asia’s wealthiest man, Mukesh Ambani, who is prepping up to take the fight to Flipkart and Amazon with Jiomart, Reliance Industries’ digital retail arm. Fuelled by fear of the Covid-19 pandemic that has led to frantic online shopping of groceries, apparel and white goods, the size of India’s e-commerce market is expected to balloon to $100 billion by 2024. As part of the partnership, Adani Logistics, an arm of Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone, will build a 5.34 lakh square-feet fulfilment centre in its upcoming logistics hub in Mumbai that will be leased to Flipkart. “Homegrown e-commerce giant Flipkart is our new strategic partner. In the two-prong partnership, AdaniConneX will build their new Tier 4 data centre and Adani Logistics, India’s leader in logistics, will build their 534,000 sqft fulfilment centre. Thousands of new jobs in Mumbai,” Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group said on Twitter. The deal marks yet another stride by the Adani group, which has business interests across sectors ranging from commodities to infrastructure. Set to be operational in the third quarter of 2022, the warehouse will have the capacity to store one crore units of inventory, the companies said. In addition, Flipkart will build its third data centre at Adaniconnex, a joint venture between EdgeConneX and Adani Enterprises in Chennai, which is expected to help the Bengaluru-headquartered e-tailer store its data locally within India. “This broad-ranging partnership across our logistics and data centre businesses is a unique business model, and we see this as a great opportunity to serve Flipkart’s physical as well as digital infrastructure needs,” said Karan Adani, CEO at Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/flipkart-ties-up-with-adani-for-logistics-data-hub/articleshow/82040815.cms||John Sarkar

The bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma has also directed the state government to immediately fill up these posts “either through direct recruitment or through promotion”. It said since rules allow ad-hoc promotions as temporary measures, it “may be granted by the state till regular promotions are made”. The entire exercise, it said, should be completed preferably within a month. The directions came as the court was hearing a PIL challenging the decisions. It had challenged the two orders issued by home secretary Nitesh Kumar Jha which gave additional charge to the police officers as well as the order issued by IG (Prison),AP Anshuman, that directed officers to take charge of their posts. The petition had said the move “effectively blurs the line between the jails and the police department which are meant to be separate.” As per petitioners, “handing over the charge of prisons to the police department goes against the fundamental principle of free and fair trial as an extra-judicial pressure might be put on the accused by the police department since they will be probing the case and handling judicial custody too.” While setting aside the orders, the court held that they go against the ‘Nelson Mandela Rules’ issued by UN and recommendations of various committees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-sets-aside-uttarakhand-order-giving-charge-of-jails-to-police-officers/articleshow/82040858.cms||Prashant Jha
---||---||EC bars Mamata Banerjee for 24 hrs from poll campaigning||KOLKATA/NEW DELHI: In a blow to Trinamool Congress’s campaign, the Election Commission on Monday banned West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee from electioneering for 24 hours, holding that she had appealed for votes along communal lines as well as said in a speech in Cooch Behar that central forces personnel would try to intimidate voters and exhorted women to ‘gherao’ them. Rejecting Banerjee’s explanation that she had not made any communal remarks at Tarkeshwar in Hooghly on April 3 and also her claims that ‘gherao’ was a democratic and legal form of protest, the EC in its order said Banerjee had, while justifying her remarks, left out key parts from her speech “perhaps due to selective amnesia”. The EC action drew an immediate response from Banerjee and Trinamool, which dubbed the order “undemocratic and unconstitutional” and called the EC extremely compromised”. “I will sit on dharna at Gandhi Murti, Kolkata, from 12 noon,” Banerjee tweeted. The order significantly reduces Banerjee’s campaign time for the fifth phase of the Bengal polling process. The poll panel, in an order last Saturday, said the “silence period” for this phase would start 72 hours before the end of voting (instead of the usual 48 hours). Campaigning, therefore, will stop at 6.30 pm on Wednesday, the one-day ban on Banerjee gets over at 8 pm on Tuesday. The EC's remarks are another instance of the commission's strongly-worded responses to the Trinamool leader's allegations against the poll watchdog. The 24-hour ban on campaigning by the CM might be unprecedented with Chittatosh Mookerjee, who was chief justice of Bombay High Court, saying, “I have never come across anything similar post-Independence in Bengal.” The EC said Banerjee had violated provisions of the model code of conduct, Representation of the People Act, 1951, and the Indian Penal Code by making “highly insinuating and provocative remarks laden with serious potential of breakdown of law and order and thereby adversely affecting the election process”. The EC has in the past meted out harsher punishments to errant politicians. In 1994, then CEC T N Seshan had asked then PM P V Narasimha Rao to remove ministers Sitaram Kesri and Kalpanath Rai for allegedly influencing voters with undue promises; in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the EC had barred BJP leader Amit Shah and SP leader Azam Khan from campaigning in UP over communal remarks, but later withdrew the ban; in the 2019 polls, the EC put a 72-hour ban on UP CM Yogi Adityanath, 48-hour on Mayawati, and a 72-hour ban on Azam Khan, besides barring Sadhvi Pragya from campaigning for 72 hours for her ‘hate speech’. Condemning her statements as “portent with serious law and order problems across the state(s)”, the EC issued a “stern” warning to Banerjee and advised her to desist from making such public utterances while the model code was in force. The order prompted Trinamool to call for mass protests on Tuesday. Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien posted, “April 12: Black Day in our democracy. EC stands for Extremely Compromised. Always knew we were winning Bengal.” Former Union minister Yashwant Sinha tweeted that Trinamool “always doubted the EC’s impartiality”. “But today it has shed whatever pretence it had. Now it is clear that the EC is acting at the behest of Modi/Shah and under their direct order. Every institution of democracy is compromised today,” he added. Sources at EC said given the violations by Banerjee, the 24-hour campaign ban was “still mild” as two-star campaigners from other parties, A Raja from DMK and Himanta Biswa Sharma from BJP, were recently slapped with 48-hour bans. “But then, she is the party president and the ban makes it clear that party presidents too are not above the law and EC’s rules,” said one of them. Incidentally, the EC is also said to have taken serious note of Banerjee’s reference to the death of four civilians in police firing at a polling station in Sitalkuchi assembly constituency of Cooch Behar on April 10 as “genocide”. This, when reports of the special observers as well as the Cooch Behar SP’s account made it clear that the firing was in “self-defence” against a violent mob that heckled the polling staff and tried to snatch arms of the security personnel. The EC had on April 7 issued a notice to Banerjee over a speech at Tarakeshwar, Hooghly, where she had allegedly appealed to minority voters not to split their vote among different political parties. On April 8, it issued another notice to Banerjee over her “attempts” to “berate and vilify” central forces by “falsely” suggesting that they may intimidate electors to vote for a particular party and even inciting women voters during a recent speech to 'gherao' central forces personnel. Monday’s order will force Banerjee to make another choice on Wednesday — she can either go to Sitalkuchi (where four villagers died in CISF firing last Saturday) or campaign for the 45 seats that go to vote on Saturday. The EC, in another order last weekend, had barred political “leaders” from entering Cooch Behar district (including Sitalkuchi) for 72 hours (from Saturday evening to Tuesday evening).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/ec-bars-mamata-banerjee-for-24-hrs-from-poll-campaigning/articleshow/82041149.cms||Debasis Konar

The government has capped attendance in government and private offices at 33% to break the infection chain. However, some essential sectors and departments like police, fire brigade, disaster management, postal and telecom have been exempted from the purview of fresh restrictions. The buzzing atmosphere at offices was replaced with a strange silence. The employees were seen undergoing thermal screening, wearing mask and using hand sanitiser regularly. District programme officer Manoj Kumar said the cap on attendance was followed in all departments at district education office. “All the rooms were sanitised before we entered the office. Security guards have been deployed at the main gate to prevent outsiders from entering the office premises as a precautionary measure,” he added. Mrinal Sisodia, who works in health department at Patna Secretariat, said the employees have been told to come to the office on alternate days. “I have been asked to go to the office on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Hence, I worked from home on Monday,” he added. Vikash Kumar Singh, employee of an automobile company, said they followed all Covid protocols at the office. “It is good that the strength of employees at the office has been temporarily reduced keeping in mind the alarming rise in Covid cases,” Singh added. Abhishek Ranjan, employee of a corporate firm at Transport Nagar, said the concept of work from home should be promoted under the present circumstances. Nisha Jha, an executive at a service centre on Boring Canal Road, said all employees have to undergo thermal screening at the entrance of the office. “The office functioned with 33% capacity on Monday,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/offices-function-with-33-workforce-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82036466.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Do not panic as sniffles, allergies common in summer: Doctors||PATNA: Allergies and sniffles are common in summer. But in a state of heightened awareness, people may worry that these could be the symptoms of Covid-19. Doctors and healthcare experts have, however, appealed to people not to panic. Dr T Jacob John, former director of Centre for Advanced Research in Virology at ICMR, said identifying clinical criteria for allergies, common flu and Covid-19 is a key indication of difference. “People should be informed and made aware about the common and distinct symptoms of allergies and Covid in order to respond appropriately,” he said. “Shortness of breath, loss of smell and taste and high temperatures usually indicate that it’s Covid. If one gets allergies every year, the person should watch for symptoms that are different from previous appearances,” he added. Dr Diwakar Tejaswi said it is important to trace contact, travel history and identify the source of infection. “No matter what are the symptoms, if a person has been exposed to a Covid patient, he should immediately get tested,” he said. Health experts have also claimed that the new Covid strain has some unusual symptoms which make it more difficult to distinguish the virus from other allergies and common flu such as conjunctivitis, sore throat, headache, rashes, upset stomach and discolouration of fingers and toes. Dr Siddharth Kumar, an ophthalmologist, said allergic conjunctivitis is an isolated occurrence, while Covid conjunctivitis will generally occur in a combination with other Covid symptoms. “People who have other symptoms in addition to conjunctivitis must seek immediate medical attention,” he said. Dr Ravi Shankar, an ENT specialist, said, “Covid-19 causes a system-wide response such as fever, body aches, chills, a sore throat, weakness and respiratory problems. An allergy is more localised like itchy eyes, nasal symptoms of itchy nose and sneezing and a tickle in the throat.” Citizens also feel it’s important to self-monitor and keep allergies under control. “Steam inhalation and warm water gargle are routine for my husband and me,” said Vibha Singh, a homemaker. Pankaj Mishra of Kankarbagh has seasonal allergies every summer, but this year it’s more stressful for him. “It’s a routine for me to get up every day sneezing for at least 15 times. But these day all I think about is the possibility of it being Covid,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/do-not-panic-as-sniffles-allergies-common-in-summer-doctors/articleshow/82036389.cms||---

Bihar, he said, had received 9 lakh doses on Friday. “Altogether 2.91 lakh people were administered the vaccine on Saturday while another 3.64 lakh received the jab on Sunday,” Parashar said, adding: “Our supplies, coming at regular intervals, are being promptly distributed to the districts.” Awadesh K Singh, West Champaran district immunization officer, said only 1330 doses of the vaccine were in the stocks late Sunday evening. “A total of 13,297 shots were given to people on Saturday and another 6174 were inoculated on Sunday. We had received 20,000 doses on Friday,” he said. Singh’s claim of 1330 doses being available on Monday morning was, however, belied by his own arithmetic that indicated a mere 529 doses available after the weekend surge in vaccination in the district. A large number of people, including several elderly persons who had gone to the vaccination centre at the Government Medical College, Bettiah, on Monday were turned back, said Sanjay Verma, introducing himself as a social worker, while pointing towards the unmanned vaccination room. A solitary security guard at the centre affirmed the shortage. “Yes, many went back as there was no vaccine,” he said. Dozens of people had left behind photocopies of their Aadhaar cards, many also writing their cellphone numbers on the paper. “Today I was turned back for the third time,” sexagenerian Nathu Sah said. “The centre was vacant. A placard pasted informed that vaccine stock had run out,” Savitri Gupta from Pakki Baoli said in disappointment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vaccine-shortage-hits-tika-utsav-in-west-champaran/articleshow/82036885.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Kanaka Durga temple looks to improve quality of prasadam||VIJAYAWADA: Following a number of complaints by devotees, officials of the Kanaka Durga temple are looking to improve the quality of prasadam sold at special counters at the temple. The decision also comes in the wake of a report by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) that draws attention to the quality of ingredients used to prepare the prasadam. The Kanaka Durga temple is the second-largest temple in the state attracting around 25,000 devotees every day on average. Laddu and pulihora prasadams sold as holy offerings at the temple hold much significance for devotees who purchase these and distribute them among family and friends. As per the temple Agama Shastra, the recipes of the laddu and pulihora prasadams are fixed and the contract agency should strictly adhere to them. For example, chickpea flour, sugar, cow ghee, cashewnuts, raisins, cardamom and other ingredients are to be used in exact quantities for preparing the laddu. The ACB report, however, states that the quality of laddu has deteriorated as officials reduced the quantity of dry fruits and ghee and increased the quantity of chickpea flour used to prepare laddu. Many also complained that the quantity of pulihora prasadam is much less than what is promised. Newly-appointed executive officer (EO) of the temple Bramarambha has directed the contract agency to strictly maintain the standards in preparing prasadams. “Piligims are sentimentally connected to prasadam. We will try to ensure the taste of the prasadam is not affected so pilgrims can purchase large quantities. We will not tolerate any type of discrepancies in temples from now and will take stringent action if we receive complaints from devotees on poor quality of prasadam,” EO Bramarambha said. The authorities also plan to arrange a weighing scale at the prasadam counters that devotees can use to check the quantity of prasadam purchased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/kanaka-durga-temple-looks-to-improve-quality-of-prasadam/articleshow/82037405.cms||Venu Lanka

The countrywide ‘tika utsav’, aimed at motivating maximum number of eligible people to take vaccine shots, was launched on Sunday. Katihar DM Udayan Mishra, who visited a vaccination site at Town Hall here, said the drive was carried out with the help of local unit of Indian Red Cross Society. “As there was lack of space at sadar hospital due to the ongoing construction works, we shifted the vaccination site to the adjacent Rain Basera, which has ample space,” the DM added. District immunisation officer Dr D N Jha said 2,673 people were vaccinated on Saturday, 6,060 on Sunday and around 5,000 on Monday. He added passengers reaching the district from Maharashtra were being screened and tested at Katihar railway station. “Three such passengers had tested positive for the virus on Saturday. However, of the 302 people who reached the district from Maharashtra by two special trains on Sunday, none tested positive,” he added. Dr Jha said isolation centres have been activated at different places in the district as people have started returning home from different parts of the country. “The occupancy at these centres, however, is nil. Those found Covid positive at the railway station are being asked to remain in home isolation. We remain in touch with them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/11k-get-covid-vax-shots-in-katihar-in-two-days/articleshow/82036916.cms||---

Alike the onset of pandemic this month last year, demand for masks, hand sanitisers and pulse oximeter has increased again. Manoj Kumar, who owns a pharmaceutical store at Punaichak, said: "People are conscious about health and are buying face masks and sanitisers. The demand has increased over the last 10 days." Suresh Prasad, the owner of another medical store, said though the demand for masks and sanitisers has surged, but the sale is comparatively less this time. Echoing similar views, owner of another medical store on Boring Road said: "Due to the rising number of Covid cases, the demand for pulse oximeter has increased as doctors ask the Covid patients in home quarantine to keep checking their oxygen saturation level in the blood and the pulse rate. Besides, some people are buying oxygen cylinders as well for emergency situation." Apart from masks and sanitisers, the shopkeepers are also keeping other essentials as well. Rakesh Jaiswal, the owner of a grocery store at Rajbanshi Nagar, said: "We are keeping stock of all household groceries to tackle any exigency." Residents also say they are on guard. "We have stocked basic medical and household essentials, including face masks, sanitisers, handwash, vitamin tablets as well as groceries," said Rajbansi Nagar resident Rajesh Sharma. Sanjay Mishra of Puniachak said: "We have kept sanitisers at home, workplace and in car as well. Masks are mandatory for outsiders and all family members are taking immunity booster medicines, like vitamin-C and zinc supplements."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/masks-sanitisers-in-demand-again/articleshow/82036956.cms||---
---||Business||Ad veteran Anil ‘Billy’ Kapoor passes away||MUMBAI: Anil Kapoor, one of the doyens of the Indian advertising industry, passed away in Mumbai on Monday. Kapoor, who was chairman emeritus at Draft FCB+ Ulka, was 73. Kapoor was battling cancer and he leaves behind his wife Rita, actor son Ram, and daughter Aruna. Known for his forthrightness and passion, ‘Billy’ Kapoor, as he was popularly called, was instrumental in transforming an ailing advertising agency, Ulka Advertising, to bring it into the top 5. Adman Piyush Pandey, who had a long-standing friendship despite being rivals, described Kapoor as a man with a golden heart. “His appreciation for the achievement of others was open and celebratory. He understood relationships, be it with clients or friends. This was his biggest quality because of which he had good relations with clients and his team members were like family,” said Pandey. He not only built great teams, but mentored many successful admen. Shashi Sinha, CEO, IPG Mediabrands, is one of them. “The one thing we learnt from him was to always have faith in ourselves. Even during the difficult phase of the agency, he gave us confidence by the way he would handle clients and lead the team from the front,” said Sinha. Kapoor, who also mentored Ambi Parameswaran, Arvind Wable, Nagesh Alai and Niteen Bhagwat, once commented how his team together made him look good. Holding a talented team together for long earned Kapoor the accolade of being a people manager par excellence. Nandini Dias, CEO, Lodestar UM, said Kapoor was a passionate man with a definite point of view, which he was unafraid to voice. “I remember my first meeting with him. We had just got the Mahindra account. Mr Anand Mahindra had just moved back from the US, and it was amazing to see Anil in action. While we were there for the communication piece, by the end of the meeting Anil had shared his point of view on how M&M, the company, needed to pivot and transform… much to the surprise and consternation of the marketing team. But from that moment our relationship with Mahindra was set,” said Dias. When Rohit Ohri took over as group chairman & CEO, FCB India, in 2016, Kapoor told him, “Mein tumhe apni beti de raha hoon.” Ulka was the daughter he had loved and nurtured for almost three decades. “He asked me to meet him for an afternoon coffee and our conversation took us almost to breakfast of the following day! His passion for the agency and brands that he had built was evident. Listening to him as he ran me through the history of Ulka was a master class in the Anil Kapoor School of Advertising. He was a fearless man who always believed in doing the right thing. His razor sharp mind would first interrogate the business model and product delivery before thinking of communication, getting many a client to re-evaluate their marketing strategies,” said Ohri. Ashish Bhasin, CEO-APAC and chairman-India, Dentsu, said the kind of respect Kapoor commanded from clients and partners is rare to find today. “In my interactions with him, I remember him to be extremely confident. He was patriotic in equal measure. I remember an instance wherein Shashi (Sinha) and I were quietly standing in a queue during an India-Sri Lanka match in Colombo and had been waiting for a while. There came Billy Kapoor, walked past the security guard confidently, scolding him that keep us waiting for so long was wrong and we meekly followed him in, as he regally marched on, with us as his tails. There I understood the value of confidence in life,” said Bhasin. Kapoor played a key role when the FCB Ulka deal was sealed, while ensuring it was on equal terms. “He fought to ensure that the name ‘Ulka’ was retained. People saw his point of view,” said Sinha. Iconic brands like Amul, Santoor, Tata Indica, to name a few, prospered under Kapoor’s leadership. In 2002, Kapoor got inducted on the global board of Foote, Cone & Belding (FCB). He was appointed chairman emeritus of Draftfcb Ulka in 2010, and in 2013, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from Advertising Agencies Association of India. Originally from Delhi, Kapoor graduated in English Literature from St Stephen’s College and went on to do his MBA from IIM-Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ad-veteran-anil-billy-kapoor-passes-away/articleshow/82039140.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Markets see rush but restrained Ugadi likely||VISAKHAPATNAM/VIJAYAWADA: With several states in the grip of a second wave of the pandemic, Ugadi on Tuesday is expected to be a low-key affair like last year. Though Andhra Pradesh had only eight Covid-19 cases last year at the time of Ugadi on March 25, this time the state has 23,115 active cases, including 3,263 new infections recorded on Monday. The spike in cases has taken the sheen off Ugadi celebrations, which is marked by Panchanga Sravanam (ritual reading of almanac), said Acharya Ravviji, a city-based astro-palmist and general secretary of International Astrological Science (Madras). While readings of panchangams in temples have been restricted, purohits have also decided to celebrate the festival within the temple premises with fewer devotees. Last year, the Panchanga Sravanam was live telecast on several channels. “Instructions were already issued to all departments concerned and the temples to celebrate the festival in a simple manner this year too in wake of rampant Covid-19 cases,” state tourism minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao told TOI. TOI spoke to some residents at shopping malls and in open marketplaces. “We are celebrating Ugadi in a simple way. The reason; my parents were infected with Covid-19 and are undergoing treatment,” said a government bank employee who has recently recovered from the disease. Andhra Medical College principal and north-coastal Andhra Pradesh Covid-19 special officer Dr P V Sudhakar said that the number of daily cases have almost touched 500 in Visakhapatnam. “We request all to take utmost care and follow all the Covid-19 precautions on Ugadi to keep this disease at bay this year. Or else, everything will be out of control,” Sudhakar told TOI. Traffic ADCP Ch Adinarayana said 56,000 cases were booked against people not wearing masks. As many as 200 police personnel will be deployed at the beach to manage the crowd. In Vijayawada, city police and Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) kept a close watch on markets across the city. Special teams were deployed to ensure mask enforcement and physical distancing at market places and shopping malls. Besant Road, Chitturi Complex, Kaleswara Rao market centre, Vaagu Centre and Patamata Junction were flooded with consumers. Mic announcements were arranged at multiple locations alerting the public about the threat of Covid-19. “The second wave of Covid-19 is very ferocious and we should be very cautious. We can celebrate festivals if we are safe and secure. One should be very cautious during the next twenty days. Festive markets have been arranged at open spaces to facilitate the public,” said Dr Suhasini, district medical and health officer (DM&HO) of Krishna district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/markets-see-rush-but-restrained-ugadi-likely/articleshow/82044582.cms||V Kamalakara Rao
---||Business||RBI asks banks to take steps for business continuity||MUMBAI: In a meeting with bank CEOs on Monday, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das asked them to take measures proactively to maintain business continuity, sharpen strategies and raise adequate capital for strengthening their balance sheets. The directive comes at a time when the nation is under the grip of a second wave of the pandemic with fears that the financial capital Mumbai might face additional restrictions on movement to curb the spread of infections. Das met with chiefs of all public sector banks and select private sector banks on Monday through a video conference. The meetings were attended by RBI’s deputy governors M K Jain, M Rajeshwar Rao and a few other senior officials. Das emphasised the need for banks to maintain a close vigil on payments and other IT systems operated by them and fortifying them for enhanced efficiency and resilience to offer seamless and uninterrupted customer service. Bankers said that the central bank was concerned about the digital channels as these have emerged as the primary route for conducting bank transactions for most customers. In his opening remarks, Das highlighted the recent policy measures taken by the RBI to further support the ongoing recovery, while preserving financial stability. He spoke of the importance of credit flows in sustaining the nascent economic recovery and advised the banks to remain watchful of the evolving situation. Das is understood to have asked banks on the prospect for stressed assets during the current fiscal. Bankers said that while they did expect the economic revival to continue, the recovery was likely to be ‘K’ shaped in the first quarter. This was because some sectors of the economy were expected to look up but businesses that were hit hard by the lockdown last year continued to face dim prospects because of the new round of infections. The governor also asked banks about the progress they had achieved in implementing the Covid resolution framework, which was introduced by the RBI in the previous fiscal. The governor also sought feedback from banks on the kind of liquidity requirements they are likely to face and on the credit flow to stressed sectors such as MSMEs and retail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-asks-banks-to-take-steps-for-biz-continuity/articleshow/82039090.cms||---
---||Business||Yes Bank fined Rs 25 crore for AT1 misselling||MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi on Monday imposed a Rs 25-crore fine on Yes Bank after the regulator found that the bank’s wealth management wing had missold AT1 (perpetual) bonds to investors, hiding the risks associated with the same. The misselling had been done under its previous management. The lender late on Monday said it will move the Securities Appellate Tribunal against the penalty. Sebi also fined Vivek Kanwar, former MD of the bank, Rs 1 crore, and Rs 50 lakh each Ashish Nasa and Jasjit Singh Banga, who were part of the bank’s wealth management team earlier. Rana Kapoor, the founder and former MD of the bank, was also one of the people against whom a show-cause notice was sent by Sebi in the same case. Since he’s now lodged in jail, he has been granted time till April 16 to make his submission. The bank and some of its officials devised the “devious scheme to dump the AT1 bonds on their hapless customers”, Sebi said in its order. The actions by the Yes Bank officers amounted to fraud by these entities on its investors, Sebi said. The dumping of these bonds on customers, by saying these bonds were safer than FDs, were done between December 2016 and February 2020, the order said. The Sebi order showed that 1,346 individual investors had invested about Rs 679 crore in the AT1 bonds. Out of these, 1,311 individual investors were existing customers of the bank who invested about Rs 663 crore in the bonds. To help institutional investors subscribe to more bonds issued by Yes Bank, the four had devised the plan to down-sell these AT1 bonds which were held by institutional investors to individual investors. The wealth management team had highlighted to its customers that AT1 bonds would earn better returns than bank FDs would but did not tell them about the risks associated with such bonds, Sebi said. “The omission on the part of the noticees to forward relevant documentary information to the investors/customers indicates suppression of material facts so as to create a misleading appearance of the AT1 bonds in order to lure the investors/customers to invest in them,” it said. However, in mid-2020, the RBI put in a new management in place and restructured the bank’s capital that included complete write-off of these bonds, because of which these investors incurred losses on their investments in these instruments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/yes-bank-fined-rs-25cr-for-at1-misselling/articleshow/82039036.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Markets witness mixed-response on the eve of Navratri and Ramzan||Prayagraj: As the holy month of Ramzan (provided the moon is sighted today) and the festival of Navratri begins on Tuesday, markets in Sangam city were all decked up with many items associated with the two occasions. However, the rising cases of Covid-19 cases did keep a large number of people away from the markets as shops witnessed low crowds than expected. With the city witnessing record-breaking infection cases of Covid-19, people were seen taking precautions at some of the markets, but the safety norms were flouted at many other prominent markets. At Chowk, which is considered the hub of all commercial activities in the city, people were seen at the shops, checking out items related to the rituals associated with Navratri and customers preparing for the month-long fasting during Ramzan. However, the numbers of buyers were comparatively low as was the expectation of the traders. Moreover, only a few of the customers were seen wearing face masks to protect themselves. At many shops, even the shopkeepers were seen selling their products without wearing facemasks. At the same time, many were seen indulging in Covid inappropriate behaviour like wearing their masks below the chin, more so to escape the fine imposed by the police than for shielding themselves against the virus. “It is so uncomfortable and in this intense heat, I feel suffocating to wear a mask”, said one of the salesmen in Chowk, oblivious to the threat to him being maskless. He was selling dates and other eatables that would be consumed during the month-long fasting. Likewise, the customers were seen making their purchases, standing in close vicinity to each other, least bothered by the fact that their fellow buyers could be Covid positive, given the spiralling cases of Covid-19 infection. Besides the areas of the market, the smaller shops, located at the entrance of the temple of goddess Durga too were decked up with the puja items. However, these shops did witness an influx of customers during the evening but for the day, it was a low-profile sale. “We are taking all care and observing the Covid protocols but still the strength of customers who turned up has been low, as people are avoiding coming out in large numbers”, says Rajesh Jaiswal, a shopkeeper at Alopidevi area. As the nine days of goddess Durga worship begins on Tuesday, all the temples of the city have been decked up. Unlike the last year, when the temples were closed because of the strict lockdown owing to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, this year the temples authorities have made arrangements to contain and avoid the spread of the virus. “We have decided that we will not go to the temple as the city is witnessing a record number of cases for the past one week. It is better to worship the deity from within the house and opt for online darshan”, said Tripti Yadav, a resident of Mundera.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/markets-witness-mixed-response-on-the-eve-of-navratri-and-ramzan/articleshow/82037213.cms||---
---||Patna||Tejashwi awaits TMC’s request to campaign in West Bengal||PATNA: Ignoring the Congress request, RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is ready to campaign for Trinamool Congress (TMC) candidates in the remaining phases of the ongoing assembly polls in West Bengal. RJD has announced its unconditional support to the TMC after Tejashwi met West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on March 1 this year. “In West Bengal, the Indian National Congress is fighting a political battle against the ruling Trinamool Congress. Your presence as star campaigner will create confusion among the common voters of West Bengal,” Congress senior leader and Rajya Sabha member Pradip Bhattacharya wrote to Tejashwi on March 17. However, RJD sources said Tejashwi has already made up his mind to campaign for TMC during the last three phases of the 8-phase election in West Bengal. The office of Tejashwi, sources said, has suggested these candidates to approach their (TMC) senior leaders for sending a formal tour programme for the RJD leader. “Once a formal tour programme is sent by the TMC, it would be easier for Tejashwi to finalise his campaign programme for the TMC candidates,” a close aide of Tejashwi told TOI on Monday. But RJD’s national general secretary and West Bengal incharge Shyam Rajak told TOI on Monday that Tejashwi would campaign for the TMC candidates in only those constituencies which have large presence of people from Bihar. Such constituencies would vote in the last three phases on April 22, 26 and 29, respectively. “Hence, Tejashwi will campaign in West Bengal after April 17. However, his programme is yet to be finalized,” Rajak said. Earlier on April 4, Tejashwi had gone to Kidderpore area in Kolkata to attend a religious programme (ashtyaam) organized by his party’s Parsa (Saran) MLA Shrikant Yadav. After attending the religious programme, he had also addressed a gathering from Bihar and urged them to vote for the TMC candidate from Port Kolkata seat, Firhad Hakim. Sources said nearly a dozen TMC candidates from Kolkata and Paschim Bardhaman districts have so far approached Tejashwi for campaigning in their constituencies, which have large number of people from Bihar, especially Yadavas. “Moloy Ghatak, the TMC candidate from Asansol Uttar seat, recently approached Tejashwi through an RJD leader from West Bengal for campaigning in the areas dominated by Bihar natives. But Tejashwi asked him to send a formal tour programme through the TMC leaders,” a senior RJD leader from Kolkata told TOI over phone on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-awaits-tmcs-request-to-campaign-in-west-bengal/articleshow/82037219.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||Closure of Mahabodhi temple hits Bodh Gaya tour operators||GAYA: More than 5,000 stakeholders of tourism industry here, who meet the expenses of their families through their day-to-day earnings, are a worried lot following closure of the world-heritage Mahabodhi Mahavihara due to rise in Covid cases. The state government had recently ordered closure of all religious places till April 30 to contain Covid spread. Although the footfall of foreign tourists at Bodh Gaya is nil in absence of international flights, some domestic tourists had started visiting the heritage city after the Mahavihara reopened as per its normal timing on December 21 last year. There is, however, uncertainty once again regarding reopening of Mahavihara and other monasteries in Bodh Gaya. “The situation is terrible this time. During the Covid- induced lockdown last year, those associated with tourism business like guides, taxi operators, waiters in hotels, e-rickshaw operators and footpath vendors had at least some savings, which helped them to arrange at least two-time meal for their family members. But their savings have exhausted now,” said Rakesh Kumar, president of Tourist Guide Association of Bihar. As the Mahavihara remained closed most of the time last year, annual events of Buddhists were not organised. In view of the recent order of closure of religious places, the 11-day 16th International Tipitaka chanting, which was proposed on the Mahavihara campus from May 7, has been postponed. International Tipitaka Chanting Council and The Light of Buddhadharma Foundation head Wangmo Dixie said in an e-mail on Monday, “Due to rise in Covid cases and safety of all invited guests, we have decided to postpone the ceremony until further notice”. Regarding closure of Mahavihara, International Buddhist Council, Bodh Gaya, general secretary Bhikkhu Pragyadeep said, “Of course it is hard time for the people. But the solution is within us only. Covid cases have once again increased. Everyone will have to follow the guidelines of the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/closure-of-mahabodhi-temple-hits-bodh-gaya-tour-operators/articleshow/82036615.cms||---
---||Business||Sensex sinks 1,708 pts on Covid surge, lockdown fears||Mumbai: Rising Covid infection numbers and increasing chances of stricter lockdowns in several parts of the country spooked Dalal Street investors on Monday as they resorted to panic selling at the start of the truncated 4-day trading week. As a result, the sensex crashed 1,708 points, or about 3.4%, to end below the 48k mark at 47,883 points — its lowest close in over two months. The day’s slide was also the second biggest points fall in the sensex in 2021 and eighth largest ever. On the NSE, the Nifty lost 524 points, or 3.5%, to close at 14,311 points. On the BSE, the day’s selling that pulled 29 of the 30 sensex stocks to close in the red also left investors poorer by Rs 8.8 lakh crore. The BSE’s market capitalisation now stands at Rs 203 lakh crore. The selling was across the board with pharma stocks being the only exception. According to LKP Securities head (research) S Ranganathan, the lower opening of trades on Monday widened as the day progressed with all sectoral indices in the red amid investors worrying about the economic fallout of the surge in coronavirus cases. “Asset quality concerns spooked banks, and PSU stocks across sectors were the worst hit amid lockdown worries,” Ranganathan wrote in a post-market note. The day’s selloff came mainly on the back of strong offloading by foreign funds who recorded a net outflow figure of Rs 1,746 crore, BSE data showed. Although domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 233 crore, it was not enough to cushion the strong selling by foreign fund managers, market players said.Because of the chances of full lockdowns in some states of the country, analysts are worried about the economic impact. With Maharashtra — the state that contributes the most to the country’s GDP — in partial lockdown currently, there is every possibility that economists will lower their GDP projections for the current quarter. Banking & financials and discretionary sectors are expected to be hit the most, while defensive stocks like IT, pharma and FMCG are expected to cushion the fall of the overall market. The rising Covid cases have also put investors on the back foot. According to Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra, markets will on Tuesday react to TCS results and the two macroeconomic numbers — IIP and CPI inflation. “The rising Covid cases combined with the fear of lockdown have pushed the bulls completely onto the back foot. We thus suggest maintaining a cautious stance in the near term,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-sinks-1708-pts-on-covid-surge-lockdown-fears/articleshow/82038924.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Spl steps being taken for safety of staff on election duty||Prayagraj: With the district administration gearing up to conduct the upcoming Panchayat polls, special steps for the safety of the staff going to the field as part of polling duties are being taken. It has been decided that essential items including facemasks, sanitizer and gloves would be given to every member who would be performing duty in the panchayat polls. Liquid hand wash will also be made available at polling stations which would be used by the voters. Steps are also being taken to see that all norms of social distancing are followed strictly at the polling stations. “These are challenging times and our employees have stood to the occasion with utmost vigour. But, to support their efforts in terms of performing their duties, we have ensured to take utmost care so that they don’t get infected with the coronavirus, for which all norms would be followed as instructed by the state government”, said ADM FR (finance and revenue) and Panchayat election incharge, MP Singh. The official informed that all the employees, performing duties at the polls, would be provided with masks, sanitiser, gloves so that they are well protected. Besides, in order to conduct polling properly in the panchayat elections, the officials of the administration have started meeting candidates panchayat wise. The candidates are being motivated to encourage voters to come out of their houses at different time duration of the day. Voters are being told to refrain from the habit of leaving their homes with several people or in groups. The candidates have also been told to make the villagers aware that the Covid-19 guidelines should be followed at all costs. Voters would not be allowed to arrive at polling centers without wearing masks from home. Likewise, voters of the Panchayat are also made aware about the concept of social distancing which has to be followed while voting and also while waiting for their turn. The voters would be motivated to wash their hands once they arrive at the polling center. Thermal screening of all the voters would also be done to ensure minimising the threat of spread of the deadly virus. BOX No social distancing at Parade ground Although the district administration may have provided different items to protect the polling party personnel against coronavirus, but at the Parade ground, from where these polling parties were dispatched, no one seemed to take care of social distancing. Everyone was brushing their shoulders with each other while collecting their kit and duty slip. Even in buses, polling staff was seen sitting next to each other. However, the silver lining was the fact that almost everyone was seen wearing the mask.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/spl-steps-being-taken-for-safety-of-staff-on-election-duty/articleshow/82037221.cms||---

Consequently, a candidate went on to lure voters by distributing a combo of chicken meat, ‘pavva’ (liquor quarter) and cash in Mahoba district.

---||Kolkata||BJP-TMC clashes in Behala, Anandapur||Kolkata: Post poll violence continued unabated in pockets of suburban Behala and Anandapur. The BJP and Trinamool Congress were involved in both cases. In the first case reported from the Ramjibanpur area in suburban Behala under the Behala East constituency — where polling ended with some skirmishes last Saturday. The BJP claimed that TMC goons bombed their area multiple times starting from Sunday midnight till the wee hours of Monday morning. The TMC has rubbished the claims saying BJP factions had been involved in the clash. The incident left a few residential buildings and a club damaged. “The impact of one bomb that was charged was so strong that the asbestos roof was damaged and glass shreds flew all around,” claimed local resident Indra Roy. Locals claimed that areas located at the borders of Behala East and Bishnupur constituencies and on the Nepalgunj-Julpia Road under ward 142 — have witnessed violence on April 6 and April 10. The police have arrested two involved in the bombing . At Anandapur’s Paschim Chowbaga, both TMC and BJP alleged that brick battles injured at least five persons — mostly women — from both sides. BJP claimed that its party office under ward 108 came under attack from TMC goons at night. Lalbazar has asked all 25 police stations where voting is over to step up vigil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-tmc-clashes-in-behala-anandapur/articleshow/82037811.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Their enclosures are being sanitised and special arrangements made to keep them hydrated. According to the zoo officials, disinfectants like virkon and lime powder are being sprayed on a regular basis and automatic sanitizer dispensers installed at strategic locations. The Patna zoo, which houses 108 different species of wild animals, has around 25 lakh visitors annually. “A special squad has been roped in to keep tabs on the visitors and ensure that they wear masks on the zoo premises. Thermal screening has also been made mandatory for everyone, including our staff,” zoo director Satyajeet Kumar told this newspaper and added that no signs of infection had been found so far. Meanwhile, coolers and water sprinklers have been installed inside the inmates’ enclosures and seasonal summer fruits added to their diet plans. While chimpanzees, monkeys, elephants and bears eat watermelons and cucumbers, other animals and birds get supplements like Glucon-D. On the other hand, tigers, lions, leopards and cheetahs have been given personal air coolers. “As prescribed by a panel of veterinarians, we have modified the diets of animals and increased the quantity of water being given to them on a daily basis. Fans and coolers have also been installed in several enclosures,” Satyajeet said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-zoo-braces-for-fight-against-corona-heatwave/articleshow/82036927.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: 13 cops associated with Munger police firing case probe shifted||PATNA: Thirteen police officers posted in Munger have been transferred to different districts on the directive of the Patna high court on April 7 while hearing a writ petition regarding an 18-year-old boy’s death in the alleged police firing at a Durga idol immersion procession in the town on October 26 last year. The police officers were somehow related to the probe into the firing in which the boy, Anurag Poddar, was killed. Several policemen and people had sustained injuries in stone-pelting and subsequent lathicharge. According to a notification issued by the police headquarters, among the 13 police officers shifted are three inspectors. While Ratan Kumar and Pankaj Kumar Singh have been transferred to Gaya, Vinay Kumar Singh went to Kishanganj. The 10 remaining police officers were in the sub-inspector rank and have been transferred to Gaya, Saran, Arwal and Darbhanga districts. The then DM and SP, Rajesh Meena and Lipi Singh, respectively, were transferred from Munger on the directive of the Election Commission as the incident took place two days before the state assembly polls in the constituency. Rachna Patil was appointed as DM and Manavjeet Singh Dhillon the SP. The high court, while hearing a writ petition filed on behalf of the deceased's father Amarnath Poddar, had directed the state government to tranfer the SP and other police officers associated with the investigation into the police firing. The court had observed that it would monitor the investigation to be conducted by the criminal investigation department (CID). It had also ordered to pay Rs10 lakh as compensation to the victim's family. Amarnath's counsel Om Prakash Poddar said that the seriousness of the Munger police could be gauged from the fact that the pellets recovered from the victim's body were sent to the forensic science laboratory for balistic examination almost four months after the incident. Moreover, the district police started interaction with the Patna office of the CISF over the issue three months after the firing. The CISF personnel deployed at Deen Dayal Chowk on the day of the incident had claimed that a teenager had been killed in the firing by the district police. Documents in the possession of the TOI suggested that the investigating officer of the case had submitted a petition in the court of CJM, Munger, for permission to send the exhibits to forensic laboratory on February 26 this year. Similarly, SP Dhillon wrote a letter to the DIG, CISF (Bihar headquarters), on February 18 this year. "The district police swung into action when the high court took cognisance of the writ petition," the counsel told this newspaper over phone. The writ petition was filed on January 6 this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/13-cops-associated-with-munger-police-firing-case-probe-shifted/articleshow/82036520.cms||Ramashankar

The drop came after foreign funds were forced to sell in the domestic market as rising Covid cases triggered fears about further delay in India’s economic recovery. At close, the rupee was at 75.06 to a dollar — weaker by 32 paise from its Friday close of 74.74. According to Reliance Securities senior research analyst Sriram Iyer, in addition to the market’s fears about a further setback to the economic recovery process, “the likelihood of higher retail inflation also weighed on sentiments”. On Monday evening, the government said that the retail inflation rate for March was 5.5%, up from 5% a month ago, while the index of industrial production showed a slide in February with IIP down 3.6%. The interbank forex markets are closed on Tuesday and Wednesday.

They have started cancelling their trips as a result of which the hospitality and tourism industry is likely to come to a screeching halt. Like 2020, Rahul Kumar, an engineer, has cancelled his travel plans again. He says, “I am eagerly waiting for the time when I will be able to travel freely to different countries and make memories.” Another travel lover, Nimita Raj, who was excited to attend a destination wedding at the end of April, rues, “Before Covid hit the world, my family and I would travel to different destinations at least twice a year. Now, I will not be able to attend the wedding of a close friend in Maharashtra.” Meanwhile, tour operators fear that the hospitality sector may face a tough situation again with a sudden spurt in the number of fresh Covid cases. Pankaj Kumar, the owner of a travel agency, points out, “The hope of a faster bounce back had grown between November, 2020 and March, 2021. Now, however, the tourism sector is grappling with the impact of fresh Covid cases. Consequently, a large number of people have cancelled their vacation plans.” Sonia Sudhan, who also runs a travel agency, feels that cancellation of travel plans amid a rise in corona cases is a matter of concern. “We receive several inquiries from customers during the period between May and July every year. However, the restrictions imposed by the government to contain the spread of the virus have significantly influenced their travel behaviour. They are afraid to leave their houses now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/virus-spreads-tentacles-skews-travel-plans-again/articleshow/82036989.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Belur Math, Dakshineswar, Kalighat temples to keep their doors open for Poila Baisakh||Kolkata: Dakshineshwar temple, Kalighat temple and Belur Math, the headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission, will remain open for Poila Baisakh, the authorities declared on Monday evening. Last year, the establishments had to be kept closed because of the lockdown. This year, though they will be open, there will be several restrictions in place. Belur Math general secretary Swami Suvirananda said the temple gates will remain open and devotees can come in following the revised timings, but no one will be allowed to touch the feet of the senior monks. The visit to the temples within the premises will, however, be allowed though no one will be allowed to offer prostrate pranaams. “Devotees can join their palms in pranaam. No touching of feet will be allowed because we have to keep everyone safe,” Swami Suvirananda said. Dakshineshwar Temple Committee has decided to keep the temple open from 5am, much earlier than usual, so people can offer their Poila Baisakh prayers.  “We will keep the floor wet by continuously flowing water over it, otherwise it will get too hot and uncomfortable. After much deliberation, we have decided to keep the temple open because we do not wish to deny devotees their darshan of the deity on the first day of the year,” said Kushal Chowdhury, trustee. Kalighat Temple has requested additional police protection so that social distancing is maintained. The revised timings will soon be declared, temple authorities said. “Chief minister Mamata Banerjee comes to the temple at midnight to offer prayers at the start of Poila Baisakh. We don’t know if she will come this year as she did not come last year because of the lockdown. However, we are making all arrangements,” said Dipankar Bhattacharya, secretary of the Sevayats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/belur-math-dakshineswar-kalighat-temples-to-keep-their-doors-open-for-poila-baisakh/articleshow/82037819.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Patna||Patna: Hospitals witness rise in cases of fever, anxiety||PATNA: Amid the surge in Covid cases, the hospitals and private clinics of Patna are witnessing a rush of patients with complaints of fever, loss of sleep and anxiety. In most of the cases, such patients are first advised to undergo Covid test, if not done as yet. What has surprised most of the city doctors is that many people in 20-45 age group are falling sick and they need both medication and counselling. Dr Mukesh Kumar, a physician of Kankarbagh, said about 75% of his daily patients have cold, cough and high fever. He said a section of youths are influenced more by the social media posts than the medical facts. As a result, many suffer from sleep deprivation, psychological stress, anxiety neurosis and fear of death. “We consel such patients and suggest them to rely on government's advice based on scientific and medical facts and unhesitatingly go for the Covid test,” he said. Dr Satish Kumar, a physician, said a concerning fact noticed in private clinics was the sceptical approach of some youths regarding the Covid infection. He said when a 30 years old with cough and fever was asked to get tested, he outright rejected the advice on the plea that he could not get infected. “I can not get Covid infected and just need medicines for cough and fever,” Dr Kumar quoted the patient as saying. There were a small but significant number of people below 45 who complained of anxiety neurosis with symptoms like increased heartbeat, sleeplessness and sometimes panic attack. Of about 300 patients turning up at the OPD of the government hospital at Gardanibagh, 80% complained of cold, cough and fever and were recommended antigen test, said the medical officer in-charge Dr Manjula Rani. Of the total 116 patients tested on Sunday, 35 turned positive. Dr Vivek Kumar, assistant professor of ENT at PMCH, said while some health problems are natural with changing season, the fear of pandemic has added to people's anxiety and even after diagnosed clinically fit, they complained of soar throat and other nasal problems. “Fear of catching Covid infection is high even among the youths,” he said. Dr Nitish Kumar Ranjan, a cardiologist, said there was about 30% rise in patients with chest pain, anxiety and psychological stress due to the news of the second wave of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hospitals-witness-rise-in-cases-of-fever-anxiety/articleshow/82036405.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Increase milk and fish production in Bihar: Nitish kumar||PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Monday asked the state government officials to work in mission mode to achieve the targets fixed under different development schemes. Presiding over the 8th governing body meeting of the Bihar Vikas Mission (BVM) through videoconferencing, Nitish also called for taking all necessary steps to increase the milk processing capacity in the state. The CM asked them to fast increase the number of women milk cooperative societies in order to enhance milk production in the state. “Work for improving the breed of cows through artificial insemination while keeping in mind the state’s climate. Another aim is to improve the breed of indigenous cows,” Nitish told the officials and asked them to work for the improvement of facilities at different gaushalas. The BVM was formed in January, 2016 for proper implementation and monitoring of the schemes under the ‘Saat Nischay’ (seven resolves) programme of the erstwhile grand alliance government also headed by Nitish. But even after Nitish returned to the NDA in July 2017, he continued with the Saat Nischay programme and thus the BVM continued to operate and monitor the development schemes. While reviewing the schemes of agriculture sector, Nitish said the state government had so far framed three agriculture road maps in the state. “The implementation of schemes as per the agriculture road maps has led to sharp increase in the production of different crops,” he said. Nitish asked the officials to review the remaining period of the third agriculture map (2017 to 2022) to “find out what we have achieved and what should be done to complete the remaining works within the stipulated time frame.” He further asked the agriculture department officials to hold meetings with farmers and experts and take their valuable feedback before embarking on the preparation of a draft for the next agriculture road map. He also stressed the need to increase fish production in the state. Deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, agriculture minister Amarendra Pratap Singh, animal and fisheries resources minister Mukesh Sahani, adviser to CM, Anjani Kumar Singh, and many senior officials were present at the meeting, while ministers and additional chief secretaries/principal secretaries of other departments joined the meeting through video conferencing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/increase-milk-and-fish-production-in-bihar-nitish/articleshow/82036864.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||No intention of lockdown: Gujarat; HC orders stricter restrictions||AHMEDABAD: Coronavirus continued its deadly march in the state as Gujarat reported a record 6,021 cases and highest ever 55 deaths on Monday. Earlier in the day, the state government made it clear before the Gujarat high court that it did not intend to impose another lockdown because it brings a “ocean of miseries” for the poor and migrant workers. The bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia heard the state law officer’s submissions during suo motu PIL over Covid-19 health emergency in Gujarat and asked for other measures to curb surging Covid-19 cases. The HC suggested that corporate offices be directed to cut staff strength or call employees on alternate days so that nothing stops and everything keeps working. “Everyone has to survive and require sustenance. Nobody has to be completely jobless or without earning,” the court said. The HC also suggested steps like capping the number of guests at weddings to 50 instead of 100 allowed currently, limiting people attending funerals and banning gatherings. Following court's directives, CM Vijay Rupani announced in the evening that only 50 guests will be allowed in marriages, no public events till April and religious events will have to be celebrated at home only. He also said that only 50% workforce will be allowed in government and private offices and employees will come to office on alternate days. Last week, the HC had suggested imposing short lockdowns to curb rising Covid-19 cases. In response, advocate general Kamal Trivedi submitted that the lockdown in 2020 was mandated by the Centre. Gujarat did not do it voluntarily. “We saw the aftermath of lockdown. There was an ocean of miseries among poor and migrant workers. There is a conscious decision from the central government that lockdown is not a solution. Lockdown, in fact, brings a problem of food, shelter for the poor and daily wagers.” Earlier, the court pulled up the state government over Covid-19 situation in the state saying reality is contrary to what the government claims. “People now think that they are at God's mercy,” the division bench said. There is a "trust deficit" among people. ""People are cursing the government and the government is cursing the people. This will not help. We need to break this chain of infection," the HC observed. During the hearing of suo motu PIL, the bench pulled up the state government over shortage of remdesivir injections and ordered it to make the stock available for all, the way paracetamol is available. The high court rejected the state government’s arguments over the shortage of remdesivir that doctors prescribe them indiscriminately. The judges told the government law officer that there is no shortage of medicine and there is no requirement to control its supply and to make people suffer unnecessarily. The judges refused to get into the nitty-gritty of production and storage of the medicine and asserted, “We want results. That’s all.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-intention-of-lockdown-guj-hc-orders-stricter-restrictions/articleshow/82038241.cms||---

The price of Banginapalle and Panukulu varieties start from Rs 200 per kilogram in supermarkets and some retail markets in Vizag city, but several consumers said the taste this year is not up to the mark. Compared to last year, the arrival of the fruit was delayed this year. “Tempted upon spotting mangoes at the market, we purchased Banginapalle for Rs 220 per kg, but the taste of the fruit is a little sour,” said D Sudhakar, a resident of MVP Colony in Vizag. Some mango lovers said farmers harvested the fruit before it was fully mature to make easy money. So far, Banginapalle and Panukulu varieties are available in the markets, while Cheruku Rasalu, Chinna Rasalu and other varieties are yet to be spotted, said mango lover P Ramakrishna. Officials of the horticulture department said the extent of mango cultivation in the north Andhra region is around 50,000 hectares with a yield of over 4.5 lakh tonnes on average. Mango lovers may have to wait another couple of weeks to get high quality Suvarnarekha, Rasalu and Banginapalle varieties of mangoes as the best quality are available in the market after the second week of May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/mangoes-here-but-consumers-rue-high-price-and-sour-taste/articleshow/82037348.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Banks’ refusal to fund hits solar scheme for farmers||JAIPUR: Centre’s Kusum scheme aimed at helping farmers with extra income from their barren and semi-fertile land through solar projects is facing hurdles from banks who are reluctant to finance the units. Out of the 170 farmers who have signed agreements with discoms to set up solar plants, only around 15 have started working on the projects and the rest are delaying it as they are unable to tie-up bank funding. A senior official at Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd (RRECL) said banks have developed cold feet to finance the projects because of two reasons. First, he said, there are concerns that discoms don’t have a good track record of paying for the power on time and second, in case of a default, they cannot confiscate the farmer’s land given the sensitivity of the issue. “Land is a good collateral. But since these are farmers, their land cannot be seized in case of a default. Banks want other collaterals for financing the projects, but farmers don’t have or give other assets. As per the agreement, discoms buy the power, but the track record of their payments to other projects has been very poor. So bankers are wary of these projects,” said the officials. When TOI contacted a State Level Banking Committee (SLBC) official, he said the boards of the banks have not taken any decision to finance such projects. “We have had a discussion on funding these projects but unless our boards decide and take a decision, we cannot lend to these projects,” said the official preferring anonymity. The PM-KUSUM (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan) Scheme was launched across the country in March 2019 and guidelines were issued in July same year. Rajasthan was the first state in the country to invite expression of interest from the farmers and complete the application process By March 2020. Out of the 623 farmers selected based on their application, 201 have deposited the security money at Rs 5 lakh per megawatt. But only 170 have signed agreements with the discoms. Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (RERC) has fixed Rs 3.14 paisa per unit of power for these projects, which the industry feels the rate is very low given the small size of the projects. Even investors are allowed to tie up with the farmers to set up the projects and pay a rental to the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/banks-refusal-to-fund-hits-solar-scheme-for-farmers/articleshow/82038958.cms||---

Central Bank of India offers higher interest rate||MUMBAI: In a first, the Central Bank of India has said that it will offer depositors who vaccinate against Covid 25 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage points) higher return under a special scheme. The special rate is applicable for single dose as well. “In order to encourage vaccination under Covid, Central Bank of India, as a part of their social commitment to a healthy society, has brought out a special deposit product ‘Immune India Deposit Scheme’ for 1,111 days at an extra interest rate of 25bps above the applicable card rate for citizens who got vaccinated,” the bank said in a statement. The bank currently offers a 5.1% return on deposits over three years. So, the return through the special scheme would be 5.35%. “Central Bank of India requests the citizens to vaccinate (Covid) and avail the offer, which is for a limited period. Senior citizens are eligible for extra interest as applicable,” the bank said. Banks typically cannot discriminate between depositors in terms of interest rate offered, except in the case of senior citizen deposits where they are allowed to offer higher returns. Central Bank has worked around this by creating a new scheme altogether for a fixed tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/got-vaccine-central-bank-offers-higher-interest-rate/articleshow/82039002.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Markets see rush but restrained Ugadi likely||VISAKHAPATNAM/VIJAYAWADA: With several states in the grip of a second wave of the pandemic, Ugadi on Tuesday is expected to be a low-key affair like last year. Though Andhra Pradesh had only eight Covid-19 cases last year at the time of Ugadi on March 25, this time the state has 23,115 active cases, including 3,263 new infections recorded on Monday. The spike in cases has taken the sheen off Ugadi celebrations, which is marked by Panchanga Sravanam (ritual reading of almanac), said Acharya Ravviji, a city-based astro-palmist and general secretary of International Astrological Science (Madras). While readings of panchangams in temples have been restricted, purohits have also decided to celebrate the festival within the temple premises with fewer devotees. Last year, the Panchanga Sravanam was live telecast on several channels. “Instructions were already issued to all departments concerned and the temples to celebrate the festival in a simple manner this year too in wake of rampant Covid-19 cases,” state tourism minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao told TOI. TOI spoke to some residents at shopping malls and in open marketplaces. “We are celebrating Ugadi in a simple way. The reason; my parents were infected with Covid-19 and are undergoing treatment,” said a government bank employee who has recently recovered from the disease. Andhra Medical College principal and north-coastal Andhra Pradesh Covid-19 special officer Dr P V Sudhakar said that the number of daily cases have almost touched 500 in Visakhapatnam. “We request all to take utmost care and follow all the Covid-19 precautions on Ugadi to keep this disease at bay this year. Or else, everything will be out of control,” Sudhakar told TOI. Traffic ADCP Ch Adinarayana said 56,000 cases were booked against people not wearing masks. As many as 200 police personnel will be deployed at the beach to manage the crowd. In Vijayawada, city police and Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) kept a close watch on markets across the city. Special teams were deployed to ensure mask enforcement and physical distancing at market places and shopping malls. Besant Road, Chitturi Complex, Kaleswara Rao market centre, Vaagu Centre and Patamata Junction were flooded with consumers. Mic announcements were arranged at multiple locations alerting the public about the threat of Covid-19. “The second wave of Covid-19 is very ferocious and we should be very cautious. We can celebrate festivals if we are safe and secure. One should be very cautious during the next twenty days. Festive markets have been arranged at open spaces to facilitate the public,” said Dr Suhasini, district medical and health officer (DM&HO) of Krishna district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/markets-see-rush-but-restrained-ugadi-likely/articleshow/82037378.cms||V Kamalakara Rao
---||Amaravati||AP: Job calendar likely to be released after LS bypoll||AMARAVATI: The state government is gearing up to release recruitment calendar in the next few days. Although chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy wanted to release the schedule for filling up vacancies on Telugu New Year day, Ugadi, the decision has been deferred by a few weeks due to the model of code of conduct in force for the Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election. Sources said that the government is likely to release the schedule any time after the completion of the election process next week. The government is expected to compile data of vacancies in different departments and release the schedule for recruitment in one go. Chief secretary Dr Adityanath Das has directed special chief secretaries, principal secretaries and secretaries to compile the list of vacancies so that the government could take a call on filling the posts. Sources said the police department has been waiting for the chief minister’s clearance to fill 6,000 to 8,000 constable vacancies. Sources said that the police department is most likely to get the green signal from the finance department on a priority basis. Similarly, the government is also keen to fill about 14,000 to 15,000 teacher vacancies in government schools. The school education department has submitted its proposals for filling teacher vacancies. Sources said the chief minister had given in principle clearance to fill teacher vacancies keeping in view the increase in student enrolment in government schools in the current academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/job-calendar-likely-to-be-released-after-ls-bypoll/articleshow/82037396.cms||Samdani MN
---||Business||Hiring outlook up, but few willing to relocate||MUMBAI: The second wave of the pandemic has not impacted hiring intentions of organisations. However, candidates in mid to senior roles are expressing unwillingness to relocate, even in location-critical roles, over family health worries and lockdowns. Last year, when the pandemic struck, hiring had gone into a freeze. Given the learnings from the previous year, the situation — although unpredictable — is not as bad, say hiring experts. TeamLease Services co-founder & executive VP Rituparna Chakraborty said the first lockdown was followed by some disastrous impact on the economy and on jobs. “We have seen momentum build gradually since September 2020. Till March 2021, while we didn’t completely recover, we have witnessed noticeable improvement in economic sentiments as well as intent to hire across a few key segments while others remained static,” said Chakraborty. Antal International India MD Joseph Devasia said, “Last year, companies put hiring on hold or froze it completely. But this year, all the hiring mandates we are working on are active and we have even got new mandates from at least 80% of our existing clients.” A fresh challenge in hiring now appears to be convincing candidates to take up job offers which require relocation. This trend was initially seen for cities that are witnessing a spike in Covid cases. However, with new government restrictions and lockdowns being imposed, the trend is now pan-India. “We are seeing an increased number of candidates unwilling to progress on roles that need relocation. In the last 4-6 weeks, nearly 50% candidates are not open to consider relocating this year. About 70% of these candidates either have a family or have aged parents living with them and wouldn’t want to take any health risk involved in relocating within the country,” said Devasia. CIEL HR Services CEO Aditya Mishra said, earlier candidate “drop-offs” happened due to counter-offers or competitive offers. “Now, at least one-third of drop-offs are taking place due to unwillingness to relocate,” said Mishra. This could result in higher costs for an organisation that may not be able to source the best talent locally. The panic situation as seen last year, however, is not visible today in hiring. “So far, no job offers are being revoked,” said Mishra. Chakraborty said certain sections of skilled candidates who can opt to work remotely are taking this stance on not relocating. “Pressure from parents is playing a role in this decision, mostly for those who are single. However, this could be a momentary phenomenon as jobs is probably not the only attraction which draws them to cities,” said Chakraborty. She added that in the long run, certain cities will remain attractive and aspirational for most candidates. TeamLease’s Employment Outlook Report (EOR), which captures the intent to hire, reveals an improvement across sectors as of March 2021 when compared to March 2020. The improvement is higher for educational services, knowledge processing outsourcing, healthcare & pharmaceuticals, e-commerce, IT and FMCG, as compared to sectors like travel & hospitality and retail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hiring-outlook-up-but-few-willing-to-relocate/articleshow/82038989.cms||Namrata Singh

Ugadi of the Telugus, Gudi Padwa of the Marathis and Chetti Chand of the Sindhis are some of the celebrations lined up on Tuesday while Vishu Kani of the Malayalis, Puthandu of the Tamilians, Baisakhi of the Punjabis and Rongali Bihu of the Assamese will be celebrated on Wednesday, followed by Poila Baisakh of the Bengalis on Thursday. However, most will keep it a low-key affair because of the rising Covid count, cancelling community events and switching to the virtual mode wherever possible. Many have cancelled visits to extended families, friends and relatives. Instead, clothes, sweets and gifts will be sent via delivery apps and video calls will replace physical meetings. Most of the cancellations of community events happened over the past few days. Since the celebrations were curbed last year due to the lockdown, grand celebrations had been planned this year. Though there is sadness over the cancelled events, people feel it is better to be safe than sorry. The Andhra Association of Kolkata has shifted the physical Ugadi event to the virtual platform. “At the virtual meet, we will have the Panchanga Shravanam, where the year’s almanac is read out and the puja will be streamed live. At home, we will prepare the Ugadi Pathadi, a solution of the bitter, sweet and sour fruits of the season,” said Srinivas Vedula, a spokesperson of the association.. The Sindhis have cancelled the community fair for Chetti Chand. The day is also celebrated as the birthday of Lord Jhulelal. “The Amrit Vela Mandir will not have congregational prayers and devotees will move in a single file, maintaining social distance,” said community spokesperson Nanik Samtani. The Chetti Chand celebration organized by Punjab Club every year has also been cancelled. The club will take a final call on the Baisakhi celebrations after a meeting on Tuesday. The Tamilians and Malayalis are also restricting celebrations to their homes. “There is a lot of similarity between the new year celebrations of the two communities. For both Puthandu and Vishu Kani, a tray of fruits is kept overnight in front of the mirror, to be viewed first thing in the morning. Children normally go to visit elders, which will not happen this time,” said S Ramani Iyer. The Tamil Association will have muted events and the puja will be streamed online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/celebrations-toned-down-as-cov-shadow-looms-over-new-year/articleshow/82037778.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

With this, 141 passengers reaching Bihar from Maharashtra have so far tested positive for the virus. The second wave of Covid, which has assumed alarming proportions in Bihar and elsewhere in the country, has put railways on high alert and forced it to strengthen safety measures at railway stations. Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar said of the 597 passengers who reached Patna Junction by Mumbai Lokmanya Tilak Terminus-Patna special train (03202) at 11.55pm on Sunday, 22 tested positive for Covid-19.

The registration of property documents galloped by a whopping 106% with 1,61,693 lakh documents being registered across the state in March 2021, when Covid-19 cases began spiralling. As against this, the number of property documents registered stood at 78,584 in March 2020, shows data compiled by the state’s Inspector General of Registration and Superintendent of Stamps. The collection of stamp duty and registration fees by the state government also jumped 146% to Rs 1,235 crore this March from Rs 501 crore during the same month last year. Both the number of documents and state’s revenues from the stamp duty and registration fees saw the year’s highest growth in March. “Reports about hike in Jantri (ready reckoner) rates from April and improvement in real estate market during January-March quarter may have led to a rise in registration of property documents as well as collection of stamp duty and registration fees,” said Ashish Patel, president, CREDAI-Gujarat, a body of real estate developers. Signalling a strong recovery, the sales of housing units in Ahmedabad rose 34% to 3,045 units in January-March 2021 from 2,268 units in the same quarter last year, stated a report by the real estate consultant Knight Frank India. Also, the property document registrations remain high in March from the point of view of taxation as it is the last month of a fiscal year, added industry players. Although there has been a steady growth in registration of property documents and stamp duty collection on month-on-month basis since September, the market disruption in the first five months of 2020-21 due to the lockdown and the slowdown induced by the pandemic has marred the overall number of registration and stamp duty mop up for the full financial year. The state’s income from the stamp duty and registration fees declined by 4% to Rs 7,364 crore in 2020-21 from Rs 7,697 crore in the pre-Covid era of 2019-20. Similarly, the number of documents registered stood at 11.48 lakh in 2020-21 as compared to 12 lakh in the previous fiscal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/despite-covid-surgeproperty-registrationssurge-106-in-march/articleshow/82038250.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Pune||Pune region: Different norms trigger containment zone disparities||PUNE: The number of micro-containment zones in the PMC areas are much less than in the neighbouring PCMC limits having more active patient due to different approaches adopted to mark such . The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) marks a micro-containment zone when two patients are found in a building. For the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the number is five. The PMC limits have nearly 400 containment zones as compared to over 2,000 in PCMC areas. But there are 51,000 patients in the PMC limits as against 25,000 in the PCMC limits. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI, “We decided on the system of marking a micro-containment zone when at least two nCoV positive cases are identified in a house, flat or a floor, to curb the spread of Covid-19. The strategy has so far worked. The government guidelines suggested at least five cases to describe a building a micro-containment zone. But since we had already formed the system, we did not change it.” Hde said there has been “a tremendous load” on the administration due to the rising Covid-19 cases in the past few weeks. The civic administration has deployed frontline and healthcare workers from different departments, such as Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) and also civic schools, to monitor the micro-containment zones. In the PMC limits, the maximum micro-containment zones are in areas such as Kothrud, Hadapsar, Satara road and Ahmednagar road. Medical practitioner and health activist Abhijit More said, “A focused approach should be adopted in the smaller micro-containment zones. Even contact tracing can be done in a scientific manner. The civic administration can reach out to the patients and help them with limited manpower.” A resident of a sealed society in Warje said, “We have 12 buildings in our society, out of which almost every building has one or two patients. The entire society is a micro-containment zone. But most of the essential services are available on the campus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/different-norms-trigger-containment-zone-disparities/articleshow/82038970.cms||Piyush Bhusari

In Purnia and Katihar, the two districts in the Kosi basin that is considered an Eldorado for agriculture workers, the thinking might alter if the lockdown is re-imposed. Rural people are not turning up in large numbers for mass vaccination against Covid-19 as they are busy in harvesting wheat. On Monday, health workers kept waiting for at least 10 people to turn up at the vaccination centre of Darmahi village in Falka block of Katihar district so that a vial could be opened, but to no avail. They finally returned from the village. One Kumod Kumar alias Tiku Singh from Purnia district was supervising wheat harvesting on his land on Monday. He had employed 20 workers for the purpose, including 18 women. “Around 60-70% of male workers with good health have migrated to Punjab in the last one month,” Singh said. Punjab has also been hit by a mutated strain of Covid-19, but it is of a different type. Skilled youths working in the IT and other sectors in various towns of Maharashtra, including Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur, have been returning to Bihar in large numbers in view of Covid spike. They are being asked by their employers to work from home. “Agriculture workers from Purnia and Katihar districts are being taken to Punjab in large numbers despite alarming rise in Covid cases there,” Singh added. One Devan Muni (22) from Pahatol village in Purnia district went to Purnia town on Sunday to catch a Punjab-bound bus, but he did not have enough money to pay the increased fare. The bus conductor was demanding Rs 1,000 more than the usual rate of Rs 1,200-Rs1,500. Muni had no other option but to return home. People willing to go to Punjab even talk to their possible employers, who, in turn, transfer the money required for journey into their bank accounts. Some also take money from the local moneylenders, who charge interest of 10-12% per month on the principal amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pandemic-not-a-concern-for-agricultural-workers-in-rural-areas/articleshow/82036980.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Bihar: Away from school, students anxious about board exams||PATNA: Facing a situation like never before due to the Covid-19 pandemic, class X and XII students are anxious about their upcoming board examinations after staying away from school for almost a year. Ananth Sharma, a class X student of Delhi Public School, said she was struggling to adjust with the new mode of online classes. “Concern over change in syllabus, mode of education and delay in exams disturbed the pace of my preparations in the last few weeks,” he said. Amid increasing number of Covid cases in the state, some students are fearing postponement of exams. “If the Covid cases continue to rise and the situation worsens, I am afraid half of my papers will be delayed and eventually get postponed. It will affect my results,” said 17-year-old Mohit Mayank. For some students, the already delayed schedule for conducting annual board examinations to May-June has left them with restrictive time for other activities, including applying to higher educational institutes, preparations for qualifying exams and profile building opportunities. Nishtha Raj, who was planning to go abroad to pursue MBBS has to look for colleges in India for her higher studies. “Private medical colleges are much cheaper in countries like Ukraine and Poland compared to India, but due to the pandemic, all my plans have been disrupted,” she said. Worried for his future, Adarsh Kumar of Tribhuvan School said, “Most of the good universities look for well-rounded resumes, but the pandemic has restricted us from doing anything extra for profile building.” Animesh Gautam, who was to move to Kota for his IIT-JEE preparations, has delayed his plans for a year. “Now I'll move to Kota for engineering entrance exam preparations only after completing my class XI,” he said. Parents, too, are concerned about the ripple effect that the postponed board exams may have. “People today will understand the scenario of students stuck in this year’s havoc. But five years down the line, all the students will be treated and judged equally regardless of the situation,” said Anjali Chauhan, mother of a class XII student. Meanwhile, teachers and mentors have advised students to stay calm and deal with the situation one day at a time. “Right now students should focus on their board exams. Staying informed and optimistic is very important,” said Saurabh Kumar, a mathematics faculty at a coaching institute on Fraser Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/away-from-school-students-anxious-about-board-exams/articleshow/82036966.cms||---

All 11 districts reported Covid-19 deaths for the 5th day in a row. Though the number of recoveries increased to 7,475, the recovery rate reduced further to 81%.

Crisis for beds, health facilities, medicines and oxygen can be felt not only in big cities, but also in smaller towns now.

---||Jaipur||Got major leads in Chomu robbery & city loot cases: Cops||JAIPUR: The special teams of Jaipur police investigating the robbery at a jewellery shop in Chomu and the loot incident at Shyam Nagar, on Monday stated that while the Chomu incident must have been executed by an organised gang, in Shyam Nagar incident, the assailants could have been amateurs. Police claimed to have got substantial leads in both the cases and are working to nail down the culprits. On Sunday, a group of armed robbers barged into a jewellery shop and robbed nearly Rs 15 lakh, 2kg gold and some silver jewellery, executing the robbery within 15 minutes. “The modus operandi of the robbers suggested that this was an organised gang. Usually, those involved in robbery avoid things like attack and assault to save themselves from getting dragged into some other sections of IPC apart from robbery,” a senior police officer, who is part of the investigating team told TOI on Monday on condition of anonymity. When contacted, Digant Anand, deputy commissioner of police (crime) said, “We have got some substantial leads and various teams are working on it for things like technical surveillance and others.” He added that police are moving in the right direction and the case would be solved soon. However, Shyam Nagar police, investigating the case of loot of a cash collection agent working for a soft drinks company, stated that the gang which executed the loot could be amateur. “Usually, organised gangs carry fire arms to intimidate but they seldom use them, but in this case, they opened fire on the victim Vipul (40) despite the fact that he did not resist. So it shows they were amateurs. Our teams are working on it and hopefully we will solve it,” said a senior officer of Jaipur police. When contacted on the developments, Ajay Pal Lamba, additional commissioner of police (crime), said, “In both the cases, accused have been identified and we will surely solve the cases. Nothing more can be shared as of now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/got-major-leads-in-chomu-robbery-city-loot-cases-cops/articleshow/82038974.cms||---

However, the city police claimed that the number of cops getting infected was less compared to the previous peak, thanks to the vaccination of these frontline workers. According to a senior cop, during the first wave last year, nearly 126 cops had been infected with the Covid-19 virus. At that point of time, about 200 people were testing positive per day in Rajkot. “At present, the daily new case tally has crossed 400-mark in Rajkot. But because of the vaccination, we are in a much better position compared to the last peak,” said Rajkot police commissioner Manoj Agarwal. “None of the cops are in the hospital. All have mild symptoms and are being treated at home.” As a precaution, the city police have asked people not to come to the police station unless it's unavoidable.

District collector Daulat Desai has made it mandatory for operators to display board saying ‘Staff Tested, Vaccinated’ outside the establishments. Last year, Desai had made it mandatory for shops and other commercial establishments to display a board with message- “No Mask, No Entry.” The idea was lauded by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and incorporated in the standard operating procedure (SOP) for commercial establishments in the every order issued thereafter. “The operators have to ensure his staff is tested and protected from Covid. Such displays will help create awareness and also to let authorities know who has followed the order and who have not done so,” said Desai. Desai said that those eligible and testing negative must get the vaccination done while those testing positive must be hospitalised or home isolated as per the recommendations of doctors. The government has also made it clear that the operators should not terminate workers or staff if they test positive and their salary must be paid on time.

Goa Pradesh Mahila Congress interim president Beena Shantaram Naik said Parrikar’s “entire tenure” as chief minister and defence minister was “full of corrupt administration, U-turns and politics of convenience.” “It is now crystal clear that AAP which wants to carry forward his legacy is the B team of BJP. Cracks and potholes on Atal Setu is a living example of corrupt legacy of Manohar Parrikar. I urge Manish Sisodia and AAP to go through the corruption cases and irregularities which took place during former CM Parrikar’s tenure. Goa Lokayukta gave orders to the current BJP government to investigate 21 cases of irregularities, most of which were during Parrikar’s tenure,” Naik said in a press statement. She also pointed out a list of “scams that happened during Parrikar’s regime” — cyberage, beach-cleaning, Panjim parking fee-collection, Smart City, Miramar-Dona Paula road, IFFI, Spaces building rent, SEZ promoters interest payment, garbage collection, etc. Naik said, “The beginning of Goa moving towards financial emergency was after Parrikar took charge as chief minister in 2012.

The crematoriums at Pal, Limbayat and Mota Varachha were not operational for many years for lack of facilities. The three crematoriums are run by trusts and none have cremation furnaces. At Pal crematorium, an open ground is available where 15 bodies were cremated during early hours on Monday. “It is a big ground and to reduce the waiting period for cremation we have developed the facilities here. Multiple cremations are possible here,” said former city BJP president Nitin Bhajiyawala, who is working as a volunteer at the crematorium. Pravin Patel, former BJP municipal councillor, said, “The crematorium was not in use for the past 10 years but it is required to be used in the current situation. At present we are cremating only Covid-19 bodies here.” In Limbayat, the old crematorium was not preferred by people since it is on the bank of a rivulet and not a river. “It has two stands for wooden pyre and three more are being installed,” said a Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) official. At Mota Varachha a traditional crematorium with one stand for wooden pyre is being used for non-covid bodies. “The trust running the crematorium has been asked to arrange for staff to assist people performing the last rites,” said an SMC official. In Varachha area SMC staff is assisting in cremating bodies at the neighbouring village of Kathore. Due to the high number of deaths many videos of the queue at crematoriums went viral recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/smc-opens-three-defunct-crematoriums/articleshow/82039017.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The state, too, has seen fatalities jump by 23% in less than two weeks of April compared to the previous month. Mumbai reported 215 deaths in March, but has crossed 333 by April 11. In January and February, the city had seen 236 and 127 Covid deaths, respectively. Similarly, Maharashtra has crossed 3,059 deaths in April so far as opposed to 2,495 in March. Worryingly, the case fatality rate (CFR) --- deaths as a proportion of cases --- is beginning to tick upwards. And, although those above 60 are still most vulnerable, instances of younger patients turning critical are rising. The city could see up to 100 deaths a day in the coming weeks, warned Dr Avinash Supe, who heads MMR’s Covid death audit committee. “Looking at the rise in cases, daily deaths will most likely touch 100 from the average of 50-60 now,” he said. “At least, 10% of the deaths are now in people under 45 years,” Supe said, adding that fatalities are being recorded among people who were in home isolation and their condition suddenly deteriorated from the 7th or 8th day. Dr Kushrav Bhajan, a member of the task force, agreed deaths are increasing again. “Myocarditis and strokes are leading to fatalities in many now,” he said. State and civic officials used to argue that Covid deaths must be seen in proportion to cases. Cases have jumped by 19% in Mumbai in less than two weeks, while Maharashtra has exceeded March’s tally in the same period. “And in those terms, the state’s case fatality rate (CFR) and even the city’s continue to be less than 1%,” said a state official. But, the fatality rate, too, is on a steady rise. Mumbai’s weekly CFR increased to 0.35% last week, up from 0.23% in the week before. For Maharashtra too, it has jumped from 0.47% to 0.53%. Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal heath secretary, said on Sunday that the CFR may see a rise. A sign of the progressing pandemic is also patients being brought dead to hospitals. BMC’s jumbo hospital at Nesco in Goregaon has seen two such cases in the last few weeks. A 73-year-old woman collapsed in the triage area before the doctors could strap her to an oxygen cylinder. In the other case, a man died in the car by the time he reached the facility’s entrance. “We are seeing deaths in people who have comorbidities, people who are coming late and those who have been under home isolation and didn’t perhaps get hospitalised at the right time,” said dean Dr Neelam Andrade. Sneha Joseph, executive director of Holy Spirit Hospital, said they too encountered a few ‘brought dead’ cases recently. “We didn’t see such cases in the past four months,” she said. A dearth of ICU or oxygen beds could also push up the mortality numbers, although Dr Gautam Bhansali, who coordinates between private hospitals and BMC, said no deaths have occurred due to unavailability of beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/citys-april-toll-already-55-more-than-whole-of-march/articleshow/82040572.cms||Sumitra Debroy

On Monday, the complaint was lodged by BJP legislator Yogesh Verma. Both men have been asked to appear before police for questioning. During the verbal duel on Sunday, Gupta’s younger brother Sanjay had allegedly whipped out a pistol, grabbed the MLA's collar and thrashed him. The purported videos of the incident went viral. Police booked Sanjay Gupta and unidentified persons for "rioting, using undue influence at an election along with under various sections of Arms Act" on the complaint of sub-inspector Narendra Pratap Singh. A probe panel was also set up by the party's district president, Sunil Singh. A report would be sent to the party’s high command in Lucknow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/after-bjp-netas-fisticuff-in-public-mla-lodges-complaint-with-police/articleshow/82036316.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Chennai||Why politicians do not vote for democracy within parties||By R RangarajIn 1959-60, the DMK began the process of its organisational elections, which was also the beginning of a showdown between E V K Sampath and M Karunanidhi that led to a split in the party. For several other political parties, elections have led to differences of opinion among the principal actors, leading to friction, groupism and breakaways.While the courts and Election Commission of India have stressed on the need for regular, organisational elections within political parties to ensure that democracy within the party prevails, these elections when conducted have led to dissenting voices growing stronger and an eventual split. Another reason why politicians want an iron-like grip on such elections.During his time, Sampath managed to bring forward resolutions at the DMK general council meeting at Mayavaram on July 11, 1959, that a person elected general secretary should not be a member of Parliament or state assembly. This was seen as a move against Karunanidhi. C N Annadurai was not keen on the resolution but did not want to stop it. The resolution could be a mere formality and need not be followed, he said.In 1960, a contest between Sampath and Karunanidhi for the post of the DMK’s general secretary seemed imminent. The Mayavaram resolution was cited, and they decided to put up their nominees K A Mathialagan and C P Sittrarasu instead. Annadurai realised the proxy fight could lead to a split, and announced that he would take charge as the general secretary. This put off the division, as he also ensured a compromise through sharing of posts, with Sampath as presidium chairman, and Karunanidhi as treasurer. This truce was short-lived, and a split did happen on April 19, 1961, when Sampath launched the Tamil Desiya Katchi.The DMK averted another split during the organisational elections in 1969 after the death of chief minister and party general secretary Annadurai. V R Nedunchezhiyan (Navalar) who was upset over the denial of CM post to him had kept away from the Karunanidhi cabinet. A new general secretary had to be elected to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Annadurai. Nedunchezhiyan had thought he had pre-empted a contest by announcing his candidature. Karunanidhi was keen on taking over the post as he did not want a dual power centre in the party. That was when M G Ramachandranannounced his support for Karunanidhi and pointed out that the Congress in TN suffered as it had one person as CM and another headed the party, and said it was appropriate that CM Karunanidhi should be the general secretary as well.Navalar did not relent and Karunanidhi, realising the embarrassment of fighting a leader who was senior to him, evolved the master-stroke of opting for the post of president left vacant until then for Periyar E V Ramaswami since 1949. Karunanidhi got the party by-laws changed to give more powers to the president, while seeming to give into Navalar’s demand for general secretaryship. While taking over as president, Karunanidhi also backed the proposal to have MGR as treasurer. Periyar was prophetic MGR's elevation, and said Karunanidhi had not realised what harm he has done. In 1972, MGR and Karunanidhi fell out and MGR went on to form the ADMK.Organisational elections and polls to elect the legislature party leader have brought about havoc. The AIADMK, for instance, has been rocked by these elections since the death of MGR in 1987. While V N Janaki was sought to be elected as party leader, J Jayalalithaa and Navalar opposed this move, resulting in dramatic scenes in the assembly in 1988. It led to AIADMK (Janaki) and AIADMK (Jayalalithaa) contesting the 1989 polls separately and a loss for both.The DMK went through a round of convulsions when M K Stalin tried to take over the party presidentship from Karunanidhi, but his brother M K Alagiri insisted that he would contest for the post. Their differences led to Alagiri’s ouster from the party.For the Congress in Tamil Nadu the last big organisational election was in 1976 when G K Moopanar agreed to face the election for TNCC president after being nominated chief following the merger of the Congress(O) with the Indira Congress in 1976. Moopanar defeated P Nedumaran, but the latter could not reconcile to the loss and quit the party to form Tamil Nadu Kamaraj Congress.The DMK has been holding organisational elections, although critics say the leaders ensure that dissidents cannot actually contest against the chosen few. The last one to put up a show of strength at the organisational elections was Vaiko when eight of his supporters were elected district secretaries. Ultimately, these district secretaries quit the DMK along with Vaiko and formed the MDMK which fought the DMK in the 1996 polls.The AIADMK is yet to recover from the bout of organisational polls in 2017 when V K Sasikala, close aide of Jayalalithaa, first took over as party general secretary, and subsequently as legislature party leader. This was challenged by former CM O Paneerselvam, who led the revolt with 12 party MLAs. Although they returned to the party fold, Sasikala was shown the door. She still claims that she is the elected general secretary. The matter is pending in the Madras high court.One would think that elections are the way forward to settle differences, since the rank and file have their say. But, with most parties believing in the right to nominate successors including dynasts, elections are contentious.(The writer is a senior journalist)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/why-politicians-do-not-vote-for-democracy-within-parties/articleshow/82037851.cms||---

A theme song ‘Ami Fatoddekar’ has been doing the rounds in social media. The song seeks to invoke the pride of Fatorda residents in the distinct characteristics of the town and its people. Aimed at tugging at the heart strings of ‘Niz Goemkars’, the song attempts to blend the rustic character of the town with the dreams and aspirations of GenNext for a modern future. The theme song revolves around the development and beautification works brought in by Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai in Fatorda, as also the works done by him during the lockdown period last year in easing the hardships of the locals. “Vote for a future-ready Fatorda,” the theme song appeals to the voters. GFP has fielded candidates in all 11 wards of Fatorda and two wards of Curtorim under its Fatorda Forward panel. As it has entered into an alliance with Congress for the Margao municipality polls by forming Margao Civic Alliance, Fatorda Forward hasn’t fielded any candidates in the 11 wards of Margao. However, Fatorda Congress block has fielded six candidates in Fatorda under its panel ‘Congress for Fatorda’ and supported independents in the rest of the wards. Sardesai said that “the Future Ready Fatorda vision sets the foundations for our united Team Goa movement”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-embarks-on-propaganda-blitz-releases-theme-song/articleshow/82039042.cms||---

Their yeoman services last year had set a glorious example of service before self. According to Arif, the group performed last rites of around six bodies in the last two days of which three were of Hindu victims. Arif told TOI, “My mother is in the hospital after she tested Covid positive a few days ago. But I am continuing my social work while taking care of her. There are many families where the entire household is infected and there is nobody who can perform the funeral rites. With the extended relatives hesitating to take the risk out of fear, we have no option but to offer our services.”On Sunday, Arif’s group cremated a Bhavnagar-based businessman, whose wife too is infected and one son lives abroad. “There was only one son here along with a relative to perform the last rites and so we arranged all the necessary things for the cremation as per Hindu religion including garlands, coconut among other things and cremated the body in Kumbharwada crematorium,” Kalva said. “Arifbhai is like a farishta (angel),” reiterated Sanjay Seth, brother-in-law of the deceased who lives in Ahmedabad. “When no relative comes forward to perform the last rites of a corona victim, this man comes forward to serve the society irrespective of religion or any other consideration during this critical time. He is indeed a very noble soul,” Seth added. According to this group, their inherent motto behind the voluntary service to give the dead the dignity it deserves will continue to guide them throughout the course of their actions till the society needs their services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/bhavnagar-group-restarts-corona-funeral-services/articleshow/82039031.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Caseload in 60-plus group & HCWs dipped in 2 months||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even while the district begins to battle an upward spike in the Covid graph after a break, there has been a notable dip in positive cases among two categories –– 60-plus and health care workers (HCWs) –– in the last two months.  Weekly analysis of number of cases in 60-plus age group shows that it dropped from 526 cases in the fourth week of January to 200 cases by the last week of March. However, latest indicators show that the trend is again reversing. Since the first week of April, the cases among 60-plus age category have begun to peak. In two weeks, the number rose from 209 to 369 cases in April. The mortality rate in the same age category has also shown a dip between January and April, 2021. At the start of this year, the mortality rate for 60-plus age group in the district was 4% and by March it reached 5.3%. However, between the second week of March and April, the mortality rate dropped from 5.3% to 1.9% which, according to health officials, is a good sign, considering the high vulnerability of this age group. The fraction of 60-plus age category in total cases reported each week had gone as high as 19.3% in December 2020. Between January and March, the fraction of cases in 60 plus age category ranged between 17.5% and 19.9%. However, there was a steady dip in the cases in this age category since the third week of March. By the second week of April, the case rate has come down from 19% to 15.4%. The declining trend in cases has also been visible for health care workers. If the infection in health care workers accounted for 1.58% of total cases in the first week of January, it slid to 0.46% by the second week of April. While age and category based vaccination data is crucial for a detailed analysis, officials said that the health care vaccination started in the middle of January and except in the third week of February the case rate among HCW has always been on the decline till now. As many as 2,082 health workers have been confirmed with Covid-19 in the district so far. According to vaccination data available till April 8, 65,082 health workers received first dose of vaccine and 41,314 received second dose in the district. As for age appropriate category, 3.74 lakh received the first dose while 5,187 received the second dose in the district till April 8. Cumulative age distribution of cases shows that those aged between 60-69 account for 10.2% cases while persons aged between 10-39 and 40-59 account for higher percentage of case share; 46.3% and 31.6% respectively. The district recorded 505 Covid-19 positive cases on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/caseload-in-60-plus-group-hcws-dipped-in-2-months/articleshow/82037866.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Mumbai||Nat’l study: 45% of those tested in Dec had antibody. It was 18% in July||Around 31% of almost 4.5 lakh people who took antibody tests for Covid-19 across India from July to December last year tested positive, according to a new study analysing data from a chain of private labs. Seropositivity, as this is known, rose from 18% in July to 46.5% in December and was slightly higher in females — 35% compared to 30% —than in males, reports Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar. In 12 cities that together accounted for a third of national cases, overall seropositivity rose to 41% by December. Different cities saw rates peak at different times—Mumbai, Pune, and Vizag saw seropositivity peak in October, while Surat saw a peak in August. Jaipur saw the highest positivity at 63% in December. Because this sample is more likely to represent relatively wealthier people and those with health concerns, researchers led by epidemiologist Prabhat Jha also calculated prevalence in the 12 cities based on mortality data for Covid-19 for the same time period. They estimated a prevalence of 43-60% in those over 20 years in these cities, with 9-12 infected adults for every confirmed case. The findings broadly align with sero-surveys in Delhi and Mumbai, said Sandeep Juneja, a senior professor at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research who has led Mumbai sero-surveys and is not associated with this study. The high prevalence rates suggest variants are driving the current surge since widespread infection is usually thought to bring herd immunity. It’s also possible that mild infections last year led to fewer deaths but also a lower protective effect, said Jha, who is director of the Centre for Global Health Research in Toronto. “Low levels of infection may be like a shoddy vaccination that doesn’t really work.” The study found antibodies peaked in those aged 14, declined by 20, and rose again to peak in the 60-70 year group —-an “M-shaped pattern” that suggests intergenerational transmission, said Jha. In some countries, antibodies are highest among young adults, but in countries with multigenerational homes, like India and Brazil, the entire family gets infected, he noted. People in their 20s, who are most likely to be living away from family, had lower positivity rates. This is an important finding, said health and development economist Anup Malani, who was not associated with the study.  “The role of intergenerational transmission tells us about the value of lockdowns for protecting the elderly,” he said. Moreover, while seropositivity rates rose in all age groups between July and December, fastest growth was in those under 20 and the 20-44 age group, suggesting younger people were driving transmission. The study, still in pre-print, tries to throw insight on what Jha calls the “paradox of widespread infection and low mortality” in India. India was among the top in Covid-19 cases last year but had relatively few deaths compared to Europe and America, leading some to suggest there were a large number of hidden deaths.  Jha’s analysis of the mortality data in the 12 cities suggests that is not the case in those urban areas: the cities were chosen for their good death registry systems, and the mortality data was adjusted for under-reporting. Higher death counts would have translated into “implausibly high” prevalence rates, Jha says. Researchers also looked for, and did not find, any associations between seropositivity and migration, age structure of the population, or PM 2.5 levels.  They did find a small 6% decline in seropositivity in areas where there had been an increase in childhood vaccination for measles in 2014-15. “It’s possible that kids who were vaccinated were more resistant to Covid-19 and that helped reduce transmission to adults, too,” said Jha. The finding was “speculative”, he noted, but did suggest background immunity may play a role. Malani, a professor at University of Chicago who has led serosurveys in India, said while the study sample was not representative of the urban population—being a self-referred group able to afford a private lab test—its size and the detailed analysis offers insights on seroprevalence across cities and time.  The study provides more evidence that antibodies wane over time, Malani noted, since seroprevalence rates fell in some cities by end of year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/natl-study-45-of-those-tested-in-dec-had-antibody-it-was-18-in-july/articleshow/82040605.cms||Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar

Even as Maharashtra has postponed its state board exams scheduled to be held later this month due to the rising Covid-19 cases, sources in the Goa Board said there are no plans to defer the exams in Goa as of now. As the number of active Covid-19 cases have crossed the 4,500 mark, the Class XII board exams are set to be held from April 24 to May 8. Soon after, the Class X exam will begin on May 13 and will end on June 4. For the Class X exam, 24,300 students have registered to take the test. This year, the Class X and XII state board exams have already been delayed due to the pandemic. Goa Board has put in place plans to deploy volunteers at the public examination centres like it had done last year to assist students in locating their seating. This is also being done to help maintain social distancing, as students trying to locate their seats at the last minute could forget to maintain safe among themselves. The board has said the SOPs for the exams will be issued separately. For both Class X and XII exams, the test will begin each day at 9.30am and students will have to report half an hour early, by 9am, as per usual norms. In a normal year, the Class XII Goa Board exam would begin in the last week of February and end by mid-March. And the Class X exam was usually conducted in April. But the pandemic has delayed the academic schedule. Physical classes for Class X and XII students were only allowed from November 21, 2020, which too saw interruption as some teachers and students tested positive in four different institutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/19-2k-students-to-answer-class-xii-board-examinations-from-april-24/articleshow/82039049.cms||---

The video has sparked outrage among residents and activists. The Thane municipal body denied such an incident had taken place. The video shows a hearse bearing a Thane registration number, carrying four corpses being brought to a crematorium in Thane city. While the bodies are neatly wrapped in white bed sheets, the faces are covered with plastic bags. Meanwhile, a fourth corpse is seen partially wrapped in a black plastic bag — similar to the ones typically to dispose junk. BJP leader Kirit Somaiya who shared the video on social media, late on Monday, lashed out at the government, questioning how bodies could be disposed in this manner. Sources said that the bodies could have been brought from Saket Global Covid hospital which is facing shortage of body bags. “There could possibly be a shortage of body bags as the volume of deaths has risen in the last few days, forcing the staff to use bedsheets to wrap the bodies,” an official said, speaking strictly on the condition of anonymity. Ganesh Deshmukh, additional commissioner at Thane Municipal Corporation, denied that bedsheets had been used to wrap bodies. In the same vein, he said he would look into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-bodies-taken-for-cremation-in-bedsheets-trash-bag/articleshow/82039998.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Till late evening on Monday, the demolition work was on, said CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues. A retail clothing store, operated by a large conglomerate, was occupying the floor. In March, CCP had issued an order to demolish the illegal structure which was challenged before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld CCP’s order and directed that the illegal construction on the second floor of the building, which is part of Panaji’s conservation zone, be demolished. The demolition of the illegal floor began a few days earlier with CCP electricians, plumbers, municipal engineers and other officers overseeing the process. “Violation of municipal regulations on construction must be met with an iron fist,” the apex court had stated in its order. After CCP ordered the demolition in 2009, petitioner Tahir Isani had filed an appeal before the minister for urban development. In 2010, the appellate authority set aside the demolition. CCP had then approached HC, which found that its order was legal and warranted no interference from an appellate authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccp-commences-razing-illegal-floor/articleshow/82039066.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The funds, which have been released after 25 years, will be used for lending to the priority sector and to local cooperatives, said the Bank’s chairman Ulhas Phaldesai. Though GSCB is not yet in the black, Phaldesai expects the state’s apex cooperative bank to wipe out all its accumulated losses by the end of the current financial year. “Basically, the mandatory requirement was the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and then there were certain statutory provisions that were to be made, which we have done. After seeing the steps taken and that the bank is very near to fulfilling the CAR, Nabard has released funds to Goa State Cooperative Bank,” said Phaldesai while talking to TOI. In a statement issued earlier, Nabard said that “proactive supervision, dedicated efforts and strategic approach” helped GSCB improve its financials in terms of profit, CRAR and other statutory compliances. Nabard has sanctioned Rs 20 crore, which will be used to provide low-cost loans to Goa Bagayatdar, farmer marketing federations and those involved in cashew cultivation. The remaining Rs 5.2 crore will be utilised for lending to the priority sector, particularly for agricultural purposes. Nabard said that the refinance window for GSCB was opened after a gap of almost 25 years with disbursement of Rs 20 crore and Rs 5.25 crore under short term-others and short term-seasonal agricultural operations, respectively. Phaldessai said that the bank is on a strong footing and nearly covered the accumulated losses of the past years. In FY 2020-21, GSCB made a profit of Rs 40 crore after making provisions for earlier losses and non-performing assets. “This year all the provisions are done and the cumulative losses have been covered,” said Phaldesai. He said that the bank’s financial statements for the last financial year have yet to be audited and finalised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-state-coop-bank-gets-nabard-refinance-after-25-yrs/articleshow/82039086.cms||---

Gold vendor and jewellery owner Sampath, along with his driver Arun, was attacked and robbed by a gang near Technocity at Pallipuram on Friday night. They were transporting gold from Neyyattinkara to Attingal when the robbery took place. The probe team took the service of Rajesh, who is with district crime records bureau, Kottayam. His sketches had been crucial in nabbing the key suspects in cases like Perumbavoor rape case. The probe team collected details of the two suspects from a hotel staff at Pothencode. Police received information that the gang members had food from a hotel in Pothencode before the robbery. One of the hotel staff recollected two men arriving in two cars and having food. He also gave a description of two faces, a clean-shaven face and a man with a moustache with uneven spread of grey hair. Sampath and Arun were unable to give a description of any of the gang members as all of them wore masks and the attack happened at night. Police are circulating the images and are collecting information about the possible suspects involved in the robbery. Apart from the colour of two cars; police have not been able to get any information on number plates due to hazy CCTV visuals recorded at night. Earlier, police had questioned Sampath’s former driver Gopakumar and three other persons after it came to be known that Sampath was robbed of cash by Gopakumar and his gang three months ago at Thuckalay. Sampath told the police that he had collected gold from a wholesale dealer in Trivandrum who had transported it from Mumbai. He was on his way to deliver the gold to a shop at Attingal.

BJP general secretary Damodar Naik said that they have stepped up the campaign by going door to door with an appeal to the people to vote for its candidates. Rajendra Talak of BJP promised that they will fulfil all the proposals put forth if Vibrant Margao is victorious. “I appeal to the people to make all 25 candidates of Vibrant Margao victorious so that they are doubly motivated to work for the people of Margao,” Talak said. Stating that Margao has been deprived of development for the last 15 years, the period when the Margao municipality was in the hands of non-BJP parties, Naik said that the Vibrant Margao panel would fulfil all the expectations of the people of Margao with regards to development. BJP functionaries took potshots at the outgoing council headed by Goa Forward Party for its “failure to bring about a single development project” in Margao or Fatorda. Pointing out that Margao had no bus stand, no Smart City, no proper parking lots, no garbage treatment plant, no bus bays, no nana nani parks for elderly people, they promised to bring in all-round development of the town if its panel came to power.

The move comes after the arrest of four people, including a disc jockey, from some of the premium hotels in the city during a series of simultaneous raid held on Saturday night. Officials have seized contrabands, including synthetic drugs, and decided to keep an eye on parties to prevent the use of drugs. Customs (preventive) has asked hotels in the city to ‘know the people’ to whom they are letting their rooms and premises for hosting gatherings and other events. The officials have asked the hoteliers to ensure that those people approaching to rent out space are not accused or have connections to any cases registered under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Legal actions will be taken against those hotels which do not follow the directives. “History-sheeters in NDPS cases will be under strict surveillance. Information will be gathered about the parties and gatherings they attend. Surveillance will be implemented in such a way that the hotels’ business is not affected. However, hoteliers will have to ensure that drug parties will not be conducted within their premises and inform officials concerned if any person approaches them with such demands. If not, they can be charged under Section 25 of NDPS Act which stated punishment for allowing premises, etc., to be used for commission of an offence,” sources said. Deputy excise commissioner T A Ashok Kumar said that the excise would deploy officials in mufti to check gatherings and other events. Moreover, information is being gathered from people who regularly take part in parties. If needed, more surprise raids will be conducted in case of any suspicions. “There is inflow of synthetic drugs from other states, mainly Goa and Karnataka. These rave parties are also used as a place to find new customers, who are mostly youngsters. The rate of such parties has increased after the Covid restrictions were lifted. With the second wave hitting the state hard, more restrictions are likely to be imposed by the government in the coming days. Excise will strengthen the surveillance on parties,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/customs-to-strengthen-surveillance-on-parties/articleshow/82037871.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It was following this attack that the force opened fire in “self-defence”, killing four people. The brother of Hamidul Haque, who was the first victim of the firing, lodged a complaint against CISF. Election Commission officials are trying to find CCTV footage of the booth to reach a conclusion about the occurrence of mob violence. Senior officials questioned several polling staff who were present at the booth. They are also planning to question a polling staffer of an adjacent booth who claimed he witnessed the incident and posted about it on social media. He may be made a witness in the case. A senior EC official, however, said booth 126 was a single-booth polling station. On Monday, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she had got the names of the CISF personnel who had opened fire at Sitalkuchi and blamed the SP for the firing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cisf-files-police-complaint-on-sitalkuchi-attack/articleshow/82041159.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya
---||Kochi||Kochi: Eco-friendly grove to come up at Mulavukad||KOCHI: A group of like-minded people, after forming a community called ‘Tau-Poor and Pure’, is on a mission to create a grove in the city, which will be a common space for all irrespective of age, religion and gender, where people could spend time, interact with others, read books by keeping aside all their worries. As an initial step, more than 360 plants are being grown on a 28-cent plot at Mulavukad, which they bought through crowd funding from over 2,500 members who are from various walks of the society. They eventually want to set up an eco-friendly library too where people can read books under the shade of trees. The aim is to set up a place, which they call a ‘compassion hub’, which will help people, especially those suffering from psychological and anxiety issues, to be stress-free. Some of the doctors in the city have offered help during their free time by visiting the place and people can talk to them openly. The concept was put forward by Fr Bobby Jose Kattikad, popularly known as ‘Bobbyachan’, who is a Roman Catholic priest from Order of Friars Minor Capuchin. Fr Kattikad and like-minded people had started the work on August 15, 2020, by planting a few saplings. On October 2, they planted more than 350 saplings of trees, including fruit trees and those which are seen in groves. “People often go to hill stations or beach resorts to take a break from their busy life. But there are many who are not able to go on such trips. Moreover, there is no place in the city where people can freely relax without any tension. We want to create a natural atmosphere called Tau Kavu that is eco-friendly and without any concrete constructions. People can come here, sit peacefully, read books or interact with each other,” said Sujith M G, one of coordinators and a trustee of Tau, which has been registered as a trust. Most of the plants have grown up to seven feet already and the members are working on setting up bamboo benches, small ponds and a medicinal garden in the plot. “We also plan to set up a few rooms made out of mud so that people can stay here for a few days if they want. We hope to materialize all these plans eventually and the cost is met through crowd funding,” Sujith said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/eco-friendly-grove-to-come-up-at-mulavukad/articleshow/82037956.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

The board, which is headed by chief minister Pramod Sawant, could not take up additional investment projects due to the lack of industrial land in the state, said sources. Most of the cleared projects were from the manufacturing sector and had approached the state government for permission to expand. “There is a shortage of industrial plots and thus the board cannot confirm more projects because of land availability. There are many good project that have come up, but because of shortage of land the projects could not be taken up,” said a board member. Sawant has directed the board to work out a proper procedure for allotment of land and to also identify vacant plots in industrial estate for new investment projects. The board agreed to clear investment projects that already own private land. Companies looking to manufacture and sell pre-mix concrete and other construction products will no longer be allotted land in industrial estates and will be encouraged to setup in their own private land. The board also deliberated on the need for a proper procedure to evaluate investment projects and the allotment of land for projects. The board members also gave the go ahead for a new investment policy to be prepared for which a sub-committee will be constituted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/15-projects-get-green-signal-from-investment-board/articleshow/82039115.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was alluding to the allegations levelled against former home minister Anil Deshmukh by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Fadnavis held six public meetings in the constituency. There is a straight fight between NC’s Bhagirath Bhalake and BJP’s Samadhan Autade in the bypoll. NCP has deployed top functionaries such as deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and state president Jayant Patil for the campaign here. Fadnavis, in his speeches focusing on the MVA government’s recent controversies, said, “Doubts are being raised over Mumbai police, which was once revered like the Scotland Yard. One minister demandes Rs 100 crore from bars, another minister sought Rs 50 crore to be collected from contractors. The MVA government has become Maha Vasooli Aghadi.” Fadnavis also raked up the issue of water distribution of Neera project as a direct attack on Pawar. “When we were in power, we allowed the water of the project to be used in drought-prone Pandharpur. However, when the MVA government came into power, Ajit Pawar cancelled the decision and the water was diverted to Baramati,” said Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/fadnavis-calls-mva-maha-vasooli-aghadi/articleshow/82036356.cms||---

Four people were killed in the CISF firing. One of the petitions sought that the CISF unit involved in the firing be removed from the election process and not deployed for the remaining four phases. The writs also called for providing adequate compensation to the families of the deceased. Seeking the formation of an independent committee headed by a retired HC judge, the petitioners — an advocate at Calcutta high court and a school teacher — stressed the need to unravel the truth and identify the offenders. While Trinamool Congress has said that the firing was unprovoked, unnecessary and indiscriminate, BJP has claimed that the forces were attacked and that the shooting was in self-defence. The petitioners argued that while central and state forces are deployed for the smooth conduct of elections and to ensure safety and peace, the opposite seemed to have occurred at Sitalkuchi, and that the forces had not followed rules regarding the use of firearms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pils-in-hc-for-judicial-probe-into-sitalkuchi-firing/articleshow/82041167.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Goa||No-trust against Curchorem council chairperson: Decision on April 16||Margao: After two no-confidence motions moved by the disgruntled councillors of the Curchorem Cacora Municipal Council (CCMC) against chairperson Balkrishna Hodarkar fizzled out, the directorate of municipal administration (DMA) has fixed a meeting on April 16 to decide on third no-confidence motion against the chairperson. The signatories to the motion are known to owe allegiance to power minister and Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral. The first no-confidence motion against Hodarkar was moved by 10 councillors on April 1 in a dramatic fashion, less than 30 minutes after he was declared elected. However, the DMA, Gurudas Pilarnekar, refused to consider the motion on technical grounds, and conveyed his decision to the councillors on April 5. Aggrieved over this, 9 councillors moved another no-confidence motion against Hodarkar the next day, which was also rejected by the DMA on April 9 on procedural grounds. The very same day, they moved yet another no-confidence motion, this time, however, signed by six councillors. The Cabral-backed councillors will need to win over two more councillors on their side to get the motion passed in the 15-member council. Meanwhile, the first ordinary meeting of the council was held on Monday with seven councillors registering their presence. Chief officer Ajay Gaude presided over the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-trust-against-curchorem-council-chairperson-decision-on-april-16/articleshow/82039136.cms||---

Police and teams of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation tried to take action against the traders, however, the representatives of Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) intervened. However, as the traders were unable to ensure social distancing, the KMC team slapped them with a fine of up to Rs 1,000. Sanjay Shete, the president of KCCI said, “We will keep shops open till the next weekend lockdown. We are against all-day week long lockdown. Despite several attempts, the government has not resolved the issue. We have conveyed our disappointment to the authorities for imposing a fine on the traders. Also, we have asked the traders to ensure social distancing is followed and not to allow anyone inside the shops without a mask.” Gudi Padva and Ramzan propelled citizens to move out for shopping. Also, there was panic buying among the people as the government is likely to impose a lockdown in the coming days to break the chain of Covid spread. The long queues were seen outside shops for groceries. The authorities had to shut down some shops in the garment market at Gandhinagar but upon request from the visitors, the authorities let the shops open again. People were mainly out for wedding shopping, who come from distant places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/all-shops-open-for-business-in-kolhapur/articleshow/82036360.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu has adequate vax doses, says CM Edappadi K Palaniswami||CHENNAI: Asserting that adequate doses of Covid vaccine are available in Tamil Nadu, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Monday called upon government staff to get vaccinated within two weeks. The management of industries, government offices, workplaces, markets and residential complexes should contact Greater Chennai Corporation/district administration to arrange for Covid vaccination that can be administered at their premises, the chief minister said. During a review meeting with the heads of departments at the Secretariat, the chief minister said the public should get vaccinated at nearby hospitals. “The management of industries, restaurants and markets should arrange for vaccination for their employees. If the management requests government hospitals, the government is ready to vaccinate the workers at their premises. We have adequate doses of vaccines,” Palaniswami said, urging people to avoid crowding in public places, wear masks, maintain social distance and follow the government’s standard operating procedures. In a slew of directions to department heads, Palaniswami said all eligible people should get vaccinated and the administrative machinery should reassure people about the necessity to take the vaccination. “The vaccination is done at primary health centres, government hospitals, mini clinics and private hospitals. The state administered 37.8 lakh vaccine doses until Sunday to health staff, frontline workers, election staff and people above 45 years,” an official release said, quoting the chief minister. The state has received 54.85 lakh doses of vaccine from the Centre until Sunday. The chief minister said the administration should conduct 90,000 RT-PCR tests a day, besides increased and aggressive testing in affected areas, and the results should come out in 24 hours. Tracing of a minimum 25-30 contacts of infected persons should be expedited and they should undergo RT-PCR tests. “Fever camps should be set up across the state and those with symptoms of cold and fever should be diagnosed and treated,” the release said. The state government has set up 8.92 lakh fever camps so far and treated 14.47 lakh people with symptoms of fever. As many as 1,309 containment zones were identified as on April 10 and intensive monitoring measures were taken. The areas where there are three or more affected people must be declared a micro-containment zone and preventive measures taken against the spread of infection. The infected persons should be either taken to Covid care centres or exclusive Covid hospitals as per protocol. More beds, ventilators, high flow nasal cannula, medicines and personal protective equipment should be kept ready, besides 108 ambulances to avoid any delay in treatment, the release said. Palaniswami also directed the health, local bodies, police and revenue staff to impose fine on violators of standard operating procedures. A sum of Rs 17.92 crore has been collected from 16.37 lakh violators until April 10. “The officials concerned should monitor the standard operating procedures being followed in public places like markets, places of worship and cultural events,” the release said. The public and private hospitals should follow standard treatment protocol to reduce deaths due to Covid. Control rooms of the directorate of public health and district headquarters should function round the clock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-has-adequate-vax-doses-says-eps/articleshow/82039122.cms||---

Patients moved to these newly created Covid Care Centres in hotels will be managed by doctors and staff from major private hospitals and their medical parameters will be constantly monitored, assured civic officials. According to the BMC, patients will have to bear the cost of the hotel room and food. “A few hotels in south Mumbai and near the city airport have come forward for this initiative. We will soon make a list of Covid hotels,” said a senior civic official. Coronavirus: Live updatesMunicipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal announced on Monday, “Certain four- and five- star hotels shall be requisitioned immediately to create CCC2 (Covid Care Centre for positive patients) to be dovetailed and run by professionals from major private hospitals to make large number of beds available to new needy patients by shifting substantially recovered patients quickly to these CCC2 facilities to be managed by professional doctors.” Over the last few weeks, due to a record surge in Covid-19 cases, a severe shortage of beds, especially in private hospitals, has been reported in the city. Civic officials believe that since many patients are from high-rise buildings, beds in private hospitals are preferred more, which led to the shortage. “The BMC has added 325 ICU beds in various hospitals, taking the total to 2,466. The total number of Covid beds on the online bed allotment dashboard has increased to 19,151 in 141 hospitals of which presently 3,777 beds are vacant,” said Chahal. “The BMC will operationalise 1,100 additional Covid beds, including 125 ICU beds, in the next seven days. In addition, the state government has decided to build three more jumbo field hospitals in five to six weeks at three locations each with a capacity of 2,000 beds with 200 ICU beds and 70% oxygenated beds,” the municipal chief added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-shift-almost-recovered-patients-into-5-star-hotel-rooms/articleshow/82039147.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Last year, Rs 1,618 crore was provided from the DPDC funds for augmenting rural healthcare infrastructure across the state. The decision was taken at a meeting presided by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who also holds finance and planning departments. The meeting was attended by urban development minister Eknath Shinde, health minister Rajesh Tope and additional chief secretary (planning) Debashish Chakrabarty. “Currently, a provision of Rs 11,035 crore has been made for schemes under the DPDC. In Monday’s meeting, it was decided to allow the use of 30% of the funds—Rs 3,310—for Covid-19 measures. Besides emergency medicines, it has been proposed to strengthen healthcare infrastructure on a permanent basis. We are in process of providing better healthcare system in rural areas,” a senior bureaucrat told TOI. He said comprehensive guidelines will be issued in a day or two on the utilization of the Rs 3,310 crore in consultation with the public health, medical education department and FDA. Pawar also directed district collectors to ensure judicious use of remdesivir, and provide it directly to hospitals, instead of distributing it through retailers. “Soon, the FDA will come out with a standard operating procedure for providing remdesivir,” he said, adding: “The ensuing 15 days are very critical. The district administration will have to ensure that adequate beds, ventilators, oxygen and remdesivir are available. The government will ensure that adequate funds and manpower are available to the district administration.” Pawar further said that the government is requisitioning additional beds in private hospitals and augmenting oxygen supply. “We are planning to set up oxygen plants on hospital premises for easy availability,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-to-use-30-of-district-plan-funds-to-tackle-covid/articleshow/82040066.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Kolkata||From 812 on March 27 to 4,511 now, Bengal sees five-fold rise in new Covid cases in a fortnight||KOLKATA: In just about two weeks since the beginning of assembly elections in Bengal, the number of daily Covid cases has gone up nearly five times. On March 27, when the state went to the first phase of polls, the state reported 812 fresh cases and two deaths. The number surged sharply to 4,043 new cases and 12 deaths by April 10, when the fourth phase was held.  With four more rounds to go, experts fear the virus will leave a trail of a massive destruction by time elections get over. “We are only half into the election process with four more phases still left. The situation is out of control already. So one can imagine how the number of positive cases is going to swell in the next 15 days,” said a senior health department official. On Monday, the state recorded 4,511 fresh cases, recording another highest single-day spike during this entire pandemic. The highest single-day spike during the first wave was 4,157. That was on October 22. On Sunday, there were 4,389 cases. “The number of samples tested in the past 24 hours was less than the previous day as some labs were closed on Sunday. Despite that, Monday had 122 more cases than Sunday. The positivity rate at some labs now is as high as 20%,” said the official. In the past 24 hours, 37,116 sample were tested against 40,372 on the previous day. With the alarming rise from only 4,608 active cases in Bengal on March 27, it has shot up over six times to 26,531 on Monday. The hospital bed occupancy, too, rose to 28.1% on Monday from a mere 7.2% on the first day of polling. The hardest hit is Kolkata and North 24 Parganas. The two districts, during the first wave, had highest single-day spikes in three digits during the peak. But unlike last year, fresh cases in both the districts have touched the four-digit mark on Sunday and is on the rise. On Monday, Kolkata recorded another all-time high of new 1,115 cases while North 24 Parganas had 1,087 cases. “While these two districts are the worst hit, some rural areas will also bear the brunt this time due to the kind of inter-zonal movement as far as electioneering is concerned,” said a public health expert with the state health department. As parts of North 24 Parganas will go to the polls this weekend, various political parties have already started campaigning and are holding rallies. Experts fear a massive explosion in this district soon. Apart from Covid facilities in Kolkata and surrounding areas, some other units in Midnapore, Burdwan and Raigunj are also running out of bed.  “A second was expected. But things could still have been under control if it was not for the polls where no leaders have shown the necessity to abide by Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said a senior doctor of a government-run Covid facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-812-on-mar-27-to-4511-now-bengal-sees-five-fold-rise-in-new-cases-in-a-fortnight/articleshow/82037970.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The physiotherapist, A Arul Chinnapparaj, 41, told police that he had got the demonetized notes from S Varalakshmi who was running an old age home at Chengalpattu. Both have been detained. Varalakshmi told police that this was money she had saved up from donations from people and NGOs to construct a building. She said Arul had promised to help her exchange the notes for commission. Sivaganga SP M Rajarajan said the claims made by both the accused are being verified. He said prima facie it appeared that a gang in Chennai had promised to pay them Rs 15 lakh for every Rs 1 crore of demonetized currency. Police are probing if the gang was part of a larger cheating racket. The physiotherapist had recently returned home to Melavalayampatti from Bengaluru where he had been employed.

---||Nagpur||Will Amravati pattern to curb cases work or is it late now?||Nagpur: The state government is all set to follow the Amravati pattern of lockdown-like restrictions in a day or two to control the cases of Covid-19. Amravati’s guardian minister and state’s woman and child development minister Yashomati Thakur has already praised the ‘Amravati pattern’. TOI looks at how Amravati, which once had 40% sample positivity rate, controlled the infection spread “within 13 days”. “In 13 days, we managed to control the number of daily cases to about 300 from 1,000. Had the entire state taken similar decision then, we wouldn’t been witnessing the current situation. The government is now working on the Amravati pattern,” Thakur, a Congress MLA from Tiwsa, said while speaking with reporters in Amravati on Monday. In Amravati, 15 days of near lockdown was imposed in February. During this period, Amravati city and Achalpur town were completely closed. People in the containment zone were banned from leaving their homes. It all began in mid-February. On February 1, there were 92 Covid-19 patients in Amravati. By February 5, the figure increased to 233, on February 10, it was 369 and on February 20, patient count reached 1,058. The lockdown-like restrictions were imposed from February 22 to 28 and later extended for one more week up to March 7. After 15 days of strict curbs, the situation improved significantly. Testing numbers remained same before and after the restrictions. Before the restrictions were imposed, Amravati conducted 2,500 to 2,600 tests per day. At that time, 900 patients tested positive on an average daily. After the restrictions, this number dropped to 300-350. Sample positivity rate also fell from 48% to 9%. Now, the state government is hoping that the current surge can be controlled if similar types of restrictions are imposed in Maharashtra. With cases under control, Amravati district is now able to cater to patients from Nagpur as well as Chhindwara and Betul in Madhya Pradesh. It’s hard to tell how successful this pattern will be. Because Amravati was the first municipal corporation in state to take such a step giving first hints of the second wave. Now, more than 10,000 new cases are being reported from 11 districts in Vidarbha daily. Moreover, deaths due to Covid-19 have increased. The bed and oxygen situation in hospitals is pathetic. RISE AND FALL Week Restrictions New cases February 1st week No restrictions/lockdown 1,079 2nd week No restrictions/lockdown 2,236 3rd week No restrictions 4,230 4th week Restrictions imposed 5,593 March 1st week Restrictions extended 4,407 2nd week Relaxations were given 2,973 3rd week More relaxations in markets 2,898 4th week Only state govt restrictions 2,632 April 1st week NO RESTRICTIONS 2,087 Amravati pattern Early signs | Admin noticed the surge early Early decision | Was first to impose lockdown-like restrictions in 2 towns Strict implementation | Amravati and Achalpur were ‘locked’, no entry-no exit policy 2 weeks | Collector made clear restrictions will be for 2 weeks only Step-by-step easing| After 2 weeks, relaxations were offered despite high cases +ve results | Cases reduced significantly after 2 weeks of strict restrictions||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/will-amravati-pattern-to-curb-cases-work-or-is-it-late-now/articleshow/82039169.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Bhopal||BJP changes strategy from large gathering to mass contact in Damoh||Bhopal: Five days ahead of polling in Damoh by-election, the Madhya Pradesh BJP has changed its strategy from holding large gatherings to mass contact and community conventions amid a massive spike in Covid-19 cases in parts of state. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who reached the poll-bound constituency on Monday afternoon, held a series of discussions with the members of Rajak Samaj, Masih Samaj and Raikwar Samaj apart from addressing a meeting of the Scheduled Caste Front.Playing the development card he said, "The BJP government will leave no stone unturned for the development of Bandakpur and Damoh areas. We have sanctioned Rs 700 crore for the drinking water project. Through Satdharu, Pancham Nagar and Sitanagar water projects, we will supply piped water in the entire constituency. Apart from this, in three years, no one will be without a pucca house and all the demands raised by the candidate will be fulfilled," said Chouhan addressing a rally in Bandakpur town of Damoh, on Monday.Chouhan also recalled the party's rout during 2018 assembly elections and said the BJP lost the government by losing 2-3 seats to the Congress including Damoh. But, people were aware of the corrupt practices by the previous Congress government and voted back the BJP to power during by-polls on 28 seats in November."Congress stopped all ambitious schemes started by BJP for the welfare of poor, farmers and women. Congress chief minister had no time to lend ears to the woes of his own ministers and MLAs. Even the Congress government cheated the farmers on loan waiver promise and daughters, in the name of marriage scheme by not paying Rs 51,000 announced by the party," he said.Chief minister Chouhan and other leaders including union minister Prahlad Patel and BJP state president Vishnu Dutt Sharma, also addressed conventions of Sindhi, Swarnkar communities and a poll meeting in Uma Mistri Ki Talaiyya. He also visited Jageshwar Nath temple in Bandakpur and offered prayers. The BJP has roped in senior party leader and former minister Jayant Maliaya and his son Siddharth, who have been provided a private helicopter to tour the poll bound areas to campaign in favour of party candidate Rahul Singh Lodhi. The party has assigned responsibility of Damoh city to Siddharth Malaiya whereas Jayant Malaiya will tour the entire constituency, sources said.Using the digital media, the party has also circulated video messages of prominent leaders including Jayant and Siddharth Malaiya, in-charge minister for the by-poll, Bhupendra Singh, health minister Prabhuram Chaudhary and state president Vishnu Dutt Sharma, who appealed to the voters to cast their mandate in favour of the BJP candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bjp-changes-strategy-from-large-gathering-to-mass-contact-in-damoh/articleshow/82037978.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Sputnik go-ahead a shot in arm for inoculation drive||KOLKATA: Approval of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine for emergency use authorization (EUA) in India amidst the alleged shortage has come as a shot in the arm.  Sputnik is expected to be rolled out as a third vaccine against Covid-19 after Covishield and Covaxin have brought cheers to the clinical trial team in Kolkata that was part of the phase III study of the vaccine. “We began the phase III trial as part of a pan India study after getting the institutional ethics committee’s approval on December 18. It was randomized double blinded placebo control trial, in which 75% of the volunteers got the vaccine and the rest were administered the placebo. The vaccine receiving EUA is a great news in the face of the vaccine shortage and the second wave,” said Dr Subhrojyoti Bhowmick, clinical director, Research & Academics at Peerless Hospitals and principal investigator of the trial. The hospital was the only centre in Eastern India that was part of the pan Indian phase III trial of the Russia-made vaccine on 1,500 volunteers from the Indian population. Developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia, Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s has partnered with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) for the phase III clinical trial in India. “It is a proud moment for us that Sputnik V has been approved for EUA in India,” said Snehendu Koner, clinical trial facilitator attached with CliniMed LifeSciences that was the site management organization for the clinical study in Bengal. Even as the immunogenicity data on Indian population is yet to be published, the vaccine’s efficacy is 91.6% based on the phase III trial conducted in various countries including Russia and published in the Lancet. “At our site none faced any serious adverse issue till date, apart from the regular side effects like fever, nausea and mild malaise. None of the participants too have contracted Covid-19 infection while there has been a surge in Covid cases. We are still going through their follow-up visits as per schedule,” added Bhowmick.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sputnik-go-ahead-a-shot-in-arm-for-inoculation-drive/articleshow/82037983.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Aurangabad||Man held for 2 elderly women’s murder||Aurangabad: A police informer from Sakhra village of Hingoli district has been arrested for allegedly robbing and killing two elderly women, one of them a money lender. The suspect, Dilip Late (32), allegedly committed the crime to fulfil the demands of his wife and three other women with whom he had extra-marital affairs, said police Police said they were investigating the murder of an 82-year-old Brajabai Ingle, whose body was found three days ago. The suspect was keenly following the case and trying to point fingers at people who had taken loans from the woman. Police got suspicious and subjected Late to intense questioning, following which he confessed to the murder. The suspect also admitted under interrogation that he killed 75-year-old Mankarnabai Sarule from the same village in August last year before robbing her of valuables and cash, said police. The partially decomposed body of Ingle, a private moneylender, was found superficially buried in a grazing ground outside the village on Saturday morning. Sengaon police exhumed the body and found that her face was bludgeoned with a heavy boulder. Accordingly a case of robbery, murder and destruction of evidence was registered. Police said Late was called to the LCB office and questioned. He soon broke down and spilled the beans. The accused worked as a police informer apart from working as an agent at the tehsil office. “The suspect is a ‘zero police’ and used to work as an informer. He has confessed to the murders and robbery of two elderly women. He has claimed that he needed money for maintaining his wife and three women with whom he had extra- marital affairs,” superintendent of police Rakesh Kalasagar told TOI. The suspect had recently taken a loan of Rs 20,000 from Brajabai and was unwilling to repay it. Moreover, he was eyeing her gold ornaments and decided to eliminate her. On April 9, he offered her help in recovering her money given as a loan on interest to a person. The suspect and the woman went for recovery, when he took a halt at a deserted grazing ground and offered her snacks laced with 10 sleeping pills. The woman soon fell unconscious and the suspect left the spot. He returned in the evening, robbed her ornaments and bludgeoned her to death. Inspector Uday Khanderai of the LCB said, “The accused kept on nagging and asking police as to why the case was not being detected and also kept on making efforts to divert our attention by naming people who had taken loans from her.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-held-for-2-elderly-womens-murder/articleshow/82036394.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kolkata||Some centres shut temporarily, others ration vials in wake of vaccine shortage||Kolkata: Despite the arrival of a consignment of 4 lakh doses of Covishield on Monday evening, the state continues to reel under an acute vaccine shortage. In fact, vaccines started drying up at some cold chain points from Saturday, a day ahead of the Tika Utsav that the Prime Minister had proposed during an online meet with states on Thursday to enhance the vaccination process. On Sunday, the first day of Tika Utsav, Bengal had one of the worst vaccination records and health officials blamed supply shortage for it. “On Sunday, the state ended up vaccinating only about 53,000 recipients from across 700 vaccination centres across the state,” said a senior health official at Swasthya Bhawan. The state had scaled up its vaccine centres to 3,000 plus across Bengal from where close to 4 lakh doses and above had been administered on a number of occasions. But the shortage had forced the health department either to shut down some of them temporarily or scale down the number of recipients due to the supply crisis. “While our centre at AMRI Salt Lake stopped vaccination from Saturday, our unit at Mukundapur could give to shot to only 12 on Monday from one vial that was carried over from the previous day’s stock. At Dhakuria, however, we got 25 vials of Covaxin and we could inoculate 312 people on Monday,” said Rupak Barua, Group CEO of AMRI Hospitals. No vaccination was carried out at the state-run Beliaghata ID Hospital on Sunday due to unavailability of vaccines. Even as it got 400 doses of Coviehield on Monday, the hospital has decided to reserve those for the second jab.“Till we start getting sufficient supply, we have decided to ration the stock for people coming to take the second dose,” said Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, vaccine centre supervisor at ID Hospital. Peerless Hospital had to stop vaccination for close to two hours as stock of Covishield ran out. The hospital got 30 Coxavin vials only around 12.30pm to resume the inoculation programme. “We could offer Covishield to only 21 as the second dose and many appointments had to be cancelled. We could start inoculating people with Covaxin only around 1pm once the vials arrived and ended up vaccinating 189 people,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. The state was allotted 21 lakh doses of Covieshield on paper about a week ago. But this consignment would not arrive before April 15. “Four lakh doses will be administered in a day if we do not scale down our operations,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/some-centres-shut-temporarily-others-ration-vials-in-wake-of-vaccine-shortage/articleshow/82037975.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Bulandshahr goes to polls in the fourth and last phase of the panchayat elections in the state. Meanwhile, an FIR under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, Epidemics Act and Disaster Management Act was registered against Yogesh Raj and three other named people along with 50-55 unnamed suspects at Syana police station for flouting norms during his campaign for the upcoming polls. In several of the videos of his campaign, Yogesh Raj, a resident of Nayabans village in Bulandshahr's Syana, along with hundreds of his supporters can be seen garnering support for his mother during a foot march through narrow lanes of the village. Yogesh Raj, who was once associated with Bajrang Dal and claimed to have parted ways now, was one of the main accused in the violence which had claimed two lives, including then Syana SHO Subodh Kumar Singh. Yogesh was arrested after the incident and was in jail for 10 months before he walked out on bail in October 2019. Sounding confident, he said that he has been getting massive support and is looking for an easy win. “Apart from two villages- Chingrawati and Dhaniyawali- which are Jat dominated, we have been getting massive support. We are looking at a landslide victory,” Yogesh said. Villages of Chingrawati, Mahav and Nayabans were the epicentre of the violence in 2018. A mob had gone on the rampage on December 3, 2018, after a cow carcass was found in a sugarcane field near Mahav village of Syana in Bulandshahr. Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh, posted at Syana police station, was killed in the attack. A youth, Sumit Kumar, also lost his life during the violence. The Chingrawati police outpost was also set on fire in the violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/out-on-bail-main-accused-in-bshahr-violence-fields-mother-for-panchayat-polls-police-register-fir-for-taking-out-rally/articleshow/82037108.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Border restrictions must to curb Covid spread in Telangana: Experts||HYDERABAD: With Covid cases increasing in the state, experts say it is high time that Telangana impose travel restrictions at state borders, especially along the Maharashtra and Karnataka borders, to control the spread of the virus. The state government has already indicated that the spread of the virus is owing to movement from these two places. It has also said that the influx of Covid-19 patients from Maharashtra, coming to Hyderabad for treatment, is further exacerbating the problem. Going by daily number of new cases, border districts such as Adilabad, Nirmal, Nizamabad, Kamareddy and Sangareddy are seeing rampant spread. For instance, the number of cases went up in Kamareddy from eight a week ago to 70 on Monday, going up nine times. Similarly, in Adilabad cases went up from 26 to 77 within a week. “Now, that Maharashtra is getting over 63,000 cases a day and we have an influx of patients from that state, Kerala and Tamil Nadu too, it is time that the government brings in some kind of restrictions on people from these states entering Telangana. While there is strict enforcement on international travellers, not much is happening in case of domestic travellers. This is one of the key reasons for a quick spread in recent days,” said Prof Subodh Kandamuthan, Director Centre for Healthcare Management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI). Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, national secretary, Indian Medical Association’s Academy of Medical Specialities, pointed out the need to filter incoming passengers. “It is advisable that borders be managed and people from areas where there is more spread are not allowed in. The Centre is already asking people to travel less. If infection is high around the border, then closure will be a good thing. At least we can control the spread,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/border-restrictions-must-to-curb-covid-spread-experts/articleshow/82037981.cms||Amrita Didyala

The party has planned over 2000 (two thousand) “Potho Sabhas” (street corner meetings) across the 40 urban seats from Tuesday onwards. Home Minister Amit shah will launch the “Potho Sabhas” series by addressing two in Dum Dum and Baranagar assembly constituencies on Tuesday. There will not be any change in the existing programmes, rallies and road shows. “The idea behind Potho Sabhas is to highlight the unique features of an urban area and in light of governance and infrastructure-related issues facing the city of Kolkata,” a senior BJP leader said and claimed that the street corner meetings will act like a massive public outreach campaign in and around Kolkata. “Various national and state leaders of BJP will reach out to the plethora of communities residing in Kolkata to share with them the party’s vision for Kolkata in specific and the state in general,” he said. The party has planned these meetings mostly in the evening hours in order to effectively reach out to the general public and keeping in mind the convenience of the people. “These meetings will take place in the evening as it will be easy to access areas such as housing societies and community centres, among others,” the BJP functionary said. A senior BJP member said Kolkata is the cultural capital of India and has always led the way in the advancement of literature, spirituality, music and cinema. “However, due to the neglect by state governments of the past, the city and its people have been facing many issues on multiple fronts such as crumbling infrastructure, inadequate healthcare facilities, lack of economic growth and growing concerns around safety of women, among others,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-to-hold-potho-sabhas-in-and-around-kolkata-with-eye-on-40-urban-seats/articleshow/82041194.cms||---
---||Goa||Cotigao man keeps cane farmers afloat, buys produce at more than govt price||Poinguinim: While farmers in Goa were struggling after Sanjeevani, the state’s only sugarcane processing factory at Dharbandora was shut down, a farmer in remote Cotigao in Canacona, Umesh (Daya) Gaonkar has turned a saviour. He also happens to be the sarpanch of Cotigao. Gaonkar came to the rescue of sugarcane farmers by starting a jaggery production unit for which he began purchasing cane from local farmers. Being a farmer himself, Gaonkar seemed to understand the plight of other food producers as him. So he started buying the raw sugarcane produce at Rs1,000 per quintal, a price higher than the government’s support price of Rs 650 per quintal. Gaonkar’s generosity does not end here. He also provides the waste generated after crushing the sugarcane, free of cost to the dairy farmers in his neighbourhood in Canacona, saving these milk production units the cost of purchasing cattle feed. Gaonkar is a resident of remote Yedda ward in Cotigao and took the courageous decision to set up the unit of producing jaggery and kaakam or liquid jaggery almost overnight. His small home-based unit now provides employment to eight locals. “To run the unit I buy the entire sugarcane produce from farmers in Cotigao and Gaondongrim, in Canacona at Rs1000 per quintal. About 20 farmers are tied up to my unit. Their harvest is about 200 tonnes,” said Gaonkar. The farmers were thrilled to learn of Gaonkar’s unit at a time when sugarcane produce in the state was standing in the fields, unharvested due to the Sanjeevani factory shutting down. The farmers are now upbeat and have decided to bring under cultivation even the area they had left fallow for some years. Meanwhile dairy farmers from the area, Manohar Velip, Vithoba Gaonkar and Gajanan Velip, who would have to bring cow-feed from Belagavi are benefiting from Gaonkar’s generosity as they can collect the sugarcane waste for free from CotiAgro Jaggery at Yedda. Gaonkar sells his jaggery in ‘Khotigao Mahila mart’ run by 25 women’s self-help groups (SHGs). “The product is being bought by buyers from Panaji, Mapusa, Dhargal, Margao, Quepem and even Karwar. This jaggery has multiple advantages as it is prepared at home using age-old methods as well as containers for storage. The liquid jaggery is particularly good for those suffering from low haemoglobin and cold. The jaggery is sold for Rs150 per kg and the liquid jaggery for Rs200 per liter,” said Gaonkar Gaonkar manufactures more than 600 kg of jaggery daily. Gaonkar began this home industry only in January this year and locals will be able to find employment here for 4-5 months upto May. “I spent about Rs5 lakh to set up this plant. So far we have had business of about Rs15 lakh,” he said. Gaonkar added that minister for tribal welfare, Govind Gaude sanctioned Rs15 lakh under the tribal cooperative marketing development federation of India limited’s (Trifed) Navnirman Vandhan Vikas Kendra - an initiative to generate livelihood for tribals through forest wealth or produce. The finished product will be sold out through Navnirman village organizations, sanctioned by NABARD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cotigao-man-keeps-cane-farmers-afloat-buys-produce-at-more-than-govt-price/articleshow/82031526.cms||Albert Fernandes

A day before, two party workers were tested Covid positive on Monday apart from six others including former state organising general secretary Makhan Singh who were tested positive during the last one week. As a result, the BJP state unit decided to sanitise the entire premises and impose unofficial lockdown till the situation returns to normal. "We have six to seven cases of Covid positive in the state head office. After the reports, we have decided to impose an unofficial lockdown in the office and appealed to the workers and leaders to communicate through digital platforms. We have also requested the guests to avoid visiting the office at least for ten days unless there is an urgency," BJP state office secretary Raghavendra Sharma, told TOI. With by-polls in Damoh in the last phase of campaigning, the BJP has asked all the districts heads and state office-bearers to remain their respective areas, except those who have been assigned duty in Damoh assembly constituency, to monitor and encourage party recommended programmes like vaccination drive and rural and urban connect to provide relief and assistance to Covid affected people. Sources said that cities like Indore and Bhopal have so far recorded an unprecedented spike in the Covid cases. With 923 cases in Indore and 824 cases in Bhopal on Sunday, the BJP has appealed to the workers to help the public in breaking the chain and control the community spread. The party has also asked the workers to assist the ministers in-charge of the districts who have been assigned responsibility by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to manage and control Covid related grievances, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/after-six-workers-test-positive-bjp-hq-closed/articleshow/82037989.cms||---

According to KMC sources, the civic body’s borough health officials have been asked to identify the most vulnerable areas of a borough where Covid-19 cases are steadily on the rise. Going by borough-wise reports that have been submitted before the chief municipal health officer, Covid-19 cases are being mostly reported from high-rises, housing complexes and crowded marketplaces.  These places are being closely monitored by the civic body’s Covid surveillance team in various boroughs. It is likely that the civic body will declare the containment zones after Assembly polls are over and a clear instruction from the state secretariat reaches the KMC headquarters. Though the KMC health department is yet to come up with a list of the probable containment zones, sources in the department said that markets in Burrabazar—Jorasanko belt, high-rises in Bhowanipore—Alipore belt and housing complexes and stand-alone buildings in large areas of Behala, Tollygunge, Garia, Jadavpur and some neighbourhoods located off EM Bypass are under scanner. The civic body is also going to open some of its safe homes in the city, predicting a surge in the number of Covid-19 patients. Primarily, they have planned to reclaim three floors of a multi-storey building at Anandapur off EM Bypass. While two of the three floors could be converted into a 400-bed safe home, the third floor would be reserved for doctors and paramedics. The KMC in July last year had opened its first safe home here. The KMC health department is also planning to set up safe homes at Kishore Bharati stadium off EM Bypass. The civic body is also keen on reopening a building near Science City, which was made a safe house last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/micro-c-zones-safe-homes-back-on-kmc-to-do-list/articleshow/82037990.cms||Saikat Ray

Those not wearing masks are trying to escape from police, while hawk-eyed authorities noticing them are making an attempt to catch them. Those who are caught are imposed a fine of Rs 1,000 but one may not be able to get away only by paying a fine. A tahsildar who went out to check how the mask rule is being implemented saw a man and his son walking on the road. At Amarachinta in Wanaparthy, revenue official Sindhuja noticed and father-son and stopped them. The man thought he had no reason to feel jittery as he had a mask on. But Sindhuja’s eyes were on the six-year-old boy who had no mask. The tahsildar made the man do sit-ups on the road to drive into his mind that he had to provide a mask to his son also. “Everyone should wear a mask or else they will face strict action,” the tahsildar told the people who saw this on Sunday. At LB Nagar in Hyderabad on Monday, a traffic policeman in a vehicle recovery van of Rachakonda police saw two youngsters coming in the wrong direction and not wearing a mask. The policeman quickly got down from the vehicle to nab the youngsters. Within a few seconds, the youth turned their vehicle and sped away giving the policeman little scope to catch them. In Medak, police stopped autos to check if the passengers were wearing masks and imposed fines on 15 passengers at Mambojipally. But, police are not having it easy. There were instances of people shouting at cops for wasting their time on the roads after they were stopped for not wearing a mask. In a video that is doing the rounds, a man was seen telling police that they should make a note of the vehicle number and come to his house and not stop him on the road. Police had to exercise patience as the man made unpalatable and objectionable remarks against cops in general.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mask-violators-police-play-cat-mouse-game/articleshow/82037988.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Not able to provide bed, remdesivir, tocilizumab, even option of other hospitals as all are full. If things continue like this, whole system will collapse,” wrote a doctor on his social media status. Little would he have imagined that this would go viral. A screenshot of the status by Dr Rahul Vasava was widely shared on social media. And heavyweight ruling BJP MLA Shailesh Mehta also shared it on his Facebook page giving it a further boost. When contacted, Vasava said that he had written the status as he was feeling helpless when he had to turn down a couple of his old patients. “I called up five or six hospitals to help them, but none had a vacant bed. I was feeling helpless that I could not do anything for them,” he said. Vasava said that he often worried about what would happen given the situation. “I have to send by staff with transportation to get oxygen cylinders. I worry what would happen if it got delayed on someday,” he said. The doctor, however, added that such frustration and feeling of helplessness was only temporary. “We know that we will have to work hard and keep going on despite all odds,” he said. Vasava pointed out that many in his fraternity were in a similar condition. Sources said that several doctors were of an opinion that the situation was very grim and if this continued they will also be helpless. “The government hospitals and large corporate hospitals are managing. Someone needs to look into the needs of the smaller hospitals. They are today treating a large number of patients,” said a doctor. President of Setu, the association of private hospitals in the city, Dr Krutesh Shah said that doctors often felt the crunch of resources. “But we need to fight with whatever we have on hand. We will have to keep our morale high else the entire system will collapse. The society too needs to ensure that it keeps up the spirits of doctors to ensure they keep battling it out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/doc-on-fb-feeling-helpless-for-patients/articleshow/82039183.cms||---

In the month of March alone, non-life insurers reported a 23% hike in collection of gross direct premium at Rs 19,299 crore as compared to the year-ago period at Rs 15,635 crore. However, when it comes to FY20, the non-life insurance players had logged a rise of nearly 12% in gross direct premium collection at Rs 1.89 lakh crore as compared to Rs 1.69 lakh crore in FY19. Industry experts attributed the low growth figures in FY21 to the slump in motor insurance business due to the lockdown in the first half of the fiscal and the overall impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The slump in motor business hit the overall growth as this segment contributes nearly 35% to the overall general insurance business in the country. As per an analysis by CARE Ratings, the growth in FY21 was primarily driven by the fire and health insurance segments. In FY 2020-21, among non-life players, the 25 general insurance companies clocked a 3.35% rise in collection of gross direct premium at Rs 1.70 lakh crore (Rs 1.64 lakh crore in FY20), five standalone health insurers logged Rs 15,720 crore (Rs 14,152 crore) and two specialised insurance players logged Rs 13,175 crore (Rs 10,437 crore in FY20). The standalone health numbers are not comparable due to takeover of Reliance Health Insurance portfolio by Reliance General Insurance and HDFC Ergo Health Insurance has been merged with HDFC Ergo General.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/non-life-insurers-log-5-rise-in-gross-direct-premium-collection/articleshow/82037996.cms||Swati Rathor

The alleged cheating took place last week, but due to consecutive bank holidays, he could not get transaction details immediately. The suspect claiming to be representative of a state-owned telecom company contacted Syed Kazim Ali Hashmi of Sadaf Colony, and requested him to verify his credentials so that his SIM card is not blocked. Falling prey to the trap, the elderly man who retired over a decade ago from treasury department, ended up sharing his bank account details. Before he could understand anything, he received multiple message alerts informing about the transactions from his two bank accounts. Later he found that a total of Rs 3.60 lakh have been transferred and withdrawn. Jinsi police station inspector Rakesh Mayekar told TOI, “The elderly man was cheated sometime last week, but the delay in bank transaction details delayed the registration of offence.” The officer said that already cyber police have carried out a preliminary probe in the case and gathered details. Following the incident, authorities have reiterated their appeal to the citizens asking them to not to share any bank details over phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pensioner-duped-of-rs-3-6l-over-phone-cops-file-case/articleshow/82036423.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Bulandshahr goes to polls in the fourth and last phase of the panchayat elections in the state. Meanwhile, an FIR under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, Epidemics Act and Disaster Management Act was registered against Yogesh Raj and three other named people along with 50-55 unnamed suspects at Syana police station for flouting norms during his campaign for the upcoming polls. In several of the videos of his campaign, Yogesh Raj, a resident of Nayabans village in Bulandshahr's Syana, along with hundreds of his supporters can be seen garnering support for his mother during a foot march through narrow lanes of the village. Yogesh Raj, who was once associated with Bajrang Dal and claimed to have parted ways now, was one of the main accused in the violence which had claimed two lives, including then Syana SHO Subodh Kumar Singh. Yogesh was arrested after the incident and was in jail for 10 months before he walked out on bail in October 2019. Sounding confident, he said that he has been getting massive support and is looking for an easy win. “Apart from two villages- Chingrawati and Dhaniyawali- which are Jat dominated, we have been getting massive support. We are looking at a landslide victory,” Yogesh said. Villages of Chingrawati, Mahav and Nayabans were the epicentre of the violence in 2018. A mob had gone on the rampage on December 3, 2018, after a cow carcass was found in a sugarcane field near Mahav village of Syana in Bulandshahr. Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh, posted at Syana police station, was killed in the attack. A youth, Sumit Kumar, also lost his life during the violence. The Chingrawati police outpost was also set on fire in the violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/out-on-bail-main-accused-in-bshahr-violence-fields-mother-for-panchayat-polls-police-register-fir-for-taking-out-rally/articleshow/82037118.cms||---

The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu) will get a machine each. The added facilities will help us to further scale up the testing,” he said. Chavan, who held a review meeting with public representatives, said the district currently has a contact tracing ratio of 17:8. “A total of 192 hospitals, including private ones, have nearly 20,500 beds available for Covid patients. The district has a smooth and regulated supply of Remdesivir injections. The supply of oxygen for medical purpose is happening smoothly by regulating the demand for industries,” he said. Aurangabad Zilla Parishad CEO Mangesh Gondawale said citizens should not hesitate to go for testing if they have symptoms. “The public representatives should help thet administration by spreading mass awareness about early benefits of testing and vaccination,” he said.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Districts run out of beds, seek railways’ Covid-care coaches||MUMBAI: Facing a severe shortage of Covid-19 beds, several districts have sought help from the Railways to get rail coaches that have been converted to isolation wards. Following a railway board directive in March 2020, Central Railway had set up 482 Covid care coaches at a cost of Rs 3.8 crore and Western Railway had transformed 410 coaches for a little over Rs 2 crore for use by the state government in case of an emergency. Both CR and WR gradually began reconverting these into normal coaches as the Covid threat abated and more passenger trains began running. But the recent surge in cases has loaded the health infrastructure, and the railways’ isolation coaches could prove useful. “We have 128 coaches for Mumbai division of the total 326 across our zones,” WR’s chief PRO Sumit Thakur said. Tribal dominated Nandurbar is the first district to get the coaches. The district, which has almost run out of Covid beds, has 24,810 cases with 7,338 patients under treatment. A total of 21 coaches have been made available. As per the agreed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) with the state government, air coolers will be provided in the coaches. Also, the roof of the coaches will be covered with grass cooling pads. However, senior district officials said with temperatures rising, these rail coaches will not be usable as they are non-AC. “We are adding more beds in the district and converting schools and hostels into Covid centres,” said an official. On the CR, 25 isolation coaches have been set aside in Mumbai division. Currently, nearly 70% of the isolation beds, 75% of ICU beds and 40% oxygen beds are occupied in the state. Even the Central team which visited the state to review Covid management has stated in its report that many districts were facing a shortage of medical infrastructure, including beds. In the modified Covid-care coaches, the two middle berths have been removed in each cabin and one Indian-style toilet has been converted into a bathroom. All coaches have the necessary medical equipment such as oxygen cylinders, blankets, medical supplies and sterilised berths. More than 5,000 Covid care coaches with up to 80,000 beds—16 beds in each coach—had been made available by the Indian Railways for use by the state governments for mild Covid cases, but they did not find many takers till date, except in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, according to the railway board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-dists-run-out-of-beds-seek-rlys-covid-care-coaches/articleshow/82039187.cms||Manthan K Mehta

Her parents have alleged they had been hounding her for dowry, which led to her death. The woman’s father-in-law and mother-in-law have been arrested while her husband and her brother-in-law, also booked, are on the run. The woman, Komal, lived in Muzaffarnagar's Datiyana village with her husband, Ashish, and in-laws. On Sunday, as she prepared to hang herself, her in-laws waited outside. In the video, she can be seen tying a noose around a beam lining the asbestos roof. She gasps once as she ties the blue stole around her neck, tightens it and tests the grip so it doesn’t give way. After one last check, she lets go and hangs herself as a man’s voice says, “Apne aap latak rahi hai (she hanged herself on her own).” The man’s voice is presumably that of her father-in-law. On Monday, they shared the video on social media, hoping it would go viral. It did. While confirming the video had been shot from outside the room where she hanged herself, SP (city) Arpit Vijayvargiya said, “They had tried to stop her from killing herself.” Her parents, however, had a different story to tell. Komal and Ashish got married in September 2019. “I had given Rs 5 lakh and a bike to his family at the time. But his father Devendra, mother Savita and brother Sachin were not happy. About six months ago, they beat up Komal and drove her out of the house. The elders of the village sent her back,” her father Anil Kumar wrote in the complaint to the police. “Two months ago, they started demanding Rs 1.2 lakh. They said they would get Ashish married to someone else if she could not come up with the dowry. All four of them got together and killed my daughter.” An FIR was lodged on Sunday, a day before the video went viral, against Ashish, his brother and his parents under sections 304B (dowry death), 498A (cruelty to married woman) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and under sections 3 (giving or taking dowry) and 4 (demanding dowry) of The Dowry Prohibition Act. Yashpal Singh, SHO of Chhapar police station, under whose jurisdiction the crime took place, said, “His parents have been arrested and will be produced before the magistrate.” Ashish and his brother Sachin are on the run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/in-laws-shoot-video-as-woman-hangs-herself-share-on-social-media-as-proof-of-innocence/articleshow/82037124.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Jewellers said that for the second consecutive year, the pandemic has forced their stores to remain shut on Gudi Padwa — traditionally considered an auspicious day to buy gold — on Tuesday.“While the falling prices of gold were expected to attract buyers in large numbers, we are forced to keep our stores shut due to Covid-related curbs on Tuesday. The loss of business during a major occasion such as the Gudi Padwa as well as the marriage season is a huge blow to us,” said Amar Varma, the treasurer of the jewellers association in Cidco-Hudco.The price of 24 karat gold has been in the range of Rs 47,031 to Rs 47,860 per 10gm on Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, 22 karat gold, which is widely used in jewellery making, was priced Rs 43,111-43,445 per 10gm. Besides gold, silver too has been witnessing a drop in prices. Kailash Shahane, another jeweller, said the option of online jewellery sale is yet to gain ground among buyers. “The present curbs that are in place cannot arrest the spread of Covid-19. The government should declare a complete lockdown to put a check on the rising number of cases instead of enforcing selective closure of commercial establishments,” he said. Jyoti Bedre, a homemaker, said her practice of buying gold on Gudi Padwa every year has been broken due to the pandemic situation. “Gold prices per tola (10 gram) had crossed the Rs 55,000-mark around a year ago. The current drop in prices was a golden opportunity to invest in the yellow-metal. But it will be missed due to the Covid outbreak,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/covid-takes-sheen-out-of-gold-buying-on-gudi-padwa-again/articleshow/82036435.cms||---

The team lead by Vijoy Kumar Singh, additional secretary and financial adviser, ministry of textiles, has submitted its report to the health ministry. The team had recently visited Chandigarh and held a meeting with UT administration, health department officials and municipal corporation officials. It had also visited the containment zones. Sources said the central team has recommended increasing contacting tracing from 15 persons of each positive case to 25. To contain the spread, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) had recently issued guidelines and allowed UTs, including Chandigarh, to impose local restrictions, and strictly enforce the ‘test-track-treat’ protocol, in their jurisdiction. The administration had then imposed night curfew in the city from 10.30 pm to 5 am. Highlighting on the ‘test-track-treat’ protocol, the home ministry had said the states and UTs, where the proportion of RT-PCR tests is less, should rapidly increase it to reach the prescribed level of 70% or more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/enhance-contact-tracing-heavy-testing-in-containment-zones-centre-tells-city/articleshow/82038006.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Recently, the department had sent a reminder to WII to provide technical support. UT chief conservator of forests (CCF) Debendra Dalai said a WII team will provide three-day training to officials from April 22 to 25. The department will then finalise the schedule to carry out the census. The department was to carry out the second census in April 2020, but the pandemic delayed the plan. The first wildlife census was carried out in the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary spread over an area of 26 sq km in the catchment area of Sukhna Lake in 2010. Being a season specific, the second wildlife census could not be carried out in 2020 as the best period to spot the animals had passed due to lockdown, said Dalai, and added that it was difficult to locate the animals in other seasons.

The integrated facility, which houses manufacturing, testing and supply chain functions, will hire 500 employees, it said. The facility, which is the company’s fifth manufacturing facility in India after Baddi, Daman, Sikkim and Mumbai, will significantly reduce India’s current import dependence for such testing kits, the company said. The new facility was virtually inaugurated by AP’s industries, commerce and IT minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy.

They said their anxiety levels had reduced to a great extent. They had been confused and could not concentrate on their studies when the decision was pending. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad’s announcement on Monday to postpone the higher secondary certificate (HSC, Std XII) and secondary school certificate (SSC, Std X) exams to May and June, respectively, has been a relief to both students and their parents. The education department is also writing to the CBSE, CICSE, IB and Cambridge boards requesting them to reconsider their exam dates. HSC student Sakshi Agarwal said, “We are finally clear about our future. It was indicative that the exam will not be held on the scheduled time table from April 23. But what would be the alternative or further decision about the exam was uncertain. Now that the minister has made this announcement, we are glad that we can plan our studies accordingly.” Many HSC students also prepare for the competitive exams including joint entrance exam (JEE) for engineering, medical, law, architecture, hotel management and other professional courses which are also lined up after the board exams. Students said they can now plan the studies for competitive exams and board exams with the state government giving a rough idea of when it would be conducted. Gaikwad said, “Given the current Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra, we have postponed the state board exams for SSC and HSC. The present circumstances are not conducive for holding exams. Your health is our priority.” Keeping the schedule of the entrance exams to professional courses in mind, the HSC exams will be held by the end of May, while SSC exams will be in June, it was announced by the minister. “We are closely monitoring the health situation. Fresh dates for these exams will be announced accordingly. The decision is the outcome of consultations with various stakeholders like the students, teachers, parents, elected representatives from across parties, academicians and tech giants in the wake of rising coronavirus cases,” Gaikwad added. During the consultations, various alternative assessment options were evaluated with the health, well-being and future of the students in mind. Postponing exams seemed to be the most pragmatic solution, she said. Principal Sujata Rege of a civic school in Chandannagar said, “Even though most of the students were prepared for the exam with mock tests and prelim exams conducted online by submitting answer sheets to the teachers, the situation outside is very risky. It is seen that the cases of paediatric Covid is on the rise and there are many infrastructure challenges that the administration is facing. So, the decision was ideal and expected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/assessment-options-under-study-for-hsc-ssc-pupils/articleshow/82038026.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Mumbai police will invoke provisions of Article 311 (2) of the Constitution to dismiss Waze. Article 311 deals with dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of those employed in civil capacities under the Union or a state. Under the article, the competent authority has power to dismiss an erring officer in the larger interest. If the authority is satisfied the official can be dismissed, they have the power to take action without conducting a departmental probe. “In the normal course the competent authority has to hold a departmental inquiry and get charges proved before dismissing an officer. But in some cases, this condition can be waived if it is likely that witnesses to be examined against such an officer are afraid of him or there is threat to life to give a statement because of the position held by him. So the officer can be dismissed,” said advocate Arvind Bandiwadekar who practices at MAT. “We have received the report from NIA on Waze’s role and invoking of UAPA. Waze was involved in anti-national activities (planting explosives), which is enough material to proceed for dismissal. We have started the process and are taking legal opinion,” said an IPS officer. Waze’s past including his involvement in the custodial death of 2002 blast accused Khwaja Yunus and suspension for 17 years will also be taken into account, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-to-be-dismissed-from-service-without-dept-probe/articleshow/82040093.cms||Ahmed Ali

Aadhti is the BJP legislator from Sadar seat in Hapur district. In the footage, a couple of men accompanying the MLA, including his gunner, can be seen roughing up a petrol pump staffer at the filling station within limits of Hapur dehat police station. The incident took place on Sunday evening. The petrol pump staffer, identified as Rohit Rawal, claimed the attack was unprovoked. “The MLA’s driver began claiming that there were complaints of short-fueling. I told him there could be a difference (in mileage) because of the hike in fuel prices in the recent past. The driver abused me and soon the gunner began roughing me up,” Rawal claimed. The MLA, on his part, alleged that the petrol pump staffer hurled abuses at him and misbehaved with his gunner following an argument over short-fueling. “I gave Rs 3,000 for the fuel but he (pump staffer) filled for Rs 2,500. When confronted, he began misbehaving. He hurled abuses and held my gunner by his uniform. I will file a complaint against him at the police station,” MLA Aadhti said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bjp-mlas-men-thrash-petrol-pump-staffer-probe-ordered/articleshow/82037136.cms||---

---||India||BJP to hold protests in Bengal against TMC candidate’s alleged anti-Dalit remark||NEW DELHI: On a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit out at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for being ‘tight-lipped’ over her party colleague Sujata Mondal Khan’s allegedly disparaging remarks against Dalits, BJP on Monday upped the ante against Trinamool Congress and announced to hold major protests against the party in the poll-bound state. The controversy, which erupted after Mondal recently equated the Dalit community with “beggars”, could be significant in the remaining four phases of polls in the state with 15 reserved (SC) seats due for polling. At a poll rally in Bardhamaan, the PM said Mamata Banerjee had insulted the SC community by remaining silent over offensive remarks of her party colleague. “Baba Sahab Ambedkar's soul must be pained listening to Didi's bitter words. April 14 is the birth anniversary of Baba Ambedkar and at such a time this insult is hurled upon him by Didi. No one can think that such statements can come from the land of Bengal,” Modi told the rally. He took a dig at Banerjee for calling herself Royal Bengal Tiger and asked whether any leader from TMC can give any statement against Dalits without her approval. "Didi calls herself Royal Bengal Tiger. Without Didi's approval, no one can give such a comment against our SC brothers and sisters. Our Dalit brothers were called beggars but Didi did not apologize and did not condemn," the PM said. In national capital, Rajya Sabha MP and party general secretary Dushyant Gautam led a delegation of Dalit MPs and approached the SC Commission seeking action against the Trinamool Congress and its leader. “What she (Khan) has said is deeply insulting. She said the scheduled castes are beggars by nature. The community is supporting BJP due to our welfare policies. What she has said is reflective of the TMC's and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's mindset," Gautam told reporters after meeting the SC Commission chairman Vijay Sampla. “West Bengal does not even have an SC commission where Dalits can lodge their complaints,” Gautam said, targeting Banerjee. He said the Modi government has worked for all sections of society without any discrimination, and that is why BJP is receiving support from every community. A BJP delegation under Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had on Sunday approached the Election Commission seeking action against TMC candidate Sujata Mondal Khan for her remarks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-to-hold-protests-in-bengal-against-tmc-candidates-alleged-anti-dalit-remark/articleshow/82041285.cms||---

The state earned Rs 11,743.99 crore from liquor sales in the last financial year, which is only 5.28% less compared to the previous year. In 2019-20, the sale of liquor had fetched the state exchequer Rs 12,398 crore, after deducting the operational cost, payment to the manufacturers, and other costs incurred by the Bevco and its profit margin. At least 52 days of liquor sales were lost in the previous financial year due to the Covid-19 lockdown. In terms of quantity, in 2019-20, the total consumption of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) in the state was 222.83 lakh cases, while in 2020-21, it closed at 193.3 lakh cases, showing a decrease of 29.53 lakh cases. However, the decrease in consumption of beer in 2020-21 was much more than the figures for 2019-20, showing that post-lockdown, IMFL had much more takers than beer and wine. While in 2019-20, the sale of beer in the state was 122.02 lakh cases, in 2020-21, it dropped to 76.7 lakh cases, marking a decrease of 45.32 lakh cases. The sale of IMFL had picked up in the last four months of the financial year, and the 35% sales tax imposed on it in May last year ensured that the overall revenue contribution to the state exchequer from liquor sales in 2020-21 did not drop much, vis-a-vis to the previous year. The sales figures in each of the last four months of the financial year had consistently been above Rs 1,200 crore. The figures for December and January were Rs 1,498 crore and Rs 1,466 crore respectively. The Bevco outlets and bar hotels were shut as part of the national lockdown in April last year. The Bevco outlets were reopened and sales resumed using BevQ token system from May 28. Despite the drop in quantity of IMFL and beer last year, the earnings did not drop much as the government had in May last year increased the sales tax by 35%. At present, the sales tax on IMFL is 237% for brands costing up to Rs 400 and 247% for brands that cost above Rs 400. In the last five years, the contribution from the liquor sales to the state exchequer had increased by Rs 2,200 crores.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-earns-rs-11-7k-cr-despite-losing-52-days-to-lockdown/articleshow/82038027.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Despite surge in Covid cases, insurance claims at just 40% of peak||KOLKATA: Covid cases in Kolkata and the rest of Bengal may have crossed last year’s peak figure, but health insurance claims have been significantly lower than the highest applications made in July, August and September during the first wave. The insurance claims for Covid treatment in hospitals in the first 10 days of April have touched 30%-40% of last-year’s peak application figures. In March, it was 10%-15%. Despite the substantial rise in Covid cases in the first 10 days of April, insurance claims had not increased proportionately, experts said. They felt the reasons could be home quarantine and admission to government hospitals. In private hospitals, which had also been witnessing a surge in cases in April, the number of critical cases had been fewer, experts said. Most claims, said insurers and third-party administrators, were from Maharashtra and Gujarat. Jyotirmoy Kundu, network manager of Heritage TPA, said a lot of Covid patients were getting admitted to government facilities. “There has been a significant jump in Covid numbers in the past five-six days, but the number of insurance claims has been 30%-40% of the peak application figures,” he said, adding they were receiving intimations from patients in government facilities as well. Echoing him, Chiranjib Bera of Raksha TPA said insurance applications jumped in the past week but it was still 40% of the highest applications last year. “A lot of people are opting for home quarantine, and so, the claims are still limited. We do not know what will happen after 15 days but as of now it is lower than the peak,” he added. Sophia Singh, GM (health) of National Insurance, pointed out Bengal saw a rise in claims compared to that in December-January-February.  “Most applications are from Maharastra,” she added. According to her, the sale of Corona Kavach policy, which increased the most in December, is coming down. Sanjay Datta, chief-underwriting, claims and reinsurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, agreed: “There is no major inflow of claims from Bengal, unlike from Maharashtra. Vaccination will play a crucial role in reducing the impact of the second wave,” he said.  Going by cashless intimations, Dutta added there were 70 in December last year, but 23 till March 29 this year. Even Bhaskar Nerurkar, head health claims of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, said after mid-February, there was a 50% jump in insurance claims though most were in western parts.  “The Kolkata number has so far been the least among metros,” he said, adding the average ticket size of claims for Covid had gone down by 5%. But Prasun Sikdar MD & CEO ManipalCigna Health Insurance Co, said case rise had pushed up claims as well as demand for health cover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/despite-case-surge-insurance-claims-at-just-40-of-peak/articleshow/82038036.cms||---

Was Coronavirus not there at that time? Was Kumbh attended by just five people? If not, then why Muslims are being asked to ensure the attendance of only five people in mosques during the Holy month of Ramadan — are some of the arguments that a delegation of the Muslim community has made to the UP government in a memorandum handed over to the Meerut district magistrate. With a sudden surge in the number of cases, notices were pasted on several mosques in the city, directing them not to hold namaz with more than five devotees at a time. Sheher Qazi Jainus Sajidin said, “We have appealed to the UP government and the Meerut DM to allow us to have at least 100 devotees praying at mosques at a time during Ramadan. We will observe all Covid guidelines responsibly.” The delegation also met the divisional commissioner with their request. Kotwali circle officer Arvind Chaurasia said, “We are only following the UP government guidelines issued in the backdrop of a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases.” Qazi Sajidin further said, “It’s our appeal to the chief minister to give a second thought to the order and allow at least 100 people to offer namaz together in the mosques with social distancing norms in place. We will be utterly grateful.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/was-holi-played-by-just-five-people-if-not-then-why-just-five-people-to-be-allowed-in-mosques-for-ramzan-prayers/articleshow/82037148.cms||Sandeep Rai

Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza has said that the new municipal council will be women dominated, and expects all of them to win from the panel Mapusa Development Front, which has the support of BJP The panel has 13 new faces out of 20. The panel also has a former chairperson, one former vice-chairperson and four ex-councillors from the previous panel contesting the polls. The panel has also given tickets to four youth candidates. “This time, the post of chairperson is being reserved for women, and I have full faith in the people of Mapusa that they will elect all eleven women from this panel. Mapusa, being the trendsetter, will this time set the record of being the first female dominated council in the entire state of Goa,” said D’Souza. Convenor of the front, Rupesh Kamat declared the panel at the party office at Mapusa. “As Mapusa is the capital and hub of Bardez, the results of the election in Mapusa will also have a strong influence on the other municipalities,” said Parsekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/11-women-in-bjp-backed-panel-for-mapusa-civic-polls/articleshow/82039310.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The teachers have a challenge of creating multiple question sets and innovative ways of creating personalised assignments for students to avoid any scope of discussing or copying each other’s assignments. The schools are following the state government’s guidelines to pass students in standards IX and XI based on home-based tests and online assignments to give them grades for promotion to the next class. Geography teacher Asmita Marathe, said, “For our subject we have come up with many innovative ways to assess the students. We have small tests of 20 to 25 marks and we are asking students to write their experiences of a certain region they have travelled in, to do some research work on the internet, for instance, on rocks and give us short write-ups based on their understanding. Similarly, in civics we are asking students to take up any recent polls and analyse them and more such interesting and innovative ways have come up in school discussions.” Many schools have also given assignments to students which they need to complete in foolscap pages and treat them like an exam. They must attempt the question paper and send the set to school. Many schools have even given a time period to submit the papers in school. “We have been given a time duration to attempt the paper at home, and once it is over, the paper has to be submitted to school within two to three hours,” a teacher said. Many schools have been able to conduct practical sessions for a brief period when the schools were allowed to open since January. The performance of students during this period was also noted and will be added to the final mark sheet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/assignments-for-stds-ix-xi-to-move-to-next-class/articleshow/82039195.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Hyderabad||Tax case on surrogacy in Hyderabad throws light on ‘exploitation’ of poor||MUMBAI/HYDERABAD: It seemed like an open and shut case involving non-compliance of tax deduction at source (TDS) obligations. But members of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal – Hyderabad bench, have found themselves staring at the “heinous exploitation of the wombs of poor and destitute surrogate mothers”.  It has directed the tax commissioner to share details with the secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Welfare (both at the central and state level) so that such practices are curbed. The moot issue in the tax litigation covering a period of four years – from financial year 2009-10 -- was whether Hyderabad-based Kiran Infertility Centre (the appellant) was liable to deduct tax at source on surrogacy payments. A bulk of these payments were made to a consultant – T Sesha Sai vice-president of a women’s welfare NGO, Amma Women Welfare Society (Amma), that supplied surrogate mothers and/or egg donors to the clinic. Amma was paid Rs 4 lakh for a single pregnancy and Rs 4.5 lakh for carrying twins. A contract between the two parties was entered into on May 10, 2012. The contract provided that all payments would be made to Sai (his personal account) on behalf of the NGO. He would then release it to surrogate mothers. As far as the income-tax (I-T) dispute was concerned, the ITAT held that the payments by the clinic to Sai, were covered by section 194-C and the clinic was required to deduct tax at source. As TDS obligations had not been met, the ITAT held that the I-T officer had rightly applied the provisions of section 40(a)(ia) and denied as a business deduction in the hands of the clinic, a sum of Rs 71.23 lakh, Rs 3,35 crore, Rs 89.02 lakh and Rs 70.50 lakh, during the respective financial years. This in turn would result in higher taxable income and consequently higher tax payments by the clinic. But it is the sworn statements made by Sai on October 23, 2013, that had the ITAT bench see red. For instance, while he obtained Rs 4 lakh or Rs 4.5 lakh from the clinic, he paid only Rs 2 lakh to every surrogate mother as instalments. And when questioned why these were deposited into his personal account and not the NGO’s, he said that it was because Amma was set up only in 2012, while he had been providing surrogate mothers to the centre since 2008. The practice of depositing the money into his personal account, he added, continued. "...As most of the surrogate mothers do not have any bank accounts and they are required to be kept under strict discipline, the money payable to them is being paid to me and I am also paid by Kiran Infertility Centre towards maintenance expenses of the surrogate mothers,” he stated. When questioned on the lower payment made to surrogate mothers, Sai said that he had to pay Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 to middle men who helped him contact willing women, and also incurred other expenses such as that of cooks, drivers, to name a few. The ITAT in its order has stated, “...all this arrangement adopted between the assessee (clinic) and its payee Sai, acting for the NGO, speaks volumes about the mechanism adopted; more particularly from the latter’s side, not only exploiting the poor surrogate mothers but also proving clear cut cheating of the female wombs…” “These parties have done nothing else but exploited the poor and destitute surrogate mothers without even paying the adequate compensation,” the ITAT observed. While maintaining that all money towards surrogate mothers were deposited to Amma’s account, post its creation in 2012, Dr Samit Sekhar, executive director of Kiran Infertility maintained that there are no restrictions, under ICMR’s relevant guidelines, on depositing money into the account of an individual entity (be it an advocate, social worker etc), if he/she is responsible for taking care of a surrogate. “On the TDS issue, surrogate mothers do not to fall under any sections applicable to TDs under the I-T Act...We have decided to appeal against the ITAT order in the Telangana High Court,” he said. Claiming that the tribunal, while hearing the recent case, did not bring up the exploitation issue, Sekhar said, “We were not even given an opportunity to be heard. If it was brought to our notice during the recent hearing, we could have provided the necessary explanation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tax-case-on-surrogacy-in-city-throws-light-on-exploitation-of-poor/articleshow/82038018.cms||Lubna Kably

---||Chandigarh||Jain rejects ‘2nd term mayor’ post, exposes rift in Cong||Mohali: Former senior deputy mayor Rishab Jain has refused to become the mayor for the second half of the term of the municipal corporation (MC), exposing infighting in the Congress that could have been one of the reasons behind the delay in announcing the elections. “It is a one-sided decision. The cabinet minister has made his own family member as mayor while ignoring senior Congress leaders like me and my wife Raj Rani Jain, a four-time councillor in a row. They have also not offered any post to women office bearers,” said the three-time councillor. “I will not accept the mayor’s post in the second half of the term. I deserved it today but it was given to a first-timer. Jeeti Sidhu will only be a stamp mayor whereas the cabinet minister will be real mayor behind the curtains,” he alleged. “I and my wife have been serving the Congress since 1998. We as a couple have won maximum tenures as councilors than anyone else. We believed that the party would announce the name of the senior most councilor for the post of mayor but the final decision came at behest of the MLA.” Jain along with his wife Raj Rani Jain, a four-time councilor, left the ceremony after taking oath and the mayoral election. They were not there during the installation ceremony of the mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. On the other hand, cooperation and jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the decision to divide the mayoral post was taken to keep all workers in the loop and not to make anyone unhappy. Sidhu said, “We are yet to decide on a change in the deputy mayor’s post.” Holistic devp top priority: Jeeti Sidhu Newly-elected mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu alias Jeeti Sidhu said he would work hard for the development of the city without any discrimination. “Holistic development of Mohali is my top priority,” he said. P2 Opnn walks out Opposition councillors on Monday staged a walkout after taking oath and did not participate in the mayoral elections. Led by former deputy mayor Manjit Singh Sethi, the 13 councillors said “there is no point in wasting time as they will not be heard”. “We are adopting a wait-and-watch policy as we know the Congress will break apart.

The big cats had strayed into a sugar cane farm in the Kannad taluka.The incident occured at Mauje Jawali village, where two cubs were spotted in a sugar cane farm on Sunday. Subsequently, the forest department was alerted. Upon reaching the spot, authorities found only one cub. Another had already been shifted to a safe place by the female leopard. Forest guard M A Shaikh said, “The two-week-old cub that was left behind was found in distress. We fed it, but it couldn’t have survived without the mother,” he said. Later, the forest department placed the cub in a cushioned container in the same sugar cane farm. The locals were requested not to visit the spot till further orders.“We were sure that the female leopard will revisit the farm in search of her cub. In order to keep a close watch, cameras were installed around the spot. As expected, the mother came to the farm on Sunday night and took the second cub. Everything was captured by the cameras,” Shaikh said.A forest department team, including assistant conservator S U Shinde, range forest officers Annasaheb Pehrekar, Anand Gayake and C M Mahajan among others reached the spot on Monday morning to collect cameras and confirm the reunion of the mother leopard with her cub. Honorary wildlife warden Kishor Pathak said sugar cane farms are perceived as safe breeding spots by leopards. “The sugar cane farms are dense and there is little or no movement of humans till the harvest time. These farms are irrigated regularly, offering apt temperature conditions for leopards to breed,” he said.Leopards are protected under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and killing them is an offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/forest-dept-helps-reunite-leopard-cub-mom/articleshow/82036455.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Vadodara||Drug racketeers sold 50 injections in a month, say cops||Vadodara: Investigations into the racket of selling remdesivir drug for a premium revealed that the accused had sold over 50 bottles within a month. The prevention of crime branch (PCB) sleuths said that they detained two more persons, Krunal Patel and Jignesh Patel, in connection with the racket.“Krunal works for a private hospital and Jignesh works in medical staff of a private engineering firm. The accused duo used to sell remdesivir drugs in the black market. They were in touch with the other two accused Dr Dhiren Nagora and Rahul Valand,” said J J Patel, PCB police inspector said.“The gang has sold about 50 remdesivir vials within a month as demand for the drug was very high. They used to tamper with the medical prescriptions of the patients to get more drugs from the medical stores. But we are investigating how they got hold of so many bottles,” Patel added.The police said that the gang also used to buy the drugs in the black market and then sell them at an even higher price to the needy. PCB had busted the racket on Sunday after it arrested Nagora by setting a trap. The cops had sent a decoy customer to buy remdesivir from Nagora after fixing a meeting with him in Raopura.The police seized one bottle of remdesivir from Nagora who led them to another accused Valand. Both Nagora and Valand knew each other as they had worked together in a private hospital. They joined hands and began selling these injections in the open market for Rs 7,500 to Rs 9,000 apiece. The police is trying to ascertain if any more persons are involved in the racket.Drug siphoned from export stockThe cops visited Ahmedabad-based company whose remdesivir was seized from one of the accused. “The company makes the drug but it exports the entire stock. The drug must have been siphoned from the supply chain and made its way to the black market. We are questioning the accused about it,” said J J Patel, PCB police inspector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/drug-racketeers-sold-50-injections-in-a-month-say-cops/articleshow/82039201.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Non-essential stores shut till April 14, shopowners wait for fresh directives||PUNE: The Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP) had decided to re-open non-essential shops on Monday but later decided against it following an appeal from the authorities. The FTAP on Monday said that shops will continue to remain shut till the state government decides on fresh restrictions likely to be announced in the next two days. Fatehchand Ranka, the FTAP president, said, “A meeting was held on Monday in which it was decided to keep the shops shut for the next two days till April 14. It is likely that the government will come out with fresh restrictions on April 14.” The traders had announced on Friday to reopen the shops on Monday following which deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar urged the local authorities and traders to discuss the issue. A meeting was held late on Sunday night in which the local authorities, including divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao and the police, appealed to the traders not to open the shops due to increasing number of Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, police beefed up bandobast on Laxmi road and other locations on Monday morning in view of the possibility of opening of non-essential shops. The establishments, however, remained closed barring some places in the suburban areas and parts of Pimpri where hardware stores were open. The non-essential shops have been shut since last week. The traders have opposed the move, claiming that it will lead to huge financial loss for them. Crowd at closed liquor outlets There was a rush outside liquor shops on Monday as customers expected shops to be open. Shopkeepers, however, said the across-the-counter sale of liquor was not allowed and only home delivery was permitted, provided all rules were followed. A liquor shop owner from Shivajinagar said, “Customers gathered outside shops, but most were closed on Monday. We have been told to conduct RT-PCR tests of delivery personnel. Many shops are yet to complete these tests,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/non-essential-stores-shut-till-april-14-shopowners-wait-for-fresh-directives/articleshow/82038032.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Goa||Cotigao man keeps cane farmers afloat, buys produce at more than govt price||Poinguinim: While farmers in Goa were struggling after Sanjeevani, the state’s only sugarcane processing factory at Dharbandora was shut down, a farmer in remote Cotigao in Canacona, Umesh (Daya) Gaonkar has turned a saviour. He also happens to be the sarpanch of Cotigao. Gaonkar came to the rescue of sugarcane farmers by starting a jaggery production unit for which he began purchasing cane from local farmers. Being a farmer himself, Gaonkar seemed to understand the plight of other food producers as him. So he started buying the raw sugarcane produce at Rs1,000 per quintal, a price higher than the government’s support price of Rs 650 per quintal. Gaonkar’s generosity does not end here. He also provides the waste generated after crushing the sugarcane, free of cost to the dairy farmers in his neighbourhood in Canacona, saving these milk production units the cost of purchasing cattle feed. Gaonkar is a resident of remote Yedda ward in Cotigao and took the courageous decision to set up the unit of producing jaggery and kaakam or liquid jaggery almost overnight. His small home-based unit now provides employment to eight locals. “To run the unit I buy the entire sugarcane produce from farmers in Cotigao and Gaondongrim, in Canacona at Rs1000 per quintal. About 20 farmers are tied up to my unit. Their harvest is about 200 tonnes,” said Gaonkar. The farmers were thrilled to learn of Gaonkar’s unit at a time when sugarcane produce in the state was standing in the fields, unharvested due to the Sanjeevani factory shutting down. The farmers are now upbeat and have decided to bring under cultivation even the area they had left fallow for some years. Meanwhile dairy farmers from the area, Manohar Velip, Vithoba Gaonkar and Gajanan Velip, who would have to bring cow-feed from Belagavi are benefiting from Gaonkar’s generosity as they can collect the sugarcane waste for free from CotiAgro Jaggery at Yedda. Gaonkar sells his jaggery in ‘Khotigao Mahila mart’ run by 25 women’s self-help groups (SHGs). “The product is being bought by buyers from Panaji, Mapusa, Dhargal, Margao, Quepem and even Karwar. This jaggery has multiple advantages as it is prepared at home using age-old methods as well as containers for storage. The liquid jaggery is particularly good for those suffering from low haemoglobin and cold. The jaggery is sold for Rs150 per kg and the liquid jaggery for Rs200 per liter,” said Gaonkar Gaonkar manufactures more than 600 kg of jaggery daily. Gaonkar began this home industry only in January this year and locals will be able to find employment here for 4-5 months upto May. “I spent about Rs5 lakh to set up this plant. So far we have had business of about Rs15 lakh,” he said. Gaonkar added that minister for tribal welfare, Govind Gaude sanctioned Rs15 lakh under the tribal cooperative marketing development federation of India limited’s (Trifed) Navnirman Vandhan Vikas Kendra - an initiative to generate livelihood for tribals through forest wealth or produce. The finished product will be sold out through Navnirman village organizations, sanctioned by NABARD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cotigao-man-keeps-cane-farmers-afloat-buys-produce-at-more-than-govt-price/articleshow/82031556.cms||Albert Fernandes
---||Kochi||Deaths in Ekm not related to vaccination: AEFI panel||Kochi: Incidents of three deaths due to Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) have been reported in Ernakulam since the Covid-19 vaccination for persons above 60 began. Two severe cases including that of a healthcare worker were also reported in the district. They were later discharged from the hospital. The deceased were above 70 and had been inoculated only a few days before. All three did not develop any side effects of vaccination. They suffered cardiac arrest and died before reaching the hospital. “The three had comorbidities and were under treatment for cardiac ailments. One was from the Panthapilly area, and the others were Muvattupuzha and Kolencherry natives. “The severe cases were in the age group of 50-51. They were also suffering from comorbidities. The state government is conducting a study into the AEFI incidents. But we cannot conclude that all these three incidents were related to vaccination," said Dr MG Sivadas, district nodal officer for Covid vaccination. He added that an AEFI committee had examined the post mortem reports and found that the deaths were not due to vaccination. One person died on April 1 and others in March. "One of them had worked as usual in the morning on the day of death," said Dr Sivadas. The monthly analysis report submitted to the district collector has mentioned the incidents of AEFI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/deaths-in-ekm-not-related-to-vaccination-aefi-panel/articleshow/82038071.cms||T C Sreemol

The victim, Abhijit Shejwal (27), is undergoing treatment at Sassoon General Hospital. The Airport police said his condition was stable. Senior inspector Gajanan Pawar said on Monday, “Shejwal and the suspects — all relatives — are neighbours but there is an old dispute between them for eight years. Around 7.30pm on April 10, Shejwal stepped out of his residence and stood outside the house of one of the suspects, Santosh Khandve. Subsequently, a dispute started between them over the issue of Shejwal waiting there.” Pawar said, “After the dispute between Shejwal and Khandve became heated, the latter’s other family members and relatives joined him in the row. The suspects thrashed the milkman with sickle, iron rod and stick. They also attacked his mother for intervening in the dispute.” He said, “We arrested Santosh Khandve (27), Sadhu Khandve (50), Raju Khandve (45) and Prasad Deokar (29) under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act, Maharashtra Police Act and Criminal Law Amendment Act.

That was June 21, 2020, three days after he was reported missing by the crew of the Liberian-flagged oil tanker ‘MT Serengeti’. Late Sambit Majumder’s wife Jayati (in blue) after the body was brought to their Bansdroni homeTwo weeks later, just as the family was coming to terms with their loss, came the shocker that his body had been found floating near the coast in Taiwan’s Taitung County. That was July 2 and that’s when Jayati’s struggle to bring back her husband’s mortal remains began. That struggle ended on Monday when her 50-year-old husband’s mortal remains finally reached their Bansdroni home. Sambit’s body was cremated at Keoratala crematorium around 3.30 pm with his wife performing the last rites in the presence of Sambit’s friends, family members and relatives. Later, the ashes were immersed by her son at Judges’s Ghat. It took three separate DNA tests involving Sambit’s son and mother, and continuous coordination with the authorities in Taiwan, for the body to be identified as that of Sambit. The Taitung County prosecutor’s office finally arranged for the repatriation of the body with the help of the Indian external affairs ministry through the India-Taipei Association, which is the representative office of India in Taiwan. “I will finally get the time to reflect and come to terms with living without him for the rest of my life. Now my only focus is our son,” Jayati told TOI after the cremation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mariners-body-reaches-home-after-10-months/articleshow/82038064.cms||Abhinay Dey

---||Pune||Pune: Glut of farm produce at Gultekdi post-shutdown; prices stay steady||PUNE: The Gultekdi market yard for vegetables, fruits, flowers and grocery items recorded an excess intake of all farm produce on Monday, following the first weekend lockdown. An official from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) said the farmers thronged the market with their produce as the market witnessed 1,500 vehicles, as against the normal daily arrivals of 800 to 850 vehicles. Madhukant Garad, chief administrator of the APMC, Pune, said, “We got 32,638 quintals of agriculture produce, including leafy vegetables, onion, potato and fruits. Last Monday, we had received 24,700 quintals of the same. Today (Monday), it was 7,938 quintals more than last Monday. This is adequate to meet Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad’s requirements. We expect vegetable prices to remain stable in local mandis.” Rates of all vegetables and fruits remained stable. Onion was sold in the Rs5 to Rs12 per kg range and potato was also sold in the range of Rs6 to Rs16 per kg. Rates of leafy vegetables were also in the normal bracket. A bunch of coriander was sold in the Rs5 to Rs12 range, fenugreek was in the Rs7 to Rs12 range and spinach was in the Rs4 to Rs10 bracket. Talking about the crowd management, Garad said, “We have banned domestic purchase at the market, in view of the increasing crowd here. Also, small-time vendors, who sell the produce on handcarts and set up stalls in the market, too have been stopped. Restaurants on our campus have been told to provide parcel service.” Shivlal Bhosale, a commission agent, said, “It will be a difficult task for the administration to control the crowd at the market as thousands of them will be working together daily.” A section of the commission agents said that the APMC could resort to last year’s strategy of running each section on alternate days. “The measure had controlled the crowd significantly in the market,” a commission agent said. While another agent said last year’s measure would go against the farmers as they wouldn’t be able to sell their harvest quickly. “Many farmers could not sell their produce last year because of this system,” the agent said. Wholesale rates of flowers remain stable Rates of flowers remained stable in Gultekdi’s flower markets on Monday, said Bala Sewale, head of the flower section. “There was adequate supply of all flowers. Hence, there was no change in the rates. Marigold flowers, which were in demand because of the upcoming Gudi Padwa celebrations, were sold in the range of Rs40 to Rs45 per kg,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/glut-of-farm-produce-at-gultekdi-post-shutdown-prices-stay-steady/articleshow/82038094.cms||Sandip Dighe

A patient from Kashmir fainted and was shifted to emergency after some delay. The guard on duty did not call up the doctor until his photos were clicked by team TOI. Dr Navin Pandey, hospital administration, said, “It’s a part of their (security guard) training to transfer patients to the emergency. As they are contractual workers, someone new might have come. We will ensure it does not happen again.” However, a security official said, “The patient had epilepsy fits. He was soon put on a stretcher and rushed in an ambulance to the emergency. There was no delay.” But a bystander claimed no help was offered to even call the doctors from the OPD. “He was shifted to emergency and is being taken care of,” said Prof Vivek Lal, head of the neurology department. The closure of the OPDs was announced owing to the spike in the Covid cases. Prof Anil Gupta, medical superintendent, PGI, said, “The decision was taken in the larger interest of health care workers and patients. We understand the challenges non-Covid patients will face. But we have gynaecology, radiotherapy department and other essential services operational for them along with telemedicine services.” Officials said they have been using microphones to announce the suspension of OPDs. Follow-up patients will have to use telemedicine services only. Though more than 40 lines have been opened, it takes at least 20-25 minutes per patient to be given telemedicine consultation as compared to five minute in a walk-in OPD. “My father developed gastroenterology problem and was shifted from the OPD to the emergency. We have come from Mandi in Himachal Pradesh,” said a patient’s relative, who had been called after telemedicine consultation. He said, “It took us longer to get the appointment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/patient-faints-as-many-still-come-to-pgi-despite-opds-suspension/articleshow/82038043.cms||Shimona Kanwar

On an average, the state conducted 17,529 tests per day against the target of 50,000 from April 1 to 11. A total of 1,92,814 tests have been done in Haridwar in the last 11 days against the target of 5,50,000.

---||Vadodara||Covid infecting co-morbid kids aged 5 years and below||Vadodara: As the second wave of Covid-19 has started infecting more and more children, paediatricians at the government hospital are witnessing a new trend. Kids below the age of five with co-morbid conditions are getting infected from Covid-19 and requiring hospitalisations. However, the silver lining is that infection in kids is not as rapid as in adults and an estimated 80% of them are getting managed through home isolation only. “At this juncture, we are seeing more kids below the age of five who require paediatric admission. These include newborns, infants and toddlers with co-morbidities,” said Dr Sheila Aiyer, professor and head of Department of Paediatrics at SSG Hospital. The department has had kids like three-and-a-half-year-old Purab Nishrata, who successfully recovered from Covid-19 even as he was suffering from Wilms’ tumour, a rare kidney cancer. “We have a four-year-old kid suffering from cerebral palsy, another suffering from down syndrome – in short, those children who have development challenges. Similarly, we are getting kids suffering from severe acute malnutrition and tuberculosis of brain. All of them are under five years,” said Dr Aiyer. Most of these children are believed to have got infected from close contacts – parents, neighbours or elders within the family. “The newborns have definitely got infected from their adults. Like in adults, the underlying condition is that kids with co-morbidities are more vulnerable to get infected and their general condition can worsen,” she said. Earlier, a majority of Covid-19 paediatric patients were limited to city areas. “Now, it is no longer an urban phenomenon. We are getting cases from Dahod, Limkheda, Panchmahals and Chhota Udepur apart from those in and around Vadodara,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/covid-infecting-co-morbid-kids-aged-5-years-and-below/articleshow/82039227.cms||Prashant Rupera

He said that some inmates at the Kopargaon sub-jail were found infected by Covid-19, and were shifted to neighbouring prisons. To decongest the Kopargain facility, around 60 inmates were shifted. Nashik Road Central Prison received a batch of 20 such inmates. Wagh said that they have has been conducting all the necessary screenings of the new inmates. Of the 20 prisoners that were transferred to Nashik Road prison, ten were found positive.The Nashik Road jail authorities are taking all the necessary precautions to ensure that the infection does not come inside the jail where close to 2,600 undertrials and convicts are lodged.Owing to the spike in cases across the district and the state, the jail authorities have also stopped letting relatives of the inmates meet them in prison. “Every new inmate is screened for Covid-19 before letting him inside the prison,” Wagh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ten-inmates-shifted-from-kopargaon-jail-to-nashik-prison-test-ve/articleshow/82036485.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Kolkata||As sun sets on Mitra, one more N Kol single screen may be replaced by supermarket||Kolkata: The iconic Mitra cinema on Bidhan Sarani has finally been sold off to a retail chain after an almost uninterrupted run of nine decades. Many in the film industry had hoped that last-ditch attempts would be made to revive the single-screen cinema, which had shut down in 2019, but the pandemic proved to be too big a blow and the property was sold off. Though there is no official confirmation, the buzz in the Hatibagan stretch is that the once-popular cinema might be turned into a supermarket. The hall’s former proprietor, Dipen Mitra (77), who called it his baby, said, “We sold it in December last year to Baazar Retail.” Old-timers remembered Dipen arriving at the hall in crisp, white dhoti-kurta at 7am and leaving only after the night show, turning off the main switch. The cinema ran films of Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak and Buddhadeb Dasgupta. Uttam Kumar’s ‘Deya Neya’ was a top Bengali grosser. Among popular Hindi films were ‘Guide’, ‘Phool Aur Patthar’, Amitabh Bachchan-starrer ‘Agneepath’, ‘Haati Mere Saathi’ and more recently,‘Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge’ and ‘Simba’. When TOI contacted Tejas Shah, VP of Baazar Kolkata, about the future of the hall and plans for a supermarket, he said, “It is all in the drawing-board stage. We have not yet decided anything.” Industry insiders found it heart-rending as Mitra’s red seats, sound system and photographs were sold off one by one. Last week, the screen was sold to an old Tollywood hand. “I have folded and kept it in a suitcase. Single-screen owners in the suburbs often want to replace their old screens,” the buyer said. A walk down Bidhan Sarani, which was once home to nine single-screen theatres, now only has space for memories. Around 500m from Mitra was Sree; established in 1936, the hall has turned into a mall. Uttara, which was built in 1935, metamorphosed into Uttara market. Radha cinema, thrown open in 1954, has made way for Baazar Kolkata, while Darpana stands like a relic. Even Rupbani, opened in 1932, has become a mall. The only two single-screen theatres on Bidhan Sarani still functional are Minar and Star. Bina is being renovated. Initially named Chitra, Mitra opened on December 20, 1930, with ‘Srikanta’. “New Theatres ran it till 1963. There is no one in old Kolkata who doesn’t know about Chitra. On Poila Baishakh of 1963, the hall was renamed Mitra,” Dipen said. Curtains came down in April 2019, after the screening of ‘Kesari’. Poor health, next generation’s disinterest in cinema business and dwindling ticket sales were cited as reasons for the closure. Industry insiders said Dipen was not keen on the shutdown. A lot of investment had been made to renovate the theatre, change the transformer and upgrade the sound system. There are rumours about offers from a cine chain, but Dipen said, “It is a painful chapter of my life. I don’t want to discuss this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/as-sun-sets-on-mitra-one-more-n-kol-single-screen-may-be-replaced-by-supermarket/articleshow/82038101.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

News galore on the contrary is purely speculative, said higher education secretary Mohammed Hanish. The government secretary told TOI that the focus of the education department, for the time being, is the conduct of SSLC and Plus Two examination that is underway. Schedule for valuation of these examination papers have also been prepared. “As of now, no decision has been taken on whether to reopen schools as usual in June or depend on off school method as we did this year in view of the pandemic. There is enough time left to take informed decision on such matters of importance,” Hanish added. Meanwhile, several senior officials with the department expressed doubts over the school reopening by early June. The second wave of Covid-19, they point out as the major reason for their scepticism. The on going SSLC examination is scheduled to conclude on April 29 and the second year higher secondary and vocational higher secondary exams by April 26. At the same time, the education department is weighing various options to make offline school education interactive and more effective, if the next academic season too is going to affect the regular mode of academic interactions in schools. “We have enough content now and portions have already been more or less completed for all classes. We are exploring several options to make the classes more interactive, if situation demands the same in the next academic year. The challenge is how to ensure the participation of a section of students who are finding it hard to follow even the non-interactive mode of learning using Victers education television channel,” said KITES CEO Anvar Sadath. In the meantime, the education department has started distribution of text books for classes up to Class VIII. The distribution of the same, in schools following state syllabus, is expected to be over in a week. Distribution of text books for Class IX and Class X would follow this. The major challenge before the government in switching to interactive mode of online education is the lack of electronic devices with all students. While private schools following CBSE and ICSE syllabus may be able to insist on the availability of the same with their students, it would be impossible for the government to do so. Though the government has launched a laptop purchase scheme at a competitive price, the same has not picked up as it was projected to be.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/next-govt-will-take-call-on-school-reopening-official/articleshow/82038096.cms||B S Anilkumar
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: In-laws post video of woman’s suicide online as proof of innocence||MUZAFFARNAGAR: As a woman, 25, hanged herself to death, her in-laws lined up outside to shoot a video through the window and then shared it on social media to “absolve” themselves of murder. Her parents have alleged they had been hounding her for dowry, which led to her death. The woman’s father-in-law and mother-in-law have been arrested while her husband and her brother-in-law, also booked, are on the run. The woman, Komal, lived in Muzaffarnagar's Datiyana village with her husband, Ashish, and in-laws. On Sunday, as she prepared to hang herself, her in-laws waited outside. In the video, she can be seen tying a noose around a beam lining the asbestos roof. She gasps once as she ties the blue stole around her neck, tightens it and tests the grip so it doesn’t give way. After one last check, she lets go and hangs herself as a man’s voice says, “Apne aap latak rahi hai (she hanged herself on her own).” The man’s voice is presumably that of her father-in-law. On Monday, they shared the video on social media, hoping it would go viral. It did. While confirming the video had been shot from outside the room where she hanged herself, SP (city) Arpit Vijayvargiya said, “They had tried to stop her from killing herself.” Her parents, however, had a different story to tell. Komal and Ashish got married in September 2019. “I had given Rs 5 lakh and a bike to his family at the time. But his father Devendra, mother Savita and brother Sachin were not happy. About six months ago, they beat up Komal and drove her out of the house. The elders of the village sent her back,” her father Anil Kumar wrote in the complaint to the police. “Two months ago, they started demanding Rs 1.2 lakh. They said they would get Ashish married to someone else if she could not come up with the dowry. All four of them got together and killed my daughter.” An FIR was lodged on Sunday, a day before the video went viral, against Ashish, his brother and his parents under sections 304B (dowry death), 498A (cruelty to married woman) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and under sections 3 (giving or taking dowry) and 4 (demanding dowry) of The Dowry Prohibition Act. Yashpal Singh, SHO of Chhapar police station, under whose jurisdiction the crime took place, said, “His parents have been arrested and will be produced before the magistrate.” Ashish and his brother Sachin are on the run.

---||Dehradun||Kumbh not Markaz, visitors have Ganga blessings: Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat||DEHRADUN: All necessary precautions and security measures are being taken at Haridwar for the Kumbh, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said on Monday, adding that "it is not right to compare last year's Markaz event in Delhi with Kumbh, which comes once in 12 years and is far more grand and widely spread out over a large area". The CM also said that unlike Markaz, only people from within the country are arriving for the Kumbh. "When Covid-19-positive cases were reported in Markaz, the situation was much different and there was not enough awareness.Markaz was limited to a room or a building, but Kumbh’s area is spread across several kilometres. There was no checking at that event and people at Markaz had assembled over a long period of time," the CM said. He further said, “Everyone was sleeping close to each other in a room at Markaz and same quilts were being used by many. In contrast, the Kumbh area has 16 ghats and is not limited to Haridwar district alone. Areas of Neelkanth, Laxmanjhula and Rishikesh are included under Kumbh area. The ghats are at a distance from each other and people took a dip at different sessions. It was not like everyone took a bath simultaneously." "To avoid overcrowding, separate time was allocated for akhadas and peshwai. It is wrong to make a comparison. Kumbh is on the banks of Mother Ganga with the holy river blessing the devotees,” the CM added. Elaborating further, he said that Kumbh comes once in 12 years and people make resolutions and on their fulfillment, take a bath. "It is a tradition, which has continued. We want the Kumbh to be grand and divine. But at the same time, safety of people is also being ensured," he said, dismissing the view that Kumbh can act as a "Covid superspreader". "There was a time when the Covid numbers touched zero in the state. And we made all the due arrangements for Kumbh. There are frequent checks, a team of doctors deployed and around 10 to 12 hospitals have been set up. All the central guidelines are being followed and it is being ensured that Covid cases do not spread due to Kumbh," the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/not-right-to-compare-markaz-event-with-kumbh-whichcomes-once-in-12-years-and-is-far-more-grand-says-cm/articleshow/82037214.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Nodal officers to be appointed to expedite bed allocation||MUMBAI: BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal on Monday issued orders for appointment of nodal officers at the 24 ward war rooms and jumbo field hospitals to ensure symptomatic Covid-19 patients are allotted hospital beds promptly. These nodal officers will fu-nction in two shifts—3pm-11pm and 11pm-7am—and will have to be constantly in touch with each other to facilitate bed allotment, especially between 11pm and 7am when allotments will be predominantly done in jumbo field hospitals, said Chahal. Upon arrival at a jumbo facility, the patient will be provided a ‘suitable bed’ only after assessing his medical condition. Patients calling up the war rooms between 11pm and 7am will also be entitled to a bed even if their test or report is pending. They will be allotted beds in the ‘suspected’ category, stabilised with oxygen, if required, and then administered the test. The BMC also directed testing labs to submit reports of patients tested the previous day by 6am daily—within 24 hours of their swab collection—to ensure they get beds by 8am the same day. Presently, positive reports of patients tested before 2pm are submitted to BMC by midnight the same day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nodal-officers-to-be-appointed-to-expedite-bed-allocation/articleshow/82039240.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Kolkata||Mag beats Ray anniv-poll result day clash, sets Poila Baisakh date for unpublished gems||Kolkata: As part of the Satyajit Ray family’s centenary celebration of the icon, his lyrics of an unused song titled ‘Aha ki somoro sombhar’ from ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’, his unpublished essay titled ‘Thoughts on Filmmaking’ and unseen letters will be unveiled on Poila Boishak. The original plan was to unveil these on May 2 in the literary magazine ‘Bichitrapatra’, of which Sandip Ray is the chief adviser. However, the declaration of election results on the same day has jeopardized the centenary plans, resulting in the schedule being brought forward. Incidentally, the family isn’t aware of the plans the information and broadcasting ministry has for the newly-instituted Satyajit Ray award. Sandip acknowledged that various publications have lined up special issues for the Ray centenary. “But this is the only one with which the family has a direct connection,” he said. The cover with a Ray painting by Subrata Gangopadhyay'None of these unpublished works are lockdown finds and have been reserved for the centenary tribute The unseen lyrics that Ray wrote for ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’ has two alternative stanzas for the original song. “This song was found in the kheror khata of ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’. For some reason, it was not used in the film and was never recorded,” he said. There’s no trace of his notation for these lyrics. Ray’s unfinished essay — transcribed from the kheror khata of ‘Aparajito’ — was written when he lived in the rented Lake Avenue flat sometime in 1957 and has answered criticism regarding his film deviating from the original novel. To those who criticized his film for leaving out “some” characters while adapting the novel, Ray pointed out that he had left out exactly 237 of them while explaining that “allotting an average of one minute to each character, we arrive at a running time of a little under four hours…”. Ray also answered back critics who felt his film ‘misses the dramatic possibilities of the original’ or ‘the place (Benaras) has come alive, but not the people’. Sandip Ray’s selection of sketches and pages from his father's 'kheror khata' Another very interesting revelation are a set of 14 letters written to Pathikrit Bandopadhyay, the son of author Supriyo Bandopadhyay. One among them is unique because of the style Ray had adopted. Soumyakanti Dutta, who along with Souradip Bandyopadhyay and Ayan Chatterjee are part of the think tank behind ‘Bichitrapatra’, said, “Back then, Pathikrit Bandopadhyay was a teenager and loved to read Feluda. Not only had he signed off the letter as Topesh Ranjan Dutta C/O Satyajit Ray, even the handwriting was changed to match that of a teenager.” Satyajit Ray's 'kheror khata' of 'Paras Pathar' Dutta also mentioned that the edition of the magazine will publish “two unseen photos of Ray by Nemai Ghosh”, the complete script of ‘Sonar Kella’ and the facsimile edition of the film booklet of ‘Sonar Kella’. In addition, there are Sandip’s selection of sketches and pages from the red books of ‘Aparajito’, ‘Paras Pathar’, ‘Jalsaghar’, ‘Apur Sansar’ and ‘Devi’. “My father started using the ‘Kheror Khata’ from ‘Aparajito’ onwards. For this edition, I chose matter from five films.” This choice was based on “interesting visual selection” and includes makeup and costume sketch of Pinaki Sengupta in the role of Apu in ‘Aparajito’, Ray’s calligraphy of the original title for ‘Paras Pathar’ which was ‘Pares babur Paras Pathar’, sketch of Anil Chatterjee in the role of Bhudeb in ‘Jalsaghar’, sketch of Alok Chakraborty in the role of Kajal for ‘Apur Sansar’ and Ray’s calligraphy of a Sanskrit sloka for ‘Devi’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mag-beats-ray-anniv-poll-result-day-clash-sets-poila-baisakh-date-for-unpublished-gems/articleshow/82038099.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||India||BJP netas justify CISF action; Mamata seeks ban on them||KOLKATA/RANAGHAT: BJP functionaries justifying the CISF firing in which four north Bengal villagers were killed and asking for “more blood to be shed” makes Mamata Banerjee “feel ashamed that they too are from Bengal”, the CM said on Monday, demanding that politicians who publicly advocate “killings and murders” be banned from politics. BJP's Habra candidate and ex-state unit president Rahul Sinha had said on Sunday that central forces “should be given show-cause notices for killing only four people”. He said the central forces “should have killed eight instead of four”. BJP state secretary Sayantan Basu was reported as saying in Dhupguri, “Do not try to play more games, we will play the Sitalkuchi game.” Sinha’s and Basu’s comments followed state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh’s warning in Baranagar that there would be “many more Sitalkuchis in Bengal”. CM Mamata on Monday urged Trinamool MP Saugata Roy to bring a private member’s bill in Parliament, seeking a ban on such politicians. Bullets should be avenged with ballots, she added, a few hours before Trinamool went to the Election Commission, asking for legal action against the BJP functionaries and demanding that they be restrained from campaigning. “This was planned. I will probe this. Why was a woman sent there first? The BJP planned this with the district superintendent of police,” Mamata said. “Who met whom (before the incident), who opened fire, how was the plan hatched? They had planned it, the firing was targeted at the chest.” The CM, referring to the death of 18-year-old Ananda Burman in a separate incident in Sitalkuchi on Saturday, said BJP had killed its own worker “and then killed four others”. “I have the names of all those who opened fire. One BJP leader is saying four should be killed, another is saying 12 should be killed. Don’t they have any shame? How can political leaders say more people should have been killed? They are provoking people openly,” Mamata said, accusing Union home minister Amit Shah of “planning this entirely”. “The PM knows about it,” she iterated. “Where do these people come from, from where have they been imported?” she said in a jibe to national BJP leaders. “Those who give clean chits after firing, those who say more should have been killed… should they be allowed in politics? We need to avenge these bullets with ballots,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-netas-justify-cisf-action-mamata-seeks-ban-on-them/articleshow/82041330.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The victim, a marginal farmer, was found hanging from a ceiling fan in his house at Chandrapur village under the jurisdiction of Aonla police station. On his complaint, an FIR was registered against an identified accused (name withheld) under sections 363 (abduction) and 366 (abducting a woman to compel her marriage) of the Indian Penal Code on April 9. Police had raided a few locations in Budaun but in vain. Villagers, however, suspect the girl might have eloped with local youth. The family told TOI that the victim had left behind a suicide note, alleging that sub-inspector Ram Ratan had demanded Rs 1 lakh from him and was not looking out for his daughter, deliberately. Ram Ratan tried to tear the suicide note that drove locals berserk and they attacked policemen, they alleged, demanding strict action against the SI and the recovery of the girl. Circle officer Chaman Singh and SDM Parul Tarar accompanied by police forces from three police stations rushed to the spot and controlled the situation. BJP MLA Dharampal Singh, meanwhile, also met the bereaved family and assured them of action against the accused. Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan said the SI was shunted out to the police line, and action would be taken against anyone found guilty. Additional SP (rural) Rajkumar Agarwal, meanwhile, said, “The victim’s daughter reportedly tied a nuptial knot with the person she had eloped with. It appears to be one of the reasons behind suicide. Besides, we have also checked the suicide note, but the handwriting and the signature of the victim on the suicide note don’t match with his handwriting and signature on the police complaint lodged on April 9. Police had taken a video of the body and there was no suicide note. Later, a local, not a family member, came up with a suicide note.” “However, taking cognisance of the suicide note, we have shunted out SI Ram Ratan and constable Monu Singh to reserve police line. They would be suspended after getting approval from the state election commission. Besides, we will also register an FIR against people who turned the situation violent,” said Agarwal. After the autopsy, the body was cremated in the village peacefully, said police, adding that they would recover the girl within 48 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-man-45-ends-life-after-visiting-police-station-several-times-for-missing-daughter/articleshow/82036474.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Items such as jaggery powder, ghee, oil and coconut were in demand,” said a grocery shopowner at Salunke Vihar.Supermarkets were packed with customers, but many of them were disappointed at not finding the products they came looking for. “In supermarkets you get a variety of organic products, which you don’t get at most grocery stores. But to my disappointment, quite a few shelves were empty and there was little stock of organic products,” said a customer at Dorabjees, NIBM road.After being deserted for the weekend, Mahatma Phule mandai was back to its usual hustle-bustle with customers out to purchase fresh produce. While vegetable hawkers started setting up stalls at 6 am, flower sellers spread their stock about an hour later and shops selling bamboo stick, gaathi (sugar garland) and other puja items opened at 10am.Another popular market area, Gujarat Colony in Kothrud, witnessed regular rush. “From gaathi for the gudi to all other puja items, I found everything I required at shops near my house,” said a resident of Kothrud.Even popular sweet shops were sold out by 4pm on Monday. “Shrikhand is a must-buy for Gudi Padwa, along with various flavoured pedha, kaju katli and other sweets. By the time we shut shop in the evening, sales were 70% of pre-covid numbers,” said a sweet shop owner on Karve Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/people-step-out-for-gudi-padwa-shopping-after-weekend-lockdown/articleshow/82038103.cms||---
---||Bhopal||50 bodies in a day: Covid SOPs go up in smoke as fatalities rise in Bhopal||BHOPAL: Forget PPE kits, no protocal are being followed to bring the bodies of Covid victims to the crematorium in Bhopal. On an average, 50 bodies of Covid victims are being brought to Bhadbhada crematorium every day. However, the Covid protocols are nowhere seen. BMC passed the buck by saying that it does not control crematorium. Additional commissioner, BMC, MP Singh told TOI that it has only deployed its vehicle to send the dead bodies to the crematorium from hospital. “Crematoriums are run by the societies. We have only deployed the vehicles to send dead bodies to the crematorium,” said Singh. Asked about the number of vehicles being deployed, Singh replied, “That I have to check.” On the condition of anonymity, an official said that the bodies are being sent to the crematorium wrapped in bags. “Hospitals send the bodies wrapped in a black bag with a chain. The hospitals also put a sticker with the name of the patient and inform the crematoriums,” said the official. Relatives are informed by the hospital who reach the crematorium by their personal vehicles. Surprisingly, drivers do not wear PPE kits while carrying the bodies of Covid victims. “It is summer and temperatures are high. It is just impossible to wear PPE kit while carrying the dead bodies to the crematorium. We have to make several trips a day to bring the bodies,” said the official without quoting his name. Drivers hand over the bodies to the crematoriums. “From there the society takes over the charge of the bodies,” said an official. Problems do not stop for the dead bodies after reaching the crematorium. “Can we expect to work in PPE in such temperature infront of the pyre? It is just impossible. We should be thankful to these employees who are working round the clock to cremate the bodies,” reacted a Bhadbhada crematorium employee. Each body of the Covid victims requires 4 quintals of wood. “Think for a while to work from 7 in the morning to 9 in the night in such summers. They can’t work by wearing the PPE. They do wear masks and try to follow the instructions as much as possible,” said secretary, Bhadbhada crematorium, Mamtesh Sharma. Covid testing is not being done for the crematorium employees. “We have requested the administration to conduct free vaccination and even regular testing of the employees who are the real Covid warriors. It will be an unimginable situation if our employees stop burning the bodies,” said Sharma. About the availability of the wood for cremation, Bhadbhada management said that it is being arranged by the forest department. “In Bhopal, wood for cremation is not available. However, the forest department has assured to bring it from Raisen. We will get it by tonite,” said Bhadbhada management president Chaudhary. Notably, the electric crematorium was started a couple of days ago. “We can not bank upon only on electric crematorium as it takes almost two to 2.5 hours to burn a body and we burn maximum five bodies daily,” said an official. As the number of bodies of Covid victims are high, the Bhadbhada crematorium management has developed another two acre land. “The existing facility is to cremate around 15 bodies per day. As the number of dead bodies have been increased exponentially we have to develop a new venue within the campus. Around 20 stands have been developed and another will be developed in the next few days,” said Sharma. Jahangirabad cemetery is also facing the problem after the number of dead bodies being brought has increased exponentially. Even such is the situation that he had to bring JCB machines to dig out graves. “It takes around 3-4 hours for manually digging a grave. As the dead bodies are more we need to have graves in spares. We brought a JCB machine which has dug a dozen graves in advance,” said Golden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/50-bodies-in-a-day-covid-sops-go-up-in-smoke-as-fatalities-rise/articleshow/82038097.cms||Ramendra Singh

Gangotri temple committee president Suresh Semwal said, "As per age-old traditions, the palanquin of Goddess Ganga will start from Mukhba village on May 14. After a night halt at Bhairav temple, the procession will reach the Gangotri shrine the next day. The portals will then be opened at 7.30am." "The temple committee has taken all precautions to prevent the spread of Covid-19. We hope that the footfall of pilgrims will be better this year to give some respite to locals who are dependent on the Char Dham Yatra for their livelihood," he added. Meanwhile, the portals of the Yamunotri shrine would also open on the same day but an official declaration in this regard would be made by the Yamunotri temple committee only on the occasion of Yamuna Jayanti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/gangotri-portals-to-open-for-pilgrims-on-may-15/articleshow/82055383.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala

On the other side, organizations like Indian Medical Association (IMA) have come out in the open saying that the Pooram and other festivals must be deferred considering the fast spread of Covid. The IMA said the government must recognize the fact that it would be tough to control the crowd during the festivals. KGMOA district president V I Aseena has also expressed concern on the health consequences of such a large assembly of people. “It will be challenging to enforce the Covid protocol when so many people assemble. However, it will be an exaggeration to say that the Pooram could lead to a death of 200 people as has been reportedly stated by the DMO,” Dr Aseena said. District collector S Shanavas on Monday convened a meeting of health, police and revenue department officials to make preparations for the conduct of the Pooram by complying with the Covid protocol. The collector said Pooram will be conducted under strict police control. Shanavas also said the health department will set up aid-posts at different locations in collaboration with the police, and services of doctors and other health department officials will be made available at these aid-posts. The Pooram ground will be divided into six sectors, and sectoral magistrates will be appointed in each of them to ensure the safety of the people coming to watch Pooram and that they are maintaining social distancing. The district authorities will provide 100 thermal scanners to examine the Pooram spectators. The collector has also directed the devaswoms to keep enough sanitizers, masks and hand gloves during the Pooram. Meanwhile, district medical officer (DMO) Dr K J Reena said it would be difficult to deploy the doctors from the health department at the aid-posts. She said the support of the National Health Mission and private hospitals will have to be enlisted for this. The DMO has requested the collector to convene a meeting of the private hospitals, and NHM on Tuesday to enlist their support. Dr Aseena said the KGMOA’s stance on joining the duties at the proposed aid-posts will be announced at the meeting convened by the collector. Meanwhile, the Guruvayur devaswom managing committee has decided to permit the devotees to offer prayers on the day of Vishu from the entrance of the nalambalam or vathilmadam. The devotees will not be permitted to enter the nalambalam to have Vishu Kani darshan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/authorities-strive-to-facilitate-safe-conduct-of-pooram/articleshow/82038104.cms||T Ramavarman

The child with the rare medical condition was referred to the paediatric department of state-run SSG Hospital in Vadodara by Kashiben Gordhandas Patel Children’s Hospital, Karelibaug after he got infected with coronavirus earlier this month. Later, Purab tested negative in RT-PCR test. “Last week, the child was referred to us after he had developed fever. Since, he already had Wilms’ tumour, besides being severely anaemic and undergoing chemotherapy, the Covid-19 infection had us much worried about his safety and that his condition may deteriorate further. Such kids are already immuno compromised but surprisingly there was no rapid progression,” said Dr Sheila Aiyer, professor and HoD of Paediatrics at SSG Hospital. Wilms’ tumour, also known as nephroblastoma, is a rare kidney cancer that typically occurs in children. “Fortunately, despite all pre-existing conditions, he stabilised and we sent him to Ahmedabad to continue his treatment for malignancy,” said Dr Aiyer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/3-yr-old-slays-covid-battling-kidney-cancer/articleshow/82039253.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Pune||RTOs stare at dismal registrations||Pune: The regional transport offices in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad are staring at dismal vehicle registrations during Gudi Padwa for the second straight year due to Covid-19 spread and resultant strict restrictions since April 3. While Gudi Padwa falls on April 13 (Tuesday) this year, it was celebrated on March 25 in 2020. “A total of 8,172 vehicles were registered between March 20 and March 31 last year. However, last year registrations cannot be related to the festival alone due to the fact that March 31 was the last date for clearing BS-IV compliant vehicle stock then. Moreover, it was a total lockdown situation on the Gudi Padwa day last year and the situation is almost similar this year too,” Pune’s deputy RTO Sanjiv Bhor said. Between April 1 and 11 this year, the RTOs registered around 5,000 vehicles. “This time too, strict restrictions hit Pune on April 3. Hence, these registration figures are not fresh,” he said. Hadapsar resident Abhay Karad, who had planned to buy a two wheeler, said, “My plan was to buy a vehicle a week before the Padwa day and take its delivery on Tuesday. But owing to the prevalent restrictions, my plans have been put on hold.” — Joy Sengupta||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rtos-stare-at-dismal-registrations/articleshow/82038105.cms||Joy Sengupta

Dr Bhagirathi Joshi, chief medical officer (CMO) of Nainital, confirmed that the staffers of the day boarding school have been isolated and contact tracing has started. “We will start the testing after four days,” added the CMO. Meanwhile, after three secretaries and two deputy secretaries tested positive for Covid-19, secretariat staffers demanded 50% attendance in the office. BJP MP of Rajya Sabha, Anil Baluni, also tested positive for the virus on Tuesday. With 1,925 new cases of Covid-19 reported on Tuesday, the state reported the highest single day tally of coronavirus for this year. Meanwhile, four students of a school at Happy Valley in Mussoorie were also found Covid-19 positive on Tuesday. With them, a total of 17 students and 4 staff members of the institution have tested positive over the past three days. The area has been declared as a micro-containment zone while the infected students and staff have been put under quarantine. Speaking to TOI, sub divisional magistrate Manish Kumar told that all the students and staff are asymptomatic and the administration was closely monitoring their health while contact tracing was being done.

---||Kolkata||Memories of historical events emerge as poll discussion topics||Kolkata: Drawing parallels with history has always been a feature in Bengal’s political discourses. Now some of the darkest chapters of history have re-emerged as topics of discussion in poll-bound Bengal across political parties as well as common people. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday has termed the deaths in Sitalkuchi a “Nandigram-style genocide”. Similarly, the incident prompted many to compare it to Jallianwala Bagh massacre, another genocide that took place on April 13, 1919. While the official pages of BJP have not mentioned the 1946 Great Calcutta Killings, its supporters are posting pictures, writings on this particular event on social media. Assistant professor at Institute of Development Studies, Kolkata Anwesha Sengupta feels, “The attempt is to reinstate fear in the public memory by dragging the episode of 1946 because Calcutta has a history of being a riot-torn city.” In several poll campaigns, BJP is invoking Syama Prasad Mukherjee to shed away TMC’s ‘outsider party’ tag. According to BJP’s Mohit Roy, “It is an attempt to remind the Bengali Hindus that it is for Syama Prasad Mukherjee that they are living in a safe homeland, otherwise, it would have been Bangladesh.” TMC minister Bratya Basu said that it is an attempt to do communal politics and incite Bengali sentiments. After Narendra Modi’s claim that he did ‘satyagaraha’ for the freedom of Bangladesh, activist Kasturi Basu shared a poster on Facebook which states ‘Banglar Maayera Meyera Sokolei Muktijoddha’. She writes, “It is time to build resistance against the Fascists who try to distort history and erase them from collective memory.” To make people aware of the imminent dangers like farm laws, NRC and CAA, Hathras rape case, a video series ‘Amader Kotha’ by No-Vote-To-BJP campaign is citing memories from the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/memories-of-historical-events-emerge-as-poll-discussion-topics/articleshow/82038106.cms||Dipawali Mitra
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Drop in cases on Monday, but BMC says ‘will stay vigilant’||MUMBAI: The weekend effect was noticeable on the daily Covid-19 charts on Monday as fewer tests were performed in both Maharashtra and Mumbai, resulting in fewer detections. While Maharashtra saw a 13% drop in positive cases as compared to a day before, the comparative drop was 31% in Mumbai. On most days this month, the state has registered half a lakh cases. On Monday, too, 55,411 cases were diagnosed from the two lakh Covid tests done on Sunday. In comparison, 2.6 lakh tests were done on Saturday that resulted in the highest-ever single-day tally of 63,294 cases on Sunday. The total caseload of the state rose to 34.5 lakh and fatalities touched 58,245. In this month so far, the state has recorded over 6.4 lakh cases, which is the highest ever addition since the outbreak in March 2020. In Mumbai, 39,398 tests were conducted on Sunday that resulted in 6,905 detections in a 24-hour period ending on Monday morning. A day prior, 9,989 cases were detected after 52,159 tests. There was a drop in fatalities too, wtih Maharashtra recording 258 deaths and Mumbai 43. BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, too, said the administration would not get carried away with the seemingly sharp drop in cases over the weekend. “Although we had fewer admissions than in the last few days in our major Covid hospitals such as Seven Hills in Andheri and the jumbo facilities at Nesco, Goregaon and BKC, we will remain vigilant,” he said. The BMC dashboard showed only 60 out of the 2,542 ICU beds were vacant and only 20 ventilators (10 each in public and private hospitals) were available. The overall number of beds has increased to 19,329 from 13,000 a week back. “We are also trying arrangements like a step-down facility at a star hotel so that people from private hospitals can be sent to the hotels for observation,” Kakani said. Officials from the state said beds were running out in many districts in the state and directions have been issued to augment bed capacity in all districts. Oxygen requirement has also gone up, and steps are being taken to increase supply. Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh in a review meeting on Monday directed the administration to hire more doctors and health workers from the private sector. He also said the use of Remdesivir should be done as per the protocols set by ICMR and misuse should be tracked and stopped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-drop-in-cases-on-mon-but-bmc-says-will-stay-vigilant/articleshow/82039300.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Make remdesivir available like paracetamol: Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Monday pulled up the state government for the shortage of the antiviral drug remdesivir and the control on its supply, and ordered it to make the medication available for all, like paracetamol, during this surge in Covid-19 cases. The judges asserted that they want results instead of getting into the unnecessary blame game over the behaviour of people, production and medicine stocks. While taking up the issue of Covid-19 in a suo motu PIL, the bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia said that the government should come up with policy on what is needed and when it is needed and to cut hoarders out. “The state can always find those hoarding and people selling medicines at higher prices and see that the strongest possible measures are taken against them,” the court said, to which the government said that this has been done. The chief justice further ordered the government, “And make sure that remdesivir is made available everywhere. Nobody has to run to form a queue.” Justice Karia added to this, “The medicine should be made available like paracetamol.” Advocate general Kamal Trivedi replied, “I wish that this becomes a reality.” The judges rejected the state government’s claims that doctors prescribe remdesivir indiscriminately, though it is a drug that is to be used in emergencies. Trivedi blamed doctors for unnecessarily prescribing remdesivir to Covid patients. The drug is 10-year-old invention and contains cyclodextrin which is dangerous for the kidney and liver and hence needs to be prescribed in critical condition and only in cases of hospitalization. The judges countered the argument, “Doctors will not prescribe remdesivir for nothing. They are not doing it for ordinary ailments. Only when RT-PCR test is positive, and lungs of a patient are infected, doctors prescribe remdesivir.” They said that doctors can take care of the situation and the government may not make policy on such a premise that remdesivir should be administered under observation only. The high court also refused to buy the state government’s argument that only seven companies manufacture the medicine in the country and 1.75 lakh vials are produced every day. The judges said that manufacturers have stocks of medicines produced in the months of January and February. The court was concerned about the control over remdesivir supply and said that control should be removed. “Controlling the supply of this injection from one sourcing centre is not in public interest at all. Why should this medicine be made available to a nursing home which is not a designated Covid centre?” the court asked and cited the 1.5km long queue outside Zydus Hospital. The court also disapproved of the system by which the government intended to supply remdesivir on demand from its stock. The judges said that private hospitals are exploiting patients and their attendants. The judges talked tough to the advocate general who tried to assert that the situation is under control. They said, “Don’t believe everything you are instructed Mr Trivedi.” The judges asked the law officer to be honest in submissions and reminded him that he is a court officer as well and people look to him to see what the state government is doing. “You know, and we also know that there is sufficient medicine available,” the judges commented and questioned why it is not made available at private hospitals and pharmaceutical stores. “If somebody wants to buy buy remdesivir, why can’t he go and buy it? Nobody is buying it for fun. Nobody has extra money to pay Rs 1,000 to stock medicine,” the chief justice said. The judges also commented that when injections are available at the recommendation of VIPs, it cannot be believed that there is a shortage. They also cited the government’s argument that Gujarat gets the lion’s share of the remdesivir production in the country, and asked it to keep proper account of the stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/make-remdesivir-available-like-paracetamol-hc/articleshow/82038131.cms||---

But health is a priority.” The steep surge in Covid-19 cases across Gujarat and the recent changes in guidelines governing public gatherings are affecting wedding plans. “My son’s wedding was to take place by the end of April. Already, there was immense confusion about how many people to involve and eventually we decided to keep it a family affair with fewer than 100 persons,” said Dhara Gandhi (name changed), a Thaltej resident. “However, the bride’s parents have just tested positive for Covid-19. We had made advance payments for the venue and have been denied refund of the deposit. We don’t have a choice, we may have to cancel the event. But we are yet to take the final call.” Several families are desperately seeking clarity. “The situation is so fluid that norms are changing by the day. Earlier, we had prepared a guest list of 200 persons and now we have reduced it to 100,” said Nidhi Maheshwari, a Vadaj resident. “My brother’s wedding is scheduled in the second half of May but with such high number of cases, curfew timings, and numerous restrictions, we are not sure how things will pan out. We are still deciding whether to organize the wedding.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gatecrashing-coronavirus-pushes-back-wedding-twice/articleshow/82039260.cms||Niyati Parikh

In an attempt to keep the virus at bay, colleges had made it mandatory for students to submit RT-PCR reports to allow entry to the premises. Sources said that an RT-PCR report template circulating on social media is now popular among students who fill it on their own and submit to the college authorities. A third-year college student at a private college on the outskirts of Dehradun said, "A large section of the students submit forged reports as it is quite convenient to download the template and fill it yourself rather than going to a hospital and get tested. An authentic report would mean a wait of up to 24 hours and the risk of testing positive." A second-year student at a Doon-based private college said, “Such templates are easily available online and students share it with each other on WhatsApp. They even make sure that the hospital or lab mentioned is located outside the city to minimise the chances of getting caught." He added that there were many such templates doing the rounds, and even the college authorities don’t have an estimate of how many are original and how many bogus. TOI accessed an email notice sent to students by the registrar of a college in the Sela Qui area which mentions that college authorities have detected a large number of students who have submitted false negative RT-PCR reports and warning of strict disciplinary action if they failed to submit a correct RT-PCR report. Confirming that many colleges are now taking steps to curb such practices, GS Warne, secretary of the Association of Self-Financed Colleges of Uttarakhand, said, "We are aware of the issue and have asked colleges to make sure that they accept only test reports from Dehradun-based labs or hospitals, mainly those suggested by us. Another logic behind the idea is that outstation students may test positive in Dehradun even if they test negative back in their hometown. We are also strictly ensuring social distancing on campus."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/fake-rt-pcr-reports-pose-challenge-for-ukhand-colleges/articleshow/82037243.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Kolkata||No meals on less-than-2hr flights in wake of Covid spike||Kolkata: More than half the flights that depart from Kolkata airport will not be serving meals on board from Thursday following a civil aviation ministry notification issued on Monday to enhance in-flight safety measures in the wake of the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases. While around 50% flights that operate on Monday, Wednesday and Friday have a flight time of less than 2 hours, the ratio increases to 70% on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday when flights from Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Ahmedabad and Chennai do not operate to Kolkata. While around 135 flights operate out of Kolkata on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, around 115 flights depart the city on other four days. The notification though does not bar passengers from carrying and consuming food on board. Also, passengers can request for water from the crew. The restriction will affect on-board service on flights from Kolkata to Bagdogra, Guwahati and other airports in the north-east, Ranchi, Patna, Vizag, Raipur, Allahabad, Varanasi and several other regional routes. On journeys beyond two hours to cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kochi, Pune, Ahmedabad, Nagpur, Jaipur and Panjim, service of meals in the same row will have to be staggered so passengers in adjacent seats don’t take off the mask at the same time. This, airline officials say, will pose a major logistic challenge. Also, with the notification barring any pouring service, hot beverages like tea and coffee are unlikely to be served. However, there are issues about pre-booked meals on flights and how the passengers will be reimbursed for meals that airlines will have to sort out within the next couple of days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-meals-on-less-than-2hr-flights-in-wake-of-covid-spike/articleshow/82038128.cms||Subhro Niyogi

As seers of various akhadas came for the shahi snan followed by pilgrims, Covid norms went for a toss as there was virtually no social distancing or masks being used by many people. Kumbh Mela IG Sanjay Gunjyal told TOI, “Implementing Covid-19 guidelines is practically not possible during the procession of akhadas and shahi snan at Har-ki-Pauri and it could have caused a stampede-like situation if we started issuing challans. However, we kept on asking pilgrims to follow the social distancing guidelines at the other ghats.” #Kumbh2021 #ShahiSnan #HaridwarMahakumbh2021Haridwar: As seers of various akhadas came for the shahi snan followe… https://t.co/XwKFs08scT— TOI Cities (@TOICitiesNews) 1618282146000Expressing helplessness at flouting of Covid norms during the day, AS Sainger, nodal health officer, Kumbh Mela, said, “We have distributed 2.5 lakh masks and also conducted awareness camps at akhadas. Yet many people are not sticking to Covid protocols such as maintaining distance and wearing masks which is unfortunate.” He added that around 18,000 people were tested for Covid-19 on Monday through random sampling in the mela area itself out of which, 102 pilgrims were found Covid-19-positive. Notably, Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad president Narendra Giri was also found Covid-positive on Sunday. Seers of his akhada, Niranjani, who were with Giri for the past few days were also seen participating in the shahi snan without masks or social distancing. The last king of Nepal, Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah also participated in the shahi snan along with seers of the Niranjani akhada. For many pilgrims, faith in the Ganga was stronger than fear of Covid. “I have come from Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh, I am not wearing a mask because I know Ganga maiya (mother) will take away my Covid if I get it by any chance,” said Swami Vipulanand, a seer of Bairagi Camp. Meanwhile, some time lapse led to a small altercation between mela administration and Bada Akhada Udaseen. The followers of Bairagi saints reached Har-ki-Pauri along with Bairagi saints in large numbers to take a dip due to which mela police could not clear the bathing ghat on time and Bada Akhada Udaseen procession was stopped for at least 45 minutes. Irked over this, Udaseen saints sat on the street and threatened to return without participating in the shahi snan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/amid-covid-spurt-35l-take-dip-at-har-ki-pauri-on-somvati-amavasya-shahi-snan-many-without-masks-or-social-distancing/articleshow/82037235.cms||MS Nawaz

The CBI team, sources indicated, on Monday quizzed Mumbai police’s ACP Sanjay Patil on some technical details regarding WhatsApp chats which it has collected during the investigation, sources said. In his complaint, Singh has mentioned WhatsApp chats with Patil who purportedly referred to Deshmukh’s insistence that Mumbai cops raise Rs 100 crore a month for him by extorting money from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Deshmukh will be questioned not only about the contents of Singh’s complaint but will also be confronted with claims made by arrested assistant police inspector Sachin Waze. His statement will be taken on record and annexed with the report which the CBI has to present before the Bombay high court next week. The CBI has filed a preliminary enquiry into the matter on the Bombay HC’s order and has to submit a report by early next week. The agency had last Friday questioned former Mumbai police constable Vinayak Shinde and a bar owner, Mahesh Shetty, in the case. Shinde was arrested by the NIA in the Mansukh Hiran murder case. The agency also recorded the statement of deputy commissioner of police Raju Bhujbal, who has been cited by former city police chief Singh in the WhatsApp chats mentioned by him in his letter to Thackeray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-to-submit-statement-to-hc/articleshow/82040126.cms||Raj Shekhar

Doctors suspect that the infection developed two critical stages in the infant in just one day after she probably caught the infected from her mother. A 30-year-old woman from Amroli area was admitted in the Diamond Hospital for delivery on April 1 and on the same day she delivered the baby girl through natural delivery. “The infant had unstable breathing, or respiratory distress syndrome, at the time of birth. It is normal and generally observed in many children. For treatment she was admitted, while the mother was discharged,” said Dr Alpesh Singhvi, a peadiatrician at the hospital. Under observation, the infant was given formula feed and not her mother’s milk till April 5. “On April 5, when the baby’s condition improved, we called the mother for feeding. On April 6, however, she developed breathing problems and hence we got an x-ray done,” said Sindhvi. “The lungs were clear on April 6, but on the next day the x-ray showed a large white area showing spread of infection,” Singhvi added. Later, an antigen test conducted in the infant tested positive. “She has been put on a ventilator since then and has been given remdesivir injection. We are planning for plasma treatment as well,” said Dr Haresh Paghda, administrator of Diamond Hospital. The hospital is treating the infant for free under Balsakha, a relief scheme by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/12-day-old-infant-girl-in-surat-fights-coronavirus-for-past-seven-days/articleshow/82039271.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Pune||Rain, thunderstorm cause waterlogging||Pune: A local weather system on Monday afternoon led to thunderstorm and rain in some parts of the city, triggering waterlogging in a few suburbs and power outage for a while. Till 8:30pm, the Shivajinagar station of the Met department registered 19.4mm of rainfall. The gauge at Lohegaon was almost negligible at 0.7mm. Some parts of the city reported more thunderstorm activity and strong winds than rain. The high volume of rain, especially in the inner suburbs of Pune, caused varying levels of waterlogging in areas such as Kothrud. Residents from Vimannagar and Wadgaonsheri reported power cuts, fluctuating voltage and rolling blackouts during the thunderstorm. The power supply was fully restored around 8pm. An Indian Meteorological Department official said the rain and thunderstorm would continue over the next 48 hours, adding that local weather systems were causing such conditions. “There are chances of isolated rain with thunderous activity, lightning in especially south-central parts of Konkan-Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, including Pune district, and in areas of Marathwada and Vidarbha for the next couple of days, till around April 15. The cause is a local instability due to heating and moisture incursion over the region. This resulted in Cumulonimbus cloud formation in the afternoon hours. This triggered the thunder and lightning. Such weather conditions will continue during the next three-four days,” said Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather at IMD, Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rain-thunderstorm-cause-waterlogging/articleshow/82038112.cms||---

Even for stores with an online presence, and for the ones offering their customers hedges at current gold rates, business has come to a near-standstill. “A lot of our orders are piled up with the courier services. The sales that happen online represent a very small part of our business,” said Amit Modak, the chief executive officer of PN Gadgil and Sons Ltd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jewellers-lament-peak-season-loss/articleshow/82038107.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

But for Sarkar who is above 80 years now, standing in a queue during the ongoing Covid situation, looked like taking some “major risks.” She was pleasantly surprised when the election commission officials came to her residence, set up a temporary polling counter and asked her to vote. After the elaborate process — just like the one experienced at a real booth — got over, Sarkar only asked them a question she had been thinking all along: “Will my vote be counted like thousands of others on counting day?” The EC officials not only assured her that it is secure, but will also be counted just like those who will queue up at the BD School to exercise their franchise on April 17. “Please keep my vote safely with you and ensure my choice is not disclosed,” she pleaded. Sarkar is one of the 1128 elderly voters — who, due to their advanced age, the Covid situation, and fear of violence, wanted to vote from home after the EC provided them the option. The EC arrangement has drawn praises from most of these voters, who were able to take part in the election process fropm the comfort of their homes. CB block’s Ramen Das was another such voter. “This initiative will help us avoid the heat outside,” he said. A few others that TOI spoke to said that were also fearful of the political heat in the light of a direct contest between state fire minister Sujit bose and former mayor Sabyasachi Dutta. “There can be tension on that day and it is best avoided,” said another voter from GD block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sr-citizens-vote-from-home-laud-ec-effort/articleshow/82038122.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Women's groups at forefront of fighting wildfires in hills||ALMORA: In the wake of raging forest fires in the hill districts of Uttarakhand, hundreds of women from both Garhwal and Kumaon regions have formed several local groups to douse the flames. The assistance provided by these groups have proven to be much-needed relief for the forest department which is using all ways and means to fight the wildfires, including help from the central forces. According to sources, women from Chamoli, Bageshwar, Nainital and Champawat districts have formed several small groups which are assisting in fire-fighting efforts. Apart from this, they have also made it their mission to spread awareness among locals about the need to prevent forest fires and the importance of timely intervention. In Tadaag and Miratolee villages of Kali Kumaon range and Dhanachuli of Nainital, women claimed that they are constantly on the watchout for any fire outbreak and rush to the spot even before the forest department's notice. Talking to TOI, Dhanachuli van panchayat sarpanch Hansa Lodhiyal, said that more than 50 women are part of her team which plays a key role in keeping such incidents under control. She added that similar groups have been formed in other villages too and hundreds of women are part of them. Echoing similar sentiments, Virendra Singh Rawat, sarpanch of Derawan in Chamoli's Tharali, said that more than 500 women from different villages are associated with such groups in the region. Reasserting that women play a key role in extending a helping hand to forest officials in fighting wildfires, Praveen Kumar, conservator of forests (North Kumaon circle), said that such local groups help boost the capabilities of the department in times of need.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/womens-groups-at-forefront-of-fighting-wildfires-in-hills/articleshow/82037246.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Migrants leave in hordes amid fear of uncertainty||PUNE: The marriage of an acquaintance has provided a perfect excuse to Vijay Kumar (20) and his cousin Amit Kumar (22) to leave the city for good. Seated in a corner of the Pune railway station on Monday, the brothers — residents of Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh — reminisced about their life in the city, “We both came to Pune a year-and-a-half ago for work. Our employer wanted us to stay on, but we feel going back is a safer option at present. A distant relative of ours is getting married and we decided to attend it. ‘Agar lockdown ho gaya toh phas jeyenge’ (We will get stuck, if lockdown happens). We have promised our employer that we will be back soon, but it seems unlikely,” they said. It is 1:30pm and the station premises is buzzing with people huddled in big and small groups, waiting for northbound trains. Gloom, fear and insecurity are writ large on their faces as they wait to head home, uncertain of a future ahead of them. Akash Kumar (18) and his friend stare at the main entrance of the station and check their mobile phones constantly, trying to guage the time left for their trains to arrive. Strangely, just like Vijay and Amit, Akash, too, has a wedding to attend. “We have been working for two years at a factory in Uruli Kanchan. We are going to attend a wedding,” Akash said. However, his friend gives it away. “If the government is bent on creating survival problems, it is better to die in the midst of family members rather than in a different city,” the Allahabad resident said. A few metres away, Wakil Saroj (36), who hails from Bhadohi in UP, is seated patiently and trying hard not to make any eye contact with other passengers. “I have been living in Pune for 18 years and am a daily wage earner. A month before the lockdown last year, I had gone back to my village due to a family emergency. I was home till December last year and returned to Pune in January. That the state government is considering a lockdown is the biggest nightmare for us. Hence, I have decided to go back home again. I will definitely return, but don’t know when,” Saroj told TOI. Middle-aged Indrajit Sah, who was listening to the conversation, said, “It was April last year when my brother walked from Pune to Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh (more than 500km) before he could get a transport to Uttar Pradesh. His employer, who lives in Magarpatta area, didn’t pay his one-month salary. Under such circumstances, how do we trust our employers? It is very easy for them to desert us. At my village in Muzaffarnagar, there is hardly any means of employment. But my family lives there. They will ensure that I don’t die of hunger,” Sah said. A rail official said that each north-bound train was running at full capacity at present. “We have introduced additional special trains to places like Danapur in Patna, Bhagalpur, Gorakhpur, among others, keeping in view the passenger load,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/migrants-leave-in-hordes-amid-fear-of-uncertainty/articleshow/82038160.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Only 50 people at weddings from April 14||AHMEDABAD: In a major dampener for weddings, the state government has further reduced the cap on guests permitted to 50 people from April 14. The state’s decision came following suggestions from the Gujarat high court on Monday morning. Earlier this month, the state government had reduced the cap from 200 persons to 100. The decision has not just left families confused but hoteliers and other venue-managers are already staring at widespread cancellations. It’s almost a repeat of the post-lockdown scenario of 2020 for hotels in Ahmedabad. While corporate travellers have become infrequent guests, cancellations and postponements of weddings have left the hospitality industry struggling for revenues all over again. The state government recently reduced the cap on guests allowed at weddings to 100 from 200 and with the HC directive on Monday, the number may be further reduced to 50 persons. With this, hotels in Ahmedabad are looking at a wave of cancellations of weddings that were scheduled for this month. This is affecting hotels’ revenues, as most have seen 50% cancellation. “We’ve seen an estimated 40% of weddings either being cancelled or postponed due to the changing rules and the surge in Covid-19 cases. With reduced guest lists and the scenario changing by the day, families are unsure of organizing weddings. Most weddings in April have been shifted to later dates or have been cancelled while those who booked for weddings in May are still in a dilemma,” said Jay Sudhakaran, general manager, Novotel Ahmedabad. Besides cancellations, the shrunken guest lists will also hurt hotels’ revenues. Deep Preet Bindra, general manager, Courtyard by Marriott, Ramdevnagar, said, “With fewer persons attending weddings, we will not just lose revenue for hospitality services (rooms booked) but also for food and beverages which accounts for 50% of the revenue for weddings booked at the hotel.” Hoteliers attribute the widespread cancellations and postponements to a dip in public sentiment due to the ‘astronomical’ increase in Covid-19 cases. With occupancies remained at an average of 50% or lower throughout 2020-21 due to the pandemic, city hotels are struggling to retain business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/only-50-people-at-weddings-from-april-14/articleshow/82039302.cms||Niyati Parikh

Some of the workers said they had been frequently checking their ticket confirmation status at the enquiry counters.Sanjay Sahu, one of the migrant workers waiting near the station, said: “Some of our friends and relatives have already left for Gorakhpur for the gram panchayat elections there. I can guarantee that they had boarded the train without confirmed tickets. However, the Nashik Road railway station authorities are simply not allowing us inside without confirmed tickets. We have been buying tickets of various trains to Uttar Pradesh for the past three days. However, seat confirmation has become a problem.”Another group of workers from Bihar looked relieved as they had got confirmed tickets, but only on a train leaving on Tuesday. Rajesh Yadav, a member of this group, said that he has got a confirmed ticket and is willing to spend a night outside the railway station. I am going home without the salary of the past one-and-a-half months. My employer says he does not have the money to pay me. It is better to return home than to die of hunger if a lockdown is announced.There were many others who had come to the railway station with their luggage only to return on being told that they have to have confirmed tickets to enter the station. Some said going to a nearby railway station and taking the trains from there was one option they could try. They too said their friends and relatives in Mumbai had travelled to their hometowns on unreserved train tickets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/agonising-wait-for-migrants-near-nashik-rd-station/articleshow/82036494.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The issue cropped up over a piece of forest land measuring around 27 hectares where the tribals have taken up ‘Podu’ cultivation. One of the three forest department officials, who was beaten up, said that they recently took up clearing of the land for afforestation works there, as part of the Telangana Ku Haritha Haram programme. “On Monday, we sent a forest staffer to the location to arrange some chairs as the district forest officer was coming for an inspection. The tribals gheraoed him and beat him up, following which he called us.” He further said, “Three of us reached the spot and tried to have a peaceful discussion on the matter but the tribals were not ready to listen and started hitting us. They tied me up to a tree which was with full of red ants.”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-forest-officials-thrashed-by-tribals/articleshow/82038164.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Indians in South Africa hit by ‘jobs for locals’ stir||HYDERABAD: A group of 32 Indian workforce, including a project manager from Telangana, executing a specialised construction project at Durban Port, are facing severe opposition from a local South African group under the guise of ‘jobs for locals only’ stir. The group has even gone to the extent of preventing the Indian workers from getting out of their makeshift accommodation. Stefanutti Stocks, one of South Africa’s leading engineering and construction groups, which employed the Indian workers, had to seek local police’s help to handle the situation. “We are now being provided private security to escort us,” said Ramesh Dandiboyina, project manager at the work site in Durban Port. Out of the 32 workers, Ramesh hails from Telangana. The others belong to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The situation took a turn for worse when the local workers who were protesting against their Indian counterparts did not allow them to go out to buy provisions or allowed food to be supplied to them. Ramesh got in touch with Patkuri Basanth Reddy, president of Gulf Telangana Welfare and Cultural Association, and discussed the matter with him. Basanth Reddy got in touch with the authorities in Durban and ensured some help to the workers. Vivek Katare, Consul (consulate, passport and visa division and community affairs), Consulate General of India (CGI) in Durban, also intervened and took up the matter with the authorities concerned. The workers said the CGI had been of great help to them. The workers, however, are on tenterhooks. Their workplace is 10 km away from where they have been provided accommodation. “As of now, we are safe,” Ramesh said. But, the local South African group is sticking to its demand that their jobs should not be given to Indian workers. The project was undertaken by Stefanutti Stocks to construct 36-meter diameter tanks. Constructing floating roofs and what are called ‘geodesic domes’ is also part of the project, which began in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/indians-in-s-africa-hit-by-jobs-for-locals-stir/articleshow/82038134.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

He has been arrested under different sections of the Essential Commodities Act. Investigating officer V V Giri of the Panchavati police station said that the doctor was produced before a city court and has been remanded in police custody for four days till April 16. Senior inspector Ashok Bhagat of the Panchavati police station said that a person named Yogesh Mohite, resident of the Ashoka Marg area, has two relatives admitted at two different hospitals for Covid-19 treatment. Mohite was trying to get remdesivir injection for them. Bhagat said that Mohite got the phone number of the doctor and called him. The two had certain communication on the price for the injection. The doctor allegedly agreed to sell one injection for Rs 25,000 and called Mohite to the Amrutdham area on Sunday night, he said. Bhagat said that when Mohite reached Amrutdham, there was a communication between the doctor and Mohite, who had only Rs 20,000. Later, Mohite went to a nearby ATM to withdraw Rs 5,000 and called up the police on number 100. The complaint was immediately diverted to the Panchavati police station. The police and a team of the food and drugs administration (FDA) rushed to the spot. The police found three remdesivir vials in possession of the doctor and arrested him. Bhagat said that the doctor has so far not revealed from where he had sourced the injections and he has also not produced bills of the same. The doctor has a clinic in the Mhasrool area. Bhagat said that he is also on the post of director of another hospital, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-homeopathy-doc-held-for-selling-remdesivir-for-rs-25000/articleshow/82036502.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The EOW transfers come a week after police commissioner Hemant Nagrale shunted 65 policemen from various units of the crime branch following the arrest of API Sachin Waze who was posted with the Crime Intelligence Unit. Of the 13 transferred EOW officers, two have been sent to the special branch, two to the protection and security unit, two to the traffic police department, and the rest have been given police station postings. For selection in EOW, an officer has to go through an interview and his skills are judged in understanding the economic offences. In the EOW, officers are generally posted for three to four years since their investigation involves paper work, studying voluminous documents, conducting preliminary enquiry before registering an FIR and filing voluminous chargesheets in court. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-13-officers-with-eow-for-over-5-years-transferred/articleshow/82040134.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Board exam date was April Fool’s prank||AHMEDABAD: In a case of circulating fake board exam dates, the local crime branch of Gandhinagar found the perpetrator to be a 14-year-old boy who tried to fool his friends on April 1 (April Fools’ Day). An LCB, Gandhinagar officer said that the boy morphed a press statement issued by the Gujarat secondary and higher secondary education board, in which he changed the exam dates and put it as his WhatsApp status. When his friends and others on his list saw his status, they began circulating it thinking it was real. LCB PI H P Jhala said, “The boy studies in Class-10 and his act of sharing the fake dates misguided people.” When asked whether putting it on the boy’s own WhattsApp status meant circulating the document, Jhala said that though his intention was to fool his friends it gave a wrong message to others. The board had on February 3, issued a press statement announcing the dates of Class 10 and Class 12 board exams between May 10 and May 25. On April 1, the teenage boy morphed the press statement and made it viral on social media in which the exam dates were changed to be between June 15 and June 30. After board secretary D S Patel was asked about the change in exam dates, he issued a clarification stating that someone had forged the press statement and made it viral due to which students and parents were being misled. In-charge examination controller B A Chaudhary also received the fake press statement through WhatsApp which was submitted before the Gandhinagar police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/teen-fakes-notice-on-board-exam-dates-to-fool-friends/articleshow/82039311.cms||---
---||Delhi||No exodus, but uptick in migrants leaving for home||NEW DELHI: On Monday morning, Rajesh Kumar was waiting in a queue to board a bus, careful to maintain a distance from others. The 21-year-old embroidery artist was returning to his village near Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh. The spurt in Covid-19 cases in Delhi has him worried and he says he will be back only when the situation improves. There’s a trickle of migrant workers now at the Anand Vihar inter-state bus terminal, which has been the busiest among the three ISBTs in the city after reopening in November last year following a long closure due to the pandemic and the lockdown. While Kumar said he was leaving the capital for a month, or a couple at most, because he is worried that he might get infected, Avdesh Pal, 26, another UP resident, did not have a happy option. “I work in a saria (iron rod) cutting unit in Kapashera,” Pal said. “Our employer told us last week that there wasn’t much work and asked some of us to leave. It won’t be easy finding work somewhere and I can’t pay my rent if I don’t get my wages.” Last year, he got stuck in Delhi without work after the lockdown and he had a hard time reaching his village. “Leaving Delhi is not an easy decision as employment opportunities back in my village are almost non-existent but there at least my relatives and neighbours won’t let me starve,” said Anil Kumar, 33, from a village near Unnao, UP. “In Delhi, no one will care about me if I were to face a situation like last year’s.” While some of those, like Rajesh Kumar, who had come to Anand Vihar ISBT on Monday were young and travelling light, there were also families resting under the many sheds at the bus terminal with baggage in tow. None of them, however, said that they were leaving due to the rise in Covid cases. Most of them said they were going to attend a family function in their village and some said they were going to oversee property-related matters or other personal work. While the ISBT is abuzz during the early morning hours, the sprawling terminal starts looking deserted after 11am with only a handful of passengers visible. Some bus conductors that TOI talked to said there wasn’t much rush at the ISBT and, in fact, filling buses later in the day took up a lot of time. Though there is no significant rush at the ISBT, there is adequate deployment of Civil Defence Volunteers and private security guards and the passenger flow, right from the entry point, is highly regulated to avoid any chance of crowding. Also, most of the passengers could be seen wearing face masks and following social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-exodus-but-uptick-in-migrants-leaving-for-home/articleshow/82038178.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Dehradun||U’khand HC sets aside orders giving additional charge of superintendent/senior superintendent of jails to police officers||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Monday set aside the orders issued by both the secretary home and IG Prisons which gave additional charge of senior superintendent and superintendent of jails to police officers who are also tasked with maintaining law and order. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has also directed the state government to immediately fill up these posts “either through direct recruitment, or through promotion”. The court said that since rules allow ad-hoc promotions as temporary measures, it “may be granted by the state till regular promotions are made”. The entire exercise, the court added, should be completed preferably within a month. The directions came as the court was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) challenging the decisions. The petition had challenged the two orders issued by home secretary Nitesh Kumar Jha which gave additional charge to the police officers as well as the order issued by IG (Prison),AP Anshuman, that directed the officers to take charge of their posts. The petition had said that the move “effectively blurs the line between the jails and the police department which are meant to be separate.” According to the petitioners, “handing over the charge of prisons to the police department goes against the fundamental principle of free and fair trial as an extra-judicial pressure might be put on the accused by the police department since they will be investigating the case and handling the judicial custody as well.” While setting aside the orders, the court held that they go against the ‘Nelson Mandela Rules’ issued by the United Nations as well as recommendations of various committees, Uttar Pradesh Jail (Group A and B) Services Rules 1982 and a letter written in 2009 by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) to the state governments recommending them to establish well-equipped training structures as well as filling up vacancies. “These committee recommendations and the Nelson Mandela Rules emphasise the need for carefully selecting the prison personnel,for providing rigorous training, both prior to their joining the service, and subsequent thereto, of the appointment being a full-time, regular appointment. It is only when these factors are inculcated in the prison administration that the prison system succeeds in protecting, reforming and rehabilitating the prisoners. Otherwise, it is a self-defeating proposition,” the court order read. The state government had argued that since Inspector General (Prison) and Additional Inspector General (Prison) posts can be filled from IPS cadre, therefore the appointments to the posts of superintendent and senior superintendent of jails can be made from police cadre. However, the court has held that the UP Jail Service Rules, 1982, provide a procedure for determination of vacancy,selection as well as promotion for filling up these posts and therefore these rules“cannot be deviated from”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-sets-aside-orders-giving-additional-charge-of-superintendent/senior-superintendent-of-jails-to-police-officers/articleshow/82037257.cms||Prashant Jha

The board announced on Monday that it will announce the new election date once the Covid-19 situation is under control. Elections were earlier scheduled to be held on April 25. GSHSEB received representations from parents’ organizations, educational and non-educational organizations to call off the elections where more than 80,000 persons are expected to vote. About 72 polling booths were to be set up in various cities for the elections. There are 5,576 voters in Ahmedabad city and 4,464 in rural Ahmedabad where four polling booths will be set up. The elections are to be held under new rules introduced by the state government through The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (Amendment) Act, 2020 in September, 2020. The new rules have reduced the number of elected members to the GSHSEB from twenty-six to nine. The elections for these members are to be held every three years. In the third week of March, various schools made representations to the education board to defer the elections due to the Covid-19 situation. The board had reiterated its stance by issuing a notification to hold elections on April 25 for electing nine members of the board. The state government has already directed the closure of on-campus studies for all schools in Gujarat. Campaigning for elections in such times could pose a major problem and hence the decision to postpone the elections, said sources in GSHSEB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gshseb-polls-deferred-indefinitely/articleshow/82039330.cms||---

On Monday, he and his team burnt 54 dead bodies including 41 of Covid victims. Overworked to the limit, the workers have developed blisters all over their hands. “This is the time to be on toes. Workers like Pradeep have continued their work of burning dead bodies even in such summer in such large numbers,” said secretary Bhadbhada crematorium, Mamtesh Sharma. Sharma said that other workers that include Mahendra, Rajesh and Dinesh who are in late 40s age group have also dedicated their whole time at Bhadbhada crematorium. “This is an unprecedented time for us all. The workers are the real Covid warriors. They have proved that humanity is still alive,” said Sharma. All the workers reach the crematorium at 7 in the morning. They collect the remains of the dead bodies for the next 3-4 hours and the collected mortal remain are handed over to the families waiting out. Their main work starts after 9 am when bodies start reaching the crematorium. “Setting up pyre with 4 quintal woods for one body is not a joke. This has become even cumbersome when one has to burn over 50 dead bodies daily. it is tough to understand the psychological level of these workers,” said Sharma. These workers work till 8 in the evening. "One of our workers had broken his leg after a 50 kg wood log collapsed on him. Thankfully, we could save his life. These workers are working for the society and people should respect them. There are around 20 such workers at the Bhadbhada crematorium,” added Sharma. Bhadbhada management has requested the district administration to recognise their work. “These should be given free vaccination. Their covid tests should be done regularly and they should be awarded with monetary support,” demanded Sharma. In all, 54 dead bodies were cremated at Bhadbhada on Monday. Of which 41 were corona body and 13 normal body. Of the 41 dead bodies of Corona, 25 were from Bhopal and 16 from outside. President of Bhadbhada crematorium, Arun Chaudhary said that 3 trucks of wood will come from Raisen in the night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/braving-blisters-injuries-to-ensure-dignity-to-dead/articleshow/82038182.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Rajkot||BJP leader held for aiding Donga||Rajot: A BJP leader from Jetpur was arrested by Bhuj police on Monday in the sensational case of gangster Nikhil Donga’s escape from police custody and subsequent arrest. Vipul Sanchaniya, secretary of BJP’s Jetpur unit, was held for allegedly helping Donga escape from the jail ward of GK General Hospital in Bhuj, Kutch. Sanchaniya is among the 13 accused arrested so far in the case, including four policemen. On March 29, Donga had escaped from the hospital prison ward. The gangster was arrested from Uttarakhand’s Nainital on April 1. Police investigation revealed Donga had been admitted to the hospital prison ward as part of his escape plan. Police informed that many persons, including 35-year-old Sanchaniya, helped Donga in planning and executing the escape. “Sanchaniya played a key role in arranging meetings between different people involved in this conspiracy. He also helped in fixing meetings between those involved in the plan and Donga inside the jail," police said. Police also informed that that two cops — PSI N K Bharwad and ASI Ali Mamad Osman Langa — who helped Donga’s escape have been arrested. Donga, a notorious historysheeter, was lodged in Bhuj’s Palara jail since last October after he was found having ‘dinner’ with his aides inside Gondal sub-jail in Rajkot. As per the police records, Donga was running an extortion racket from inside Gondal jail. He was booked under Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime (GujCTOC) Act.

---||Lucknow||Delayed response from command centre deepens crisis, rue citizens||Lucknow: The Integrated Covid Command Control Centre (ICCC) might be helping many Covid-19 patients daily, but there is also no dearth of complaints about inadequate or no response from the single window system established by the district administration to manage the pandemic in the city. The functions of the centre include addressing grievances of the Covid patients, providing medical assistance through helplines, monitoring contact tracing, maintaining records of the hospital and patients, and coordinating ambulances for shifting patients to the hospitals among others While officers claimed that ICCC helps 6,000-7,000 patients daily, many patients gave a thumbs down to the services. Common complaints include constantly busy phone lines, no quick response to contact tracing, and delay in allotment of ambulances and hospitals. Shobhna, Alambagh resident, blamed ICCC’s lack of response for the loss of her mother. “I took my 60-year-old mother to a nearby private hospital after she developed fever and breathlessness on April 8 where she tested positive for Covid-19. I called ICCC for help, but when calls went unattended, I brought mother home. On April 9 night, her oxygen levels started dropping. I called ICCC again, but lines were busy. I rushed her to the same hospital but she died on the way,” said Shobhna Ashish Awasthi, a businessman in Mahanagar, said “It took ICCC over eight hours from Sunday night to Monday morning to allot an ambulance for getting my parents admitted to the hospital. Both are above 70 years, comorbid and complained of breathlessness.” Vishwajit Kanaujia, a private executive, complained that he needed a referral to get his 80-year old father admitted to a Covid hospital in Gomtinagar on April 9. Journalists are receiving such desperate SOS calls daily from colleagues, family members and acquaintances. They, in turn, flood the WhatsApp group created by the district administration for mediapersons with requests to help the needy. The DM then directs officers in every case to take necessary action. “ICCC is working 24X7. Lines are often clogged due to thousands of calls. The shifting and referral of patients at times get delayed due to shortage of critical care beds in hospitals, manpower and ambulances. But we hope the situation will ease as ambulances have been doubled and beds being increased” said an officer. (With inputs from Pragati Shukla) No hosp can refuse emergency Covid patient: A senior KGMU faculty member said that in case of emergency, people can take Covid-19 patients to any hospital with emergency facilities. “No hospital can deny treatment. The administration has on the chief minister’s orders already directed hospitals to maintain a holding area where all treatment will be provided to the Covid-19 patients till a bed is allocated in a Covid hospital” he added. TIMES VIEW It has also been found that in many cases, people are not even aware of the ICCC numbers. They don’t save helpline numbers during the normal course and panic when the crisis struck. In the times of covid, one should read the educational material, guidelines and helpline information among others published in the newspapers to keep themselves updated with the latest and be ready for any eventuality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/delayed-response-from-command-centre-deepens-crisis-rue-citizens/articleshow/82040135.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Ugadi of the Telugus, Gudi Padwa of the Marathis and Chetti Chand of the Sindhis are some of the celebrations lined up on Tuesday while Vishu Kani of the Malayalis, Puthandu of the Tamilians, Baisakhi of the Punjabis and Rongali Bihu of the Assamese will be celebrated on Wednesday, followed by Poila Baisakh of the Bengalis on Thursday. However, most will keep it a low-key affair because of the rising Covid count, cancelling community events and switching to the virtual mode wherever possible. Many have cancelled visits to extended families, friends and relatives. Instead, clothes, sweets and gifts will be sent via delivery apps and video calls will replace physical meetings. Most of the cancellations of community events happened over the past few days. Since the celebrations were curbed last year due to the lockdown, grand celebrations had been planned this year. Though there is sadness over the cancelled events, people feel it is better to be safe than sorry. The Andhra Association of Kolkata has shifted the physical Ugadi event to the virtual platform. “At the virtual meet, we will have the Panchanga Shravanam, where the year’s almanac is read out and the puja will be streamed live. At home, we will prepare the Ugadi Pathadi, a solution of the bitter, sweet and sour fruits of the season,” said Srinivas Vedula, a spokesperson of the association.. The Sindhis have cancelled the community fair for Chetti Chand. The day is also celebrated as the birthday of Lord Jhulelal. “The Amrit Vela Mandir will not have congregational prayers and devotees will move in a single file, maintaining social distance,” said community spokesperson Nanik Samtani. The Chetti Chand celebration organized by Punjab Club every year has also been cancelled. The club will take a final call on the Baisakhi celebrations after a meeting on Tuesday. The Tamilians and Malayalis are also restricting celebrations to their homes. “There is a lot of similarity between the new year celebrations of the two communities. For both Puthandu and Vishu Kani, a tray of fruits is kept overnight in front of the mirror, to be viewed first thing in the morning. Children normally go to visit elders, which will not happen this time,” said S Ramani Iyer. The Tamil Association will have muted events and the puja will be streamed online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/celebrations-toned-down-as-cov-shadow-looms-over-new-year/articleshow/82038223.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Only seven (1.2%) intensive care unit/ventilators out of 574 in Covid hospitals were available for Covid-19 patients in the city as on Monday afternoon. These beds were available only at TSM Medical College while ICUs of remaining 30 Covid hospitals were full. Over 700 beds were added in the last 24 hours by enhancing the capacity of existing hospitals and conversion of a couple of other units into Covid facilities. The total number of beds in all the 31 Covid hospitals taken together at around 4pm was 3,469, according to hospital status report of the district health authorities. However, as hospitalisations spiked due to rise in new cases, the number of patients under treatment reached 2,365 by the afternoon. Of the 3,469 beds in city’s Covid hospitals, 1,679 are isolation beds, 1,126 high dependency units (HDUs) and 574 ICUs/ventilators. Overall, at least 1,104 (32%) beds were vacant. Availability of isolation beds was better as 949 (57%) of the total were vacant. However, HDUs were under pressure with only 148 (13%) vacancies. The situation was toughest in the ICU category. Isolation beds are for mild cases, HDU for serious and ICUs for critical patients. Since serious and critical cases take some time to recover, HDUs and ICUs remain occupied for a longer period. Trained and qualified staff, that too more in number, is required to manage HDUs and ICUs. In many hospitals, healthcare professionals and staff have also been infected putting pressure on manpower. Currently, the crisis is mainly of the ICU, which, authorities said would be increased further. Overall, the number of Covid hospitals in the city have been increased to 31, almost double than the last week’s figures. The strength of beds has been increased by three times in the same period. However, last seven days have witnessed exponential growth in Covid cases with an average of about 2,000 daily. Nearly 80% of these patients are asymptomatic and 15% with mild symptoms, while average 5-7% are serious or critical and require hospitalisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-hospitals-grapple-with-shortage-of-icu-beds-amid-rising-load-of-patients/articleshow/82040137.cms||---

The farmers had earlier demanded MSP of Rs 2,000/quintal, but have raised it now in view of a rise in the cost of production due to a sharp increase in fuel prices and seeds among others, said the association on Monday. The demand comes amid a continuous drop in the wholesale prices of onions at the agricultural produce market committees (APMCs) across the state. The average wholesale onion price has reduced to Rs 750 per quintal during the last few days. The Centre procures onions through Nafed to create buffer stock under the price stability fund (PSF) to tackle possible scarcity between August and September. It usually starts procuring the produce by April-end or from the first week of May. Onion farmers are disappointed due to continuous drop in the average wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon APMC, the country’s largest wholesale onion market. Association president Bharat Dighole said there has been an increase in the prices of seeds, fertilisers, rent for various tractor-mounted farming activities and labour cost in the last few years. “The cost of production for one quintal onions has increased to Rs 1,600/ quintal from Rs 1,000/quintal around a few years back,” he said. Dighole said that farmers have been incurring huge losses due to the fall in prices at the wholesale markets and increase in cost of production. “The government will have to do something to bail the onion farmers out of the financial crisis, otherwise they will have to stop selling the produce to Nafed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rs-3k/quintal-msp-or-we-wont-sell-onions-to-nafed-farmers/articleshow/82036532.cms||Tushar Pawar

In October 2020, Goswami was asked to appear before ACP Sudhir Jambhavadekar, also a special executive magistrate (SEM), but instead his lawyer Abad Ponda represented his case and filed a vakalatnama. Police had initiated chapter proceedings against Goswami under CrPC Section 108 and the SEM issued a show-cause notice asking him why he should not be asked to execute a bond of good behaviour under this section. In the notice, police cited two of Goswami’s news reports—the lynching of sadhus at Palghar and the gathering of migrants outside Bandra station during the lockdown—which had allegedly created communal disharmony. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-closes-chapter-proceedings-against-arnab/articleshow/82040160.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Power tariffs rise for consumers in Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar||AHMEDABAD: Torrent Power Limited (TPL)’s consumers having electricity consumption of more than 50 units in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar will have to pay more for the electricity they consume during 2021-22. There will, however, be no increase in tariff for consumers of the state-run Uttar Gujarat Vij Company Limited (UGVCL). Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) has approved raising of the energy charges for TPL’s residential consumers having monthly consumption between 51 to 200 units per month by 5 paise per unit. “Power tariffs for all the remaining consumers, including residential consumers consuming electricity above 200 units per month are increased by 10 paise per unit,” the state power regulator said in a release issued on Monday. The revised tariffs are applicable to TPL’s Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar supply area. GERC, however, has kept the power tariffs unchanged for below poverty line (BPL) consumers and small residential consumers in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar who consume power upto 50 units per month. About 18% of TPL’s total consumers are covered under this category. Similarly, there is no change in tariff for consumers covered under General Light Purpose (GLP) category, which includes charitable and not for profit institutions such as charitable hospitals, schools, crematoriums, and religious institutions. “The electricity bill for those consuming 200 units will increase by about Rs 7.5 per month, while the hike works out to be Rs 17 per month for the minimum consumption of 300 units. Even those consumers who consume more than 200 units, the first 50 units will not attract the new tariffs as electricity rates for the first 50 units has been kept unchanged,” explained sources in the energy sector. According to the state power regulator, the revision in power tariffs for TPL consumers were necessitated to allow recovery of the company’s past dues. In its petition regarding determination of power tariff for 2021-22, TPL had proposed to levy a regulatory charge of 19 paise per unit from consumers in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar supply area to make up for the past under recoveries. The tariff orders for TPL and UGVCL were earlier put on hold due to the code of conduct in the wake of Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation elections, which has now been postponed considering the surge in Covid-19 cases in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/power-tariffs-rise-for-consumers-in-city-gandhinagar/articleshow/82039344.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Question on media credibility rejected||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Monday rejected the state government’s claim that media reports on the current Covid-19 situation are exaggerated, lopsided and sometimes fake.In its suo motu PIL, the HC cited various media reports depicting the present situation and the problems being faced by common people due to shortage of medicines, hospital beds and ICUs. The advocate general questioned the reliability of the media reports and blamed the media for not reporting the good work done by doctors and officials, who burn the midnight oil in this pandemic.The AG gave details of total Covid beds in Ahmedabad and in the state. Total 141 hospitals have been acquired for Covid treatment and total beds are 6,283. He said that 5,022 beds were occupied and over 1,000 beds were empty. He also told the court that only 7% beds in Covid care centres for the asymptomatic was occupied. Across the state, there are 71,021 Covid beds in total 1,127 hospitals.After giving these details, advocate general Kamal Trivedi told the court, “I question the media where is the shortage? The pandemic has grown, but this does not mean that total health infrastructure has gone to dogs. Government is working hard and the officials need to be appreciated. The press should act honourably and honestly.”The chief justice refuted the government’s charge against the media. After a prolonged discussion on Covid situation, Justice Vikram Nath said that he does not watch Gujarati channels because he does not follow the local language, but he reads two newspapers with national presence. “Every day there are 8-10 reports. This is not good. These newspapers with their reputation would not be reporting baseless reports. There would be some sense of journalism.

---||Hyderabad||Former AP judge gets relief as SC closes HC investigation||Hyderabad: Former judge of the Andhra Pradesh high court, Justice V Eswaraiah, who is present chairman of Andhra Pradesh Higher Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission, got relief when the Supreme Court on Monday ended the ongoing inquiry of retired SC judge RV Raveendran against him. The probe had been ordered by the AP high court to ascertain the authenticity of an alleged telephonic conversation that took place between suspended magistrate from AP S Ramakrishna and Justice Eswaraiah. However, judges of the apex court said the probe was unwarranted. “Calling for a report from Justice Raveendran need not be allowed to continue and hence we are ordering the closure of this probe,” said a bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice R Subhash Reddy, while disposing of the petition filed by Justice Eswaraiah. The bench said: “When the petitioner himself has filed the transcript, we are of the view that if the AP high court intends to refer to the above transcript, the same can be done only after giving an opportunity to Justice Eswaraiah. The high court ought not to have embarked on any other inquiry in the matter except to the maintainability of the PIL,” the SC bench said in its order. The former judge had challenged the decision of the HC for proceeding against him without issuing him a notice. When an officer from the HC registry died during the thick of the pandemic last year, a PIL was filed charging the HC administration with ignoring the Covid-19 protocols and putting staff in danger. It was in this petition, the suspended magistrate had sought to implead himself and brought in the telephonic conversation issue. The high court had ordered a probe by Justice Raveendran to ascertain the authenticity and genuineness of the transcript of the conversation. Justice Eswaraiah filed a transcript of the conversation he had with Ramakrishna before the apex court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/former-ap-judge-gets-relief-as-sc-closes-hc-investigation/articleshow/82038669.cms||---

On April 13, 2019, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation’s enforcement wing had removed the statue from Panjagutta area stating that permission was not granted to install the statue at that spot. Later, Hanumanth Rao got another statue of Ambedkar but before he could install it, even this was taken away by cops. Speaking to reporters, Hanumanth Rao said he was willing to sacrifice his life for re-installation of the statue at the same spot in Panjagutta. “Can the statue of the architect of the Constitution be kept in a police station? Is it not an insult to the great personality?,” he asked.

In its suo motu PIL, the high court attached a news article about distribution of injections in Surat. In defence, advocate general Kamal Trivedi submitted, “In fact, it was an attempt to do a charity out of sheer enthusiasm. This was not with an intention to create any malice. The idea was to see that people are helped out.” While the judges were hearing the submissions quietly, the government law officer asserted that there is everything on record to show how and from where the stock was procured. “They are legally obtained injections and given free of charge,” he argued and then submitted, “Perhaps, this could have been avoided…but what is wrong in it.” On Sunday, when people kept running from pillar to post to procure remdesivir, Paatil insisted that he had done nothing wrong by procuring huge stock. Chief minister Vijay Rupani also skirted a question over the controversy sparked by Paatil managing such a huge supply of schedule-H drug. Paatil blamed the Congress party for fuelling the row.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-defends-paatils-remdesivir-procurement/articleshow/82038229.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||BJP leaders will have to flee if we go on offensive: KT Rama Rao||WARANGAL: TRS working president and minister KT Rama Rao warned BJP leaders over using objectionable language against chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. He said that TRS leaders will not keep quiet if opponents abuse the chief minister. Stating that it was the last warning, KTR said some oppoents were abusing the CM without taking his age and stature into consideration. “Right from Amit Shah to local BJP leaders criticising the chief minister, if we start a counter-attack, BJP leaders will have to flee,” he said. KTR alleged that some opposition parties were instigating unemployed youth that Sunil Naik had ended his life after similar instigation. Urging unemployed youth not to resort to extreme steps, the TRS working president said the government would soon issue notifications for filling up 50,000 vacancies in various government departments.The minister participated in various developmental works in Warangal municipal corporation limits on Monday. He said BJP leaders should tell how many jobs were given by the Centre in the past few years. “The TRS government would come up with a white paper on the funds released to Warangal in the past six years. Will BJP leaders bring double the amount from the Centre for development of Warangal?” KTR said. The minister said the state government would bring metro rail to Warangal city and ensure Mamunoor airport is made operational soon. Attacking the Centre for its alleged lack of support for Telangana’s various welfare schemes, he said the state had paid Rs 2.73 lakh crore towards taxes but in turn the Centre gave only Rs 1.4 lakh crore to the state in tax devolution. Addressing a public meeting at Fort Warangal, KTR said, “The state government has fulfilled the promise of daily water supply scheme for citizens of Warangal. The project was taken up with Rs 1,589 crores at Rampur for the daily water scheme.” KTR said that Rs 300 crore was allocated to Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (GWMC) every year in the state budget for all-round development of the city. He assured that TRS will turn Warangal into futuristic city with the best living conditions in the country. Meanwhile, ABVP students tried to obstruct the TRS working president’s convoy in Deshaipet in Warangal town. The students were demanding jobs for educated graduates. However, police around the convoy managed tp push them away and clear the route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-leaders-will-have-to-flee-if-we-go-on-offensive-ktr/articleshow/82038569.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna
---||Hyderabad||HC questions data used to lower BC quota in local polls||Hyderabad: The high court on Monday expressed displeasure over the laxity of officials in filing counters in a plea pertaining to BC quota in panchayat and other local body elections. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a batch of petitions filed questioning the reduction of the number of seats earmarked for BCs from the earlier 34% to the current 22%. The state counsel could not give a satisfactory answer as to why the principal secretary, panchayat raj department, could not file his counter despite the passage of two years since the pleas were filed. Appearing for one of the petitioners, Samala Ravinder, his counsel Dharmesh Jaiswal said the state has given a go by to the scientific collection of data before determining quota for BCs in each election. The data was to be collected and compiled by the state backward classes (BC) commission, but the state entrusted the task to Telangana Backward Classes Cooperative Finance Corporation, which was against the rules. Later, it finally claimed that it was relying on the 2011 Census data, Dharmesh said. To a pointed query from the bench, the state’s additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao said that they had relied on the data furnished by the BC Commission. The bench asked him to file an affidavit that the material being relied upon by them was furnished to them by the competent commission. “Show us the surveys you conducted and the material you relied upon on April 19,” the bench said adjourned the case to that date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-questions-data-used-to-lower-bc-quota-in-local-polls/articleshow/82038641.cms||---

He alleged that CM K Chandrasekhar Rao did not respond when an unemployed youth, Sunil Naik, ended his life last week when he failed to secure a job. He said the pink party did not keep its promise of providing at least one job to each household. The BJP president, who participated in road shows in Peddavura mandal and other places as part of the campaign for Ravi Naik in the Nagarjunsagar bypoll on Monday, attacked the TRS chief for cheating people. Sanjay said overall development of Nagarjunasagar would be possible only with BJP. In other programmes at places like Nellikallu, ex-MP and BJP leader Vijayashanti said KCR had promised that a Dalit would be made chief minister once separate Telangana was achieved. She said the CM made promise that he would not seek votes if Mission Bhagiratha was not completed, but now he was seeking votes without completing the project. “If people vote for Congress candidate in this election, the vote will become stale,” Vijayashanti said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-did-not-keep-its-promise-on-jobs-bandi/articleshow/82038748.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Civic data shows just 60 ICU beds are currently free in Mumbai out of the total 2,542 designated for Covid. Chahal said of the 125 ICU beds, 50 would be operationalised in BMC-run Seven Hills Hospital and 25 at the Nesco jumbo centre in Goregaon. The rest would be added in private hospitals. In addition, there are plans to operationalise 1,100 beds in dedicated Covid health care centres (DCHC) and dedicated Covid facilities (DCH). A senior ward official said instructions have been issued that no ICU bed should be directly allotted by the civic ward war room till a BMC medical team has visited a patient’s home to check. “The civic ward team may not be able to visit during night hours, so such patients would need to be referred to a jumbo facility and doctors there will be expected to assess the patient and decide which type of bed is to be allotted. This step is being taken so that ICU beds are allotted only to those who are in real need of the same,” said a senior official.  Most leading private hospitals have already run out of beds. Of the 60 vacant ICU beds in the city, 34 are in private hospitals and 26 in public. The board outside L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, said on Monday that no ICU beds were available. The hospital had increased Covid beds from 95 to 125, and ICU beds from 16 to 20. “At any given point, there are 3- 4 people waiting for a Covid bed to vacate. The situation is stressful,” said CEO Dr Sujit Chatterjee, adding they have begun recruiting junior doctors to help out the team of senior doctors. Similarly, in Andheri’s Holy Spirit Hospital, executive director Sneha Joseph said their Covid beds have increased from 125 to 150. “Most ICU beds are now dedicated to Covid care and almost all are full. The new ward we started filled up the same evening,” she said. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said private beds are being constantly augmented too. “Most affected in the second wave are people from rich and middle-class families who prefer private hospitals over public and that is creating the demand ,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-to-add-125-icu-beds-in-a-week-to-be-allotted-after-med-team-visits/articleshow/82036865.cms||Richa Pinto

The judge made it clear that all the pleas will go before a roster judge, who was on leave on Monday. As the high court is closed for the next two days, the petitions may not yield any of their intended purposes when they are taken up after two days. While one petition was filed by Ch Saidaiah and Danavath Kiran Kumar from Nalgonda district, the other petition was filed by Goli Saidi Reddy and Srinivas Reddy objecting to the conduct of the CM’s public meet in their land at Anumula without obtaining their consent and without allegedly following Covid-19 protocols. Objecting to the pleas that were filed at the last minute, advocate general BS Prasad said that this was an election being conducted by the Election Commission of India which is holding bypolls and assembly polls in several parts of the country. In fact, in states like West Bengal, both prime minister and the Union home minister themselves were participating in public meetings and addressing people. Even for Nagarjunasagar bypoll, several parties like BJP and Congress have held public meetings and petitioners did not file any objections at the time. “When TRS is readying for a public meet with CM planning to address people, these petitions are cropping up,” he said. “We will follow all Covid-19 protocols and conduct the meet,” the AG said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/judge-refuses-to-pass-order-on-pleas-against-poll-campaigning/articleshow/82038846.cms||---

Of these, 387 were found to be Covid-positive—or 4.3%. According to WHO norms, detection of less than 5% indicates that there is reasonable prevention and it is not widespread in the organisation.” Covid cases among frontline workers in the undertaking have already crossed the 3,000-mark and the death toll 90. There were 3,218 Covid cases in the undertaking, 3,115 of whom had recovered. Families of staffers who died have got ex-gratia of Rs 50 lakh each, Dr Singal said. “We have also provided job to the next of kin of 74 staffers,” he added. While 97% staffers have recovered after hospitalisation, BEST is keen that all employees, including drivers and conductors, receive vaccines.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra considers ban on e-commerce non-essentials in lockdown||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government is said to be considering the demand of traders to prohibit the sale of non-essential goods on e-commerce platforms to create a level playing field if retail shops remain closed in the proposed lockdown, sources said. Senior officials, though, are of the view that such a step will serve no purpose in breaking the chain of transmission in the pandemic. E-commerce supply of non-essentials was not permitted for the bulk of the national lockdown in 2020. Trader bodies have demanded that this time too e-commerce platforms should not be allowed to sell non-essentials if retail shops stocking non-essentials remain closed. Last week, trader organisations had threatened a state-wide agitation if this demand was ignored. “We are hopeful that the government will be fair to us,” said Viren Shah of the Federation of Retail Traders’ Welfare Association, which represents 3.5 lakh shops in the city. Senior officials are against the move. “The primary reason to restrict any activity in a lockdown is to break the chain of transmission. Activities should not be stopped because one section views it as unfair,” said one. Officials said the sale of non-essentials on e-commerce platforms also provides employment to locals. “Local units are involved in the manufacture and transport of such goods even though they are sold on e-commerce platforms,” said one. As the government works out the contours of the proposed lockdown, it is clear public transport will stay open. “But the aim will be to reduce the number of people venturing out. Transport links will stay open if people want to travel within the city to other districts or return to other states,” said an official. Officials said public should not rush to hoard essentials in anticipation of a lockdown since these will be freely available. “Since transport links will not be stopped, there will be no problem in supply of essentials.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-bar-non-essentials-e-biz-says-traders/articleshow/82037074.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Bhuse held a meeting on Monday to assess the Covid situation in the district. “Covid patients and deaths are rising in rural areas. Those in serious condition are forced to come to Nashik for further treatment. Therefore, health treatment should be strengthened in rural areas,” he said. Malegaon corporation and sub-district hospital of Malegaon cater to patients from the surrounding rural areas. “It is, therefore, important that a steady supply of oxygen for hospitals in Malegaon is maintained. The oxygen support to the private hospitals should also be ensured by way of refilling supplies through the jumbo or dura cylinders,” he said. “The administration should strengthen the DCHC at Manmad so that the flow of patients to Malegaon decreases marginally and people get treatment in time,” he said. Meanwhile, in a meeting district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal said “Niphad has a large number of cases and authorities need to ensure there is no Covid death.

Fresh dates for these exams will be announced accordingly. We’ll also be writing to the CBSE, CICSE, IB, Cambridge boards, requesting them to reconsider their exams dates,” she said. Over 30 lakh students appear for the HSC and SSC exams in the state each year. Over the last few weeks there has been a growing demand from parents and students to cancel or postpone the board exams. However, the decision to postpone the papers hasn’t appeased some groups. “The government must opt for internal assessment as the situation is unpredictable. There is a lot of stress among parents and students. The Centre must intervene and announce a uniform decision for all its students,” said Anubha Sahai, a member of the IndiaWide Parents Association.

Additional district health officer Dr Ravindra Chaudhary said the district, on average, administers about 15,000 vaccines every day. “With the earlier stock, we would have been able to vaccinate beneficiaries till Wednesday. The additional vaccine doses will allow us to continuously vaccinate beneficiaries till the weekend,” Dr Chaudhary said. The district on Monday received 45,000 Covishield vaccine doses, which were distributed to the Nashik Municipal Corporation, the Malegaon Municipal Corporation and Nashik Rural areas. On Monday, there were fewer vaccination sites operational — 132 session sites out of a possible 200 — as the number of doses was on the lower side. Some centres were also closed on Sunday to give the staff a break. “The focus was on keeping the sites witnessing larger beneficiary turnouts running,” Dr Chaudhary added. “We received 13,000 vaccine doses on Monday and are likely to get another 12,000 doses on Tuesday. Appropriate number of vaccine centres would be started then,” said Ajita Salunkhe, who is coordinating for the NMC vaccine centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-district-gets-fresh-vaccine-doses/articleshow/82036563.cms||---

The inauguration was done through a video conferencing session, which was also attended by Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank. CM Rawat and Pandey interacted with the youth participating in the Skill India Fair and asked them to motivate others towards skill development. Rawat emphasized the need to pay special attention to the skill development of women self-help groups and link the skill development programme with the self-reliant India initiative and the 'Vocal for Local' campaign. The CM said that “we all should make a united effort to ensure that Skill India pavilion gives a direction to the youth of the country”. He added that agriculture, horticulture, food processing, tourism, especially adventure tourism, and IT are the key sectors that should be focused on in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/skill-development-pavilion-inaugurated-cm-says-need-to-pay-special-attention-to-skill-development-of-women-self-help-groups/articleshow/82037347.cms||Kautilya Singh

According to the Met office, light rain, thunderstorm and snowfall is likely to occur at isolated places in Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Bageshwar, Pithoragarh, Dehradun and Almora districts. Rohit Thapliyal, senior scientist at Met centre, said, “A fresh western disturbance is active over Uttarakhand and as a result, rain and thunderstorm activity will be witnessed in both hills and plains in next few days.” Thapliyal added that the intensity of the rain and thunderstorm activity is going to increase on April 16 and 17 covering many places of the state. The high altitude areas are likely to receive light snowfall during the same period. Meanwhile, the maximum temperatures in both hills and plains are settling above normal level while the minimum is hovering around normal as well. For instance, the maximum temperature in Dehradun was recorded at 36.1 degree Celsius, four notches above normal. However, the Met officials have claimed that the rain and thunderstorm activity will have negligible impact on the temperatures and the mercury is likely to hover around the same level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rain-snow-in-the-offing-in-ukhand-during-this-week/articleshow/82037350.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Manubhai Chudasama ended life by consuming poisonous substance on the outskirts of Hanuman Khijadiya village on Sunday. His elder brother, Dhana Chudasma, lodged a complaint against Machharam Bavaji and his aide Anubhai, both from Rajkot’s Jetpur town, accusing the duo of abetting his younger brother’s suicide. According to case details, Manubhai’s son Siddharth was in love with accused Manchharam’s daughter Payal, who went missing a few days ago. So, Manchharam threatened to kill Manubhai if his daughter did not return. Following the threat by Manchharam and his aide, Manubhai allegedly ended his life, Dhana stated in his police complaint.

---||Chennai||Offer perks for taking jab, experts tell govt||Chennai: The new goal is administering at least 2 lakh doses of the vaccine daily, nearly doubling the number administered so far on the best days, health secretary J Radhakrishnan announced last week, but hesitancy about the vaccine remains a hurdle. Aware that getting as many people as possible vaccinated will be critical to containing the pandemic and allowing a return to a more normal way of life, public health analysts, virologists and infectious diseases experts offer three ways to beat hesitancy. Create awareness, improve accessibility Right messages about vaccines should stare out of billboards and blare out through public address systems, says former director of public health Dr K Kolandaisamy. Since many people want to avoid hospitals and crowded places, vaccination camps should be held in schools, anganwadi centres, meeting halls or open grounds of residential complexes, parks and workplaces. The government should update its web pages on where the vaccine will be available every day. VHNs too will be able to effectively do door-to-door canvassing in parts of the state. If people avoid vaccines because they want to wait for one brand, they should be told that the efficacy levels of both the vaccines are good. Offer privileges to those vaccinated Those who have taken at least one dose of the vaccine, and others who have taken the second dose at the right interval, says infectious diseases expert Dr Subramanian Swaminathan, should get privileges in entry to places of worship, tourist spots, or while booking movie tickets. They should, however, follow pandemic protocols. It should be announced that vaccine certificates will be required for all international travel. Though people can be infected even after two doses of the vaccine, they will not have severe disease. While natural immunity comes with the infection, vaccines can trigger antibodies – which can fight the virus – without risk of morbidity or mortality. No vaccine, no compensation for severe disease/death While vaccination is voluntary, public health experts say the government must tell healthcare providers and frontline staff that there will be no paid medical leave, reimbursement for severe treatment at private hospitals in case of severe Covid symptoms if they skip taking the vaccine. They should also not be compensated with cash in case they die of the viral infection. There is adequate scientific evidence that the vaccines offer up to 80% protection against the infection and prevent severe disease. The most informed people cannot have hesitancy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/offer-perks-for-taking-jab-experts-tell-govt/articleshow/82038246.cms||---

After making arrangements for the moon sighting at Aishbagh Eidgah on Monday amid Covid-19 protocol, head of the Sunni Markazi Chaand Committee Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali said, “Moon for the holy month of Ramzan was not sighted on Monday which means the first roza will be on April 14.” Head of Shia Markazi Chaand Committee Maulana Saif Abbas also confirmed the same. With the month of Ramzan commences the long period of fasting from dawn to dusk and worship for Muslims across the world. Both Shia and Sunni clerics have been making appeals to people to adhere to Covid protocol, wear face masks and maintain social distancing. Earlier, the Islamic Centre of India had issued a 12-point advisory asking Muslims to offer ‘taraweeh’ – an elaborate Namaz offered by Sunnis during Ramzan – at the mosque and allow only 100 people at mosques and during Iftar (meal at sunset to break the fast). The advisory had also prohibited the use of loudspeakers at the time of sehri (meal at dawn to begin the fast). However, after the government restricted the number of devotees to five at religious places, the devotees have been advised to pray from homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ramzan-month-to-begin-tomorrow/articleshow/82040230.cms||Aditi Singh

Patients from neighbouring talukas have begun pouring in and this has worried municipal officials at the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC). Councillors of the GMC, led by its opposition leader Shailendrasingh Bihola, has represented before the state government and the municipal commissioner to turn the exhibition facility in Sector 17 into a temporary Covid care centre. Bihola wrote in his representation, “The Sector 17 exhibition domes have AC, electricity and are quite spacious and can house Covid patients.” Over the past fortnight many residential areas in Raisan and Radhesan are seeing almost 300 active Covid patients. The new Gandhinagar area has almost 1,500 active cases. “A majority of the dwellings in new Gandhinagar are apartments which has led to the rapid spread of the disease,” says a GMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/turn-exhibition-area-into-covid-centre/articleshow/82038245.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘High prevalence rates suggest variants driving current surge’||A study on seropositivity across 12 cities in India threw up sharp differences in growth rates across different age groups. Because the sample drawn from private labs is more likely to represent relatively wealthier people and those with health concerns, researchers led by epidemiologist Prabhat Jha also calculated prevalence in the 12 cities based on mortality data for Covid-19 for the same time period. They estimated a prevalence of 43-60% in those over 20 years in these cities, with 9-12 infected adults for every confirmed case. The findings broadly align with sero-surveys in Delhi and Mumbai, said Sandeep Juneja, a senior professor at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research who has led Mumbai sero-surveys and is not associated with this study. The high prevalence rates suggest variants are driving the current surge since widespread infection is usually thought to bring herd immunity. It’s also possible that mild infections last year led to fewer deaths but also a lower protective effect, said Jha, who is director of the Centre for Global Health Research in Toronto. “Low levels of infection may be like a shoddy vaccination that doesn’t really work.” The study found antibodies peaked in those aged 14, declined by 20, and rose again to peak in the 60-70 year group —-an “M-shaped pattern” that suggests intergenerational transmission, said Jha. In some countries, antibodies are highest among young adults, but in countries with multigenerational homes, like India and Brazil, the entire family gets infected, he noted. People in their 20s, who are most likely to be living away from family, had lower positivity rates. This is an important finding, said health and development economist Anup Malani, who was not associated with the study. “The role of intergenerational transmission tells us about the value of lockdowns for protecting the elderly,” he said. Moreover, while seropositivity rates rose in all age groups between July and December, fastest growth was in those under 20 and the 20-44 age group, suggesting younger people were driving transmission. The study, still in the pre-print stage, tries to throw insight on what Jha calls the “paradox of widespread infection and low mortality” in India. India was among the top in Covid-19 cases last year but had relatively few deaths compared to Europe and America, leading some to suggest there were a large number of hidden deaths. Jha’s analysis of the mortality data in the 12 cities suggests that is not the case in urban areas: the cities were chosen for their good death registry systems, and the mortality data was adjusted for under-reporting. Higher death counts would have translated into “implausibly high” infection rates, Jha says. Researchers also looked for, and did not find, any associations between seropositivity and migration, age structure of the population, or PM 2.5 levels. They did find a small 6% decline in seropositivity in areas where there had been an increase in childhood vaccination for measles in 2014-15. “It’s possible that kids who were vaccinated were more resistant to Covid-19 and that helped reduce transmission to adults, too,” said Jha. The finding was “speculative”, he noted, but did suggest background immunity may play a role. Malani, a professor at the University of Chicago who has led serosurveys in India, said while the study sample was not representative of the urban population—being a self-referred group able to afford a private laboratory test—its size and the detailed analysis offers insights on seroprevalence across cities and time. The study provides more evidence that antibodies wane over time, Malani noted, since seroprevalence rates fell in some cities by end of year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-high-prevalence-rates-suggest-variants-driving-current-surge/articleshow/82039382.cms||Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar
---||Ahmedabad||Cut trust deficit over Covid battle, court tells government||Ahmedabad: During the hearing of a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) on the Covid-19 surge, the Gujarat high court on Monday observed that there is a trust deficit among people in relation to the government’s efforts to control the pandemic. The court said that the people and the government should make joint efforts to deal with the situation. To the state government’s assertion that its officials are working 24 hours through the week, and the media does not give due credit to them, the high court observed that the state government has made efforts, but it has to make them in a comprehensive manner. “People should feel that work is being done. At present, there is total deficit of trust in the mind of people,” Justice Bhargav Karia said. “Today, people feel that nothing is happening, and they are at the mercy of the Almighty. The trust has to be restored.” Justice Karia made some suggestions to the government to control the spread of the disease. One was the enforcement of Covid norms to break the infection chain. He suggested that one person from each residential society be given the responsibility to ensure that people follow the standard operating procedures (SOPs). That person should also be given the power to act, he said. Upon the person’s call, police should get into action immediately. Officials will not be required to do unnecessary running around if such an initiative is launched. The judge enumerated the government’s efforts made last year to contain the Covid spread. Of an aggressive tracing and isolation strategy, he said: “This time you have given up hopes. It appears like that. Last time, it was vigorously pursued.” The government, however, continued to maintain that its strategy is the same. Justice Karia highlighted the need to rope in religious outfits — such as the Swaminarayan sect, Muslim trusts, and churches — as well as NGOs which can set up Covid care centres, community kitchens, and medical facilities for groups of people. The judge observed that there is a gap between the people and the government at present. “Today, the government is cursing the people and the people are cursing the government,” the judge said. “This is not solving the issue. We have to work in a harmonious way to fight this pandemic.” When the state government made a detailed presentation about the measures being taken, Chief Justice Vikram Nath interrupted. “We are not happy with certain policies of the state government, which need to be corrected and placed in order,” he said. “We have tried to indicate this. I hope you get it. The government machinery is doing its best. There is no doubt about it, but some things need to be corrected and with those corrections, things will go much better and will help in the larger public interest.” The chief justice also said it is the common people’s trust that is important and not the services that the VIPs get and what they feel about the government’s work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cut-trust-deficit-over-covid-battle-court-tells-government/articleshow/82038261.cms||---

At least 72 people lost their battle for life. According to official bulletin, the total cases in the state have reached 7,05,619 of which 76,670 cases have been added in April alone. Though the number of cases on Monday declined as compared to Sunday’s figures, officials said the dip was due to a decrease in the number of samples tested in 24 hours. The total number of active cases is 81,576 of which about 44,000 are under home isolation while the remaining are in hospitals. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said 3,197 recoveries took the total number of recovered patients to 6,14,819. While growing cases continued to exert pressure on the state’s health infrastructure, the number of deaths emerged as another cause for concern. As many as 72 lives were lost across the state in the last 24 hours taking the total to 13,685. Alarmed over the surge, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed officials to increase RT-PCR tests from an average of 90,000 to 1.5 lakh over the next few days. Reviewing medical infrastructure, the CM asked officials to increase beds in Lucknow, Prayagraj and Varanasi. He also appealed to the people to stay at home and move out only in emergency. “Festivals are starting from Tuesday but people should celebrate indoors,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/with-13685-fresh-cases-ups-covid-tally-crosses-7-lakh-in-past-24-hours/articleshow/82040237.cms||Shailvee Sharda

At present, there are 5,130 beds at Athipattu, of which 450 are occupied. Another 50 patients have been admitted to Victoria students hostel in Presidency College. “Last year, when more than 2,000 cases a day were reported, the number of patients admitted to Covid care centres did not cross 5,000. We have already proposed 11,775 beds in 13 facilities. This will be scaled up to 20,000 in the coming weeks. Hospitals will tie up with these centres and send the asymptomatic patients to these centres,” said Meghanath Reddy, deputy commissioner. Until November, the civic body had taken over 52 colleges, 24 schools, 74 government, aided and private schools and tied up with 60 hotels for paid accommodation. When the announcement of colleges reopening came in November, the buildings were returned. But Athipattu, K P Park slum tenement and Guindy trade centre were retained.

Let the Union government send some proposal and morcha leaders will decide on it as the matter concerns the farmers of the country, he said. “The SKM will never shy away from talks. We know that talks are the only way to find a solution and the central government must decide on when to hold them. They cannot be held with any pre-conditions, these (talks) should be unconditional,” he said while speaking during a live session of the SKM’s IT cell forum. Regarding the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s previous offer of “the government is a phone call away and let the farmers make that call”, Tikait said it was regarding the Centre’s offer of putting the three contentious farm laws, against which the farmers are protesting, on hold for 18 months. “We had rejected that offer and the matter was closed. Now Tomar is talking about resuming talks, but it seems to be lip service only. If the government is really serious about it, it should give the talks a practical shape. Farmers are here to stay (on protest) for any number of months,” the BKU leader said. Alleging that the corporates had already been alerted about putting in place the infrastructure and godowns prepared, Tikait said farm laws were brought in later, which is why farmers are opposing them. He added that various crops were not being sold at the minimum support price (MSP) in most states and it is left to the farmers to demand a legal guarantee of MSP. T3 formula to oppose farm laws BKU leader Rakesh Tikait has proposed T3 formula — tractor, Twitter and tank — to oppose the ‘machinations’ of the central government. The ongoing struggle against the central farm laws will be won only when farmers learn to use tractor, youngsters use Twitter to create an environment in their (farmers) favour and defence personnel lend them the support, he said. Many agree on employing “tractor and Twitter”, but they are not convinced about employing tank as one of the tools in farm struggle, but Tikait has its own way of thinking, a farm leader pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-tomar-offer-tikait-says-ready-for-unconditional-talks/articleshow/82046679.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Nashik||Nashik city shoppers crowd market places||Nashik: Despite the non-essential shops being closed, many market areas in the city were crowded with people buying goods from the shops that reopened after two days of the weekend lockdown. The rush on Monday can be attributed to the fear of a fresh lockdown, which can be announced by the state government at any time. For the past month, Nashik has been observing weekend lockdowns, when all the shops and establishments — barring milk centres, vegetables vendors and essential shops — were not allowed to function. “We will be celebrate Gudi Padwa on Tuesday. I came out to buy goods for the same and thought of packing some more, just in case the need arises,” said Ranjana Deshpande, a homemaker. Ramzan is about to begin so Asif Sayyed and his wife went to the market to shop. “We never know when the government will close all the shops. We don’t know what will be allowed to function so we are making all the required purchases to ensure we are prepared,” said Asif. But neither the customers nor shopkeepers were bothered about maintaining physical distance. Though people wore masks, most of them did not wear them properly. “People are on a buying spree to an extent where they do not care about social distancing. If I impose restrictions, then people will go to some other shop,” said Ramesh Patel, one of the shopkeepers. Asked if sanitisers were kept for the customers to use, Sanket Patil, a fruit and vegetable vendor, said, “These days people carry their own so we have not put the sanitisers.” When told that customers could be touching the goods, he said he can’t restrict them from touching as they would want to check the quality of the products. Refusal would mean a loss in business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-shoppers-crowd-market-places/articleshow/82036579.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The number of fatalities was 69. The real effect of the changed testing strategy on case figures will become apparent in the reports on Tuesday.The decline of 1,540 new cases was perhaps the biggest decline so far this month, which has now reported 58,179 cases in 12 days. Officials said April 11 reported the highest testing and new cases because civic and district centres cleared backlog, which abnormally pushed up the numbers.Also, the testing numbers fell by nearly 9,000 to 17,047 after touching the highest ever tally of 26,007 samples a day before. This was because only one sample was collected at all centres, for rapid antigen test. Recently, the centres had been asked to take two swabs, one for antigen and one for RTPCR. Samples of people with symptoms but antigen negative would only be sent for RTPCR. This increased the overall antigen tally.In view of huge backlog of samples, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) stopped RTPCR swab collection at all its 42 centres, and decided to offer only antigen tests at these places till Wednesday. On Tuesday, all centres shall remain closed on account of Gudi Padwa holiday.Civic officials claimed the day’s cases included all the results of antigen tests in the day. Around 3,000 antigen tests were done. The backlog of around 6,000 RTPCR samples was also reported on Monday.This was the sixth consecutive day when cases were over 5,000 in the district. The day’s cases included 3,912 from city and 1,744 from rural. As overall fatalities increased, city reported 37, rural 27 and five Covid victims were from other districts.Collector Ravindra Thakare has now deployed a two-member team to keep vigil on oxygen production, supply and distribution to GMCH, Mayo Hospital and other Covid hospitals.Range Forest officers (RFOs) Nandu Uikey and Kanteshwar Bolke were deputed to ensure free and fair distribution of oxygen to hospitals and coordination among different agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cases-dip-to-5661-nmc-conducts-only-rat-in-city/articleshow/82037366.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Not convinced with the official data, locals said that there was no big crowd on city roads and the number of people along the river bank was much less than what the administration claims. Sanjeev Nayyar, leader of a local traders' association, told TOI, “We don't believe the data released by the mela administration as there was limited footfall on most of the river banks. Traders kept waiting for consumers. The mela administration should disclose their method of counting.” Meanwhile, Rekha Sharma, senior divisional commercial manager, Moradabad division, Northern Railways, told TOI, “No special train was run for the shahi snan. Around 15,000 passengers deboarded at Haridwar and Jwalapur railway stations on Monday.” Similarly, Uttarakhand roadways officials claimed that only 8,000 pilgrims reached Haridwar in buses from other states. Prateek Jain, assistant regional manager, Uttarakhand roadways, told TOI, “We are compiling the data of the passengers who reached Haridwar from buses. Till evening, around 8,000 passengers came to Haridwar. This is not a big rise in passenger count.” Sanjay Gunjyal, IG Kumbh Mela, told TOI, “We collected the data from the entire Kumbh Mela region, including Rishikesh and Jwalapur.

SKM has named the day as Savindhan Bachao and Kisan-Bahujan Ekta Diwas. Members of Dalit communities are expected to join protests on the borders of Delhi on this day to support farmers, said morcha on Monday. “Bhimrao Ambedkar is the spark behind the the dream for freedom of the exploited and oppressed people of the country. People know him as the architect of the Constitution. At present, the central government is making sharp and brutal attacks on many fundamental rights given in the Constitution. Due to this, unemployment, deficit in agriculture and indebtedness are increasing. The crisis for those associated with agriculture is also deepening,” said SKM in a statement. The contentious farm laws have become a threat to both landowning and landless farmers, said SKM. “The new form of farming is even more dangerous for sharecroppers as big corporates will use machines on a largescale to make farming profitable and the workspace of sharecroppers will be lost. Going by all this, farmers, labourers and Dalits need to join hands for protests,” stated SKM.On April 13, farmers sitting on the borders of Delhi will celebrate Baisakhi through cultural, sports and traditional events at Tikri border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/skm-calls-for-unity-between-farmers-dalits/articleshow/82038282.cms||---

Senior police officials reached the spot for investigations after Military Police patrolling the area spotted the car parked near the NCC mess. ADCP, East, Qasim Abidi, who was at the spot told TOI, “The military policemen spotted the grey Tata Indica car and thought some persons were consuming alcohol in it. They tapped but got no response so they opened the door and saw a man with a gunshot wound on his forehead lying dead on the driver’s seat. A woman was lying dead next on the other front seat with a bullet wound in her right side of chest.” Prima facie, it appears that the man shot the woman and then shot himself inside the car as he was holding a licensed revolver, Abidi added. ADCP said the man was identified as Sanjay Nigam of Sadar Bazaar area who owned an eatery in Cantonment area and had purchased the car from a retired army man Santosh Kumar. Sanjay had separated with his wife who has been living in Indira Nagar with her son. The dead woman in the car was identified as Asha Agarwal, 35. “We are yet to establish how the duo were related to each other,” he said. The forensic team also reached the spot and collected evidence and said there were no signs of struggle in the car. “The car was on hand brake and its engine and lights were switched off. The mobile phone of Sanjay Nigam was on while that of Asha was switched off. Further probe is on,” said ADCP Abidi. A two-page suicide note was also found in the car in which Sanjay accuses a woman Anju of trying to forcefully take away his shop and held her solely responsible for his condition. “The suicide note has been given to the forensic experts for analysis,” said Abidi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/man-woman-found-shot-in-car-revolver-suicide-note-recovered/articleshow/82040243.cms||---

Many of the hundreds of huts erected on the highway are empty today, with a large number of the protesters returning home to harvest the wheat and mustard crops. There is only a handful of people in the area. Gurdar Singh, 80, of Hanumangarh district in Rajasthan, said the farmers need to be present in their fields at this time of the year. “The Samyukta Kisan Morcha has allowed people to go back to their villages, though most will be back in the next couple of weeks after the harvest is done,” said Singh. A memorial made of red earthen pots place inversely over sticks spiked in the earth brought from the villages marks the blockade site, which covers both the carriageways of the Delhi-Jaipur highway. Japan Singh said that most of the protesters here hail from Hanumangarh, Churu, Ganganagar and Sikar districts of Rajasthan, places where mustard is cultivated. “People have small fields and the families mostly carry out the harvesting on their own, not with hired labourers,” said Japan Singh. “We are optimistic of people returning on a rotation basis before the march to Delhi.” Samyukta Kisan Morcha has announced a march to Parliament in May. The association of farmers unions has decreed the march will be on foot and special care will be taken to avoid the incidents that marred the January 26 tractor rally. Among the people who have remained put at Shahjahanpur are members of left-wing organisations. Bhagat Singh, 62, of Shahjahanpur belongs to one such organisation.  "We are asking people to come here on a rotation basis. The dust-storms of April 1 damaged many tents, but we are not budging,” he said. Maleram, 61, of Sikar district hasn’t left the protest site since December 13. “We have braved storms, the harsh winter and rains. What is the point of giving up now? We will stay till the three black farm laws are repealed,” he declared. A Haryana Police officer stationed at the location confirmed that the number of protesters here had diminished, estimating them at between 100 and 200. The cops are using the service lanes for traffic going to Jaipur from Delhi. “We make sure the service lanes are open. We only have orders to prevent the farmers from moving to Haryana,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/protest-site-deserted-traffic-continues-to-crawl/articleshow/82055464.cms||Paras Singh

Earlier, the administration had to seek police help to get the requisitioned doctors join duties at the newly started or existing Covid facilities.Sources in the health department of district administration stated that requisition was sent to nursing colleges and training institutions for recruiting additional nurses at Covid facilities. It’s learnt that some of the planned Covid facilities could not be started due to shortage of doctors and nurses. “We need doctors and nurses to attend to the patients at the newly opened or existing Covid facilities,” said an official. “At many places, beds can be increased to accommodate more patients in rural areas from where people would not have to travel to the city, but need medical staffers to attend to them,” he added. A highly placed source said almost all nursing colleges and training institutes were approached asking them to send senior trainees and also pass out students for serving in the Covid facilities. “Apart from remuneration, they were offered to work for gaining experience under the challenging circumstances and learn while serving. Some would have even got a chance to work under a well qualified doctor,” said the source. The district administration is facing an uphill task to convince them to join as a bulk of the nursing students have only shown apathy to work citing various reasons for not joining the government mission. “We have tried to motivate the students, but not many are willing,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/district-admin-hit-by-shortage-of-nurses-too/articleshow/82037371.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Chennai||Commuters urge CMRL to add coach||Chennai: A day after Chennai Metro Rail Limited started penalising commuters not wearing masks, regular commuters urged CMRL to reintroduce the special class coach or add a coach so maintaining physical distance during commute, amid increasing footfalls, is easier. On Sunday, the day it started imposing fines, CMRL went easy on passengers and pulled up only two for not wearing mask. Since metro train services resumed in September after a five-month lockdown, footfalls have touched 80% of the pre-covid daily average of 1.16 lakhs. As the footfalls are inching towards pre-Covid numbers, passengers complained that maintaining a safe distance in the four-car trains operated now is not possible. The trains are run every 5 minutes during peak hours. Hence, many regular commuters who earlier travelled in special class coach paying double the normal ticket fare want it back. A few months ago, CMRL converted special class coach into women’s-only coach to facilitate physical distancing. A few commuters have also taken to CMRL’s social media account and posted images of crowded metro trains, asking metro rail to take action and ensure safety. “The trains are packed during peak hours. Despite the markings on the seats to keep distance, eight people sit in a five-seater,” said S Lakshmi, a government employee who travels from Thirumangalam to LIC station every day for work. “We are ready to pay double the ticket fare. CMRL should either introduce a special class again or add a coach,” she added. A CMRL official said it won’t be possible to add a coach. “Our trains are designed for four-cars,” the official said. “But we have special teams that do surprise checks and a team monitoring passengers through CCTV cameras in trains.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/commuters-urge-cmrl-to-add-coach/articleshow/82038277.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Massive fire engulfs fibre factory in Pantnagar industrial estate||Rudrapur: A massive fire broke out in a fibre factory in the Pantnagar industrial estate, two kilometres away from Rudrapur, on Monday afternoon. Fire station officer Chandra Prakash said the fire broke out around 2 pm. Subsequently, fire tenders from private factories and nearby fire stations were called upon to douse the flames. The personnel of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) were also called on the spot as the officials suspected that the roof of the factory may collapse as it melted due to high temperature. The cause behind the fire is yet to be ascertained. Daleep Singh Kunwar, district's senior superintendent of police (SSP), said that it took more than four hours to control the blaze after a series of blasts were reported owing to inflammable chemicals stacked in the factory premises. “More than a dozen fire tenders were pressed into service. It was a humongous task for them as the factory had huge stocks of thermocol sheets and other chemicals. We will conduct a probe into the incident,” said SSP Kunwar. Ajay Tiwari, patron of the Sidcul Entrepreneur Welfare Society (SEWS), said, “The entire building was gutted in the fire. Goods worth crores of rupees were completely damaged,” he said. Meanwhile, the owners of the factory have said that they will need some time to calculate the exact amount of loss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/massive-fire-engulfs-fibre-factory-in-pantnagar-industrial-estate/articleshow/82037367.cms||Aakash Ahuja
---||Nagpur||Rly hospital may be taken over for Covid patients||Nagpur: With coronavirus cases swelling and the administration facing a shortage of beds, the Nagpur Central Railway and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) are in talks about whether beds at railway hospital can be made available.Considering the poor plight of railway employees who are turning positive and facing problems, the National Railway Mazdoor Union (NRMU) too on Monday demanded at least 60 O2 beds at the 200-bedded railway hospital can be given for the treatment of Covid patients.NRMU general secretary Venu P Nair said, “As per my talk with the principal chief medical director the railways have no problem in treating Covid patients but it can happen only when the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) return our doctors and paramedical staff used for Covid patients at its hospitals and centres.” “With 60 beds connected with oxygen pipeline and 12 ventilators lying idle, why the railway hospital cannot be utilized to treat patients? Around 800 railway employees and officials have turned positive and several retired and serving employees have died due to Covid,” says Habib Khan, working president of NRMU.Even as there is a demand, the NMC, which is the authority to take a final call under the Epidemic Diseases Act, has some reservations. Talking to TOI, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, “The placement of railway hospital wards is such that it will require manpower. We are already using their staff and doctors to treat patients.”Radhakrishnan added, “We need a separate entry for Covid patients. With two DRM offices, the railway premises are congested and have many visitors. There will be operational difficulties and as of now it will not be possible and we will have to rethink. Even use of their coaches for quarantine purposes has hurdles as train movement has increased compared to last year when passenger trains were shut.”Residents of Mohan Nagar alleged attempts to offer a railway hospital for Covid patients as the administration has started constructing a separate entry for Covid patients by breaking open the compound wall close to the hospital.In a memorandum submitted to the DRM on Monday, the residents, led by Manoj Donge, opposed the new entry. “It will cause more congestion in the narrow lane. There will be a parking problem and it will also lead to the cutting of several trees. Shifting Covid patients through narrow lanes of Mohan Nagar will cause more damage than relief.” Additional DRM Jay Singh said, “Some discussions are going on with the NMC on admitting Covid patients, but nothing has been finalized yet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rly-hospital-may-be-taken-over-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82037389.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Chandigarh||BJP: Govt is insensitive to unemployed||Chandigarh: Absolute insensitivity of the Punjab government had become apparent from the cane-charging of jobless teachers in Patiala, alleged BJP spokesperson Iqbal Singh Lalpura on Monday. The unemployed were trying to march towards chief minister Amarinder Singh’s residence to protest against “false promises’ made by him, he added. The BJP functionary said the Congress had promised in 2017 that 25,000 jobs would be given to qualified teachers. However, the Congress only misled the non-employed qualified teachers and even after four years the unemployed teachers were forced to stage protests and jump into canals to demonstrate their pathetic condition, he added. The former IPS officer said the Congress government had again hired “maverick” Prashant Kishor to spin and weave another plan to hoodwink the electorate in the assembly elections scheduled early next year. The situation of unemployment was reaching a stage where people were forced to jump into canals. tnn “Is this democracy? Where people can not raise their voice in descent,” asked Lalpura. He said BJP had promised if it voted to power, each and every teacher eligible for the job would be immediately accommodated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-govt-is-insensitive-to-unemployed/articleshow/82038365.cms||---

The school, which has around 420 students, hasn’t reconsidered the decision despite two students testing positive. The school was shut down on April 9 for sanitisation and classes will resume on April 15. When contacted, Rudra Gowda, director school education, Puducherry, said: “The French school follows a separate system different from the state board and CBSE, they were allowed to function following SOP. They are complying with SOP. If needed, we will ask them to switch to online classes too.” He added that the school is expected to offer parents the option of online classes too. Despite repeated attempts to get a comment from Stephan Madrias, proviseur of the school, there was no response. “We are very worried as cases are increasing, the school is refusing to start online classes. In March too the school had two Covid positive cases and again it has happened this month,” said a student’s mother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/school-holds-physical-classes-amid-curbs-two-students-test-ve/articleshow/82038370.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Students who do not opt for any of the two options will by default be considered for pen-and-paper format, said sources in GU. The university is planning to finish holding exams by May-end so that the next academic session can begin from June. The varsity had earlier announced that exams will be held from April 12. The exams were to be held in pen-and-paper format. Keeping in view the surge in Covid-19 cases in Gujarat, GU then put the exams on hold. In March, the varsity had initiated examination process but after completion of the first exam paper for semester I, it decided to defer exams after the state government announced closure of all colleges till April 10.

---||Nagpur||Lockdown unfair to shops, ban e-tailers too: NVCC||Nagpur: Shopkeepers’ loss has led to e-tailers’ gain during the lockdown. As shops selling non-essential goods remain shut, business continues through e-portals for the same goods. This has left traders owning brick and mortar shops complaining that the lockdown orders are not only affecting their businesses, but also leading to an unfair advantage to e-commerce giants.The matter has been taken up at different levels. Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC), an umbrella body of various trade bodies in the region, has written a letter to district collector highlighting the issue. “We have highlighted that brick and mortar shop owners are facing discrimination due to the one-sided order,” said Ashwin Mehadia, president of NVCC.The NVCC has demanded that authorities should also ban delivery of non-essentials through e-commerce during the lockdown period lasting till April 30. The NVCC letter says even as all shops except those dealing in essential items have been shut down, e-commerce is open for all types of goods. This has led to a major disadvantage for small and mid-sized traders, who are among the major contributors of tax. In order to maintain parity, the NVCC has demanded that even e-commerce of non-essential items should be stopped.BC Bhartia, president of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said the organization has been raising the issue questioning why should e-commerce giants be allowed to profit if the traders have to shut down. “Risk of infection may be higher in a conventional shop as compared to an e-commerce company, where the goods are delivered at the doorstep. However, this is leading to a clear disadvantage in term of business reach. Eventually, the consumers are likely to get used to the system of buying goods through e-commerce portals as against the traditional brick and mortar shops. This may end up in a loss of clientele for the shops as they reopen,” said Bhartia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lockdown-unfair-to-shops-ban-e-tailers-too-nvcc/articleshow/82037398.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Lucknow||DM claims no shortage of oxygen, IMA chief differs||Lucknow: Following reports of massive shortage of oxygen in city, DM Abhishek Prakash on Monday evening denied the shortage and claimed that 20% more oxygen cylinders against the demand are being provided to hospitals in the district. He said, “Everyday 4,750 oxygen cylinders are being provided to hospitals. An action plan is being worked out to double the supply by 8,800 oxygen cylinders in the district. In the next two days, the increased supply will start.” However, contrary to DM claims Indian Medical Association, Lucknow president, Dr Rama Srivasatva said, “Overwhelmed with the rise in number of Covid-19 patients especially those admitted in intensive care units, a massive shortage of oxygen cylinders is being experienced in private hospitals of Lucknow. Merely 20-30 per cent of oxygen supply is left with hospitals across the district and they require mega cylinders of 40-50 litres in the next 24-48 hours.” “We have informed the district administration about the worrying situation of oxygen cylinders’ availability,” she added. However, when TOI shared the DM’s claims about 20 per cent more oxygen cylinders being provided against the demand, Dr Rama Srivasatva did not respond. Meanwhile, the oxygen manufacturing plants claimed that “we are working round the clock, but the demand has grown by 250 per cent. There are seven plants which supply oxygen cylinders to Lucknow based 266 private registered hospitals. “The administration did not prepare even after learning lessons from the first Covid-19 wave and is now harassing us to meet the demand. The solution to this crisis is that the administration needs to help us with subsidies to expand the plant and tight noose around the liquid transporters who have hiked prices,” said Ankur Mehrotra, a supplier of oxygen cylinders to city hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dm-claims-no-shortage-of-oxygen-ima-chief-differs/articleshow/82040247.cms||---

---||Nashik||Mixed reaction to SSC/HSC exam postponement||Nashik/Aurangabad: A section of students heaved a sigh of relief following the state government’s decision to defer the SSC and HSC exams. However, some teachers and parents felt online exams would have been better. Kaveri Shelar, a Class X student in Nashik, said she recently lost a close relative and could not concentrate on her exam preparation. “The Covid cases are rising and we fear that we may contract the infection,” she added. Another Class X student Saara Shirsat said, “Our performance would have suffered as the Covid issue is showing no sign of improvement. We will now have some time to revise.” A junior college teacher Vaibhav Sarode, however, said: “There is no guarantee the number of Covid cases would dip in May and June. It would have been better to hold online exams. Also, the schools should have been told to give special assignments. Students could have been graded on the basis of the online exams and assignments.” Francis Waghmare, another teacher, felt the government should have completely done away with the exams and promoted all students. “The new exam policy anyway does not stress much on exams. During admissions for higher studies, the colleges can take entrance tests,” he said. Anjali Supe, a parent, said: “The exams could have been online. Many students would like to pursue higher studies outside Maharashtra. But if exams in those states are not deferred, our students would face a problem getting admissions,” she said. Aarati Relgaokar, a mother of a Class XII student, said the board examinations could have been held like the MPSC or UPSC exams. “The deferred exams could affect students’ preparations and impact their studies for national-level tests,” she said. Praveen Mule, a parent of a Class X student, said student safety is priority. “The second wave of Covid seems to be stronger. It would be apt to wait for a few weeks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mixed-reaction-to-ssc/hsc-exam-postponement/articleshow/82036610.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Generally, a person’s lungs can handle only around three-four litres of water. The person had a milky fluid in his lungs due to a rare disease, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), which is caused by the build-up of a protein-like material in the air sacs. The disease is mostly found in those aged 30-60 and it affects about one in 1,00,000 people worldwide. The person, suffering from breathing difficulty and cough for the past five months, was earlier treated for allergy and asthma at various centres. He was referred to the pulmonology department of AIMS after his symptoms persisted. At AIMS, his lungs were cleaned using warm saline water in a rare procedure called whole lung lavage. Both the lungs were cleaned in two sittings, each one lasting nearly six hours, and one of his lungs was put on ventilator support while the other was being cleaned. “This is an extremely rare disease, often seen in people with genetic disorders leading to excessive production of surfactant protein. Excessive accumulation of this protein, which normally is needed to maintain patency of air passages, leads to serious respiratory issues. Other underlying conditions that can produce this disorder are certain respiratory infections, cancers and heavy exposure to sand or wood dust,” Dr Tinku Joseph, chief interventional pulmonologist, AIMS, said. Most respiratory symptoms of this patient had begun after he got exposed to huge amounts of wood and cement dust particles as part of his occupation in Saudi Arabia. The samples of the patient have also been sent to a hospital in Cincinnati, US to rule out genetic causes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mans-lungs-cleaned-with-40-litres-of-saline-water/articleshow/82038494.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Delhi||3 arrested for role in GTB hosp shootout||New Delhi: Three men who were at the forefront of a shootout at northeast Delhi’s GTB Hospital on March 25 have been arrested by Delhi Police’s Special Cell. The accused, along with 10 other heavily armed criminals, had landed at the hospital to free their associated Kuldeep Maan alias Fajja. As the cops and criminals exchanged fire, one criminal was shot, while another was critically injured. In the melee, Maan managed to flee only to be gunned down days later at a flat in Rohini. According to DCP (Pramod Kushwaha), the men, who were arrested by a team led by ACP Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan, have been identified as Vicky Baniya, Vicky and Akash. Three pistols and eight cartridges have been seized from them along with two stolen bikes, Kushwaha said. “In the past few days, input was being received about the members affiliated to Jitender Gogi gang. Using technical surveillance, their movements were tacked down to Najafgarh. A team laid a trap in Nangloi, Najafgarh, and apprehended them,” Kushwaha added. Police found that the trio came in touch with Rishi alias Lambu in jail and started working for him. Rishi joined hands with Gogi and the trio was subsequently roped in to free Fajja. While the two men named Vicky arranged for weapons for a shootout, Aakash was the one who threw chilli powder at the police team at the hospital. The trio disclosed that they had been asked to carry out two contract killings in Delhi and Punjab. The target in Delhi was a real estate businessman, who had refused to pay them extortion money. Earlier, cops had nabbed two juveniles involved in the GTB hospital incident. At least seven-eight criminals involved in the shootout are still absconding. Teams are conducting raids in three states for their arrest, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-arrested-for-role-in-gtb-hosp-shootout/articleshow/82055500.cms||---
---||Nashik||50 Ahmednagar civil hosp workers test +ve||Nashik: As many as 50 healthcare workers of the Ahmednagar civil hospital — including doctors and nurses — engaged in Covid-19 duties have tested positive, said district civil surgeon Sunil Pokharna. Of the 50, seven are doctors, 20 are nurses and the rest are ward boys and lab technicians. All of them have received at least the first shot of the Covid vaccine. Pokharna said all these infected healthcare workers have been taken off their duties and they are all stable. However, there is now more pressure on the remaining hospital staff. “There are 20 wards in the hospital where more than 280 Covid patients, including critical patients, are being treated. With many healthcare workers unable to work, the remaining employees are making added efforts to treat and cure the patients. They are doing the work diligently,” he added. Complicating the matters further for the civil hospital management is the fact that three healthcare workers (among the 50 who tested positive) were involved in conducting the RT-PCR tests at the civil hospital’s lab, Pokharna said. “The lab carries out more than 2,000 swab tests every day. With three of them infected with Covid, it would be a Herculean task for the remaining staff to conduct that many tests a day,” said Pokharna. Ahmednagar district has been witnessing a surge in daily Covid cases. The average daily case count is hovering around 2,000. There are currently 19,000 active cases here and availability of beds in Covid hospitals has become an issue. “There is a need to have more healthcare workers in our Covid hospitals. In spite of our efforts, we are not getting the extra manpower,” said Pokharna. Probe ordered into oxygen supply disruption Ahmednagar civil surgeon Sunil Pokharna has ordered a probe into the allegations made by the family members of a 75-year-old Covid patient who succumbed a couple of days back at the civil hospital. Pokharna said the victim’s family had alleged that the oxygen supply to his bed was disrupted for 15-20 minutes, which led to his death. “We are investigating the matter. We have centralised oxygen supply system wherein patients receive the gas through a pipe. If there was a disruption in supply, other patients too would have faced problems. But we did not get any other complaints. The oxygen saturation of the deceased patient was very low and his overall condition was not good,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/50-ahmednagar-civil-hosp-workers-test-ve/articleshow/82036620.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Delhi||It’s a test of nerves: Parents agonise over offline CBSE Boards||New Delhi: Manoj Sharma and his daughter, a student of Class XII in Delhi Public School, Mathura Road, have been having this constant tiff. She wants to go out to meet her friends and her father doesn’t want her stepping out of the house due to the resurgence of Covid-19 cases. However, he also realises that in few weeks’ time, he has to send her out to write the board exams, set to begin from May 4. For parents and students alike, the stress level is directly proportionate to the daily Covid positivity rate. The Central Board of Secondary Education has, so far, scheduled offline exams for Class X and XII, with, of course, precautions against the coronavirus. “When I ask my daughter not to go out, she argues that political leaders are out there without masks, mixing with crowds,” said Sharma, who is also the vice-president of Delhi Parents Association. “She then asks me if I will stop her from appearing for the board exam. Obviously, I don’t answer her, but sometimes I think maybe it would be better to drop a year than risk infection.” Some practicals are also pending since Delhi government declared suspension of offline classes from April 9. In the past week, students have been demanding the cancellation of board exams on social media. On Monday, the Maharashtra government postponed its state board exams. Satya Prakash, whose daughter will be appearing for the Class X CBSE exams, is aware of the stress she is in. “This is her first board exam, so I can understand what she is going through,” said Prakash. “The entire year, she had online classes and suddenly she has to appear for an offline exam. This doesn’t seem very fair. My worst fear is her being infected while going out for the exams.” The girl studies at Lancer Convent School in Rohini and went to school for only about 10 days this year for the practicals. Prakash and many other parents think the government should utilise the remaining few weeks till the exams to vaccinate the examinees. “At least that would minimise the chances of infection and give us some relief,” said Prakash. In contrast, Ashutosh Bhardwaj, father of a Class XII student of Venkateshwar Global School, thinks the exams are very important. The girl is in the science stream and has completed her practicals. Bhardwaj, a Delhi University teacher, explained, “If social distancing is followed and other measures taken, I don’t think there is much of a problem. Holding the exams are important to understand the learning of level in students. In my daughter’s school, the assessment was proctored, so for those who have studied hard, it is not fair to withhold the exams.” On what he thought of having to sit for the exam, Vivek, a candidate, shrugged, “Is there an option not to appear for it?” He added, “It is very amusing that we were told for over a year to stay at home and now are being told to leave the house and write the exams in a crowded hall.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/its-a-test-of-nerves-parents-agonise-over-offline-cbse-boards/articleshow/82038445.cms||Shradha Chettri

In a meeting on Saturday, CM Thackeray had said that a lockdown in the state was required to bring down the daily cases and augment the health infrastructure. Senior state government officials said that it is likely that a decision will be taken on Wednesday, and the work of drafting SOPs on how the lockdown will be imposed is underway. The state government is also working out a way in which the currently short supply of oxygen, medicines and anti-viral injection remdesivir can be streamlined, and additional beds are being arranged in many districts. A mechanism is being put in place to ensure that injections will be made available directly in the hospitals rather than locally being distributed through retailers. Also, setting up of oxygen plants at hospital premises will be done to meet the rising demand for oxygen in the state, officials said. ALSO READ: Maharashtra Covid-19 lockdown news liveA scheme to provide foodgrains at subsidised rates is also being worked out.

On Sunday, during a meeting with the CM, most members of the state task force had said there was a need to impose tight curbs, though opinion on lockdown was divided among them.

---||Lucknow||Centre mandates UP to form separate account for dalits under MGNREGS||LUCKNOW: In an important development, the Centre has mandated the UP government to form separate account for dalit workers under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) which had turned out to be the biggest job spinner for migrants who returned to the state in large numbers during coronavirus lockdown last year. The decision, which comes ahead of the 130th birth anniversary of dalit icon BR Ambedkar on April 14, is being seen as a step to cater to the interest of dalit labourers who look up to MGNREGS amid surge in Covid-19 cases. Additional commissioner, rural development, Yogesh Kumar told TOI that following the Centre’s instructions, the state government would open separate accounts for SC/STs under MGNREGS. “The funds allocated for the community under the scheme would be received in this account which will be regularly monitored,” he said. Officials said the measure had been taken to ascertain if the benefits of the schemes were reaching the deprived sections of the society. MGNREGS records in UP show that SC accounted for 31.19% of total 39.49 crore mandays of employment generated in the state till March 31, 2021. This was marginally up from 2019-20 when SC accounted for 30.43% of the total 24.44 crore mandays created. The maximum engagement of SC population under MGNREGS was recorded in 2017-18 when they got 34.07% of the total 18.15 crore mandays of employment, according to data. The participation of ST community has, however, been as low as 0.99% of the total mandays of employment generated in 2020-21. This was though slightly on the upper side than in the past five financial years when ST accounted for 0.95% of the total mandays of employment under MGNREGS. Data show that currently the state has 1.43 crore active MGNREGS workers, of which SC and ST account for 31.47% and 1.07%, respectively. Officials said it was substantially higher given the fact that SC and ST accounted for just over 21% of the total state population as per the 2011 census. “The Centre has set a target of generating 26 crore mandays of employment under the scheme in the current financial year – 2021-22. UP has managed to provide over 100 days of employment to over 6.5 lakh people under MGNREGS in the pandemic year. This was almost five times of what the state government provided in 2019-20 when nearly 1.32 lakh people were given 100 days of employment under MGNREGS,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/centre-mandates-up-to-form-separate-account-for-dalits-under-mgnregs/articleshow/82040254.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Delhi||No other religious place has fixed devotees, why limit of 20 for Markaz?: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Wondering how a ceiling can be imposed on the number of devotees who can pray at the Nizamuddin Markaz when there is no such limit for other religious gatherings, Delhi high court on Monday allowed in principle reopening of the mosque for Ramzan prayers subject to the adherence of Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s guidelines to tackle Covid-19. “No other religious place has fixed devotees, how can they have only 20 from a list? It is an open place,” Justice Mukta Gupta remarked, after the Centre said the management should furnish a list of 20 people who could be allowed out of a verified list of 200. Sensing the mood of the court, the Centre agreed that devotees could be allowed to pray at the mosque in the month of Ramzan, expected to begin on Wednesday. But it maintained that the permission be made conditional on the devotees and the mosque management strictly adhering to the guidelines to maintain social distancing in the wake of the rise in Covid-19 cases in Delhi. The government also said the names of the office bearers, staff etc of the mosque who will run and manage the day-to-day operations should be furnished to the local station house officer (SHO) of the area. These include names of those who will be permitted to be present inside throughout the day. The Centre’s stand came during the hearing of a plea by the Waqf Board seeking opening of the Markaz where a Tablighi Jamaat congregation was held amid the pandemic last year. It has been locked since March 31, 2020 following a controversy over the spike in cases, and an FIR was registered. Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, appearing for the board along with the Centre’s counsel, told the court that a joint inspection would be carried out on Monday itself by the SHO of Hazrat Nizamuddin police station and the office bearers of the mosque. “The exercise of measuring the area of the mosque where the devotees can offer namaz five times in the day will be carried out today itself and as per the guidelines issued by DDMA, keeping the distances required to be maintained, blocks will be made at the place where the prayer mats can be put for the devotees to offer namaz,” both parties assured the court. Gupta also said CCTV cameras would be installed on Tuesday to ensure safety and security of the premises and the people coming to offer prayers, and monitor compliance of social distancing norms. The court listed the matter for further hearing on Tuesday when it will take stock of the results of the joint inspection. On March 24, the Centre had said 50 people chosen by the Waqf Board could be allowed to pray at the mosque during Shab-e-Barat. The board, in its plea, has contended that even after the unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the Markaz — comprising Alami Markaz Banglewali Masjid, Madarsa Kashif-ul-uloom and the attached hostel — continues to be locked up. It further contended that even if the premises was part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it “under lock as an out-of-bound area” was a “primitive method” of the enquiry process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-no-other-religious-place-has-fixed-devotees-why-limit-of-20-for-markaz/articleshow/82038491.cms||Abhinav Garg

After struggling for several hours, farmers, firement and other district authorities managed to control the blaze with the help of tractors and fire tenders. Due to strong winds, it was getting tough for farners to douse the flames. Farmers said they were working in the fields when they noticed flames in wheat fields which expanded in no time. It is suspected that the fire has been caused due to an electricity short circuit that took place in wires supplying 24-hour power to nearby industries. On receiving information, fire tenders reached the spot along with police from Gumthala Garhu police post of Pehowa. The fire also caused damage in the farmlands of neighouring Kheri Shishgara and Santpura village. Local farmers who suffered damage include Jabarjeet Singh on 14 acres, Bhupinder Singh Chattha on five acres, Lakha Singh and Jodha Singh on eight acres each, Janpal Singh on four acres and some others. A farmer said, “We spent Rs 55,000-60,000 per year and took the land on contract for the purpose of agriculture. We have already paid the landowners and now our crop has been damaged. We will have to struggle for survival this season. We ask the government to provide us compensation. We have pending expenses on our head, including school fees of children, bank installments and family functions, which we were hping to pay from harvest.” Sugarcane on 10 acres gutted In another fire incident in Thana village of Kurukshetra, about 10 acres of ready sugarcane crop was gutted. Fire official Sandeep from Pehowa said, “The first fire incident took place at Thana, where we had deputed two fire tenders from Pehowa. In a short time, another call was received from Kheri Shishgara village and a third fire tender was sent there. Another call was received from Dera Fateh Singh and Gumthala Garhu area and we had to call fire tenders from Kurukshetra and Kaithal. At the end of the day, we managed to control the fire.” Pehowa sub-division magistrate (SDM) Sonu Kumar said, “There have been two-three fire incidents today in Pehowa. I had sent the concerned patwaris to ascertain the amount of damage suffered by farmers. The patwaris are yet to submit their report and we expect the exact assessment by Tuesday.” Crop insurance doesn’t cover fire Insurance companies do not compensate farmers in case of fire incidents. Private insurance companies have kept this nature of damage out of the claim category, said farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ripened-wheat-crop-on-80-acres-gutted-in-pehowa/articleshow/82038485.cms||JK Singh
---||Nagpur||Two hard to get: Oxygen and Remdesivir||NAGPUR: In view of alarming Covid-19 situation in the city and severe shortage of oxygen for patients, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Monday requested chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to set up an oxygen production plant here urgently. “In our view, it wouldn’t be difficult for Maharashtra Government to take immediate action in this regard. We also request guardian minister Nitin Raut to look into this matter and coordinate with the CM. We hope and trust that some urgent decision will be taken in the matter and conveyed to this court,” a division bench comprising justices Zaka Haq and Amit Borkar said, before adjourning the hearing till Tuesday 2.30 pm. Earlier, amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar assisted by Nidhi Dayani quoted media reports on mayor Dayashankar Tiwari’s statement regarding 500-bed facility to be made available at Mankapur Indoor Stadium. Coronavirus: Live updates“We direct the mayor to file an affidavit pointing out background of making such statement. We direct the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) commissioner to file separate affidavit pointing out whether what the mayor said can be implemented,” the bench said. The amicus and other lawyers told the HC that all major injections needed had suddenly vanished from the market. They informed that that Tocilizumab injections were being sold by the private pharmacists at exorbitant prices and there was reason to believe that some persons had hoarded these life saving drugs. “We direct the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) commissioner to inquire into the matter immediately and submit a report by Tuesday. We want that the flow of Tocilizumab from the production centres/factories to wholesalers and to retailers and the dispensing of these injunctions from the counters of the private pharmacists should be tracked. If there is any hoarding, appropriate action as per the law should be taken against the erring persons,” the judges said. The directives came while hearing a bunch of PILs, including suo motu based on TOI report, one filed by District Bar Association (DBA) president Kamal Satuja and other by Subhash Zanwar against the central government. Earlier, intervenor’s counsel M Anilkumar, while quoting an oxygen producer, informed that Rs 10 crore would be required for setting up of a plant having capacity to produce 900 cylinders/day. Senior counsel MG Bhangde and additional government pleader Deepak Thakre informed HC on behalf of FDA joint commissioner Vijay Kose that Remdesivir injunctions were being supplied to the hospitals as per procedure laid down by FDA commissioner on April 5. They clarified that the injection wasn’t sold from private pharmacists counters. ‘Ensure 24x7 patrolling at hospitals to prevent attacks’Concerned over growing number of attacks on the hospitals treating Covid-19 patients by their relatives, the HC directed police commissioner Amitesh Kumar to ensure round-the-clock patrolling by the police near their premises. “The CP should deploy sufficient police force at the government hospitals to ensure unnecessary vandalism and rowdiness is not created by the relatives. The doctors and health workers should work in a protected atmosphere, without there being any fear of vandalism,” the court said. The judges asked police to take stern action against persons creating ruckus at hospitals. “The authorities should immediately act on the hospitals’ complaint. They shouldn’t permit any person to take photographs or make videos by forcible entry in the hospital. Such entry should be prohibited even to media persons. We request the media that the unfortunate incidents should not be highlighted too much because those create unnecessary panic in the citizens,” they said. Ban on Remdesivir sale adds to woes of bedless patientsThe district administration’s latest move to ban sale of anti-viral injection Remdesivir from any type of outlets has added to the woes of patients who are failing to get a Covid bed. Though having breathlessness and different symptoms, many patients are forced to rely on day care or casualty-based treatment in private hospitals. However, the onus of arranging the injection was left to the patients or their kin while doctors or medical staff was administering the drug by showing them as day care patient or on OPD basis. One of the previous orders of the collector had allowed sale of Remdesivir stock left after supplying to authorized Covid hospitals. In the last three days, the collector has issued three orders which have confused the stockists, doctors and patients alike. On April 6, the collector’s order mandated delivery of Remdesivir directly to Covid hospitals by the carrying and forwarding agent. On April 9, another order asked the agent to hand over the doses to stockists and distributors who will give it to Covid hospitals while the leftover could be sold through retailers. On April 12, yet another order came which states the collector office will receive the entire supply and hand it over to stockists with the names of hospitals to which the drug is to be supplied. This means, no supply will be left for public. VHA president Dr Ashok Arbat said basically the administration must make Remdesivir freely available in the market and let the doctors decide when it has to be given. “Such orders will create more trouble for the patients. A patient is getting admitted for injection treatment like Remdesivir, O2 and other supportive management. Remdesivir is very important drug. But such decisions will create more confusion in Covid management,” he said. Asked about category of patients needing the anti-viral injection, Dr Arbat said it is solely the discretion of a clinician as to whether a mild or moderate patient needs it or nor. “The government capped bed charges, then it took control of oxygen and now Remdesivir. Does it want to control the treatment too,” he asked. Remdesivir needed only for patients with low oxygen: ExpertsConcurring with the guidelines of the state Covid task force members and views of doctors from other parts of the state, experts here said Remdesivir needs to be used judiciously and after considering due clinical indicators. They said the first important factor to use the anti-viral drug is assessing if patient’s blood oxygen level is down. Since not all patients feel breathlessness, this line of treatment can well solve the ongoing crisis for the injections and oxygen, they said. Senior paediatrician Dr Satish Deopujari, who recently developed seven models to facilitate teaching in explaining cardio-respiratory and arterial blood gas (ABG) functions, says Covid patients having a drop in oxygen saturation level are the only candidate for Remdesivir therapy, which also includes the 6-minute walk test. “Administering this drug at home without proper monitoring is not recommended,” he said. According to him, severe disease (breathlessness, hypoxia, or >50% lung involvement on imaging within 24 to 48 hours) was reported in 14% of patients. “Remdesivir is needed in the first 12 days of illness only if SPO2 level goes down. After 12 days, it doesn’t have the desired effect,” he said. On shortage of Remdesivir, he said using an important drug like it in situations where it is not recommended could be an important factor. He said people have developed an extreme fear of Covid-19. Citing his own example on how he managed the disease, the 66-year-old doctor said, “I kept on monitoring SPO2 and took paracetamol as when necessary and that was enough.” He added that high-risk patients need close observation. Dr Imran Noor Mohammad, a member on HC appointed Covid-19 committee, said that Remdesvir is not an elixir. “Patient won’t die if it is not given. I have recommended that its use must be judicious and clinically prescribed. People are going for CT scan right on day one of testing positive. We found hospitals administering Remdesivir on OPD basis,” he said. Dr Mohammad, who is also ex-secretary of Critical Care Society of Nagpur, said Remdesivir must be given when a patient has CT scan score of 12 or13, fever and SPO2 level 89 or less. “But there is mass hysteria. People are thinking they will die if they don’t get it,” he said. Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, who too is member of Covid-19 committee, said that Remdesivir is known to benefit only in reducing hospital stay. “In case of patients with moderate disease needing oxygen, 30% patients have reportedly improved when steroid, oxygen and Remdesvir are given,” he said. Dr Sarnaik stresses it is important to overcome fear in this situation. “We see people without need for oxygen getting hospitalized and those who need it are waiting for beds,” he said. Respite for admitted Covid patients as hospitals get 100% Remdesivir stockThe kin of patients will not have to go searching for Remdesivir injections at distributors, stockists or pharmacies now. The collector office has for the first time ensured Covid hospitals get all the available stock on Monday. The entire stock was taken over by the collector from the suppliers, and distributed to hospitals as per NMC’s approved bed capacity of each hospital. After taking over the entire stock of Remdesivir allotted for the district, collector office has also issued an order on Monday that Covid hospitals and such facilities will get their share of the injections from designated distributors or stockists only. The distributors and stockists were provided a list of Covid hospitals and facilities, along with number of beds allotted to each, by the collector office. Retail sales of the drug remain prohibited in the district. In a twist, some hospitals that had increased the number of beds beyond the number sanctioned by NMC are likely to face shortages even now. It is not known how patients admitted in these additional beds would be administered the drug. “We had sought list of hospitals and number of beds allotted to them from NMC. Accordingly, we distributed Remdesivir for 100% of their capacity. If someone has increased the beds then NMC must look into the violations,” said the collector. He added that hospitals are not supposed to ask kin of patients to procure Remdesivir from outside. Dr Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA), said they have already appealed that Remdesivir must be administered as per the mandated guidelines of Covid treatment protocols and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “Only E and F category patients are to be treated with Remdesivir while the rest with Favipiravir. So, we can say that the shortage is unlikely to happen,” he said. The latest order of allotting Covid hospitals Remdesivir stock may have given some respite to indoor patients, but serious patients who are yet to find a bed seem to have been left in the lurch. A day ago, the collector office could manage to distribute some stock to hospitals after a consignment of 1,500 Remdesivir vials had reached the city’s carrying and forwarding agents (CFA) at Wadi late in the evening. On Monday, stocks from at least three more brands reached the city, allowing the collector office to send supplies to all hospitals. According to a distributor and stockists, the Remdesivir injections are distributed from Nagpur to districts as far as Jalgaon and even in other states like Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. “The shortage in Nagpur depot will have repercussions in neighbouring states too,” he said. As hospitals had started handing over Remdesivir prescriptions to patients’ kin to arrange for the drug, long queues were seen outside the pharmacies even beyond midnight, which had warranted the latest strategy by the collector office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/consider-setting-up-oxygen-plant-in-city-hc-to-cm/articleshow/82037410.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Police got evidence that the fourth accused in the case, Sreerag, who is currently in remand, had stayed with Ratheesh in Chekkiad and nearby areas where they had gone into hiding after the attack against Mansoor on April 6. According to police sources, the investigation focusing on mobile cell tower location revealed that Ratheesh and other accused were present under the same tower location in the area. The body of Ratheesh was found hanging in a vacant plot near Chekkiad on Friday. As per the preliminary post-mortem report, there were internal injuries and possible signs of strangulation which raised suspicion of foul play in the death. Following this, a crime branch inquiry was instituted in this case on Sunday. Crime branch deputy SP, probing the case, recorded statements of residents in the area where the body was found on Monday. Meanwhile, CPM Kannur district president MV Jayarajan said that Padmini, the mother of Ratheesh, has submitted a complaint to the state police chief saying that her son had committed suicide due to the mental agony of being falsely named as an accused in the Mansoor murder case. “She has, in the letter, said that IUML activists had conspired to falsely implicate Ratheesh in the case and urged action against those who were responsible for his suicide. She also said in the complaint that Ratheesh had told her that IUML workers had manhandled him on poll day,” Jayarajan said, while speaking at the peace rally organized by CPM from Kadavathur to Peringathur in Panoor on Monday urging for reinstating peace in the region. He claimed that many others were also falsely named as accused in the FIR on the basis of the statement of IUML activists. Meanwhile, Congress leader K Sudhakaran reiterated that the death of Ratheesh was a murder and alleged that Ratheesh was hanged by other accused in the case after a conflict arose while they were hiding in a house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/ratheesh-others-stayed-at-hideout/articleshow/82038488.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No pre-arrest bail for pilot in sex harassment case||Mumbai: Observing that sexually harassing women at the workplace is a serious offence, a sessions court recently refused to grant anticipatory bail to a 53-year-old senior captain in an airline. The accused has been allegedly harassing a woman colleague for five years by making sexually coloured remarks and the airlines had failed to take action despite her complaints. The woman lodged an FIR last month. Ruling that it was not a fit case for granting pre-arrest bail, the court said, “The record also shows that the accused has the habit to sexually harass women working with him in the company which shows that he is habitual and involved in such activity with other female members who kept silent due to their defamation,” the court said. The court said the reputation of such a prestigious company was also at stake due to the accused’s heinous act. The woman had complained to the police on March 30. In her complaint, the woman, who got divorced recently, alleged the accused used phrases such as like “looking great”, “looking very nice in that”, “want to get together later?” and “you must be very lonely”. She said he would look at her body in an inappropriate manner and make passes at her. The woman also alleged that after she complained to the company in January this year, the accused had repeatedly called her at odd hours and threatened her to get her out of the job. The court held that the mobile phone used by the accused to send the woman the messages was yet to seized. It also said the man’s custodial interrogation was essential for the investigating officer to probe the case. “Moreover, there is every possibility that the accused may tamper with the prosecution witnesses and evidence if he is released on anticipatory bail,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-pre-arrest-bail-for-pilot-in-sex-harassment-case/articleshow/82036952.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Delhi||Govt to involve people to cut pollution: Rai||New Delhi: Environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday said the government would focus on public participation and changing their mindset and behaviour to combat air pollution in Delhi. The two-day online conference discussing measures to be taken to reduce pollution before the onset of winter concluded on Tuesday. “Within the constraints of the pandemic and restriction on mass mobilisation, we need to create a movement against pollution. Our three-pronged approach needs to focus on policy, technology and making the environment a mass concern,” Rai said, adding that people had the power, and if they make environment their concern, big milestones could be achieved. The minister added that the third level was effective use of agencies at their disposal. “We had launched the Green Delhi App to register real-time complaints. Often when a crisis occurs, it is shuffled from one department to another because even officers in charge sometimes do not know where their jurisdiction ends. Delhi faces multiple challenges, and if within them we can deliver, it is a feat worth celebrating,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-involve-people-to-cut-pollution-rai/articleshow/82055518.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Now, system to save crop from animals||Patiala: The researchers at IIT Ropar have come up with a concept of acoustic repellent system (ARS) for crop protection against animal attacks in agricultural fields. The animals would be detected and repelled by this repellent and monitory system from the fields by using ultrasonic sound frequencies beyond the hearing capacity of the animals. The initial study has been carried out in Katli village of Ropar district that shares the border with the forest area in the district and was prone to the attack of wild animals including wild boar and nilgai and deer. The wild boar has a hearing frequency range from 250Hz to 40 kHz whereas nilgai and deer have a hearing frequency from 33Hz to 50KHz, said researchers, who are further working to deploy and implement the system in the fields after initial checks. They said it was a unique technique to monitor and repel stray or wild animals entering the fields without causing them any physical harm. Professor Harpreet Singh, department of mechanical engineering at IIT Ropar, said a farmer or cluster of farmers can collectively install the ARS at the entry points of the wild or stray animals after carrying out mapping of the area. He said that under the concept ARS can also be monitored with the help of mobile phones. According to researchers, the proposed system with the help of an infrared camera would sense its surroundings and process images using computer vision and would detect the kind of animal entering the fields. The ARS, however, would be able to detect the animals around 50 metres away and with a span of 110 degrees. The researchers revealed that amplifiers can be used to increase the audible range. The ultrasonic repellent can produce frequencies ranging from 15 to 65 kHz. On detecting the animal in the fields, the ARS would send positive signals following which the frequency generator would emit the frequency waves that will scare away the animal. The animal won’t be able to tolerate the high-pitched sound and would leave the coverage area of the sensor. The researchers said the movement and images of approaching animal would be detected by a high-resolution infrared night vision camera and even in the absence of humans it would ensure security during night, harsh weather and low visibility. “The destruction of crops by wild or stray animals has been a major issue not only in the agrarian state of Punjab, but across the country and world where farming is being practised. The ARS would cost around Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000 for installation in the agricultural fields. Our research paper has been published in the international journal in November last year,” said Anmol Rattan, a BTech student at department of mechanical engineering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/now-system-to-save-crop-from-animals/articleshow/82038493.cms||Bharat Khanna

---||Chandigarh||Ex-SDM held in Rs 150cr land grab case||Ferozepur: Nine years after six officials were among seven persons booked in a Rs 150-crore land grab case, police here finally arrested retired sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Gurjeet Singh Pannu and former naib tehsildar Biram Lal. Though the case was registered on December 11, 2011, the duo had not yet been arrested over allegations of grabbing Union government land worth over Rs 150 crore on the basis of forged and fabricated documents. The arrests came on the basis of a reinvestigation that had been launched by Punjab Police on directions from the Punjab and Haryana high court. While addressing a petition filed by one Harjinder Singh, complainant in the case, in 2019, the court had also mentioned Section 173 (2) of CrPC report prepared by the police against the accused, including officials of the local revenue department. Ferozpur native Assa Singh forged and fabricated documents, allegedly in connivance with officials of the local revenue department, in 2011 and grabbed the land measuring 15 acres and 9 marlas. Following a complaint, the then Ferozepur DC, S Karuna Raju, ordered a probe and subsequently a case under sections 409, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471, and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code was registered in December 2012 against Assa and officials of the local revenue department, including naib tehsildar Madan Mohan, assistant sales clerk Gurmeet Kaur, revenue officials Gurdial Singh and Balwant Singh, clerk Birm Lal and patwari Ashok Kumar for their alleged bid to usurp the land. The probe also named Pannu for his involvement in the case, but his name was cleared in the following probes. People involved in the fraud are said to have approached local politicians to get a new inquiry marked into the matter in 2013. Police had reportedly made a report and given a clean chit to all the accused. But, before it was submitted to the higher police official for approval, Ferozepur Cantonment resident Harjinder filed the petition in high court. To confuse the court, police reportedly launched multiple investigations into the matter and gave contradictory findings. It was only after the court summoned the then DGP to clarify the role of police in conducting multiple investigations, an inquiry was entrusted to Mukhwinder Singh Chhina, IG of Bathinda zone, who got the matter probed by a SIT led by SP (investigations), DSP City and SHO of Sadar Ferozepur police station, during which all the documents presented by Assa Singh were found fake and the entire record of the revenue department and transfer deed were also found fabricated and tampered with, after a scientific analysis at the forensic lab in Mohali. The SIT also recommended action against Amarjit Singh Matwani, the then SP (Investigations) of Fazilka who deliberately recommended the scrapping of the case by ignoring documentary evidence. Ferozepur SSP Bhagirath Singh Meena confirmed the arrests of Pannu and Lal. However, after his arrest, Pannu was rushed to the hospital as he complained of ill health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ex-sdm-held-in-rs-150cr-land-grab-case/articleshow/82038522.cms||Dinesh K Sharma
---||Kochi||CPM organizational polls likely in July-August||Kochi: After the eventful assembly polls, it will be once again election time for the CPM. The party organizational polls, which should have started in September last year, may begin in July-August this year. The party had put organizational polls on hold considering the elections to the legislative assemblies in Kerala and West Bengal. The elections will give answers to a lot of questions like whether Kodiyeri Balakrishnan will return to the helm of the party state unit, how will the party accommodate Jayarajans, will the party continue under the tight grip of Pinarayi, etc. “The organizational polls will be start either in July or August. We have started groundwork for the organizational conferences,” sources with the CPM said. Balakrishnan, who had relinquished the state secretary’s post following allegations against his sons, was actively involved in the assembly election campaigns. He undertook various responsibilities and tried to sort out certain issues some of the communities had with the party. Though the name of E P Jayarajan had been doing the rounds for holding party state secretary’s charge, chances are less for him to be elected to the post. There is a chance for Kodiyeri to return to the post unless he is trapped in fresh controversies. It is viewed that A Vijayaraghavan, who holds the post of the state secretary when Balakrishnan took leave, performed well. So, he may be rewarded during the organizational polls. Ministers like T M Thomas Isaac, who didn’t get ticket to contest this assembly elections, may also be considered for some organizational posts. Political observers as well as supporters are keenly watching on how the party is going to accommodate P Jayarajan. Cases like gold smuggling and deep sea fishing deal may be discussed at length at the party conference. However, the outcome of assembly elections will decide how deep such discussions will go. It is certain that not so many of the leaders are satisfied with the authoritarian attitude of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Such issues will also reflect during the discussions as part of conferences at various levels. But it is sure that a win in the assembly elections will make Vijayan more powerful. Many in the party are apprehensive how the party can retain its democratic set up in such a situation. The CPM leadership has already planned some measures to increase the party’s mass-base. “The central committee has given instructions to the state leadership to enhance the strength of women, marginalized sections and minorities in the party. The party will be adopting strict measures to ensure that the central committee’s instructions are adhered to,” sources said. “There should also be efforts to increase the participation of youth at various levels of the leadership,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpm-organizational-polls-likely-in-july-august/articleshow/82038530.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The students will be promoted on April 15, 2021, on the basis of homework given and projects done under SMILE 1, SMILE 2 and under the programme ‘Aao Ghar Se Seekho’. Students will be marked on the basis of these projects and evaluated by teachers without written examination looking at the rising number of corona cases. Students studying in classes VIII, X and XII board will not be promoted, but board examination as per schedule will be conducted. For classes I to V, already announcement for promoting them on the basis of SMILE programme without examination was made. Only students studying in classes IX and XI are remaining for which the department is yet to issue any order. Under SMILE 1, students were added in a WhatsApp group in which government teachers would upload subject material and student would study during the time of complete lockdown. This was taken on a later stage in which students were given homework online, then collected by teacher from his/her home and then evaluated. The government launched ‘Aao Ghar Se Seekhe’ scheme during the time when classes were still closed. Under this scheme, online videos were uploaded on YouTube from which students could study. All these initiatives were taken to facilitate students at home as schools are yet to function properly. The government re-opened classes IV to XII initially, but closed down again when the cases started to rise. Now, on the basis of all the other programmes, students will be evaluated in final examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/class-vi-and-vii-students-to-be-promoted-without-examination/articleshow/82038504.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: 700-year-old-mosque gets glory back in 5 years||NEW DELHI: Over 700 years old, the Jamat Khana Masjid in the Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah complex didn’t show its provenance, hidden as its history was under layers of enamel paints. Five years of effort put in by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) with the support of the local community, the mosque is almost back to its former glory. Calling it the first ever conservation of a living and unprotected mosque used by around two million people every year, AKTC removed years of paint, repaired leakages and revealed the intricate incised plasterwork of the 14th century building. Najmi Nizami, whose family has been leading the prayers at the mosque for centuries, approached AKTC for its preservation around five years ago. “I used to visit Humayun’s Tomb with my wife and was impressed with the restoration work done there. The Nizamuddin Baoli was also conserved by AKTC in a scientific manner. Because of these examples, the Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah Committee thought Aga Khan Trust for Culture would be the best organisation to conserve this unprotected masjid, also called the Khilji Mosque,” revealed Nizami. The dargah committee is happy that the restoration is almost complete. Farid Ahmed Nizami, president of the committee, said work had progressed slowly because they had to make sure the mosque did not stop functioning. “Both AKTC workers and we had decided that devotees who visited the mosque or the people who came for the langar would be hampered by the restoration work,” said Farid Nizami. Neetipal Brar, conservation architect at AKTC, added, “This work was an example of flexible conservation because the mosque was in use and we could not work during the month of Ramzan or during Eid and even on Thursdays and Fridays of the week.” This was reiterated by AKTC CEO Ratish Nanda, who claimed the restoration was an example of joint work in which “the local community and the dargah committee assisted us”. Nanda explained that Jamaat Khana was among the earliest buildings in the Humayun's Tomb-Nizamuddin locality. Over four million pilgrims who come annually to the Nizamuddin Dargah also visit this mosque. Brar, conservation architect at Aga Khan Trust for Culture, disclosed, “Over the years, the mosque had deteriorated, the stones were crumbling and the roofs were leaking. But instead of fixing this, the earlier protection workers used cement or painted over the corroded portions.” The restoration has seen the removal of lead paint that had begun affecting the red sandstone structure. The effort was also to reveal the original stone structure with its Quranic inscriptions and stone carvings. Of the three bays, the zenana (women’s section of the mosque) has seen the restoration of the ornamentation and the incised plaster work wherever there was evidence of its existence. Nanda also said that the domes or the gumbad had been repaired, while some stone parapets needed to be replaced. Altamash Nizami, Dargah Committee member, assured that with the historic structure now restored, “we will make sure that there is no further damage to the structure and we maintain the integrity of the stone structure”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/700-yr-old-mosque-gets-glory-back-in-5-yrs/articleshow/82038501.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Temples step into Navratri with caution, put restrictions on entry||NEW DELHI: Temples across the city have stepped up arrangements for Navratri which starts on Tuesday in light of the raging Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions on religious gatherings. At Jhandewalan Devi Mandir, the temple committee has decided the shrine will not be open to the public. Ravinder Goel, trustee of the mandir, said that several arrangements had been made for Navratri puja. “We have decided to engage 2,400 volunteers, including 300 women, to help us implementing the Covid precautionary norms while allowing a limited number of people inside the temple premises at particular times,” said Goel. He said that despite there being no clear-cut instructions from the government on the opening or closing of temples, the committee decided to keep the temple closed to visitors during Navratri. “We took this decision due to the sudden rise in Covid cases and considering the fact that our temple is visited by hundreds of people from far and near every day during Navratri,” added Goel. The puja would be telecast on YouTube and social media channels. At Kalkaji Mandir in south Delhi, only the one entry near Nehru Place will be kept open to allow in devotees. There will be no distribution of prasad, and the temple will close at 8.30pm. No one will be allowed in even for the evening and morning pujas. Devotees are being encouraged instead to attend the online aarti on the mandir’s website. Kalkaji Mandir gets a crush of devotees during Navratri with people not minding the long stand in queues for a darshan of the goddess. Ajay Bhardwaj, convener of Shri Kalkaji Mandir Prabandhak Sudhar Committee, disclosed that the temple would be open for darshan, but only a limited number of devotees would be allowed inside at a time. “We don’t want crowds or bhandars in and around the mandir complex,” said Bhardwaj. “To stop people bringing flowers and other offerings to the mandir, we have asked all shops in the complex to remain shut. People are expected to immediately leave after the darshan and no one will be allowed to linger on at the temple. We have also closed a section of the temple to avoid crowding.” Navratri isn’t especially momentous at the Hanuman temple in Connaught Place. But Suresh Sharma, mahant of mandir, said, “Though the number of devotees doesn’t go up in Navratri, we will nevertheless have measures such as disinfection of common areas and fences and thermal scanning. We have also made arrangements to allow entry to devotees in small groups at a time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/temples-step-into-navratri-with-caution-put-restrictions-on-entry/articleshow/82038517.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||Drugs via darknet: Two more arrested||New Delhi: Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Tuesday said two more drug traffickers operating through the darknet module were arrested and contraband worth Rs 27 crore seized so far. The total number of arrests now stands at six. On Monday, NCB informed about the arrest of four traffickers and seizure of a huge quantity of drugs. During the operation, the cops also busted the pharmaceutical company manufacturing and diverting the psychotropic drugs illegally. Deputy director (Ops) KPS Malhotra said the probe revealed that the owner of the pharmaceutical company busted by the agency was in jail in a murder case. He will be taken on remand for interrogation. His son, who handles the illicit business, is absconding and teams are conducting raids for his arrest, he added. NCB’s director general Rakesh Asthana also led the Indian delegation in the International Narcotics Control Board’s conference on drugs and crime on Monday, where he made specific remarks on the issue of psychotropic drugs diversion, while mentioning this operation. Further investigation into this darknet-enabled-drug trafficking network has revealed that several pharmaceutical companies were directly involved in the diversion of psychotropic drugs from lawful to illicit channels. “One of the main methods of diversion used was to increase production per batch. The firms are allowed to produce a certain number of drugs per batch, they manufactured more and sold them in the black market,” KPS Malhotra said. NCB, the officials said, had also observed that the syndicate members were exploiting the loopholes in the Indian postal system. “Involvement of some of the postal employees and branches in aiding the syndicate members for booking consignments destined for the US and the UK is under scanner,” Malhotra added. According to NCB officials, the members of this syndicate were fraudulently obtaining copies of IDs (i.e Aadhar card, Voter IDs, PAN cards) from various sources for the purpose of booking the consignments with the connivance/aid of postal employees. More arrests are likely in the coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/drugs-via-darknet-two-more-arrested/articleshow/82055566.cms||---

---||Noida||Now, two vaccine vans to give jabs in slum areas||Gurgaon: To inoculate people living in slums, the health department on Monday launched two Covid-19 vaccine vans. These vans have four vaccinators, a doctor, a room for monitoring adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) and space for registration of recipients. They will vaccinate 100 people a day each, officials from the health department said.The department has mapped out slum areas of the city, which mostly fall in Bhim Colony, Nathupur, Wazirabad, Rajendra Park, Dundahera and Sirhaul. The vans will visit a slum area daily and will motivate people to get the jabs. “Each of these vans can vaccinate 100 people in a day. After inoculation, the recipients will be asked to wait in the AEFI room for 30 minutes to ensure that they do not develop any adverse effects,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon.This innovative initiative has been launched with the view to target people who are in slums and are not going to session sites as most of them are unaware of the vaccination drive, officials said. The city also set up session sites in several banks from Monday. To ensure maximum coverage of those above 45 years of age, ASHA workers are motivating people by going house-to-house in rural and semi-rural areas of Gurgaon. “The plan is to vaccinate 20,000 people on Tuesday and 14,000 on Wednesday. We have achieved 100% of our Day 2 target of the tika utsav as cumulatively, we have vaccinated 20,060 recipients on Monday. We are getting a good response as we are venturing into community centres, societies, banks and malls,” Dr Yadav said.On Monday, 18,599 people aged above 45 years got vaccinated. As many as 220 session sites were set up in Gurgaon — 164 at government facilities and 56 at private hospitals. A total of 4.3 lakh people in Gurgaon are eligible for getting the jabs, and so far, Gurgaon has vaccinated 2.5 lakh. Meanwhile, 384 healthcare workers and 1,077 frontline workers also got the jab on Monday, taking their total tally to 52,945 and 34,218, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/now-two-vaccine-vans-to-give-jabs-in-slum-areas/articleshow/82039436.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Nagpur||Respite for admitted Covid patients as hospitals get 100% Remdesivir stock||Nagpur: The kin of patients will not have to go searching for Remdesivir injections at distributors, stockists or pharmacies now. The collector office has for the first time ensured Covid hospitals get all the available stock on Monday. The entire stock was taken over by the collector from the suppliers, and distributed to hospitals as per NMC’s approved bed capacity of each hospital.After taking over the entire stock of Remdesivir allotted for the district, collector office has also issued an order on Monday that Covid hospitals and such facilities will get their share of the injections from designated distributors or stockists only. The distributors and stockists were provided a list of Covid hospitals and facilities, along with number of beds allotted to each, by the collector office. Retail sales of the drug remain prohibited in the district. In a twist, some hospitals that had increased the number of beds beyond the number sanctioned by NMC are likely to face shortages even now. It is not known how patients admitted in these additional beds would be administered the drug. “We had sought list of hospitals and number of beds allotted to them from NMC. Accordingly, we distributed Remdesivir for 100% of their capacity. If someone has increased the beds then NMC must look into the violations,” said the collector. He added that hospitals are not supposed to ask kin of patients to procure Remdesivir from outside.Dr Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA), said they have already appealed that Remdesivir must be administered as per the mandated guidelines of Covid treatment protocols and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “Only E and F category patients are to be treated with Remdesivir while the rest with Favipiravir. So, we can say that the shortage is unlikely to happen,” he said.The latest order of allotting Covid hospitals Remdesivir stock may have given some respite to indoor patients, but serious patients who are yet to find a bed seem to have been left in the lurch. A day ago, the collector office could manage to distribute some stock to hospitals after a consignment of 1,500 Remdesivir vials had reached the city’s carrying and forwarding agents (CFA) at Wadi late in the evening. On Monday, stocks from at least three more brands reached the city, allowing the collector office to send supplies to all hospitals.According to a distributor and stockists, the Remdesivir injections are distributed from Nagpur to districts as far as Jalgaon and even in other states like Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. “The shortage in Nagpur depot will have repercussions in neighbouring states too,” he said.As hospitals had started handing over Remdesivir prescriptions to patients’ kin to arrange for the drug, long queues were seen outside the pharmacies even beyond midnight, which had warranted the latest strategy by the collector office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/respite-for-admitted-covid-patients-as-hospitals-get-100-remdesivir-stock/articleshow/82037429.cms||Soumitra Bose

Shivakshi wants to work for the uplift of women and economically weaker sections of the society. A resident of Indiranagar, Shivakshi did her BCom (Hons) from Shri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi. “For anyone who wants to crack PCS examination, newspaper and NCERT books are a must. Candidates find it difficult to memorize current affairs but if you are reading newspaper regularly, current affairs will be on your fingertips,” she said. “I did’nt enrol myself with any coaching institute. Internet was my coaching centre at the time of pandemic. For success, all one needs is to fix a target for oneself for covering a particular topic in a fixed time duration,” she added. Shivakshi studied at Spring Dale College, Indiranagar, till Class 10 and thereafter at La Martiniere Girls College. “My mother, Veena Dixit, is a teacher at Rani Laxmi Bai Memorial School and she is my biggest inspiration.

---||Mumbai||BMC paying 2.5 times more for remdesivir, accuses BJP||MUMBAI: With Covid-19 cases rising sharply, demand for antiviral drug remdesivir, used to treat serious patients, is up again. Amid reports of shortage and hospitals and patients’ families struggling to get it, BMC is procuring over 2 lakh vials. The opposition has raised a red flag, alleging the civic body is paying 2.5 times more for the life-saving drug than other public agencies acquiring it. BJP claimed BMC is spending around Rs 17 crore more to buy remdesivir. Party corporator Vinod Mishra has written to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal, asking for a probe. “The entire tender was fabricated and rigged. For remdesivir worth Rs 13 crore, BMC is paying over Rs 30 crore,” he said. BMC placed an order for 2 lakh vials on April 7 at Rs 1,568 per vial. Interestingly, the state-run Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corporation (HBPCL) placed orders for around 57,100 vials at Rs 665 per vial on April 9. Moreover, records show BMC itself had purchased 50,000 vials of remdesivir on March 25 at Rs 650 per vial. Last week, health minister Rajesh Tope had said there was a price cap of Rs 1,100-Rs 1,400 on remdesivir, stressing that the price for a vial should not cross Rs 1,400. Mishra alleged that BMC violated procurement norms and bought the vials directly from a private company even before the tenders were opened. “This is nothing but a medicine scam. BMC floated tenders on April 5. The price bids were opened on April 12, but BMC had already placed an order on April 9. They are buying 2 lakh vials at 2.5 times the price of HBPCL and their own purchase price from two weeks ago,” he said. Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh said BMC had violated all procurement norms and he would take up the issue with the Lokayukta. “This is nothing but a scam. BMC should have negotiated the price with the company. There are eight remdesivir manufacturers and BMC should have placed orders for smaller quantities with them. There was no need to place a bulk order with one firm at 2.5 times the price all at once. Buying of remdesivir is not a life-saving but a money-making exercise,” said Shaikh. When contacted, P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), said, “There was a single bidder. The other manufacturers did not participate in the tender. Since there was only one bidder, the central purchase department (CPD) took the information of pricing by email without waiting.” Weighing in on the controversy, BJP MLA Ameet Satam demanded an audit of remdesivir use in BMC hospitals. “There has been rampant misuse of this life-saving drug. Vials have been given to VIPs and there is no account of usage. There must be an audit of how many vials of remdesivir were used in each BMC hospital,” said Satam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-paying-2-5-times-more-for-remdesivir-accuses-bjp/articleshow/82039510.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Gurgaon||Haryana: Restrictions may hit supply chain, fear transporters||GURUGRAM: Transporters have expressed concern over Haryana’s decision to impose curfew between 9pm and 5am, fearing they would run into further losses at a time they are yet to recover from the financial setback of the lockdown. Many of them said the restrictions on movement at night would not only cripple their businesses but also disrupt the supply chain, like it had done the last time. “Curfews and weekend lockdowns have dealt a blow to the transport sector, which was already reeling from losses incurred during the lockdown. These restrictions will once again lead to harassment of truckers by the local authorities and leave them stranded in the middle of the night. The government must pay heed to our concerns as the livelihood of lakhs is at stake,” said Kultaran Singh Atwal, president of All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC). Transporters demanded that the government must assure them that these restrictions would not impact the supply chain and other services. “We’ll have to wait and see how these restrictions pan out for us. But, this is certain that they would lead uncertainty and financial issues. We haven’t yet recovered from the economic shock of last year’s lockdown. The government must make it clear that these restrictions will not affect those involved in supply chain services,” said Bajrang Sharma, vice-president of Haryana truck and transport association. The operators have sought an exemption from the e-way bill penalty and demanded that the condition be brought down from 200km/day to 100 km/day. The new guidelines have put curbs on timings and are leading to delays in transportation and expiry of e-way bills in many cases. This has been attracting penalties. “We have demanded that the government exempt us from paying e-way bill penalty and change the existing condition from 200km/day to 100 km/day, which could help accommodate such uncertainties. Also, strict directions must be issued to field officers not to stop or harass truckers at checkpoints,” Atwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/restrictions-may-hit-supply-chain-fear-transporters/articleshow/82039469.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

Described as Vascular Bypass surgery for Diabetic foot, the method has been practiced by HoD Prof Rajiv Agarwal and his team for the past six months. Citing recent data Prof Agarwal said: “Out of 62 million diabetics in India, 25% develop diabetic foot wounds or ulcers (DFU) of which 50% become infected requiring hospitalization. Of the admitted patients with DFU, 20% need amputation. Also, patients with DFU have a higher death rate when compared to other diabetics without wounds.” Talking about the new method, he said: “we conduct a bypass grafting of the diseased arteries in diabetics in which a good calibre vein is used to restore the blood flow across the diseased segment in a micro-vascular surgical procedure. Though complex and 5-8 hours long, the procedure restores normal blood supply to affected areas through a new channel which enables rapid healing of the wound and prevention of further gangrene to a significant extent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/saving-gangrene-in-diabetic-foot-patients/articleshow/82040290.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Sunanda Pushkar death case: Shashi Tharoor cites 7-year wait for justice, seeks discharge||NEW DELHI: “We have waited for seven years for justice,” said former minister Shashi Tharoor through his counsel seeking discharge in the death case of his wife, Sunanda Pushkar, on Monday. The arguments were concluded before special judge Geetanjli Goel, who said orders would likely be passed on April 29. Both Tharoor’s counsel, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, and special public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava concluded their submissions. Shrivastava insisted that the court frame charges of abetment to suicide under IPC Section 306 and the alternate charge of murder under IPC 302. Pahwa had, however, argued, “This case has absolutely no evidence. It is a baseless case where charges cannot be framed. I, on the contrary, appreciated the Special Investigation Team for bringing this material which shows I am innocent. This is one case where we are looking for justice and the accused should be discharged.” Charges couldn’t be framed against Tharoor for want of evidence, he said. “It is hearsay evidence. They are not able to even establish if it is a suicide. There is overwhelming positive evidence that it is neither a suicide nor a homicide. They say it is ‘accidental’. That is their evidence, I am not saying that,” Pahwa contended. It came on record that a medical opinion stated that Pushkar’s death was accidental. Pahwa also contested the prosecution’s argument that suicide had to be presumed and said the evidence did not show suicide. “Not even a single relative of the deceased has said anything against me.” According to the defence, every aspect — how many times food was ordered, who went and who came out — in three days surrounding the day of Pushkar’s death at the hotel had been analysed. “Nothing suspicious was found,” he added. The counsel further said AIIMS had given three reports, all inconclusive, following which the investigating officer had written a detailed letter saying he was going to the Union health ministry requesting for a medical board. “Medical board also said it was neither a homicide nor a suicide. Psychological autopsy report also doesn’t say anything,” Pahwa added. “If the death is accidental, suicide cannot be presumed. If it cannot be presumed, where is the question of abetment?” asked Pahwa. Shrivastava relied on the statement of an eyewitness to argue that Tharoor and Pushkar fought with each other. He said Pushkar was subjected to cruelty and had lost her appetite. “Things did not happen in one day. It happened over a period of time,” Shrivastava said. According to the prosecution, Tharoor also tried to “intervene” in the preparation of a medical report and “wanted a favourable report”. The court, thereafter, posed two questions to the prosecution. First, if anywhere in the medical reports filed on record was the quantity of the antidepressant tablets that could lead to someone’s death mentioned and secondly what was the effect of these tablets at the time of alcohol intake. The traces of these tablets were reportedly found in Pushkar’s autopsy. The court was informed that according to doctors, no such study had been carried out on human beings to demonstrate the fatal quantity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tharoor-cites-7-yr-wait-for-justice-seeks-discharge/articleshow/82038526.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Delhi||Delhi govt declares 14 private hospitals fully Covid facilities||NEW DELHI: Amid an exponential surge in Covid cases, Delhi government on Monday declared 14 private hospitals as full Covid facilities and increased the number of beds in other private hospitals from 50% to 60%, adding 2,060 Covid beds. Another 593 beds were created in six government hospitals, including Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, Burari Hospital, Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital and Ambedkar Nagar Hospital, all fully Covid hospitals. Delhi reported 11,491 new Covid cases in the past 24 hours and the number of active cases has crossed 38,000, challenging the existing healthcare infrastructure. The situation regarding the occupancy and availability of Covid beds was assessed in a meeting chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday. The occupancy of Covid ICU beds has crossed more than 85% in 57 out of the 115 private hospitals and reached 100% in almost all large private facilities. The occupancy of ward beds has also crossed more than 85% in 32 private hospitals and reached 100% in most of the prominent facilities. Delhi also sees a steady flow of patients from outside. Shehnai Banquet Hall in central Delhi has been converted into a temporary Covid hospital. During the last wave and before that, hundreds of patients were treated at this banquet hall. It was closed last year after cases dipped, said Dr Rajat Jain of Doctors For You, which is running the temporary hospital. Immediately after the facility was set up, 21 patients were admitted to it on Monday. The government is also exploring the possibility of involving other such facilities to tackle the crisis. According to an order issued by the health department, “In view of the high occupancy percentage of Covid beds (ICU/ward) in the large private hospitals, it was also decided to declare 14 large hospitals namely, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Holy Family Hospital, Maharaja Agarsen Hospital Punjabi Bagh, Max SS Hospital Shalimar Bagh, Fortis Hospital Shalimar Bagh, Max Smart Super Specialty Hospital, Venkateshwar Hospital, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, Jaipur Golden Hospital, Mata Chanan Devi Hospital, Pushpawati Singhania Research Institute, Manipal Hospital & Saroj Super Specialty Hospital, as full Covid hospital.” These hospitals will not admit any non-Covid medical/surgical patient till further orders, the order clarified. “Further, in order to reach the Covid ICU bed capacity to the level of November 2020, it was decided that the reservation of ICU beds is to be increased from 50% to 80% in 19 out of 33 private hospitals and to be increased from 50% to 60% in the remainder 82 out of 115 private hospitals,” the order added. At least 60% of the total ward capacity of a hospital is to be reserved for Covid-related treatment in 101 private hospitals, which are not declared as full Covid hospitals but are providing Covid-related treatment. The number of beds has been increased from 500 to 650 in the Rajiv Gandhi hospital, from 320 to 450 in Burari Hospital and from 100 to 213 in Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital. Last week, the government had directed private hospitals to reserve 50% of their total ICU and ward beds, but since then the number of cases has increased several times. Following Monday’s meeting, the government decided to increase the number of beds due to higher load on the healthcare infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-declares-14-private-hospitals-fully-covid-facilities/articleshow/82038552.cms||AlokKNMishra

These vans have four vaccinators, a doctor, a room for monitoring adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) and space for registration of recipients. They will vaccinate 100 people a day each, officials from the health department said. The department has mapped out slum areas of the city, which mostly fall in Bhim Colony, Nathupur, Wazirabad, Rajendra Park, Dundahera and Sirhaul. The vans will visit a slum area daily and will motivate people to get the jabs. “Each of these vans can vaccinate 100 people in a day. After inoculation, the recipients will be asked to wait in the AEFI room for 30 minutes to ensure that they do not develop any adverse effects,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. This innovative initiative has been launched with the view to target people who are in slums and are not going to session sites as most of them are unaware of the vaccination drive, officials said. The city also set up session sites in several banks from Monday. To ensure maximum coverage of those above 45 years of age, ASHA workers are motivating people by going house-to-house in rural and semi-rural areas of Gurugram. “The plan is to vaccinate 20,000 people on Tuesday and 14,000 on Wednesday. We have achieved 100% of our Day 2 target of the tika utsav as cumulatively, we have vaccinated 20,060 recipients on Monday. We are getting a good response as we are venturing into community centres, societies, banks and malls,” Dr Yadav said. On Monday, 18,599 people aged above 45 years got vaccinated. As many as 220 session sites were set up in Gurugram — 164 at government facilities and 56 at private hospitals. A total of 4.3 lakh people in Gurugram are eligible for getting the jabs, and so far, Gurgaon has vaccinated 2.5 lakh. Meanwhile, 384 healthcare workers and 1,077 frontline workers also got the jab on Monday, taking their total tally to 52,945 and 34,218, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/now-two-vaccine-vans-to-give-jabs-in-slum-areas/articleshow/82039501.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Delhi||Delhi: After tiff, six men return to bar, attack waiter with rods||NEW DELHI: After an earlier argument with a server at a lounge and bar in Hauz Khas Village, around six men returned, wielding sticks, spades and rods and attacked the bar manager — who needed 28 stitches on his head—and other servers. According to the police, the trouble on March 31 started when some customers started dancing on the table, leading to a heated argument between them and the waiter. The men were asked to leave the club. Police have arrested the main accused, while the other men involved are yet to be brought in. According to the police, Mehul Rana, the manager of the club, said in his complaint that that around 12.50am on March 31, the bouncer informed him about 3-4 men misbehaving. “I went to check this out and identified one of the men as Tanveer, a frequent visitor to our bar and another bar close by. Tanveer owns a gym in Hauz Rani,” Rana said in the complaint. “I tried to tell him and his friends to mend their ways but when they did not listen. I asked the bouncer to escort them out. While leaving, they threatened me and told me they would teach me a lesson. Since it was time for the bar to close, we were wrapping up work when Tanveer and his friends barged inside with spade and sticks in their hands.” Rana added that the men attacked the guests, bouncer and damaged the bar property. “Tanveer first attacked me with a spade on my head and then his friends picked up a beer bottle and broke it over my head. They went on hitting, kicking, breaking things and thrashing all our staffers,” alleged Rana. “We ran to the washroom to save ourselves and rushed to the hospital after they left. Due to the injuries I suffered, I fell unconscious. Since I had to undergo treatment, I could report the matter to the police only two days later and a case was registered.” According to the cops, the fracas started with the accused dancing on a bar table. “We have arrested the main accused, Tanveer, and raids are being carried out to apprehend his friends,” said a police officer. On Monday, when TOI spoke to Rana, he claimed to be in a state of shock and did not wish to speak about the incident. “I needed 28 stitches on my head, among several other injuries I suffered,” Rana said. “I cannot even fathom what happened and it's taking me time to come to terms with the events of the day. The entire incident has been caught on CCTV cameras, starting from how they created havoc at the bar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-tiff-six-men-return-to-bar-attack-waiter-with-rods/articleshow/82038549.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||SAD, Cong hand in glove in saving culprits of Kotkapura firing: BJP||Jalandhar: Alleging that Shiromani Akali Dal and Congress are hand in glove with each other in protecting the culprits of police firing at innocent and peaceful protestors in Kotkapura, BJP national spokesperson Iqbal Singh Lalpura has said justice should be delivered at the earliest in sacrilege and firing cases. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was in power in Punjab along with SAD when the police firing took place in 2015. “We hold Sukhbir Singh Badal responsible for what happened under his watch, including firing incidents, and accused of sacrilege and firing remaining free. We hold present Punjab chief minister, who is also holding the home department, responsible if accused are now getting a leeway in place of justice being delivered,” said Lalpura, whiles speaking to TOI on Monday. “Justice delayed is justice denied; now, if the accused are managing to escape for whatever reasons, buck stops at the chief minister as he is home minister also,” he said. He said CM could not escape responsibility if Punjab and Haryana high court scrapped the special investigation team (SIT). “Who so ever is directly responsible for this outcome in the high court, the final responsibility is of the CM,” he said, adding that BJP wanted justice in all the three cases – Bargari sacrilege, Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura firing. BJP national spokesperson also alleged that there was nothing new in whatever was happening. “Earlier when police and other officers backtracked in cases of corruption against Badals, which were registered during previous tenure of Congress government, the Amarinder Singh government after coming to power, in place of taking any action, rewarded such officers. Officers who had backtracked from their statements in court should have been taken to task but instead they were protected and rewarded after Congress came to power in 2017. Now also, accused are being protected,” he said. ‘Police tried to frame Sikhs in sacrilege case’ BJP national spokesperson also pointed out that under former deputy CM Sukhbir Badal’s watch police had even attempted to implicate Sikh youths in sacrilege cases in place of arresting the real accused. “Sikhs were demandwith ing justice for sacrilege, but police tried to put blame on the Sikhs themselves. A Special investigation team had then tried to frame two Amritdhari Sikh brothers by fabricating evidence. However, no action was taken against such wrongdoing by the police officers,” said BJP national spokesperson Iqbal Singh Lalpura, himself a former police officer. “It was triple injustice to the Sikhs – first the sacrilege, then the firing and then blaming Sikhs for sacrilege. All this happened under Akali Dal chief minister and home minister. Had people not defeated this false implication, the blemish would have remained on the Sikh community forever and real culprits would have never been arrested,” he argued. “In 1981, Punjab Police arrested Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale (in Lala Jagat Narain murder case) without any evidence and then he was released after around a fortnight as there was no evidence. However, this led to a lot of trouble. If there was no evidence against him why was he arrested at first place?” said Lalpura, who was part of the team of police officers who were tasked to arrest Bhindranwale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-cong-hand-in-glove-in-saving-culprits-of-kotkapura-firing-bjp/articleshow/82038557.cms||IP Singh

---||Goa||Goa’s urban areas grapple with huge spikes||PANAJI: In less than a month, the state’s urban areas have witnessed an explosion of Covid infections, with densely-populated Porvorim leading the chart with 499 active cases on Monday. While during the first phase last year, it was Vasco’s Mangor hill that was an area of concern, at least in the beginning, this time around, urban areas around the state have seen a simultaneous spike in infections. “Porvorim is an urban area and is as packed as Panaji. Some parts of Porvorim have a higher concentration of population than Panaji,” said state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar. While Porvorim touches 500, Margao isn’t far behind with 466 active infections. Mapusa, Candolim Panaji, and Ponda all have over 300 cases, while Vasco has 227. Last year, areas such as Panaji and Porvorim reported around 20-30 cases daily during the peak. On Monday, Porvorim recorded over 60 new cases within 24 hours. “All urban areas have been impacted,” said Betodkar. “Panaji, Margao, and Porvorim have seen the fastest growth in cases. Once a certain limit is crossed, extensive contact tracing and testing are the only way out to control the spread of the disease. Earlier the test the better.” While rural areas are witnessing slower growth, infections in semi-urbanised places such as Siolim, Bicholim, Sankhali and areas which are thickly populated like Cortalim, Cansualim, Corlim and Chimbel are rising. In the first phase of the pandemic, several areas of Chimbel had to be declared micro-containment zones as the area, with a large number of hutments, saw cases spiralling. A senior government doctor said that urban areas, especially in North Goa, have witnessed a sharp rise due to heavy inter-mingling of people with least regard to Covid-appropriate behaviour. “There was no control whatsoever even as it was proved beyond doubt that certain events and places could be the source of infection,” he said. “The government seems to have woken up only after the state’s daily average went beyond 500 cases. I would say, even existing measures are not sufficient. The government must strictly deal with people who do not follow social distancing norms and do not wear masks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-urban-areas-grapple-with-huge-spikes/articleshow/82039514.cms||Bindiya Chari

Most of these persons continue to be negligent in adherence to Covid guidelines and behaving as if they are normal.This worrying situation came to the notice of the administrative and police officials, when they roamed across the city for the physical verification of positive cases and were in for shock not to find many of them at their houses.DCP (East) Dharmendra Yadav said such persons were being recommended essentially for institutional quarantine and cases of negligence were also being filed against them considering them a potential threat to the non-infected persons.In view of the seriousness of the situation, the JMC has also swung into action. JMC North mayor Vanita Seth has roped in a team of councillors to keep watch on the home quarantined persons. Each councillor has been given charge of 10 wards, who will not only remain in contact with such persons, but will also carry out activities for awareness.On the other hand, the administration has focused its efforts on ensuring the optimal utilization of resources in hospitals amid the surge of cases.District magistrate Indrajit Singh has given directions to the government as well as private hospitals to focus on daycare by identifying the positive cases and keeping adequate beds in hospitals to meet any emergency.“We are ensuring that the primary and secondary health centers and hospitals as well as satellite hospitals are adequately equipped in order to avoid burden on tertiary hospitals. We are also focusing on adequate availability of beds and oxygen in hospitals to meet any eventuality”, Singh said.“Besides this, we are also making sure that there are no casual referrals from district hospitals to the city hospitals unless there was an emergency and have directed the hospitals in the city to keep a proper record of all the positive cases”, he added. Considering an alarming spurt in cases in Jodhpur, the administration has set up 37 micro-containment zones with adequate barricading in such areas. Considering the unabated cases, more such zones are on the cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/positive-patients-defy-home-quarantine-norms-in-udaipur/articleshow/82038553.cms||---

The rotor leaves were dismantled before the chopper was lifted from the swamp using a hydraulic crane early on Monday. The chopper was transported on a large truck to the airport by 5am. Earlier on Sunday, official from the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) visited the spot and inspected the chopper that was stuck in the mud owing to landing impact. Post-inspection, DGCA gave clearance to shift the chopper to the hangar. “DGCA team and civil aviation experts will carry out a detailed inspection to find what led to the emergency landing. An investigation report will be submitted to DGCA soon. The officials of Agusta Westland, the manufacturer, are likely to inspect the copter. The agents of insurance company will also make an assessment of the damage,” said airport sources. The incident happened on Sunday morning when the chopper carrying LuLu group chairman MA Yusuff Ali and five others made an emergency landing in a marsh near Panangad police station. Ali was flying from his house in Kadavanthra to see his relative at a private hospital.

---||Bhopal||Bhopal under ‘corona curfew’ till April 19; 7,000 cases this month||BHOPAL: What was hovering on the horizon for the past four days has come true. Bhopal is in lockdown till April 19. Following a meeting of the District Crisis Management Group on Monday afternoon, Bhopal collector Avinash Lavania announced a lockdown in BMC and Berasia Municipal Council areas from 9pm on April 12 to 6am on April 19. However, the order issued under CrPC section 144 uses the word ‘Corona curfew’ rather than ‘lockdown’, and there would be more relaxations than a conventional lockdown, which Shahpura and Kolar are going through. Ever since Bhopal and Shahpura went under lockdown, there was apprehension that the entire city may be shut down any day. There have been over 7,000 new infections this month alone and active cases now stand at 5,438. Referring to spiraling cases of Coronavirus in Bhopal, Monday’s lockdown order says that several social, political and religious organisations have requested for prohibitory orders to rein in the virus. During the ‘curfew’, all commercial establishments will remain closed and normal traffic will be prohibited. However, medical stores, grocery shops (for home delivery), vegetable vends, fuel pumps, banks, ATMs, milk parlours and handcart vendors will be exempted. Central and state government employees, BMC staff, and those involved in emergency services are also exempted. So are mediapersons, newspaper hawkers, telecom, electricity, LPG cylinder agencies, PDS outlets, electricians, plumbers and carpenters, and construction activities (if the workers are staying on site). Transport of milk collection and distribution is allowed. Agriculture-related work — sale of pesticide, insecticide, fertilisers, agriculture implants — can go on unhindered. Candidates going to examination centres, industrial workers, transport of raw material and finished products from industries, transport of goods and services to other districts and states are allowed. Those going to the airport, railway stations and bus stands will be allowed to travel. So will IT firm employees and support staff of BPOs/mobile companies. In-room dining is allowed in hotels.

---||Delhi||Essential for BIS to monitor manufacture, sale of helmets: HC||Essential for BIS to monitor sale of helmets, says HC: Delhi High Court on Monday said it was essential for Bureau of Indian Standards to strictly monitor and supervise the manufacture and sale of helmets as it concerns the safety of consumers. Justice Prathiba M Singh’s remark came on an NGO’s plea claiming no action has been taken by BIS on over 1,400 complaints made by it from 2019 till date highlighting various alleged illegalities and irregularities in manufacture and sale of helmets. The NGO, Utprerit Consumer Foundation, also alleged that BIS has failed to properly monitor and supervise the manufacture and sale of the protective headgear. After hearing brief arguments on the issue, Justice Singh said, “Considering that safety and security of consumers is at stake, strict monitoring and supervision of the manufacture and sale of helmets is essential.” It also directed BIS to look into the complaints made by the NGO and to file a status report indicating the action taken on them and the steps taken by the authority to monitor and supervise the manufacture and sale of helmets to ensure there was no misuse of the ISI mark. The NGO claimed in its plea that “few companies and manufacturers are indulging in rampant illegal and unfair trade practices, including misrepresentation and false declarations, thereby cheating and misleading the customers by way of manufacturing and selling inter alia sub-standard helmets and/or without applicable licence to manufacture helmets.” It added that some companies are using ISI mark on their helmets despite cancellation of their licence to use it, while some others are manufacturing helmets of categories for which they do not have licence to use ISI mark. Some of the companies are also making helmets that do not conform to the standards laid down by BIS, the plea claimed. “By doing such illegal acts, they are risking the lives of the consumers for their petty and unlawful gain,” the NGO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/essential-for-bis-to-monitor-manufacture-sale-of-helmets-hc/articleshow/82038564.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

One of the videos that has gone viral shows a migrant worker walking towards the bus stand with a sack full of clothes and other items. He can be heard saying he is going home to Agra and does not plan to return anytime soon. “Curfew has been imposed here. Who knows when they will enforce the other one (lockdown) too?” he says. Travel agents agreed there was no panic as of now, but said a few migrant workers had started to return home in Bihar fearing another lockdown. They also said that many of the labourers may have been persuaded by their employers to return so that they won’t have to pay them when restrictions are in place. “Ever since the curfew was announced, there has been an uptick in the number of labourers heading home to several districts in Bihar, such as Kishanganj, Katihar, Darbhanga, Motihari and Patna. These workers have been told by their contractors that since the curfew has been imposed and there is not much work here, they should return home. Contractors tend to take advantage of such situations and send off migrants without making a payment,” said Younus Parvez, a travel agent at Pari Chowk. According to him, those headed for Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi and other UP districts are going to vote in the panchayat polls. Rural elections in the state are scheduled to be held in four phases between April 15 and 29.In village polls, there have often been allegations of candidates distributing cash or other valuables to influence voters. “There are a lot of bookings for April 19 and 26, which is because of the panchayat polls. Many say that villagers are being given Rs 4,000 to vote for a particular candidate. That is reason enough for many to return home at this time. Moreover, there are several others who are genuinely interested in casting their vote,” said Ankit Thakur, another agent.District magistrate Suhas LY directed the SDM (Sadar) to inspect the Pari Chowk area and find out if migrant workers were indeed queuing up there. “I strongly urge reputed media houses not to give credence to such people spreading rumours and they need to be quelled at the root. Industries have been told they can work at night. If one or two contractors have told something to the labourers, that does not mean people are moving out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/bookings-up-for-bihar-up-say-travel-agents/articleshow/82039519.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: RT-PCR report delays hamper Covid fight||BHOPAL: As Madhya Pradesh scrambles to tackle the runaway Covid pandemic, delays in tests results by government labs are slamming the brakes on the race against Corona. More and more people are complaining that they are getting their RT-PCR reports from government labs after five, or sometimes seven days. By then, often, the patient has either recovered or has been hospitalised as his condition worsened. Narayan Ajnare had given his swab sample for RT-PCR test on April 7 and was still waiting for the report on Monday, five days later. The delay prevented him from getting timely treatment. His condition deteriorated, and he got himself examined at a private hospital and is now on medication, he told TOI. Asked if the doctor at the fever clinic in Gulabi Nagar, where he had given his sample, didn’t give any medicines, he said: “They gave me medicines for 2-3 days. The prescribed doses got over but the report didn’t arrive. I went to a private hospital but by then my health had worsened,” said Ajnare. Dr Rakesh Shrivastava had given his sample at JP Hospital on April 7 and is yet to learn if he is infected or in the clear. People going to Mumbai, Delhi and other cities that have made negative RT-PCR test reports mandatory, are having to change travel plans as their test reports are delayed. On the delay in test results, Bhopal CMHO Dr Prabhakar Tiwari said: “The lab in-charge would be able to answer that.” To add to the chaos, ever since the state government fixed the rate for RT-PCR test by private labs at Rs 700 (and an additional Rs 200 for home collection of sample), many private labs have stopped doing the tests. Earlier, the average rate was Rs 1,100. “It has created a lot of problems for people, particularly the elderly, who can’t go out to get themselves tested,” said Rishi Shrivastava, who was searching for a lab that would collect samples of his mother from home. Asked about private labs stopping RT-PCR tests, CMHO Dr Tiwari said: “We can fix the rate but not force any lab to carry out the test if they refuse to do so. Only some labs must have stopped testing, not all.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/rt-pcr-report-delays-hamper-covid-fight/articleshow/82038565.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

The incident came to light after police received a call that a man had been stabbed near Mandir Bhim Basti in Jonapur. A police team that reached the spot found that the injured had been taken to AIIMS. At the hospital, cops found that the injured, 61-year-old Manohar, a resident of the basti, was stabbed multiple times in his abdomen by a sharp object. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur said that the injured was unfit for statement. “An inquiry revealed that the wife of the injured man had died earlier and he lived with his son Balwan alias Vikky. During an argument on Sunday, Balwan asked his father for some money. But when the father refused to give him money, they had an argument during which the son stabbed the man,” the DCP said, adding the man and his son used to have such arguments often. Thakur said that Balwan was drunk at the time of the murder. “On Monday, we got information that Manohar died during treatment at the hospital. His son has been arrested and booked for the murder,” the DCP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/28-yr-old-stabs-his-father-to-death-for-not-lending-money/articleshow/82038559.cms||---

Most of the severe cases of Covid-19 are treated at GMC which has about 150 beds, including a 20-bedded intensive care unit (ICU). The less complicated cases are treated at South Goa district hospital, which is now a Covid hospital. Rane said the new tests will also be introduced in the Covid hospital, shortly.  Last year, the state government vigorously promoted plasma therapy for Covid patients after the state was hit by the first wave. Plasma donation subsequently slowed down after a drop in cases in the last two months of 2020. A GMC official said, they have been calling potential donors, but the response is yet to pick up. “We are hoping that more people will come forward,” he said. Last year, the government had announced that plasma donors will have access to free medical check-up for a year, as an incentive. The directorate of health services have enhanced Covid tests from less than 2,000 tests a day to 2,000 to 2,500 tests, after the state witnessed an exponential rise in cases over the last many days. The government has announced its plan to set up a genome testing facility to determine the types of strain in circulation in the state. “We are exploring options for procurement of equipment for establishing the sequencing facility. It will also help conduct tests for other diseases,” Rane said. Currently, the state relies on the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for genome sequencing and there are generally delays in receiving the results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-first-state-to-offer-two-special-covid-tests-free-rane/articleshow/82039520.cms||---
---||Delhi||NCB busts drug trafficking network operating via darknet; four arrested||NEW DELHI: Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has arrested four people and busted a drug trafficking network operating via darknet. It has seized drugs, including Amphetamine, worth around Rs 1 crore in a special operation. To evade the drug law enforcement authorities, this syndicate used to conceal psychotropic drugs in herbal supplement packages. According to deputy director (operations) KPS Malhotra, NCB has busted the complete network of this module. “In all, 34 seizures have been made in the last 10 days in various parts of Delhi, UP and Uttarakhand. The drugs were meant to be shipped to the USA, the UK, Europe and other countries,” Malhotra said. The seizures include 30.5 lakh tablets of psychotropic drugs, 70,000 Codeine-based cough syrups and 14.9 kg of Amphetamine. On Monday, NCB’s director general Rakesh Asthana led the Indian delegation in the International Narcotics Control Board’s conference on Drugs and Crime where he spoke on the issue of psychotropic drugs diversion while mentioning this operation. “This module has a modus operandi of getting the orders through darknet market host and the same are delivered through dedicated shippers to create anonymity between the receiver of the order and logistic people,” Malhotra said. During investigation, it was unearthed that the shippers are primarily based in Delhi-NCR and are using fake identities. Based on the backtrack investigation, one of the shippers, Kapil Agarwal, was arrested. He disclosed that he got his drugs supply from Agra and led the cops to his associate Arun Goyal. Goyal then led the sleuths to a Haridwar-based pharmaceutical firm, which was diverting the psychotropic drugs to these traffickers. A raid was conducted and two more people—Somdatt and Manish Gupta—were arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ncb-busts-drug-trafficking-network-operating-via-darknet-four-arrested/articleshow/82038570.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||After chaotic AGM, more trouble in store for HCA||Hyderabad: The Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) is likely to face more hurdles after the chaos that prevailed at the 85th annual general body meeting (AGM) on Sunday. HCA president Mohd Azharuddin had walked out of the meeting after appointing the ombudsman. On Monday, Justice (retd) Deepak Verma, wrote to the HCA members saying he was accepting the position, but wouldn’t be able to travel to Hyderabad in the near future because of his doctor’s advice. “Should there be any urgent issue, which requires to be sorted out immediately, then that can be dealt with in a virtual hearing,” he wrote. “The AGM cannot be abruptly ended when several points are still to be discussed,” former HCA secretary PR Man Singh, who is an authority on the cricket body’s bylaws, told TOI on Monday. “Whatever be the reasons for the president, he shouldn’t have done it. An AGM can be ended only after all points on the agenda are taken up.” Defending his action, Azhar said the members were stuck on the issue of the ombudsman and were creating nuisance. “How can the meeting continue in such an atmosphere? The remaining points of the agenda will be taken up at a later meeting,” he said. The bylaws state that the AGM is the supreme body with regard to various appointments. “The apex council, at best, can only make a recommendation, but the final authority rests with the general body. It is up to the members to decide on the appointments. They can either go with the recommendation or choose any other person,” Man Singh said, adding that things were going from bad to worse in HCA. “Why is Azharuddin so caught up with the appointment of Justice (retd) Deepak Verma? If the members wanted a voting on the issue, he should have allowed it. He should either convince the members or accept the verdict of the general body. Whatever is happening is not good for the association,” a former office-bearer, who didn’t want to be named, said.  Sources say Azhar may face more hurdles at the apex council as well. The appointments made by the rival group too were not without flaws. “How can Shivlal (Yadav) be HCA’s representative to BCCI when he had served for more than nine years in HCA and BCCI? Similarly, Arshad (Ayub) too is disqualified from being on any committee of HCA by virtue of having served in the association for more than nine years,” former EC member RM Bhaskar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-chaotic-agm-more-trouble-in-store-for-hca/articleshow/82038576.cms||Solomon S Kumar

On Sunday, 3,672 people were caught for violating the face mask rule and Rs 7.3 lakh was collected in fines, probably the lowest ever since Mumbai police and the railways joined the civic body in taking action. This is a sharp drop from just a few days ago when the three agencies penalised 17,883 persons and collected around Rs 36 lakh in fines on April 2. “There is a night curfew and strict curbs in the day. Plus, there was a total lockdown on the weekend. Those who step out are wearing masks since most are essential workers,” said a senior civic official. Over 25 lakh people have been fined and more than Rs 51 crore collected in fines since March 2020. But the numbers have fallen of late.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh Board Class 10 & 12 exams postponed||BHOPAL: The MP Board class 10 and 12 exams, scheduled to begin on April 30, were postponed on Monday amid the deepening Covid crisis. School education minister Inder Singh Parmar told TOI that exams will be conducted after May 30. New dates will be announced in a couple of days. School for classes 1 to 8 will remain close till June 15. “Due to the rise in Corona infections in Madhya Pradesh, it has been decided to extend the exam dates. The situation does not allow us to organise the exam on the scheduled dates,” said Parmar, adding that practical exams are being pushed back too. “We have instructed officials to conduct exams by May 15,” said Parmar. The minister pointed out that ‘Corona curfew’ has been imposed in many districts. “In such circumstances, the life of children cannot be endangered by conducting examinations. Therefore, class 10 and 12 examinations are being postponed,” he said, reiterating that there will be no general promotions. A proposal on postponing exams was sent to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who accepted the request. From April 17, the time limit for the proposed practical examinations has been abolished. “Children can give practical exams as per their convenience in two or three days. Time is being given till May 15 for this,” Parmar said. All government hostels will be closed till further orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-board-class-10-12-exams-postponed/articleshow/82038578.cms||---
---||Goa||Attacks on GoaMiles:CM threatens action against errant cabbies||PANAJI: Following attacks on taxis and drivers affiliated to the app-based cab service, GoaMiles, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday warned that action would be taken against those who take law and order into their own hands. He said transport minister Mauvin Godinho was handling the issues of cab operators. “Whatever the decision, it will be taken to resolve the taxi issue,” he said and added that he has also asked ports minister Michael Lobo — who has long been throwing his weight behind local taxi unions — to give his suggestions. Over the past couple of days, taxi operators have gone on strike demanding that GoaMiles be scrapped. Opposition parties have also extended support to the protesters. Godinho on Friday had warned that if taxi operators continued to resort to violence, the government would cancel their permits and not issue fresh ones for the next five years. He has also accused the operators of beginning the agitation to scrap GoaMiles mainly to divert attention, “as they do not want to install digital meters which will monitor them”. “Taxi operators first said they want to install meters, but now, they have no intention of doing that. That they will install taxi meters only after GoaMiles is scrapped is just an excuse. Earlier, it was easier to tamper with digital meters and put them out of order, but now we are insisting on back-end services through NIC, which will have GPS, a panic button and automatic monitoring. Taxi operators don’t want to be monitored,” Godinho had said while adding that the government has decided to install the meters — which cost Rs 34 crore — free of charge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/attacks-on-goamilescm-threatens-actionagainst-errant-cabbies/articleshow/82039528.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Complaints against Jodhpur builders for charging extra GST||JODHPUR: Some builders are not passing the benefit of input tax credit to the flat or house buyers and are unlawfully profiteering by over-charging GST from them. Acting on one such complaint against a leading builder in the city, the Directorate General of Anti-Profiteering, in its investigation, has found the builder guilty. By doing so, the builder amassed Rs 1.76 crore accruing on 356 flats under its scheme ‘Arihant Anchal’ by charging 18% GST in lieu of 12% by taking full credit of tax thereby drawing the benefit of Input Tax Credit under GST and not passing the same to the buyers of these 356 flats. On the basis of this report, the National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA) has initiated a hearing in the matter, which has been completed in March and the order has been kept reserved. The report possessed by TOI states, “Section 171 (1) of CGST Act 2017 states that any reduction in rate of tax on any supply of goods or services or the benefit of input tax credit shall be passed on to the recipient by way of commensurate reduction in prices, has been contravened by the builder amounting to Rs 1,76,59,634.” Repeated e-mails to different addresses of the builder seeking comment on the issue, however, remained unanswered despite reminders. The DGAP had carried out this investigation following a complaint by a buyer Pramod Agarwal against the builder Arihant Superstructures Ltd. “The builder charged 18% GST instead of 12% and took full credit of taxes but did not pass this benefit of the same to the buyers under Pradhanmantri Awas Yojna and Mukhymantri Awas Yojna,” the complainant said. “On this account, the investigation reveals that the builder is required to pass on the additional benefit of input tax credit amounting to Rs 1.76 crore to 356 recipients along with the applicant,” the report stated. It may be noted that NAA has been dealing with many such complaints involving builders and real estate developers on a pan-India basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/complaints-against-jodhpur-builders-for-charging-extra-gst/articleshow/82038579.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan high court goes virtual for a fortnight from April 15, invites ire of lawyers||JAIPUR: Rajasthan high court will function virtually from April 15- 30 in the light of increasing Covid cases. The decision of the registrar general has invited criticism from the Bar association and the Bar council as they said the decision was taken without consulting them. However, hearing in subordinate courts/special courts and tribunals will continue through both physical and video conferences. High court registrar general in a notification said “In view of exponential rise in cases across the state, for prevention of spread of the pandemic and for safety and welfare of all the stakeholders, the functioning of Rajasthan High Court in Jodhpur and Jaipur Bench shall be only through video conferencing from April 15-30.” The notification said though physical filing counters would remain open, it is advised to prefer e-filing for safety of all concerned. Payment of court fees may be made through e-pay facility. Personal presence of accused persons in appeals/revisions shall stand exempted till April 30. Rajasthan High Court Bar Association, Jaipur, in a memorandum to the chief justice said the notification was issued without taking the views of the Bar Association. It pointed out that previously it was unanimously decided at full court that both virtual as well as physical hearing would be held considering the hardships of the lawyers in having net connectivity, but it was reserved without taking the views of the association. “It is a matter of great surprise that such a major step was taken by the court without holding any discussion or deliberation with the Bar Council and the Bar Associations. Such decisions of the court, which majorly affect the rights of the lawyers, should not be taken arbitrarily and solely without their consultation,” Dr Mahesh Sharma, Bar council member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-goes-virtual-for-a-fortnight-from-april-15-invites-ire-of-lawyers/articleshow/82038577.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: How Covid virus is settling deep down in lungs, making diagnosis tough||NEW DELHI: The novel coronavirus variant that is causing the current wave of Covid-19 is not just highly infectious but also stealthy. City hospitals say there are getting cases where a patient has typical symptoms of the disease but tests negative for the viral infection, sometimes twice or thrice even through RT-PCR, considered the gold standard for Covid testing. “We have received many such patients in the past few days. They had fever, cough, shortness of breath and the CT scan of the lungs showed lighter-coloured or gray patches. It is referred to as patchy ground glass opacity in medical terms. The condition is one of the defining characteristics of Covid-19,” Dr Aashish Chaudhry, managing director of Aakash Healthcare, said. He added that some of the patients underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), a diagnostic method in which a flexible scope is passed through the mouth or nose into the lungs with a measured amount of fluid introduced and then collected for examination, which confirmed the diagnosis. “All such persons who tested negative through conventional Covid-19 testing methods but had disease symptoms came positive in the lavage test,” Dr Chaudhry said. Read Also14 private hospitals in Delhi declared Covid care centres: GovtIn view of exponential surge of Covid-19 cases in the capital, the health department of the Delhi government has declared as many as 14 big private hospitals as fully Covid care centres on Monday.What could be causing this? Dr Pratibha Kale, associate professor of clinical microbiology at Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, said, “It is possible that in these patients the virus didn’t colonise the nasal or throat cavity because of which swab samples taken from these areas didn’t yield a positive result.” The virus, she added, attached itself to the ACE receptors — a protein found on the surface of many cell types — in the lungs and “that’s why when the fluid samples from the organ were analysed, it confirmed Covid-19 diagnosis”.Dr Vivek Nangia, the chief of pulmonology division at Max Healthcare, said nearly 15-20% of the Covid-19 patients suffered from this problem. “They are highly symptomatic of the disease, but test negative. This is a serious problem because such patients can continue to spread the infection if they are admitted in non-Covid areas. Also, it can delay the treatment,” he added. Coronavirus in India: Live updatesThe pulmonologist said the symptoms in Covid patients also varied significantly in the current wave compared to previous outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2. “A significant mutation in the virus cannot be ruled out. It is the most plausible explanation for the changes being witnessed,” he said. Dr Arup Basu, senior consultant in the chest medicine department of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said nose running, cold and conjunctivitis like symptoms were also being seen in Covid-19 patients this time, which were not present earlier. “Many patients do not have cough or breathlessness and the result of the CT scan of their lungs is also normal. However, they have persistently high fever for eight to nine days that necessitates hospitalisation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-virus-is-settling-deep-down-in-lungs/articleshow/82038587.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Western suburbs and central Mumbai appeared to be affected the most. There was heavy traffic in Parel and Dadar. “Both bounds of Babasaheb Ambedkar Road witnessed congestion. Several garment stores kept their shutters half open near Plaza Cinema to avoid police action,” said a local resident, Margaret Fernandes. Shoppers also thronged Crawford Market and Abdul Rehman Street throughout Monday. Unusual crowds were seen in local markets in the western suburbs. “People were stocking up essential supplies, causing slow movement of traffic. Snarls were reported at Malad’s Natraj market and markets in Marol, Vile Parle, Jogeshwari and Andheri,” said a police officer. Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road was congested from morning up to 4pm. Mumbai police issued challans to 1,875 motorists and seized 78 vehicles over the weekend for flouting lockdown guidelines. Police also lodged 163 cases against people for violating the government notification, crowding and shops stocking non-essential supplies staying open. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shoppers-hit-mkts-cause-traffic-jams/articleshow/82040333.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Will neither clamp lockdown nor let one die in misery: CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday dismissed speculations on the possibility of lockdown in the state despite the surge in Covid-19 cases. “We will neither impose lockdown nor let people die in misery,” the CM said, directing officials to take over private testing labs, if required, and pay adequate amounts to ensure there is no delay in test results. “The government should also take over private hospitals and medical colleges, if necessary, to overcome any shortcomings,” he added. The directives were issued after the CM office received several complaints about delay in test reports and that some private labs were not carrying out tests at all. The CM said more private labs should be roped in to increase RT-PCR tests to account for at least 70% of the total tests. “Capacity of RT-PCR testing labs should be increased so that the state can carry out at least 1.5 lakh RT-PCR tests per day in the coming days. TrueNat machines should also be used for testing,” the CM said. He also warned private labs and hospitals against overcharging and said strict action would be taken if complaints were received against them. Yogi said the cancer institute should be turned into a dedicated Covid hospital. Earlier, he had directed that Era’s Medical College, TS Mishra Medical College and Integral Medical College should be made dedicated Covid hospitals. “Each bed should have the facility of high flow nasal cannulas and ventilators. Once these three hospitals are fully functional, there will be 2,000 additional Covid beds available in the city,” he said. The CM said Covid beds should also be made available at Hind Medical College and Mayo Medical College. Other private hospitals should make arrangements for Covid beds, he added. Asking officials to be on their toes to control the exponential spread of Covid-19 across the state, he said it would be their responsibility to ensure that there is no shortage of hospital beds. The CM said all arrangements should be made to keep corona warriors safe. “All frontline workers should wear masks and gloves,” he added. Yogi said half of the ambulance service fleet should be reserved for Covid-19 patients and added that the response time for ambulances should be 15 minutes. “Sanitation and fogging should be carried out in all rural and urban areas. UPSRTC buses should also be sanitized. Public awareness campaigns will be carried out regularly to inform people about ways to protect themselves from the virus. For this, the public address system should be used effectively,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/will-neither-clamp-lockdown-nor-let-one-die-in-misery-cm/articleshow/82040328.cms||---

The issue came to light on Sunday night. Kukatpally police said that the victim was G Manjula, a BTech student and resident of Habeeb Nagar in Moosapet. According to the police, Manjula’s cousin, Bhupathi, 25, was allegedly upset with her for befriending a few boys. On Sunday, he called Manjula to his residence in Kukatpally to discuss the matter. During the talks, an annoyed Bhupathi allegedly strangulated Manjula to death. “The parents of the victim and the accused believed that the two were potential spouses and would be a good match. The accused had asked the girl if she was in touch with a boy. However, during the discussion, he became agitated and throttled her to death,” Kukatpally police said. After committing the murder, Bhupathi dumped the girl’s body into the water sump in his house. Police said that Bhupathi, who had discontinued his BTech studies, claimed that he too planned to commit suicide but did not have the courage to take the extreme step.

The government has ordered purchase of 2,000 oxygen concentrators as an 'emergency arrangement', and oxygen status is being reviewed every day. Lockdown is not the solution to the Covid pandemic, Chouhan reiterated. “If people lock themselves in and do not come out unnecessarily, there will be no need for a lockdown,” the CM pointed out, urging people to always wear a mask when they step out of home. To ensure patients don’t run around desperately looking for hospital beds, information on vacant beds (isolation, oxygen-supported, ICU and HDU) in private and government hospitals in each district will be available on the NHM website at www.sarthak.nhmmp.gov.in/covid/facility-bed-occupancy. This information can also be obtained by scanning a QR Code. The state government has also issued instructions to all CMHOs to ensure that private hospitals do not overcharge patients.

Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is in Goa for the last three days, said that AAP will contest all the 40 assembly seats in the state. The party, which had a 15% vote share in the recent zilla panchayat elections, plans to increase its presence in the state and hopes to have a volunteer base of 8,000 over the next six to seven months from the present 4,000. The party has been inducting new members, including politicians, from various parties. It has also made overtures to disgruntled BJP functionaries by promising to fulfill former chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s vision. A day after lauding Parrikar’s ideas, Sisodia went to pay tributes at the memorials of former chief ministers Dayanand Bandodkar and Parrikar at Miramar. “People are talking about a united opposition but the so-called opposition is completely united with BJP,” Sisodia said. “People are upset with Congress and BJP and they want a change. AAP will form the government with a majority, this is my confidence,” he said. The party appears to be working on an anti-corruption plank and is relying on the Delhi governance model to convince locals about AAP’s intentions. Sisodia said that the party would not accept any person with a criminal background. AAP is emerging as a political alternative to BJP in the state due to the opposition’s failure to take on the state government, the delhi deputy CM said. He has been holding meetings across the state as AAP tries to make inroads across all sections of Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-plans-to-contest-all-seats-on-its-own-in-goa/articleshow/82039533.cms||---
---||Delhi||Leave hospital beds for seriously ill, urges CM||NEW DELHI: With Covid cases continuing to spiral in the capital, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday urged people not to rush to hospital unnecessarily and to ensure that they get vaccinated. While reviewing the Covid-19 situation in an emergency meeting with health minister Satyendar Jain and senior officials, Kejriwal expressed concerns over people with very mild or no symptom reaching hospitals and occupying beds, leading to an increase in the number of admitted patients. Beds should be available only to serious patients and all others must be treated under home isolation, he pointed out. The Kejriwal government has asked the Centre to escalate the number of Covid beds in the central government hospitals. In all, 1,090 Covid beds are currently available at these hospitals, while above 4,000 were available in November when Delhi was hit by the third wave of the pandemic, said Jain. Delhi government has requested the Centre to step up the beds in its hospitals to the November level. During the review, the chief minister directed officials to ramp up the number of Covid beds in private and government hospitals. The current situation was compared with the last peak in November 2020 and it was decided that the reservation of Covid beds in the private hospitals should be immediately increased in public interest and should at least reach the numbers available during the last peak. “We must ensure that our bed availability in government and private hospitals is at par with November last year, and we will further request the Centre to increase Covid beds in the central government hospitals as well,” Kejriwal said. “Delhi’s Covid situation is very serious, the fourth peak of the virus more dangerous than ever. There should be no dearth in the number of beds available,” he added. Kejriwal also stated that the objective of his government is to provide the best Covid treatment facilities to the people of Delhi. Along with stressing the need to increase beds and related facilities, including oxygen and ICUs, for Covid-19 patients, the chief minister also instructed the officials concerned to convert private and government hospitals into fully Covid hospitals. After the meeting, Kejriwal took to Twitter requesting the people of Delhi to cooperate with the government in checking the spread of the infection and urging them to follow all Covid protocols. Delhi health minister Jain later said the government had increased nearly 5,000 beds in the last week and 50% of the beds were available, and the number of beds was being further escalated. Around 2% of the beds out of the 5,525 in Delhi government’s Covid Care Centres are occupied, he said, adding that temporary Covid Care Centres would be set up at different places as per requirement. According to a source, the government has decided to convert banquet and community halls into temporary hospitals the way it had done last year during the previous Covid waves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/leave-hospital-beds-for-seriously-ill-urges-cm/articleshow/82038597.cms||AlokKNMishra

We have markets in and around the area where visitors often don’t comply with the Covid norms despite safety messages being shared on WhatsApp,” said Ruby Makhija of Navjiwan Vihar RWA.“In our market, we have pasted a circular regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour outside all the shops. Our guards are conducting thermal screening of visitors,” said Hardeep Singh of Sainik Farms RWA.Taking note of the surge in Covid-19 cases, RWAs are also making arrangements to help residents in case of an emergency like last year. They want to ensure availability of oxygen cylinders, pulse oximeters, thermal scanners and sanitisers in their respective areas.“We have arranged for two oxygen concentrator machines and one portable oxygen cylinder and offered residents to use them in case any patient’s oxygen level falls to an alarming level. The machines are given on a first come, first served basis and only as a stopgap arrangement for 24 hours, when the family makes alternative arrangements. We have also prepared a requisition form, which needs to be filled by residents before availing the facility. They need to confirm that oxygen cylinder or concentrator is being taken after medical advice,” said Sanjay Anand, chairman of Resident Welfare Society, Greater Kailash-I E block.Spike in critical cases has led to an increased demand for plasma too. “We have been getting many requests from residents for plasma donation every day. We are asking people, who have fully recovered and are free of symptoms for at least two weeks, to come forward to donate plasma. We have also arranged for some other facilities to deal with emergency cases,” said Sanjay Rana of GK-II RWA.“Unlike last year, when none of our seven oxygen cylinders and five oxygen concentrators was used, the demand is high this time. We are ready to provide all assistance, including sharing of contact details of hospitals and nursing homes, which patients can visit in case of emergency,” said Pankaj Agarwal of Safdarjung Enclave RWA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rwas-want-police-to-help-make-people-follow-rules/articleshow/82038635.cms||Vibha Sharma

Also some 122 nursing staff positions are yet to be filled against the approval for 742 nursing positions. In times of the pandemic, the new civil hospital happens to be one of the hospitals at the centre of Covid management in Surat city. The RTI also reveals how posts like medical superintendent and even a resident superintendent are left vacant. “How is information related to a health crisis in Gujarat provided to a citizen under RTI Act not for court use? Does the government mean that a citizen be discouraged from approaching courts with this information that explains where the state’s resources should go? Has the government been directed by courts any time that information under RTI Act should not be placed before the courts? If so, then where is the written order?,” asks RTI applicant Alpesh Bhavsar from Relief Road. Bhavsar had filed a series of RTI petitions highlighting the large government vacancies across government hospitals in the state over the past seven months. The RTI reply Bhavsar received also reveals that at the new civil hospital, all of the assistant professors, numbering 23-25 posts are appointed on temporary basis. A senior medical officer in the state health department told TOI that all RTI applications will be stamped, “Not for court use” as per official orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rti-reply-on-staff-shortage-not-for-courts-health-dept/articleshow/82038661.cms||Paul John
---||Agra||Not against BJP, people free to vote their choice in UP rural polls: BKU||Agra: In a statement that surprised many, BKU general secretary Yudhvir Singh on Monday said the farmers' outfit was "not against BJP” and people of Uttar Pradesh were free to choose anyone in the upcoming panchayat polls. Bharatiya Kisan Union has been opposing the ruling party over the contentious agriculture laws and held several mahapanchayats in UP -- and in West Bengal during campaigning for the assembly elections in that state -- asking people to boycott the BJP. Top leaders of the BKU, including Rakesh and Naresh Tikait, were silent when asked about Yudhvir Singh's statement. Rakesh told TOI: “Where does the question of backing or not backing BJP arise? It is an election based on individual personality.” Yudhvir Singh also said, “People inclined to different political ideologies are supporting us. We have not issued any directions for panchayat elections. Farmers are free to take their own decisions. We will not interfere in panchayat elections.” Another senior BKU leader Rajveer Singh Jadon said, “We have no plan to support or oppose any party in the panchayat election. Farmers should vote for candidates they like. We are not a political party.” Jadon, who is the outfit’s UP chief, added, “Our focus is on strengthening the farmers' protest. We will not back off till the central government withdraws the three farm laws and provides the legal guarantee for MSP. We will continue to oppose anti-farmer policies of the BJP government.” The local leadership of the outfit, meanwhile, was perplexed with the stand taken by the outfit as this has come even as cadres and the second rung leadership have continued to hold meetings and are campaigning against the BJP on the ground. “We don’t know why the leadership is suddenly so reluctant in opposing BJP in the panchayat elections. But we are reaching out to farmers and asking them to support non-BJP candidates having winning prospects,” a senior BKU worker told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/not-against-bjp-people-free-to-vote-their-choice-in-up-rural-polls-bku/articleshow/82037552.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Delhi||Street kids recall how they were left to fend for selves||New Delhi: Instead of spending their time studying like other kids their age, these children have been forced to take to begging or odd jobs after their parents lost their employment following the Covid-induced lockdown. On International Day for Street Children, kids between ages 11 and 14 spoke about how they struggled to survive and felt neglected. Anuradha recalled how she had to shift to Bihar with her family when the exodus began and they had to resort to begging. “When lockdown was announced, both my parents, who worked as a house help and rickshawpuller, lost their jobs. Our landlord kicked us out. Somedays we could stay at a shelter home but most days we were on the streets,” she said. Most kids said they had lost all ambition. “Our family’s income plummeted to zero during the lockdown until I managed to get work at a local shop. I wanted to be a doctor, but now that dream seems unlikely,” said Firoz, who delivers groceries at houses of Covid-patients. Sanjay Gupta, director of NGO Chetna, said that this is one issue that needs serious intervention. “The lives of street kids have gotten harder over the last year, but many of them still face life with a smile on their face,” he said. Israel, who aims to become a teacher when he grows up, talked about how tough education has been for him in the last one year. “My father died of tuberculosis four months ago, after which my mother was left alone to care for seven childen. I had no idea how to go about my life, until I was approached by an NGO member,” he said. With help from a team educator from Chetna, Israel says his dreams do not seem so faint now. “With help, I am able to focus on studies so that I can provide for my family in the future,” he said. Meanwhile, on the International Day for Street Children on Monday, Housing and Land Rights Network urged the government to protect the rights of all homeless children and ensure their access to adequate housing (including special homes and shelters), free meals, milk and adequate nutrition, potable water, toilets, among other rights and facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/street-kids-recall-how-they-were-left-to-fend-for-selves/articleshow/82038664.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Hyderabad||Judicial powers to waqf board can stop encroachments: Body||Hyderabad: Telangana Minorities Welfare and Waqf Protection Society (TMWWPS) on Monday announced a state-wide awareness campaign for the protection of waqf properties. Addressing a pressmeet here, the organisation said that the campaign is aimed at protecting waqf properties from being encroached upon by land sharks, politicians and other socially-prominent members of the community. It urged the state government to set up a waqf commissionerate and confer judicial powers to the board. The organisation stressed that such a move will also help in protecting and reclaiming encroached waqf properties worth crores of rupees. It said the state Waqf board has 33,929 institutions located across several districts in the state. “These institutions account for 77,538 acres of land, but of this, 57,423 acres have been encroached upon,” it said. Society president Abdul Haq Qamar claimed the income from proper utilisation of these properties would be sufficient to provide education and improve the socio-economic status of the entire Muslim community in the state. General secretary Mateen Shareef and joint secretary Mohammed Shakeel stressed the matter of digitization of Waqf board records in the state and its synchronization with the endowments department to “solve the mystery surrounding some important properties, particularly after bifurcation of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh with original records of some properties still remaining with AP.”  The organisation said that waqf properties have a financial potential to ameliorate the status of the community, while adding that the society is operating under the guidance of Justice B Chandra Kumar and senior high court advocate Mirza Nisar Ahmed Baig Nizami to bring about an impactful change. Justice Kumar insisted that a new amendment in Waqf Act needs to be carried out by the Centre to give judicial power to the waqf board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/judicial-powers-to-waqf-board-can-stop-encroachments-body/articleshow/82038625.cms||---

The victim, Shiva, 40, and the accused, David, worked as daily wagers with a private contractor entrusted with gardening work at metro stations. On Sunday, Shiva, David and other co-workers went to Komuravelli Mallana temple in Siddipet district and returned to the city at night. After returning to Jubilee Hills, Shiva, David and other workers including Srinivas and Rakesh, consumed liquor on the footpath at Road No. 10 of Jubilee Hills. After midnight, Rakesh and Srinivas left the place while Shiva and David continued to consume liquor. “At around 2.30 am, Srinivas returned to the spot where Shiva and David were consuming liquor. He found Shiva lying dead in a pool of blood with severe head injuries. David was not present at the scene,” Jubilee Hills sub-inspector (SI) G Sekhar said. Alerted by locals, Jubilee Hills police rushed to the spot and shifted the body to a hospital for post-mortem. “Shiva used to harass David, who does not know Telugu. We suspect that when Shiva fell asleep after consuming liquor, David killed him with a boulder,” the SI said. David is on the run and a manhunt has been launched to nab him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-bludgeons-co-worker-to-death/articleshow/82038637.cms||---

On receiving information, Kotwali police reached the spot and sent the body to govt hospital mortuary. They also recovered a suicide note. The family members sat on dharna outside the mortuary demanding to arrest the person abetting suicide. Police persuaded the family members who later met human rights commission chairman G K Vyas and demanded justice. Vyas asked them to cremate the body first and asked to lodge a case if required. According to sources, Ganesh Kumar, a businessman in Barmer city, is the deceased. The suicide note alleged that a person named Madho Singh harassed him over a land dispute case. The brother of the deceased said that a few people were continuously harassing Ganesh over a plot and earlier, too, a few people had attacked his brother and a case was lodged with the Kotwali police. On the other hand, heavy police force was deployed outside the mortuary to maintain law and order situation. Barmer SP Anand Sharma said Kotwali SHO Prem Prakash informed him that the deceased had hanged himself at his house and a suicide note was found from him. Action will be taken as per the report given by the family members, but in regarding the allegation levelled by the deceased, it was found that in 2002 the municipality had freed the government land from the possession of the deceased and later the land was sold in auction by the municipality, which was purchased by Madho Singh in his son Himanshu’s name. The deceased Ganesh had filed a case in the high court against the municipality for wrong allotment, which is still pending. He said the deceased had filed a case against Singh in 2017 under SC/ST Act, which was found fake, and later on February 15, 2020 again a case of assault was lodged against Singh, which was also found fake and police had filed final reports in both cases. The SP assured the family members that if Singh was responsible for abetment to suicide, then action will be taken against him. However, the family members have not budged and are still protesting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/barmer-bizman-commits-suicide/articleshow/82038651.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Making edu more accessible to orphans||Hyderabad: As someone who went to school while living in an orphanage, P Prasanna Vikhil is aware of the hardships that life can throw at people like him. And it is this realisation that drove him to set up an NGO — Friends Being a Helping Hands — along with his two childhood friends in 2015. Over the last five to six years, the organisation has supported over one lakh people — orphans, senior citizens and others — with books, ration and other essentials, apart from organising awareness campaigns to highlight issues plaguing marginalised sections. The final year graduation student runs the NGO along with Ch Anish and Md Nadeem. “When I was in school, I used to wait for donors so I could get books. If school started in June, I could not get books until September or October,” Vikhil told TOI, adding, “This made me think about orphans and I started the NGO right after class 10.” Over the years, his team has established rural libraries to make sure orphans get books by July. A student of Nizam College, Vikhil said that they recently organised a menstrual hygiene campaign too, in Miyapur slum, and provided sanitary napkins to 200 families. Slum children were also given biscuits, juices, among other things, he said, adding that during the pandemic they distributed over 20,000 ration kits to migrants and the poor. Apart from supporting orphanages and old age homes, the NGO has also started distributing buttermilk at different locations in the city including LB Nagar, Nampally railway station, Koti Maternity Hospital, among other areas from March 30. “Friends Being a Helping Hands donated a projector to our orphanage so that our students can continue learning in the virtual mode. They have also been providing us with sanitary napkins, snacks, and ration,” said M Sada Lakshmi, manager-cum-teacher, Amanvedika Rainbow Home, Musheerabad, adding that the orphanage has 75 girl children. N Prabhakar, founder and MD of Karuna Radham Charitable Trust, said that Vikhil’s NGO is sponsoring Ugadi lunch for all the 60 people at the facility on Tuesday. “Instead of regular lunch which consists of rice, curry and dal, our inmates will get special lunch,” said Prabhakar, adding that ration has already been sent by the NGO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/making-edu-more-accessible-to-orphans/articleshow/82038656.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

He is the third deputy lokayukta of the state. As special CBI court judge, Yadav had given the verdict in the Babri mosque demolition case in September last year, acquitting all the 32 accused including BJP veteran leaders LK Advani, MM Joshi, Uma Bharti and Kalyan Singh. The verdict said Babri Mosque demolition was not pre-planned but a spontaneous act. He was administered the oath of office on Monday by UP lokayukta Justice Sanjay Mishra. Given the Covid-19 protocol, the swearing-in was kept a low-key affair. The swearing-in started with the reading of the letter by secretary, Lokayukta, Anil Kumar Singh. Governor had signed Yadav’s appointment letter on April 6. Yadav had retired as district judge, Lucknow, in September 2019 but on the directions of the Supreme Court, he was given extension to deliver judgment in Babri mosque demolition case which he had been hearing since 2015. He had been conducting daily hearings in the case since 2017. A resident of Jaunpur, he started his judicial career as additional munsif, Ayodhya, on June 8, 1990.

---||Kochi||After vibration, Air India pilots skip Kozhikode table-top runway, land in Kochi with 188 on board||NEW DELHI: Presence of mind displayed by the pilots of the Air India Express flight from Riyadh to Kozhikode on Saturday night ensured that all the 188 people on board reached home safe. Just before IX-1322 got airborne, Captain Yazad Bachaa and first officer Nishad Arawandakar experienced a “small jolt, a wobble” that indicated a possible trouble with the landing gear or tyre/s. Since all flight parameters were normal, they decided to continue flying home but made one crucial change — diverting to safer Kochi to avoid landing with landing gear trouble at the tabletop runway of Kozhikode which last August had witnessed the crash-landing of an AI Express flight in which 19 passengers and both the pilots lost their lives. IX-1322 landed safely in Kochi early Sunday morning. The Boeing 737-800 (VT-AXI) took off late on Saturday night from Riyadh. Just before getting airborne, sources say, it experienced a “vibration that showed something out of the ordinary.” The pilots repeatedly checked all flight parameters that were absolutely normal. After reaching cruising altitude of 35,000 feet, they contacted the Riyadh air traffic control (ATC) and asked them to check if tyre pieces were found on the runway after this flight took off. Riyadh ATC shortly afterwards confirmed that there were tyre pieces on the runway but they could not confirm if they were from the AI Express. Making best use of “crew resource management”, the pilot-in-command (PIC) called the co-pilot and captain who had operated this aircraft from India to Saudi Arabia and were returning home as passengers, to the cockpit. The four pilots brainstormed and worked out likely scenarios with the tyre trouble. Then the highly experienced Captain Bachaa decided to divert to Kochi because of its longer runway and clear weather, choosing it over the airline’s maintenance base Trivandrum. Kochi airport made all arrangements for handling an emergency situation. The aircraft had an uneventful landing early on Sunday morning and exited the runway to come to a halt on a taxiway. AI Express engineering and fire tenders checked the landing gear. Once it was confirmed there is no fire, all the 180 passengers, six cabin crew and the two pilots deplaned using stepladder. The runway had tyre pieces strewn along it and the right side tyre (rubber part) of the main landing gear had completely disintegrated. AI Express arranged another aircraft some hours later to fly the passengers to Kozhikode. AI Express Dubai-Kozhikode flight on August 7, 2020, had crash-landed and skidded off the tabletop runway, killing 19 passengers and both the passengers. An AI Express Dubai-Mangalore flight crash in May 2010 had claimed 158 lives. Mangalore is also a tabletop runway. While the Kozhikode crash report is awaited, experienced pilots and investigators say there are lots of similarities between it and the Mangalore crash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pilots-timely-action-ensured-safe-landing/articleshow/82038672.cms||Saurabh Sinha

But on Monday, the pandemic spread made the ashram shut its gates again. The Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust, which manages the ashram, said in a press release on Monday that the premises “will remain closed for visitors due to the Covid pandemic till further notice.” The ashram served as Mahatma Gandhi’s base, from where he launched the freedom struggle for India. It was closed for visitors on March 19 last year for 10 days after the initial cases of Covid in Gujarat were detected. Then a few days later, the ashram decided to close the premises till the cases subsided. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had visited the Sabarmati Ashram last in March to flag off a symbolic Dandi March as part of the ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ initiative. Several prominent shrines in Gujarat including Somnath Temple, Bahucharaji Temple, and Shamlaji Temple have been shut for visitors because of the rising Covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gandhi-ashram-closed-again/articleshow/82038681.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Mosquito menace rampant; cleaning of water bodies slack: Hyderabad residents||HYDERABAD: Already reeling under the pandemic, residents of Hyderabad are now battling another problem — mosquito menace. Residents say the problem has turned acute after the frequency of fogging activity in several areas has been reduced by civic authorities in the past two months. “It has become impossible to keep windows or doors open for even a minute. We are forced to use mosquito coils which are causing respiratory problems in children and elderly people. Had the authorities continued regular fogging and cleaned the water bodies which are reduced to cesspools, we wouldn’t be facing this problem,” said Harini Rajashekar, a resident of Anjaneya Nagar Colony in Moosapet. Residents urged GHMC authorities to clean IDL lake in Kukatpally, which is a breeding ground for mosquitoes. In a novel protest, several residents had barged into the south zone GHMC office last week and waved mosquito-swatting bats. Residents from Petlaburj, Phool Bagh, Charminar, Ghansi Bazar, Dilli Darwaza, Nayapul, Char Mahal, Moosa Bowli, Begum Bazaar and other areas surrounding Musi river said the menace has reached alarming proportions in past few weeks. “The entire Musi stretch has turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes because of hyacinth and garbage being dumped in the river. We lead a miserable life and stay indoors all the time... It’s high time the government took measures to find a permanent solution to this problem,” tweeted Sai Srinath Dasthar, a resident of Begum Bazar. Entomologists said the problem of mosquitoes is due to the rampant growth of hyacinth. “The hyacinth is the reason for the breeding of mosquitoes. We are working to remove the hyacinth from water bodies since it keeps growing back due to discharge of sewage. To control the mosquito menace, a three-unit team is looking after fogging operations,” said Rambabu, chief entomologist, GHMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mosquito-menace-rampant-cleaning-of-water-bodies-slack-residents/articleshow/82038671.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Hyderabad||Culex mosquitoes makes max buzz in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: As the city reels under the fear of vector-borne diseases due to the rising mosquito menace, a GHMC project has found that there is a rampant increase in the presence of Culex mosquitoes in the city. As part of the project, Moskeet Traps, which capture, identify the species, and provide real-time data — were set up in all six zones of the Greater Hyderabad region in Nacharam, Malakpet, Langar Houz, Yousufguda, Moosapet and Begumpet. These traps were installed particularly near water bodies and parks where the density of mosquitoes is higher compared to other areas. Experts TOI spoke to said that while Culex mosquitoes do not transmit dengue or chikungunya, they are one of the most bothersome summertime pests that transmit malaria in some cases. “In Hyderabad, Anopheles and Culex are the two mosquito species that are mostly responsible for malaria,” said Dr Chelmala Srinivasulu, senior assistant professor of zoology in Osmania University and member, Telangana State Biodiversity Board. “What GHMC studies are showing is a seasonal pattern. Culex mosquitoes breed in stagnant and dirty waters and they are known as problematic species similar to Aedes and Anopheles,” he added. The Moskeet Traps attract and catch mosquitoes from 100 m radius . “We assess the data collected from Moskeet Traps weekly once but when the problem is rampant, we collect the data daily. The data from all six zones in the last few weeks revealed an increase in presence of Culex mosquitoes. These mosquitoes do not transmit dengue or chikungunya but are one of the most bothersome as they swarm in large numbers and cause itchy, red spots on your body from their bite,” said Dr Rambabu, chief entomologist, GHMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/culex-makes-max-buzz-in-city/articleshow/82038668.cms||Moulika.KV

Police said the 16-year-old boy was hooked onto drugs and was in need of money to fund his habit. The collective cost of the bicycles is nearly Rs 4 lakh. On March 16, a businesswoman living in a highrise on Kandivli Link Road noticed that her bicycle had been stolen from the society’s parking lot between 4.30-6.20pm. She lodged a complaint with Kandivli police station. After checking CCTV footage of the society, police started a probe. They tracked down the youngster, who is a class IX school student, on April 12. He admitted to the theft and 25 other stolen bicycles, besides the one belonging to the businesswoman, were found. “The youngster would sell the stolen bicycles at throwaway prices,” said senior inspector Babasaheb Salunke, Kandivli police. He would target expensive bicycles parked in societies or parking lots in Kandivli-Malad-Bangur Nagar belt. The owners of all the bicycles have been tracked down and the stolen bicycles have been returned to them, police said. Investigators are now probing if the youngster had accomplices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-student-detained-for-stealing-26-bicycles/articleshow/82040389.cms||---

Going by the vaccination programme in the state, the stocks would last for next three to four days. A health department’s bulletin on Monday said over 97,000 vaccines were given, including 95,000 first doses and another 2,200 second doses. “The Centre is arranging about 2 lakh doses of Covaxin locally and another 1.62 lakh doses Covishield from Pune, which arrived late on Monday night,” chief secretary Somesh Kumar told TOI. Admitting that the stock of three lakh doses is much less when compared to what the state needs, the chief secretary said the Centre would be sending more doses on a regular basis. In his letter to the Centre on April 10, the Somesh Kumar had said the state was left with only 5.66 lakh doses of vaccine which would last three days only. Official sources said the demand for vaccine shots has increased after the government asked all heads of departments of panchayat raj, municipal administration, police, revenue and health to vaccinate all the staff in their respective areas. This demand is in addition to the regular vaccine drive. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has asked collectors and HoDs to personally monitor the drive and complete the exercise by April 15. Following the directions of the CM, GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar said they would not allow the staff inside the offices if they did not get vaccine shot before April 15. Meanwhile, the health department has directed private hospitals to provide additional beds for Covid-19 treatment. Hospitals and nursing homes with more than 20 beds are advised to upscale their bed availability. A total of 50,000 beds will be allocated for treatment over the next two weeks, said health authorities on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-sends-sos-for-30l-vaccine-doses-centre-releases-3-6l/articleshow/82040387.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Nagpur||Let’s fast to control our ego, self righteousness and our obsession to be praised||Once again the month of Ramazan has come, the month in which the revelation of the Holy Quran began and was gradually completed in 23 years of the life of Prophet Muhammad. This holy book is read and recited throughout the globe in this month. But ironically, a miniscule minority understands its message. This is with almost all the heavenly revelations. Let’s ponder over the purpose of life, the reason of our birth and the objective of our existence on this planet. The Holy Quran says “O you who have attained to faith! Fasting is ordained for you as it was ordained for those before you, so that you might remain conscious of God.” The above verse emphasizes that consciousness of god is the primary purpose in ordaining fasting. Reducing fasting to a ritualistic practice leads one to merely feasting at dusk. While realizing God consciousness will lead one to the conclusion that there is a role for him to make this world a better place for all fellow beings. He must rise beyond his self centricity towards G0d-centricity and contribute for the betterment of others around him and justly spare his abilities, skills, expertise, education and God-gifted things for the less fortunate ones of the society. Fasting should start a process of introspection within us. Our lives should have a missionary zeal in the pursuit of our unselfish goals. The concept of the Quran and all the heavenly scriptures is that all human beings are equal and no one is superior to someone else in his capacity as a human being. Since everything existing in the universe is subjugated to man, there is nothing superior to him except God almighty, the lone creator of the universe. The teachings of Gita also enjoin us to be humble and to consider all actions of ours as will of God almighty. How come we assume ourselves superior when we do something good for public welfare? In every era, humans face misery, strife, disintegration and violence. All the heavenly scriptures give an idea that humanity should not be contaminated by religious superiorism. History suggests that whenever humanity is contaminated by religious superiority or racism of religions, the environment of composite living together or plurality is badly damaged. The divine system enjoined in the heavenly scriptures is the only system which can bring happiness in society. The ego of doing good is more dangerous than the ego that comes from becoming powerful, wealthy or materialistically successful. We must be aware of this danger and insulate ourselves with the cloak of humility to selflessly pursue the path of common good. A number of people choose a non-traditional path, sometimes at great loss to their own self, but of great satisfaction in their lives. One needs to prepare himself to rejuvenate the human community in all the spheres of his existence sans the desire to win adulation from the general masses. This greed of reverence and applause propels self gratification in human beings. The essence of the holy Quran 2/264 categorically says, “O people who claim to be religious! Do not deprive your benevolent deeds of all worth by stressing your own benevolence and hurting the feelings of the needy, as does he who spends his wealth only to be seen and praised by men, and trusts not in God and the Last Day: For his parable is that of a smooth rock with a little mud upon it - and then a rainstorm smites it and leaves it hard and bare. Such as these shall have no gain whatsoever from all their good works: for God does not guide people who refuse to acknowledge the truth. Let’s fast to control our ego, self righteousness and our obsession to be praised, instead, actually be admired by God almighty on the Day of Judgment. Happy Ramazan 2021. (The author is regional secretary of Society for Communal Harmony. New Delhi)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lets-fast-to-control-our-ego-self-righteousness-and-our-obsession-to-be-praised/articleshow/82038702.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Low production in January, February led to shortage of Remdesivir||HYDERABAD: It’s not just the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases that has resulted in an acute shortage of anti-viral drug Remdesivir. One of the key reasons behind the current shortfall in supply is the scaling down or stoppage of production of the drug in January and February due to the low Covid-19 caseload since December 2020 and the resultant low demand, pharma industry sources said. With the second wave of cases hitting Telangana now, the state government is looking to stock up on 2 lakh doses of the drug. But manufacturers have said they are unlikely to get the numbers immediately. “Manufacturers can’t take the risk of being saddled with huge inventories as Remdesivir has a short shelf-life of six to eight months,” said a pharma industry source, confirming that there was low production. The other reason for the crunch is the rapid surge in cases which seems to be more widespread. “In the first wave, the impact of Covid and demand for Remdesivir was restricted to only the metros and Tier-1 cities. But in this second wave, there is a surge in cases even in Tier-2, 3 and 4 cities and towns due to which the distribution network is struggling to keep pace with the demand and stocks of Remdesivir have been spread thin,” said a top official at one of the manufacturers. “It is not a question of just shortage. The surge in the second wave has been so rapid that it has resulted in a mismatch in the production curve and the demand curve,” added an official with another pharma company. However, pharma industry officials insisted that this is just a temporary situation and in the next week to 10 days about a couple of million doses of Remdesivir should hit the market. “This (shortage) is a temporary phenomenon. In the next few days ample stocks of Remdesivir will be available. The industry and the government are working together to ensure maximum doses of Remdesivir are available,” said Mahesh Doshi, president, Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association. “Everyone has ramped up production since mid-March. In the next 7-10 days the impact of this ramp up should be visible and 1-2 million doses should be available in the market,” added the official of a Remdesivir manufacturer. Doshi added that the recent government move to ban exports of Remdesivir and its active pharmaceutical ingredients too will help ease the situation. Remdesivir’s innovator, US-based Gilead Lifesciences, had inked non-exclusive licencing agreements with six Indian drug manufacturers – Zydus Cadila, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Hetero Drugs, Jubliant Life Sciences, Cipla Ltd and Biocon Group’s Syngene. The Indian facilities of US-based Mylan too manufacture the drug. According to estimates, all these manufacturers put together have a capacity to make close to 4 million units of Remdesivir per month for domestic as well as exports to over 120 countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/low-production-in-jan-feb-led-to-shortage-of-remdesivir/articleshow/82040392.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Believed to be planted by the Britishers, jacaranda and spathodea are now part of the Munnar plantations. A distant view of jacaranda gives the visitors a complete blue hue of a huge tree without its green leaves. Locally called Neela Vaga, it is a major attraction for the visitors now. The jacaranda trees are in full bloom on the Munnar-Marayoor stretch of the Munnar-Udumalpet interstate route in Idukki. Trees enveloped in blue dot both sides of the road. According to the natives, the jacaranda flowers are also known as exam trees. In some countries the jacaranda trees are colloquially called “exam tree” or “purple panic”. At the University of Queensland, students even maintain a joke superstition that if a jacaranda bloom falls on their head during exam time, they will fail the exam. The bad luck can be broken by catching another bloom before it hits the ground. The jacaranda trees shed its leaves during December and starts flowering in the beginning of March. According to local residents, the jacaranda trees were planted by the Britishers as an ornamental tree. Jacaranda Mimosifolia is one of the 49 species of flowering plants in the family of Bignoniaceae, native to Central and South America, Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. Aju Abraham Mathew, general manager of Tall Trees Resort in Munnar, said that after the helicam visuals of the jacaranda flowers went viral on social media, many tourists reached Munnar to enjoy the beauty of the flowers. Jithesh Cheruvallil, a tourism stakeholder in Marayoor, said that hundreds of tourists arrived at the Munnar-Marayoor route to enjoy the beauty of the flowers. “The view of Jacaranda flowers provides an extra push to the tourism sector in the Covid-hit period,” said Jithesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/jacaranda-a-visual-feast-gives-boost-to-munnar-tourism/articleshow/82038689.cms||Sandeep Thomas

We, as housing societies, can work with the local authorities and coordinate with the control room for any kind of support. This will, in turn, help citizens better,” said . Pune Co-operative Federation member Suhas Patwardhan. The housing societies have already opposed the state government’s decision to declare an entire society a micro-containment zone even if one of its wings has five or more Covid-19 patients and slap a penalty of Rs10,000 in case of the protocol violation. Patwardhan told TOI that before levying such rules, the authorities should discuss with the federations for some feasible solutions. Many housing societies are pitching in with blood donation drives and arranging grocery items for their members in the time of Covid-19. A member of a society with more than 25 Covid-19 cases said the members were following the protocols, but were afraid of the entire premises would be sealed. “Those tested positive are in home isolation and the society is helping them. We are a big society. Sealing the society would be a major problem, as most of the units are row houses,” the member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/housing-societies-seek-more-involvement-in-covid-management/articleshow/82038698.cms||Nisha Nambiar

With a sharp surge in Covid-19 cases, the supply of favipiravir tablets used to treat Covid-19 patients is not meeting the rising demand. Upon independently checking with six medical stores in Ahmedabad in Vejalpur, Prahladnagar, Jodhpur, Sardar Patel Stadium, Navrangpura and Ambawadi areas of the city, only two had the required stock. “We only have one strip of 400mg of favipiravir in stock with us. The demand is unprecedented and adequate stock is not being supplied from stockists. Whatever we get is rapidly flying off shelves,” said Arvind Tiwari, who manages a medical store in Prahladnagar. Stockists claim they’ve been getting adequate stock. Jashvant Patel, chairman, Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Drugists’ Association, said, “We have been procuring fresh stocks every day and have been disseminating to chemists who place orders with us. There is no hiccup in procuring the stock from depots.” The situation however, is different at retail counters who are unable to meet the rising demand and are compelled to either turn down customers or ask them to inquire later. “It’s noon time and we have exactly 10 strips of favipiravir left with us and customers have booked them over the phone. The stock won’t last soon and fresh supply will only be available tomorrow. We’re trying not to turn down customers by procuring the medicine from multiple stockists, as the stock is barely hand-to-mouth,” said Dashrath Patel, a chemist at Sardar Patel Stadium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/favipiravir-supply-still-slow/articleshow/82038707.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Husband of cop who died after biker rammed into her gets Rs 80L||Mumbai: The husband of a 26-year-old sub-inspector who died after a 19-year-old biker who was allegedly stopped for riding without a helmet rammed into her while trying to escape, was awarded a compensation of Rs 80 lakh. The victim was at a nakabandi on Western Express Highway (WEH) at Borivli (East) in 2012. The biker, Sajan Varma, who was booked for murder, is out on bail. His trial is underway at the Dindoshi sessions court. Nandinee Patil’s husband Dattatray had moved the Motor Accident Claims’ Tribunal against bike owner Nitin Varma and Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Limited in October 2012. On January 4, 2012, at 4.45pm, the biker was allegedly riding rashly, in a negligent manner, and was speeding. Patil alleged that instead of stopping when ordered, the biker accelerated and severely injured Nandinee. She was rushed to hospital but succumbed to injuries that day. Patil claimed a compensation of Rs 60 lakh. The bike owner did not appear before the tribunal, so the case against him proceeded ex parte. The insurance company denied the victim died on account of serious injuries sustained in the accident. It alleged that the victim was solely negligent in causing the accident. Denying liability, the insurer sought dismissal of the petition with costs. While Patil deposed during the hearing, in his cross-examination by the lawyer for the insurance company he admitted he did not witness the accident. Another witness, a biker, who was near the scene, deposed. Patil’s lawyer submitted that even if police had not invoked charges relating to death by negligence or rash and negligent driving, there was enough evidence to show the biker was rash and negligent. It was submitted that as the victim happened to be a police officer, the serious offence of murder was invoked against the biker. Opposing this, the advocate for the insurance firm submitted that it was evident from police papers that it was not an accidental act but intentional on the part of the biker and it was a murder case. The lawyer said such acts were not covered under Motor Vehicles Act. The tribunal, however, ruled in favour of the victim’s husband and said, “There is ample evidence on record to hold that the deceased died in a motor vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving by the rider of the offending motorcycle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-husband-of-cop-who-died-after-biker-rammed-into-her-gets-rs-80l/articleshow/82040396.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Chandigarh||With claims on Covid mgmt, Harsimrat demotivating health workers for publicity: Sidhu||Chandigarh: Terming the allegations of former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal as baseless and political motivated, Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said that SAD had lost credibility and support of the people of Punjab. Sidhu accused her of trying to malign the image and confidence of medical fraternity for publicity. The minister said the state government was working on advisories issued by central government and corrective steps, as required, were being taken. He said the feedback had been found to be useful and will help the state manage the Covid surge in the state. Countering Harsimrat's allegation, Sidhu said contact tracing in Mohali was highest in state and 105% target of Covid testing achieved in Patiala as she alleged it was much lowest than set target. He said contact tracing in Ludhiana is 13 per case, Patiala 14, and 23 in Mohali, which is highest in state. Contact tracing is being further enhanced by involving personnel from other departments, he said. Responding to the status of labs in state, he said RTPCR labs are not required in every district. Districts have been attached to seven RTPCR testing labs with no district more than one to one-and-half-hour drive from the lab. He said testing had ranged from 35,000 to 40,000 tests per day, which will be increased to 50,000 this week. He said in addition to this, all district hopitals had been provided with TrueNat RTPCR machines for quick testing and results weree available in one to two hours. Pointing out Level III care facilities made by the state government, he said not all districts required dedicated Covid hospitals. Districts have been attached to nearest Level 3 facility and for transfer of patients on time adequate ALS and BLS ambulances are available in all districts as acknowledged by central teams, he added. Sidhu said the state had added more than 6,000 health care workers — including medical officers (specialists), medical officers, paramedical staff etc — in the last one year to augment healthcare workforce. Specialist medical doctors are recruited through walk-in-interviews regularly and 50 specialists of various disciplines have been issued appointment letters last week only, he added. He added the state had more than 400 Level I beds available in the government sector and 8,000 beds in private sector. Bed occupancy at Level IV is only 25%, he said. There is sufficient capacity available at Level II and III beds are also available for Covid patients in government and private hospitals have also been advised to make more beds available in case the number of Covid patients increases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/with-claims-on-covid-mgmt-harsimrat-demotivating-health-workers-for-publicity-sidhu/articleshow/82039683.cms||---

Amit Kumar, the chief executive officer of the PCB, said, “This facility would enable us to provide adequate oxygen at least for 24 hours, which would be a big relief in the crunch medical emergency.” Dr V D Gaikwad, the resident medical officer of the PCB, said, “The facility will store 1.3 lakh litres of oxygen, adequate for 350 oxygen beds. Since we have oxygen central line at the hospital, we shall be able to maintain the supply smoothly.” He said, “Currently, we get 125 oxygen cylinders from private agencies. But it is a time-consuming and tedious process. We buy oxygen cylinders worth Rs30,000 per day now. With the induction of the new facility, it will reduce to Rs20,000 per day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1-3-lakh-litre-oxygen-tank-in-pcb-hospital-soon/articleshow/82038744.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Mumbai||Vax picks up as Mumbai gets 3.5 lakh doses; ‘not enough’ for 1lakh/day target, say officials||MUMBAI: Vaccination picked up in the city on Monday after a two-day lull as fresh doses of the Covid vaccine arrived. Civic officials, though, said the staggered supply was hindering plans to hit one-lakh vaccinations in a day. On Monday, 39,300 people got vaccinated in the city, taking the total doses administered to 17,07,928 in the city. Footfall saw a nearly 20% increase compared with the weekend when vaccination mostly happened at public centres. Of the 39,300, 25,617 vaccinations were among people aged above 45 years, 10,541 senior citizens, 2,356 frontline workers and 786 healthcare workers. Before the shortage, Mumbai had managed to hit an average of 55,000 vaccinations daily. In fact, on two occasions the city had vaccinated more than 60,000 daily. The city received 2.3 lakh doses over the weekend. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the city has received another 1.2 lakh doses on Monday. “Collectively, we have doses for around four days since we are vaccinating over 50,000, but that is not adequate to run a seamless drive. We want to scale up to one lakh vaccinations in a day and for that to happen, we need more supplies,” said Kakani. Another civic official said some doses must always be in the pipeline or in reserve. “But we are perennially in a hand-to-mouth situation and that must change since we are reporting nearly 10,000 cases daily,” the official said. Vaccinations at the state-level were also hit due to the vaccine crunch. On Sunday, the state could vaccinate only 2,23,753 people, down from an average of 4.5 lakh it had managed to reach in the beginning of April. State officials had said they were expecting to receive around 19 lakh doses on Monday. State officials said they have distributed around 12 lakh doses of the vaccine on Sunday of which 1.3 lakh doses were allotted to Mumbai, 2 lakh to Pune, 1.3 lakh to Kolhapur, 2.2 lakh to Nagpur, 99,000 to Akola and 1.9 lakh to Nashik. The Centre has said Maharashtra should prioritise the six-seven districts currently witnessing a surge. On Sunday, the state could vaccinate merely 22,3753 people due to strained supply. The state too had hit a daily high of 4.5 lakh vaccinations in a day. Dr Kushrav Bhajan, a member of the state task force, said Maharashtra should have received higher doses from the Centre due to the population and the sheer case burden. “For a population of 12 crore, we got a little over one crore doses. Whereas Gujarat with half of Maharashtra’s population has received almost equal number of doses,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-picks-up-as-city-gets-3-5l-doses-not-enough-for-1l/day-target-say-officials/articleshow/82037612.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Nagpur||It’s labour pain again, amid the pandemic||Nagpur: Sajid Shaikh in his early thirties is back to square one. Last year in March, Sajid, a waiter at a restaurant in Pune, was among those rushing home after the first lockdown was imposed throughout the country. After working in his home state West Bengal, he had gone back to his old employer at Pune a couple of months ago. On Monday, he was among over a dozen of waiters of the same restaurant who alighted from Kolhapur-Gondia Express and were heading for their home at Krishnanagar town in West Bengal again, by another train. The travel was arranged by their employer both the times, but the expenses were adjusted from the wages, said Sajid and others. “Except a few delivery orders, there was hardly any business at the restaurant these days. The owner has sent us home. The fare has been adjusted against the wages,” said Moidul Shaikh, also one of the returnees. After getting down at Nagpur at 3.30pm, they were to catch post midnight train to West Bengal. Though not seen on the highways this time, the fear of a longer lockdown in the state has certainly triggered another labour migration during the second wave of Covid. In small groups, the workers can be seen scrambling to reach their homes in Bihar, Bengal, Uttar Pradesh or Jharkhand in trains and buses. “You can find many when the trains towards Bengal or Bihar arrive at the station,” said a ticket collector. Outside, another group of workers from a factory in Katol was waiting to buy tickets. “We will not be able to go back if the lockdown lasts longer. There are elections also in West Bengal. So, we may go and vote as well,” said Nazrul Islam, one of them. He was among the 10 to 15 others from the same unit. Some of them said they were going as there were elections, others soon accepted that it was due to lockdown as well. Nazrul was in Manipur during the national lockdown last year and had set out of Bengal only a month ago. “We have no choice but to move out of the state for work. We don’t have any farm holding to till,” he said. A little ahead, another group of workers waited to get tickets for Jharkhand. “We are moving due to the lockdown,” said one of them. Since a week, workers can be seen taking trains to the eastern states in small groups, said railway officials. On Kamptee Road, migrants stood crammed in a queue to board a bus to Jabalpur. There were groups from Mumbai, Solapur, Latur and other parts — all heading towards Jabalpur or Allahabad or Varanasi and further ahead. A quick inquiry showed that most of them were leaving due to the lockdown. Amid those rushing home, there was another group of over 15 youth setting out for work. From Gondia, they were going to Hyderabad. “We go there every year during Ramzan to work in the eateries there. It’s time to earn for us,” said one of them. Some more workers from Butibori were heading to Surat, where they had found a higher paying job at a textile unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/its-labour-pain-again-amid-the-pandemic/articleshow/82038789.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Delhi||EDMC employing security firm blacklisted in 2010, says Bharadwaj||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Monday claimed that East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has signed a contract amounting to crores of rupees with a company that was blacklisted by the unified MCD in 2010. Bharadwaj alleged that the company was penalised by the High Court and did not get any relief from the Supreme Court, but is now getting contracts from the BJP-led municipal corporation. Ahead of the 2022 municipal elections, AAP and BJP are engaged in political war of words over issues related to the corporations. Recently, Bharadwaj levelled corruption charges against a BJP councillor and sought action against him. The councillor, however, rejected the charges. “In 2010, a company of private security guards was investigated for its dealings with the MCD. The company was penalized by courts and removed from tender procedure.The news was extensively reported in the press,” said Bharadwaj, displaying newspaper clippings. The same company has signed a contract with EDMC. Under the contract, 240 security guards will be empanelled via the company. Bharadwaj asked Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta how the company secured a contract. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the same company has security contracts of dozens of Delhi government departments and hospitals. “Bharadwaj said company was blacklisted by unified MCD on 9 July, 2010, but in a related matter MCD itself informed the high court on 22 September, 2010 that it had not blacklisted the said company,” said Kapoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-employing-security-firm-blacklisted-in-2010-says-bharadwaj/articleshow/82038803.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||With Kerala HC stepping in, EC sets Rajya Sabha poll on April 30||T’PURAM/KOCHI: With the high court on Monday ordering the Election Commission (EC) to conduct polls to three Rajya Sabha seats from the state during the term of the current Legislative Assembly, the EC later in the day announced that the election would be held on April 30. A notification in this regard under Section 12 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, was issued by the Election Commission. As per the notification, nominations will be accepted from Tuesday and the last day for submission would be April 20. On April 21, the nominations will be scrutinized, and April 23 will be the last day for withdrawal of nominations. The polling will be held from 9am to 4pm on April 30. The Commission also appointed Kerala Legislative Assembly secretary S V Unnikrishnan Nair as the returning officer for the poll and KLA special secretary R Kishor Kumar as the assistant returning officer. Out of the nine Rajya Sabha seats in the state, terms of Vayalar Ravi (Congress), KK Ragesh (CPM), and P V Abdul Wahab (IUML) are due to expire on April 21. Monday’s order by the HC bench of Justice PV Asha had come while considering two petitions filed by the secretary of Kerala Legislative Assembly and S Sharma, MLA. After announcing that the polls would be completed by April 16, the EC had postponed them citing a reference from the central government. In court, the EC had contended that it is the next Assembly that has to elect the Rajya Sabha members. The court said the power to amend or extend the election schedule should not be invoked normally by the EC and is warranted only when there is a law and order situation or any practical impossibility. The postponement is not envisaged either in the Constitution or in the rules in the absence of good and sufficient reasons, the court added. Stating that EC is not expected to be influenced on the basis of a reference, the court said the Commission had notified the Assembly election and was aware of it when it announced the election to the Rajya Sabha seats. Once the results to Legislative Assembly election are announced, there would be another electorate for the Rajya Sabha polls. It could have been avoided if the Rajya Sabha polls were held as scheduled. The fact that it is up to the Commission to fix the schedule would not mean that it can fix any date, the court said. Therefore, the Commission should expedite the proceedings so that the representation in the upper house from the state is always in full swing and a situation where the nominations are made by one Legislative Assembly and voting by another is avoided, the judgment said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/with-hc-stepping-in-ec-sets-rajya-sabha-poll-on-april-30/articleshow/82038822.cms||---

---||Lucknow||UP: Gyanvapi management seeks stay on ASI survey||AYODHYA: Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee, the management committee of Gyanvapi Masjid in Varanasi, filed an urgent application before the Allahabad High Court on Monday seeking a stay on the April 8 judgment of a local court in Varanasi allowing an archeological survey of the entire complex by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), contending the order was passed illegally and without jurisdiction. Meanwhile, the Sunni Waqf Board will also file an appeal against the Varanasi court order on Tuesday. The Anjuman Intezamia application filed by senior advocates Farman Ahmad Naqvi and Syed Ahmad Faizan states that the lower court ignored the entire written submissions and applicability of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 and Order 7 Rule 11D of the Civil Procedure Code. Talking to TOI, Anjuman Intezamia counsel Farman Ahmad Naqvi said, “We have filed the petition and requested the court to hear us on an urgent basis as our petition is serious in nature.” The petition says the Allahabad high court had already reserved its judgment in this matter, but the Varanasi court has been hearing the contentions of the opposite party. “It appears that the learned civil judge concerned is more interested to bypass all judicial disciplines and ethics as well as procedures of law and to establish himself as above the judicial hierarchy as defined under the Civil Procedure Code and had assumed himself as the only authority to decide the entire issue without looking into the legal impediment and bar,” it says. Meanwhile, talking to TOI, Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board chairman Zufar Farooqui said, “We support Anjuman Intezamia. The Sunni Board will also move the Allahabad high court against the Varanasi civil court order on Tuesday.” Athar Hussain, secretary of Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), the Ayodhya Mosque Trust, said, “The move of Anjuman Intezamia challenging the civil judge’s order in Allahabad high court is welcome. It will help uphold the Places of Worship Act 1991, the relevance of which for preserving the secular character of our Constitution was clearly highlighted in the Ayodhya title suit verdict.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gyanvapi-mgmt-seeks-stay-on-asi-survey/articleshow/82040397.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Nagpur||Experts: Due to unbearable heat in May, all exams should have been held in June||Nagpur: Almost 30 lakh school students in Maharashtra can heave a sigh of relief as the state government has decided to postpone HSC and SSC board exams to May and June respectively due to rising Covid cases. The exams were scheduled to begin from April 23. TOI was the first to report on April 5 itself, about the board’s plan to postpone all papers of SSC and HSC, something which is probably happening for the first time. Earlier, only odd papers have got postponed or cancelled, the entire schedule has never been pushed ahead. On Monday too, TOI reported that the final decision on postponement is very likely to be taken on April 12. Around 3pm, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad made the decision public through her social media page after having a meeting with CM Udhav Thackeray. “For HSC, the exams will start in May whereas SSC will start in June,” Gaikwad said. A revised timetable will be released before the month’s end. State board has been planning this massive exercise with precision and its biggest decision about logistics, to give home centres to students rather than external ones, will be a big help. Many academics felt that students will have “psychological comfort in knowing that they will be appearing in their own school and will be seeing plenty of familiar faces on exam day”. Sachin Kalbande, a school trustee and president of RTE Foundation, said, “It’s a fantastic decision by the education minister. Parents were worried about Covid-19 cases rising and were afraid of letting their children appear for the exams.” Another senior principal said, “The heat in the month of May is unbearable. They should have shifted everything to June.” Speaking to TOI last week, minister Gaikwad had addressed the issue. “Every area has some unique issues which we have to address, but the final decision has to be taken for entire state. Vidarbha summers are bad, Konkan monsoons are tough. So we try to find the best possible way out of the situation,” said Gaikwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/experts-due-to-unbearable-heat-in-may-all-exams-should-have-been-held-in-june/articleshow/82038824.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Endless construction work, bumpy roads make simplest commutes treacherous in Kehri Gaon||Dehradun: With never-ending road construction work and potholes every few metres, residents of Kheri Gaon in Prem Nagar area of Dehradun say even a simple commute proves treacherous for them. The stretches dug up for work under the Smart City project cause waterlogging after the slightest of showers, forcing residents, most of them senior citizens and retired Army personnel, to take long detours to run daily errands. Rubi Srivastava, a resident of Kehri Gaon, said, “The condition of the road near my area is pathetic. I used to go for walks but now even that has become difficult due to the giant boulders strewn across the road. When out for a stroll, I often stumble and nearly fall.” MP Singh, a businessman in Sainik Colony who owns a paying guest (PG) accommodation, said, “Colleges like UIT (Uttaranchal Institute of Technology) have reopened and students are coming back to PGs. We were hopeful that business would pick up but students now avoid this area. Most own two-wheelers and riding those is difficult on the uneven roads we have here.” Nitin Srivastava said he had brought his father to Kehri Gaon from Sitamarhi, Bihar, for medical treatment at a Doon’s Shri Mahant Indiresh Hospital but now regretted staying in Kehri Gaon because of the condition of the roads here. “As my father was receiving medical treatment in Dehradun, we started staying at a relative’s house in Kehri Gaon. My father has undergone two operations and suffers from an abdominal ailment. Commuting on these bumpy roads is, therefore, extremely risky for us,” Nitin said. A PWD official who did not wish to be named and is involved in development works in the area, said, “These Smart City Project works will be completed soon and then the waterlogging issue will also be solved. In fact, we are working extra hours to ensure residents don’t face any inconvenience from our department.” {The report has been filed by Sakshi Srivastava}||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-endless-construction-work-bumpy-roads-make-simplest-commutes-treacherous-in-kehri-gaon/articleshow/82037692.cms||---
---||Goa||FC Goa ready for historic debut in AFC Champions League||Margao: The Nehru Stadium in Fatorda has been home to FC Goa since inception in 2014. It’s here that the club has enjoyed some of their finest moments. It’s here that they have dominated visiting teams. Wednesday night, though, will be different. It’s Champions League football. Not the one you watch late night on television; that’s reserved for European clubs. This is the Asian version and Goa will become the first from India to feature in this high-profile league. Nobody really knows what to expect. None have been here before. But when Goa face Al-Rayyan SC late on Wednesday, they are sure to realise it’s nothing like their dominant ways in the Indian Super League. “A lot of our players are used to playing against teams who are at a similar level, or lower than us (in ISL),” captain Edu Bedia told TOI. “These Champions League games will be tough. We have to stay focused. There will be difficult moments and it is up to us to show we can face these moments.” Goa have been the most consistent team in ISL, making it to the playoffs for a record six times in seven seasons. They qualified for the AFC Champions League after winning the League Winners’ Shield last season. ACL, though, will be a different challenge. First up are ACL regulars Al-Rayyan. The Qatar giants are looking to qualify for the knockout stage for the first time in 11 appearances and managed to convince the 1998 French World Cup-winning centre-back Laurent Blanc to return to coaching after a four-year sabbatical. “I watched FC Goa matches on video and they like playing (with the ball). We all have our targets, but our focus is on Goa. They are not an easy team to beat,” said Blanc, who last coached French giants PSG. That’s not how everyone looks at Goa in group E, which also has last year’s finalists Persepolis FC from Iran and Al Wahda (UAE). For many, they are the punching bag. “If you listen to everyone, we are considered the weakest team in the group,” said Edu. “I don’t personally see it that way. If we put our best foot forward, teams will have to be a lot more careful of how they play against us.” Coach Juan Ferrando is under no illusion either. Since recovering from Covid-19, Ferrando has spent most of his time telling the players what to expect from heavyweight Asian opponents. For a week now, he’s made adjustments to the team’s eating and training habits, so that they are in the best possible shape for a late 10.30pm kickoff. “This is an important moment for the club, for Indian football. We know about the opponents. We know their level. The game will be of high-intensity. It’s important to be ready, not just physically, but psychologically. “For us, it’s a big responsibility. It’s important to focus and take this one game at a time. This is our time to learn, to be competitive against the best teams in Asia,” said Ferrando.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-ready-for-historic-debut-in-afc-champions-league/articleshow/82055840.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

B Mohanraj of Ram Nagar owns Sri Raja Hotel at Gadhipuram. Around 10pm on Sunday, a cop from Kattoor police station came to the restaurant and told Mohanraj to down the shutters immediately as inspector Latha would be coming for night patrol. As the customers were having dinner in the restaurant, he kept the shutter half-closed. Around 10.20pm, sub-inspector Muthu, 36, attached to the Kattoor (law & order) police, entered the restaurant with a baton in hand. He started to thrash customers having dinner and employees of the restaurant for allegedly keeping it open despite cops’ warning and violating Covid-19 restriction of closing shops before 11pm. However, as per the Covid-19 standard operating procedures, eateries shall be permitted to operate with 50% occupancy till 11pm. “A woman named Jayalakshmi suffered an injury near her eyebrow when the baton hit her. The SI also assaulted four hotel employees,” Mohanraj said. CCTV cameras fitted in the restaurant have footage of SI assaulting customers and employees. Jayalakshmi was among the five women who came from Hosur to the city. “The sub-inspector behaved rudely. It reminded us of the Sathankulam incident (where a father-son duo died after being tortured by police for keeping their shop open beyond the permitted time). My hotel staff members are admitted to CMCH for treatment. The SI has been transferred but an FIR should be registered against him,” Mohanraj told reporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/si-hits-diners-staff-of-hotel-in-coimbatore-suspended/articleshow/82038821.cms||A Subburaj

Both the PMC and the PCMC have now decided to add at least 300 beds to these facilities by the end of this week. Officials from the PMC said their CoEP jumbo facility, which had stopped new admissions on January 15, was restarted in March due to the recent surge. The unit reopened with a capacity of 50 beds, which was increased to 250 and then later to 600. Its maximum capacity is 800 beds and officials said these could all be occupied soon. "Doctors and paramedical staff, despite the tremendous stress, are working very hard. Relatives and citizens are trying to put undue pressure on the system. And this is causing unnecessary panic among those on duty," said Shreyansh Kapale, dean of the CoEP jumbo hospital. He said that in some instances, management had to call the police. Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner, said the civic body is aware of these frequent clashes between staff and families at Covid facilities, including the Annasaheb Magar stadium jumbo unit. “We will give the Magar unit more manpower and police protection. On Monday, we added four more doctors to the jumbo unit's team," Patil said, adding that talks are on with NGOs for volunteers. He added, "We know relatives of patients are getting impatient. These are testing times. Everyone needs to keep calm and cooperate." Patil said the security issues at the Magar stadium jumbo unit will be resolved with the next two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/as-jumbo-units-fill-up-quarrels-erupt-between-families-staff/articleshow/82038840.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The victim has been identified as JM Meshram. Forest labourers were extinguishing fire in Pitezari range adjoining Nagzira wildlife sanctuary on April 7 when the fire-blowers they were carrying caught fire, which engulfed the labourers. While three of the labourers succumbed to the burns on April 9, seriously injured two others were undergoing treatment in hospital. The fire was noticed by forest guard YU Badole and some others around 1pm on April 7. Meshram, a resident of Bampewada in Sakoli tehsil, had suffered burns in compartment number 14 in Wadegaon beat under Pitezari range. According to FDCM officials, Meshram was using a blower machine when he was surrounded by fire from all sides. He was seriously injured after the blower fuel tank caught fire and exploded. Meshram was admitted to sub-district hospital at Sakoli and shifted to district hospital at Bhandara, but as his condition was serious he was referred to a private hospital in Nagpur where he succumbed on Monday. FDCM chief general manager (CGM) Rishikesh Ranjan said, “The corporation will pay an ex gratia of Rs2 lakh to wife of the victim. Besides, being a permanent van majoor since 2012, Meshram’s all requisite service dues like gratuity and PF will also be released.

In the petition filed through advocate PC Sasidharan, Jaleel has contended that the Lok Ayukta’s findings against him were without conducting any preliminary investigation or any adjudication on whether the complaint is to be entertained. The Lok Ayukta proceeded to finalize the report solely based on oral arguments of the parties, it is alleged in the petition filed in the high court. The minister has also contended that the Lok Ayukta should not have entertained the complaint as it related to prescription of qualification and appointment to a minority development finance corporation, which is specifically excluded from the purview of the investigation under the Kerala Lok Ayukta Act. Further, the petition said the appointment was a subject matter of a writ petition before the high court earlier and the issue was also raised before the Governor. Both the high court and the Governor had not entertained the petitions, it is pointed out. The findings of the Lok Ayukta are perverse and not based on any materials. The Lok Ayukta also did not follow any procedure mandated under law to arrive at a finding against him, the minister argues while seeking to quash the Lok Ayukta’s order. An admission hearing on the petition is expected during the vacation sitting on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/jaleel-challenges-lok-ayuktas-order-at-hc/articleshow/82038842.cms||---

CM||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday hit out at Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for attempting to appropriate the legacy of former defence minister and CM Manohar Parrikar. “Manohar Parrikar is our leader, and we are following his vision,” Sawant said. “The legacy of Parrikar will be followed by BJP. Who are they (AAP) to follow it?” Responding to Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia’s request to disgruntled BJP karyakartas to join AAP, Sawant responded with his own invitation to join BJP instead. “All will join BJP,” he claimed. Political observers say that AAP is keen on encashing the resentment within BJP after the zilla panchayat and municipal polls. Over the past year, some BJP karyakartas have joined other parties after they realised their future was bleak in the saffron party. However, on instances like the recent CCP election BJP has been able to silence its detractors within its fold, who openly criticised the party. On Sunday, taking a dig at the Sawant-led government for ignoring Parrikar’s ideas and loyalists, Sisodia said the saffron party “has buried the vision of development for Goa” after his death and sidelined people who aligned with his vision. “I want to convey to BJP volunteers in Goa to leave the party as it will never be able to bring Parrikarji’s vision of development to life. Join our fleet of 4,000 AAP volunteers, who will take forward Parrikar bab’s vision for Goa,” he said. Sisodia had said that AAP would win the 2022 assembly election and will bring “Parrikarbab’s vision for a developed Goa into life”. “We want to focus on Goa’s vision of sincere politics. When we focus on sincere politics and attain growth, when we focus on politics of vision, we take into account the needs of what people in Goa want, what changes need to be made for Goa’s progress,” he had said.  “Whoever has the vision to bring growth in Goa should join hands with AAP. We can together work towards Goa’s development. BJP will never make an impact for Goa’s progress,” Sisodia had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/who-is-aap-to-follow-parrikars-legacy-cm/articleshow/82038889.cms||---

The traffic police decongested the traffic,” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said. Gupta said, “We have taken action relating to disobedience against 100 people for not maintaining social distancing under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code in various parts of the city.” Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame said, “There were complaints relating to traffic snarls at Market Yard and its adjoining suburbs because large number of goods vehicles were stranded/parked in a haphazard manner. We ensured that the vehicles were parked systematically so that no inconvenience was caused to other vehicles plying via Market Yard. There were also complaints relating to minor traffic jams near Santosh Hall on Sinhagad road, Yerawada, Maldhakka Chowk and Shahir Amir Shaikh Chowk because of heavy rains, water logging and signal disruption. We streamlined the heavy flow of traffic manually and ensured that there was no major traffic disruption.” Shrirame said, “We have fined around 8,000 motorists for committing traffic-related offences like stopping on zebra crossing, riding triple seat, not wearing helmets, not carrying driving licence etc. The action against motorists was taken by policemen on field duty via CCTV cameras. We also used CCTV cameras for monitoring the traffic situation at important chowks and junctions in the city.” Meanwhile, the police on Monday penalised 1,815 people in the district for not wearing face masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traffic-congestion-at-market-yard/articleshow/82038851.cms||Asseem Shaikh

---||Nagpur||44 gardens in bad shape, contractors yet to get their dues||Nagpur: Around 44 city gardens are nobody’s baby now. They are struggling to survive. After not receiving payments for nearly nine months, contractors who are in charge of maintaining the gardens have backed out. In July last year, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) took over more than 70 gardens owned by the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT). The decision was reportedly taken by the then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe. About two months ago, TOI reported about NMC’s decision to reverse its decision and hand over the gardens back to NIT. While both the parties are struggling to come to a decision, the fate of these gardens hangs by a thread. While taking over the gardens, NMC had asked the same contractors, who were maintaining around 44 gardens when they were under NIT, to continue doing the job till some arrangement was made. In a letter written to them, NMC had stated that they will be paid as per the terms and conditions. However, that never happened. On April 5, the contractors finally stopped work as they had not received payments for over nine months. According to them, the total pending amount is over Rs 1 crore. “We kept requesting the civic officials to pay us. All these months we were paying labourers from our own pockets,” said a contractor. Now, the contractors have also exhausted all their financial resources. “Nearly 200 labourers are sitting idle due to the pandemic. As they are skilled in gardening techniques, they can’t find any other job. Even if NMC makes part payment, we are ready to work as we want their houses to run,” said another contractor. As per sources in NMC, the civic body has appointed its own permanent labourers to maintain these gardens. “Hardly two labourers have been appointed for one garden which won’t serve the purpose. We would keep 8-10 labourers depending on the garden size. This is peak summer and gardens are dying due to lack of watering and maintenance,” the contractor said. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari told TOI that the decision to take over the gardens was made by Munde without taking approval from the house. “At a time when NMC is struggling to maintain its own gardens and is seeking help from NGOS, how can it take care of additional gardens of NIT? We have written a letter to NIT, asking them to take the gardens back,” said Tiwari. NIT commissioner Manoj Suryawanshi confirmed that such a letter was received. “I will be meeting civic officials soon and will then take a decision which will be in public interest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/44-gardens-in-bad-shape-contractors-yet-to-get-their-dues/articleshow/82038849.cms||Manka Behl

---||Mumbai||Autos see 33% dip in daily rides in Mumbai, 50% for taxis||MUMBAI: The Covid-19 restrictions have led to a huge dip in auto, taxi rides. The number of daily rides in autorickshaws is down by 4-5 lakh, while that of taxis by nearly 50,000 due to ‘Break the Chain’, activists from the auto-taxi unions said on Monday. Autos log average daily rides of 15 lakh, while it’s around a lakh in Mumbai for taxis, trade union sources said. “In the past one week, we have seen a huge drop in rides as only two passengers are allowed, while at the same time, people are not stepping out to go to private offices, shops etc. Autos are running empty even on feeder routes,” said Shashank Rao of Mumbai Autorickshawmen’s Union. Another reason commuters are opting out of autos and taxis for short distance travel is the recent hike in fares by Rs 3. Mumbai Taximen’s Union leader A L Quadros said taxis are facing problems due to the new rule on just two passengers per cab. Fearing a more stringent lockdown, a section of drivers is also planning to go back to their villages. “Earnings have gone down as compared to pre-Covid times. Besides, we have already incurred huge losses during the last lockdown and fear we may end up in another crisis if there is a similar lockdown announced for the state,” said a driver, who requested anonymity. With business hitting a low, auto drivers have become more pliable, says Shoma Dey. “It was a pleasant surprise as three drivers asked me and were willing to take me to my destination,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/autos-see-33-dip-in-daily-rides-in-mumbai-city-50-for-taxis/articleshow/82040449.cms||Somit Sen
---||Kozhikode||Revealing interview marks will pose threat to lives of board members: CU||Kozhikode: Calicut University has provided a strange excuse to a Right to Information (RTI) query seeking information about interview marks awarded to candidates who attended the assistant professor interview in Malayalam department saying that revealing the interview marks would pose threat to the lives and personal safety of the interview board members. The varsity has turned down the RTI query in this regard citing section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act which pertains to ‘information, the disclosure of which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes’. Several candidates who had attended the assistant professor interviews had approached the varsity seeking interview marks of the selected candidates following allegations that there has been violation of norms and nepotism in the ongoing faculty appointments. The reply to the RTI query denying the request was provided by assistant registrar K Abdul Rasaq. The varsity’s reply also mentions that the interview marks cannot be provided as it pertains to third parties. Meanwhile, UDF-affiliated syndicate member Rasheed Ahammed P said that it was strange that the varsity has invoked a provision in the RTI Act which is not normally used to turn down an RTI query in an academic institution. “It shows that the varsity doesn’t want the interview marks awarded to candidates to come out in public as that would expose possible violation of norms and whether the three-point criteria for awarding marks, including for research experience, ICT-enabled teaching proficiency, etc. have been followed by the interview board,” Ahammed said. He added that interview marks of candidates do not come under the purview of confidential information as it is placed at the syndicate meeting. There have been instances of colleges and university providing the interview marks to RTI applicants before, he said. Ahammed added that the varsity has been keeping the entire selection process under wraps and even the syndicate members have not been provided the reservation roster governing the appointments. The Central Information Commission had earlier pulled up the authorities of the Banaras Hindu University for taking recourse to Section 8(1)(g) merely as a pretext to deny information. The order by the CIC had said that ‘Through this order the Commission now wants to send the message loud and clear that quoting provisions of Section 8 of the RTI Act ad libitum to deny the information requested for, by CPIVs/ Appellate Authorities without giving any justification or grounds as to how these provisions are applicable is simply unacceptable and clearly amounts to malafide denial of legitimate information attracting penalties under section 20(1) of the Act.’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/revealing-interview-marks-will-pose-threat-to-lives-of-board-members-cu/articleshow/82038859.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||NGT directs Talwandi Sabo plant to deposit Rs 84.99 lakh as environment compensation||Chandigarh: The National Green Tribunal has directed Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) thermal plant in Mansa district to deposit Rs 84.99 lakh as environment compensation with the Mansa district magistrate within a month to restore the damage caused to environment through pollution and execute recommendations of the environment monitoring committee in a time-bound manner. The deputy commissioner has to ensure environment restoration work after preparing an action plan in consultation with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB). The NGT principal bench headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel has also directed CPCB to issue appropriate guidelines for remedial measures during the startup period of thermal power plants and also advise the state pollution control boards or committees to incorporate suitable conditions in granting consent to operate such plants in future. The tribunal observed that from the information in public domain, it appeared that TSPL’s turnover was Rs 5,286 crore in the financial year 2018-19. “We may note the legal position with regard to payment of compensation on ‘polluter pays’ principle. Compensation is equal to loss caused or suffered,” said the NGT, adding the compensation has to have relation with the financial worth of the violator so as to be deterrent. Earlier, TSPL had moved the Supreme Court, challenging the NGT order of July 15 last year which constituted a committee comprising CPCB, PPCB, state environment impact assessment authority (SEIAA), and Mansa district magistrate to furnish action-taken report (ATR), including restoration plan for damage to the environment and assessment of realistic compensation of the damage caused. TSPL submitted that it was not heard by the NGT before constituting the committee. But the arguments raised by TSPL failed to find any favour with the Supreme Court, which observed: “It is also not in dispute that the committee had furnished to the appellant (TSPL) an opportunity of submitting a representation.” It observed the committee had already submitted its report. Therefore, the Supreme Court, while disposing of the appeal, had directed TSPL on January 29 to lodge its objections to the joint committee’s report before the NGT within three weeks. Thereafter, when the matter was listed before it on April 7, the NGT observed: “The TSPL has not filed any response to the report of the committee, inspite of specific opportunity and time given in terms of order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court though more than two months have passed….” The NGT added no further opportunity was sought by the TSPL before listing of the matter which could be availed by simply sending an email. “However, during hearing, adjournment is sought for which we do not find any justification,” reads the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ngt-directs-talwandi-sabo-plant-to-deposit-rs-84-99-lakh-as-environment-compensation/articleshow/82038857.cms||Sanjeev Verma

There were 10 flights to Singapore, with around 160 passengers each, during pre-Covid times. “That will give us a little more ticketing business because businessmen, students and people with permanent residences will travel. But this will also be minimal till the wave subsides,” Krishnaraj added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/no-plan-to-resume-coimbatore-flights-now-srilankan-airlines/articleshow/82038856.cms||---

Members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said these nursing homes can now be regularised via a conditional permit to aid in the city's fight against Covid-19. These facilities could not secure the civic body's registration as they had not met certain norms set by the PMC's building department, including stairway width and other structural shortfalls. Quite a few of these nursing homes and small hospitals are currently treating mild to moderate Covid patients and need remdesivir. But they are unable to get the drug as their names are not on the dashboard - a dedicated online portal where every healthcare unit treating Covid disclose information on bed capacity and occupancy. Medical expert Amit Bagul, who runs Universal Hospital at Kasba Peth, said, "Currently, we are treating 30 Covid patients. My hospital's registration renewal for expansion is awaited from the PMC. The process was delayed due to the surge in cases and civic officials have been extremely busy. But we are now facing problems while procuring remdesivir for our patients." Vikas Gaikwad, who runs the 53-bed Sai Shraddha Hospital at Dhanori, said, "I'm struggling to procure remdesivir and even oxygen cylinders for patients here. We are currently treating 40 people with Covid. I have submitted the patients' tests reports and other details to the distributor, but I'm yet to get the vials." According to new rules, all hospitals and care facilities treating Covid have to submit patient details - including RT-PCR tests and chest CT scans - to justify use of remdesivir. The norms are in place to check hoarding and unnecessary prescription. Experts said now is the time to extend immediate help to the unregistered nursing homes that are struggling to get the anti-viral drug. "These small units should be given conditional permission. And their names should be included in the dashboard so that they do not face any problems while procuring medical essentials," said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA's Hospital Board of India, Pune branch. Despite repeated attempts, both the PMC's health chief, Ashish Bharati, and the assistant medical officer of health, Manisha Naik, could not be contacted for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/unregistered-nursing-homes-struggle-to-secure-remdesivir/articleshow/82038861.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Eight municipal corporations and 109 municipal councils and nagar panchayats had gone to polls on February 14, and results were declared on February 17. Last week, Vimal Thathai was elected the first mayor of Abohar municipal corporation on Friday in the presence of industries minister Sunder Sham Arora. Meanwhile, the choice of the mayors of the remaining five corporations – Pathankot, Bathinda, Moga, Batala and Kapurthala, is likely to be made in the coming days. In Hoshiarpur, Shinda was sworn in as the mayor of the Hoshiarpur municipal corporation in the presence of Arora and food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. Parveen Saini and Ranjeet Chaudhary were elected as senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. Jalandhar divisional commissioner Gurpreet Kaur Sapra presided over the oath taking ceremony besides administering the oath of office to newly elected mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. Amarjit, brother of cabinet minister and local MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu, was elected mayor of the Mohali municipal corporation after the oath taking ceremony of the newly elected councillors at MC Bhawan in Mohali. Amrik Singh Somal and Kuljit Singh Bedi were elected senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. In an expression of resentment, Congress councillor and former senior deputy mayor Rishav Jain and wife Rajrani Jain (also councillor) boycotted the ceremony after taking the oath. The choice of the mayor from the same family as the local MLA did cause some heartburn among a section of the local Congress leaders. “It does not send the right signal even to the voters, besides antagonising those who may be vying for the top post,” confided a Congress leader. Meanwhile, in other districts too, the Congress MLAs are lobbying hard to get their confidante councillor chosen for the top post. “Having one of your supporters as mayor works for the local MLAs, especially with the next assembly elections around the corner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hoshiarpur-mohali-get-new-mayors/articleshow/82038871.cms||---

About 200 people are getting vaccinated in a PHC a day. The mobile vaccination drive was launched to increase the number of people getting vaccinated. Three vehicles each have been allotted for the five zones. Staff manning the vehicles have been instructed to meet the target.”Those working in industrial units, commercial establishments, private companies, educational institutions and general public will benefit from the drive. “People can contact the staff on the telephone and WhatsApp number to make use of the facility. The vehicles will visit places where there are least 50 people. They should follow Covid precautionary measures,” said a corporation source. “Each team comprising of two staff and three supportive staff would be able to vaccinate 200 people in a session. Additional vaccine vials will be supplied to them immediately if required.”The three Covid care centres at Bharathiyar University, Anna University and Codissia trade fair complex have 1,500 beds, Pandian said. “We are working on to increase the number of beds to 3,000.”The rapid increase in number of positive cases in the city is directly proportional to the population and density, the commissioner said. “We plan to limit the number of people in parks, commercial complexes and markets by 50%. We plan to introduce token system at parks from Tuesday. Traders and farmers in markets will be asked to work in shifts,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-launches-mobile-vaccination-drive-aims-to-achieve-target-of-10000-per-day/articleshow/82038862.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Oxygen supply choked, patients queue up at Civil Hospital||AHMEDABAD: With oxygen supply getting scarce in small hospitals designated as Covid-19 treatment facilities, there was a deluge of breathless patients Covid-19 needing oxygen, who were diverted to Civil Hospital on Monday night. Sources close to the development said that there were over 40 such patients. It was the twelfth consecutive day of daily peak for the state as Gujarat recorded 6,021 new cases in 24 hours – recording four cases every minute. It’s nearly threefold rise in daily cases in 12 days. The state also recorded deaths of 55 Covid patients, the highest so far. The unprecedented surge has sent all the stakeholders scurrying for resources. While Ahmedabad witnessed long queues for Remdesivir for past 4-5 days, it was now the turn for oxygen. Despite assurances from the state government, the hospitals in Ahmedabad confessed that they had to turn down patients due to want of the lifesaving gas. “I have 50 patients admitted, out of which 35 require constant flow of oxygen. Every minute, the patient requires about 60 litres of oxygen. I had to tell a few inquiries that we cannot admit any new patients till any existing ones gets discharged,” said the director of a city-based hospital on condition of anonymity. “The shortage is so acute that several city-based hospitals are now pooling in resources to ensure uninterrupted supply.” The medical fraternity pointed at a two-layered system populated by produces and distributors. “Due to the heavy rush, some units are producing oxygen round the clock. But production is not enough – it also needs a supply chain to ensure that the stock reaches hospital. Several of the distributors have bucked under the pressure and have also experienced employee resignations due to over 12 hours of shift,” said a business insider on condition of anonymity. The issue is graver for the new hospitals that don’t have elaborate set-ups. The big hospitals have liquid oxygen tanks that can be refilled directly or mechanism that can produce oxygen from air. But the hospitals with 10 to 40 beds depend on the oxygen cylinders. It’s rise and rise of cases for almost all the districts of Gujarat. With over 30,000 patients, Gujarat is among top 10 states with highest active cases. Ahmedabad district has highest active cases at 7,165 followed by 6,486 in Surat, 3,781 in Vadodara and 3,303 in Rajkot. The test positivity rate (TPR) indicating positive cases every 100 tests also recorded a fourfold rise in two days, from 1% to 4%. The rise has resulted in near-full hospitals in Ahmedabad. While 89% of the available beds in private hospitals were occupied, the state government-run hospitals were also filling fast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/oxygen-supply-choked-patients-queue-up-at-civil/articleshow/82039854.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Twin hotspots run out of groceries, veggies||BHOPAL: The seven wards under the jurisdiction SDM, Kolar, declared containment zone will continue to have complete lockdown with everything except for medical shops shut even as grocery and vegetable shops will be allowed to open in other parts of the city during the lockdown. For grocery, residents of the area have been advised to book orders online to superstores. “Lockdown in itself is an unpleasant situation but even if it has to be imposed, provision for sale of things like vegetables, fruits, eggs, chicken, fish and meat, which can’t be stocked in the same way as grocery, should be made by the administration,” said P K Singh, a resident of Gulmohar. Administration, on the other hand, claims that vegetables are being sold door-to-door by vendors licenced by the BMC. However, they are rarely seen in the areas. “It has been more than 3-4 days that lockdown has come into effect but I didn’t see a single van of BMC-authorised vendors selling vegetables here. When you say such & such thing will be open or available, it should at least be visible. They had said medical shops would open, you can see them open. But, when it comes to vendors authorised by BMC to sell vegetables, I have never seen any of them till now,” said Vishnu Sharma, a resident of Shahpura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/twin-hotspots-run-out-of-groceries-veggies/articleshow/82037730.cms||---
---||Pune||Remdesivir helpline either busy or unreachable: Pune hospitals||PUNE: Several city hospitals and nursing homes on Monday found the 24x7 remdesivir helpline either "busy" or "unreachable", a day after it was set up to streamline the supply of the drug. Many hospital administrators expressed their anger and disappointment, saying the system should be immediately improved, considering Pune's current Covid caseload. Officials from the Officials from the Food and Drug Administration said the control room operating the helpline will take at least a day more to be fully functional. The system was activated at the district collectorate on Sunday evening, April 11. S B Patil, joint commissioner (drug) of FDA, Pune said, "A few teething issues are being resolved. We are gearing up to streamline the helpline/control room work from Tuesday (April 13)." On Monday, Pune received 6,000 vials of the remdesivir. Siddharth Dhende, who runs a small hospital at Yerawada, said, "I tried the helpline number - 02026123371 - several times between 8am and 10am on Monday. But the call did not connect. How can a single helpline number be enough when the daily requirement in Pune has crossed 14,000 vials. There should be multiple helplines because there are so many families desperately trying to reach a single number." Dhende's small unit has six Covid patients on oxygen support and a few others with underlying conditions who may go on to need the drug. "I asked for 20 vials from the area distributor because a loading (first) dose itself takes two vials each of 100mg of remdesivir. That means a patient's first loading dose takes two vials followed by one vial each (100mg) over the next five days. We cannot skip the dose," he said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India, said, "Since Sunday evening, several hospitals have been calling the helpline number. But many have found the control room's response to be very slow. Even after 12pm on Monday, only about 25% of the hospitals that had managed to reach the control room had received some kind of response." Healthcare activist Abhijit More said every hospital's remdesivir allocation should be made public. "There is no clarity on procurement. The district administration should bring in more transparency to the whole process," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/remdesivir-helpline-either-busy-or-unreachable-say-hospitals/articleshow/82038875.cms||Umesh Isalkar

This is one of the largest private cloud deployments in the country and will further strengthen Flipkart’s growing e-commerce business in India, the company said in a statement. Walmart-owned Flipkart did not disclose the specifics of the new Chennai facility, the financial terms of the deal and the timeline for the new centre to go live. The e-retailer has a data centre in Chennai and it has also set up another centre in April 2019 in Hyderabad in partnership with provider CtrlS. “The data centre has been designed to meet the highest standards in reliability, security and sustainability, which will capitalise on the Adani Group’s capability as the largest solar player in the country to generate and source green power. The AdaniConneX data centre is a brand-new facility enabling Flipkart to design the data centre to its growing infrastructure needs with a significant focus on security and keeping data locally within India,” Flipkart said. Last year, the Adani Group revealed its plans to invest around Rs 2,500 crore to set up a hyperscale data centre (DC) in Chennai called Adani Chennai-1 in a boost to the city’s aim to become a major data centre hub after Mumbai. The availability of large industrial parks around Chennai, a strong network of undersea cables connecting the city to south east Asian countries and TN’s reputation of being a power surplus state are the state’s key strengths. As per state officials, at least six companies have committed around Rs 12,000 crore in data centre infrastructure investments in Tamil Nadu in 2020 as part of a series of MoUs signed by the state. Yotta Infrastructure, HDCI Data Centre and Singapore-based ST TeleMedia are a few other companies that have committed to investing in TN. “At the Flipkart Group, we are focused on ensuring that our customers get access to a wide range of products made available by sellers across the country as we continuously innovate to drive greater affordability. Our logistics network and technology stack are instrumental in making this a reality. These investments will help us strengthen our presence and capabilities in India to support MSMEs and sellers while also accelerating job creation and growth,” said Kalyan Krishnamurthy, CEO, Flipkart Group. Flipkart also partnered with Adani Logistics to strengthen Flipkart’s supply chain infrastructure, and as part of the tie-up, Adani Logistics will construct a 534,000 square feet fulfilment centre in Mumbai and lease it to Flipkart. Set to be operational in the third quarter of 2022, it has a capacity to house 10 million units of sellers’ inventory at any point and create around “2,500 direct jobs and thousands of indirect jobs”, Flipkart said. “This broad-ranging partnership across our logistics and data centre businesses is a unique business model, and we see this as a great opportunity to serve Flipkart’s physical as well as digital infrastructure needs,” said Karan Adani, CEO, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/flipkart-partners-with-adani-group-for-data-centre-in-city/articleshow/82036926.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
