The updated health advice comes as more than half of all adults in the United States have now received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Biden said the new advice was a direct result of steps the country had take to fight the coronavirus. "We’ve made stunning progress because of all of you,” Biden said, adding that Covid-19 cases are "down dramatically." Deaths among senior citizens have dropped by 80%, as vaccinations have increased, he said. Wearing face masks has been considered by experts one of the most effective ways of controlling virus transmission. With most Covid-19 transmission occurring indoors, and vaccinations on the rise, the use of masks outdoors has been under public debate for weeks in the United States as Americans look to enjoy the benefits of being fully vaccinated. "The release of these new guidelines is a first step at helping fully vaccinated Americans resume activities they had stopped doing because of the pandemic, while being mindful of the potential risk of transmitting the virus to others," the CDC said. New Covid-19 cases have dropped 16% in the last week as the US surpassed 140 million people having received at least one shot of authorized vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech , Moderna or Johnson & Johnson's one-dose vaccine. This was the biggest percentage drop in weekly new cases since February, according to a Reuters analysis of state and county data. SMALL OUTDOOR GATHERINGS The agency said fully-vaccinated Americans can safely dine outdoors with friends from multiple households at restaurants and attend small outdoor gatherings with a mixture of fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people. CDC continues to recommend masking for crowded outdoor events such as parades and sporting events and indoor visits to the hair salon, shopping malls, movie theaters and houses of worship. The agency classified activities as "red," "yellow" and "green" based on level of safety for unvaccinated people. It said unvaccinated people can also walk and run unmasked with household members outdoors safely and attend small outdoor gatherings with fully vaccinated family and friends. Data on whether vaccinated people can spread infection to those who did not receive their shots is limited and the CDC warned that people should evaluate risk to friends and family before going out without masks. This is an update to the CDC's guidance, which in March said people who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 can meet without masks indoors in small groups with others who also have been inoculated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/citing-stunning-progress-on-coronavirus-biden-lifts-outdoor-mask-guidelines/articleshow/82280715.cms||---

"Adequate facilities in terms of beds, oxygen and testing are in place. These are also being augmented. Currently Ladakh has two oxygen plants in the government sector. One each in Leh and Kargil. There are two more plants in the private sector in Leh. Another two will be ready in the next few days, one each in Leh and Kargil. We are also working on two more plants, possibly in Nubra sub-division of Leh and Zanskar sub-division of Kargil in the next few weeks," divisional commissioner Saugat Biswas told TOI. He said blocking entry of people without negative reports combined with restrictions on movement and gatherings have helped "keep things under control". "Anyone without valid RT-PCR negative report not older than 96 hours is being turned back. We have set up 'filtering points' for people coming by road via Srinagar or Manali. We have sensitised Border Roads Organisation (BRO) (which employs most of the migrant labourers) and other stakeholders on this. We have requested states, from where these migrants come, to create awareness about the need for a negative report so that they don't get stranded upon arrival," Biswas said. Deputy commissioner Shrikant Balasaheb Suse said Covid checkpoints and quarantine facilities have been created at Upshi on the Manali road and Khaltse on the Srinagar highway. For locals returning home, there is a dedicated service to ferry them to a government testing centre. "A seven-day home quarantine is mandatory for arriving locals even after the test result is negative," Suse said. Ladakh attracts an estimated 70,000-80,000 labourers every May-September 'working season' for building roads and other infrastructure projects as well as private construction. A majority of these migrant labourers come from Jharkhand and Bihar to work in projects across the hinterlands of Ladakh, mostly roads being built by BRO. This has stoked fear of infection spreading among the thinly-spread population in areas where healthcare facility is limited or not easily accessible. Cases began spiking since the last week of March and are hovering around 2,000. Suse said the daily arrival of labourers by air has come down from about 700-800 two weeks back to about 150-200 as they now prefer to come by road, which is cheaper. The flow of tourists too has come down to a trickle after showing signs of an uptick in March. Biswas said the number of labourers without RT-PCR report has also fallen sharply due to sustained information campaign. Simultaneously, however, cases of forged test reports have also come to light. "Several police complaints have been registered against contractors," Suse said. Biswas said the effort was now on to decentralise testing at block level to overcome the challenge of geography and resultant distance in the region. Suse said a CB-NAAT (alternative to RT-PCR) test machine has been brought in for this purpose, while the testing capacity of the test centres, one in Leh and the other in Choglamsar is being expanded. "Testing is going on. Since several states have now made RT-PCR negative report mandatory, we will soon have a testing facility for tourists going back to their home states to make their exit smooth," Biswas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-new-oxygen-plants-to-help-ladakh-breathe-easy-as-entry-without-covid-report-blocked/articleshow/82281000.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||India||Not supplanting HCs, can’t be a mute spectator amid national crisis: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it was taking up the national crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic and did not intend to supplant the role being played by the executive or the high courts, which were striving to provide succour to the stricken and fearful citizenry in states. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S R Bhat said, “The suo motu cognisance taken by the SC was not in any manner intended to supplant the high courts, which have a valuable role in exercise of their powers under Article 226 to protect the fundamental rights as well as legal rights of citizens in states, where the HCs are in a better position to monitor the situation and provide succour." But as it acknowledged the role of the HCs in enforcing the fundamental and legal rights of citizens, the bench also asserted that the SC also had a role to play when it came to issues with countrywide repercussions. “Obviously, there is a need for the SC to step in to deal with national level issues, especially those relating to coordination in supply of oxygen, medical equipment, medicines and vaccination of all eligible citizens, especially as the category above the age of 18 years will be eligible from May 1,” the bench said. “At a time of national crisis, the SC cannot be a mute spectator. We intend to play a complementary role to the HCs. We will ensure that HC orders are enforced. We want to clarify that the HCs will play their role. We wish to do our part,” the judges said even as they warned states not to use the proceedings as a platform for recrimination on political grounds. The Centre, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, said it had approached the crisis arising from the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases in a holistic manner and had taken states along. "Coordination is done at the highest level of the prime minister and chief ministers. Everyone is responding collectively and no one is acting as one vs another. We have a high-level coordination committee to iron out differences. Steps are being taken on a war footing and the situation is monitored 24x7,” he added. The bench assured the Union government that it was not going to substitute the executive's wisdom and policy in tackling the pandemic with the views of the court. “We are not taking over the work of the executive. It is for the government to decide what method and mechanism is best suited in the present situation. However, we would like to give our views on certain issues and suggest improvements for achieving better results.” When certain states started airing their individual grievances on supply of oxygen and stoppage of oxygen tankers by some district administrations, the bench warned all states against using the SC proceedings as a platform for exhibiting political rivalry and attempting to score brownie points against one another. “No recrimination please. Let us find solutions to the present crisis. Recrimination is not going to solve anything,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/not-supplanting-hcs-cant-be-a-mute-spectator-amid-national-crisis-sc/articleshow/82281337.cms||---

Our endeavour would be to save the maximum lives. There is no point arguing about the number of deaths. The main issue at present is whether we are able to streamline our system,” the CM said. “Nobody knew about the pandemic. We need everyone’s support at this time and nobody should make data related to deaths a point of contention.” Congress's Randeep Surjewala latched on to Khattar’s comments, saying “such words can only be of a ruthless ruler”. “It is necessary to debate each and every death in the state that has taken place because of the government’s failure. It is warranted to debate so that it can reach BJP, which has turned a deaf ear to the issue,” he said. In Rohtak, Khattar had denied that the administration's handling of the Covid surge had been lax and insensitive. On senior officers of the administration being allegedly unavailable for any kind of assistance, Khattar said everyone was accessible to him over the phone even at odd hours. He also defended the state’s largest health institute, Rohtak-based PGIMS, shutting its doors to Covid-19 patients. The CM said admission was stalled by low oxygen pressure. “Once the oxygen pressure level came to normal, admission of patients was allowed.” Haryana has reported 4.5 lakh Covid infections and around 4,000 deaths. At several places, deaths have been allegedly caused by unavailability of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/useless-to-debate-covid-toll-as-dead-wont-come-back-to-life-khattar/articleshow/82281606.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Kolkata||City clubs scurry to impose curbs as Covid gets to patrons||Bengal, like the rest of the country, is reeling under the Covid tsunami. According to reports, the surge in cases that has affected a significant chunk of the urban elite can perhaps be linked to a surge in social events, including grand weddings, get-togethers, and so on. Though the state government is yet to declare a new set of rules to contain the situation, several institutions in Kolkata, especially city clubs, have already started imposing strict restrictions to ensure they do not turn into superspreader venues. Here's how… No sporting activities being encouragedCalcutta Cricket and Football Club (CCFC) and Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) has stopped almost all indoor activities. The gyms and swimming pools are closed and even if some of the outdoor sports are being conducted, protocols are being maintained. "Only running and tennis are allowed because there are fewer chances of physical contact. In this situation, we cannot think of operating indoor activities," said Hirak Dasgupta from CCFC. Prasant Jalan, a senior member of RCGC agreed and said that any kind of indoor sports is a strict no in their club too. No indoor activities for the time beingAlong with the sports, there has been a ban on indoor dining facilities as well. Tollygunge Club and CCFC have stopped all sorts of cultural events and gatherings. Even though some clubs have kept their bars open, only a limited number of people are allowed to get inside after thermal screening. On the other hand, clubs like Tolly Club and RCGC have taken their bar out in the open. "We have canceled all our cultural events and social gatherings planned for the next few weeks. This is the only way to keep things going in a proper way," Anil Mukherjee, the CEO of Tolly club added. New roster for club workersFor the last few weeks, most clubs are registering extremely low footfall. According to Tolly Club authorities, only 15% of its members are visiting the club on weekends, while on weekdays it is even less. Similar is the situation at Punjab Club and because of that, it has reduced the number of the workers by scheduling them on shift duty. "Since the number of guests has reduced drastically, there is no need for all the staff members to gather in the club every day. Once the situation gets better, their timings will get back normal," said Sanjay. Special vaccine drive for club employees Recently, CCFC and Punjab club also organised a special vaccine drive for their staff members and patrons. CCFC, for instance, will start a five-day vaccination drive for its employees soon. "They are the ones who come in contact with the guests the most. If they are safe, we can all be safe," said Hirak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-clubs-scurry-to-impose-curbs-as-covid-gets-to-patrons/articleshow/82280232.cms||Bishwabijoy Mitra

The primary job of an “oxygen nurse” is to monitor its use among patients and ensure minimal wastage. Government medical college and hospitals (GMCHs) in the state will soon have dedicated oxygen nurses, said state health director Archana Patil. Patil told TOI instructions have been issued to all GMCHs to set up a dedicated team of such nurses. “These nurses have to monitor the requirement of oxygen every 2-4 hours, round the clock. They will have the discretion to increase or decrease the flow depending on the patient’s need,” said Patil. The department has asked the GMCHs to have one oxygen nurse for about 50 patients. The ongoing small but effective practice of appointing oxygen nurses was started last year in Nandurbar, which is 450km from Mumbai. It has received much attention and accolades this year due to the significant increase in oxygen requirement among Covid patients. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said as the state has been stressing on judicious use of oxygen, the concept of an oxygen nurse will ensure its effective use and reduce wastage. “Appointing an oxygen nurse is a unique and effective way of monitoring the use and reducing wastage of oxygen. When patients visit the washroom, eat a meal or talk on the phone, they remove their masks and the oxygen gets wasted. Also, when a patient’s oxygen saturation improves, its use must be reduced. An oxygen nurse looks into all this,” said Tope. “The concept of an oxygen nurse was not born during the second wave but has been in practice since last June, albeit on a smaller scale,” said Nandurbar civil surgeon Dr Raghunath Bhoye. Due to the shortage of nurses in the beginning of the pandemic, the idea couldn’t be implemented in its full scale then. “This year, we have managed to keep one oxygen nurse for 15-20 patients in a ward on O2 support,” said the doctor. “The job is simple. They monitor the oxygen saturation levels of patients every one-two hours. If someone’s saturation is stable above 95%, the nurse can take a call on reducing the O2 supply. On the other hand, if a patient is struggling to maintain good oxygen despite being on support, they can escalate the case,” said Dr Bhoye. “It also helps us avoid giving too much oxygen where it is not needed,” the civil surgeon added. At Nandurbar Civil Hospital, where 240 patients were on oxygen support on Tuesday, around 15 nurses were posted exclusively to monitor the intake. Dr Bhoye said the concept has already been implemented in two other sub-districts and is likely to be introduced in rural hospitals as well. The district has recorded 31,553 Covid cases and 462 deaths since March last year. It has recently been praised for its foresight in installing two oxygen generation plants that have made it self-sufficient. Work is in motion to install a third.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/oxygen-nurses-to-monitor-use-limit-wastage-in-maharashtra/articleshow/82282219.cms||Bhavika Jain

The measures were recommended by the Union health ministry at a high-level meeting on Tuesday but a final decision will be taken by the Centre in consultation with state governments. The proposal may be further refined, but the urgent need to tackle the spread in high caseload-high positivity districts was underlined by the ministry. “Our analysis suggests stringent lockdown measures in districts with very high positivity rate are essential to break the chain of transmission over the next few weeks,” a senior official told TOI.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Coronavirus: Live updatesIndia has been reporting over 3 lakh cases daily for almost a week now.

Covid’s official death toll has crossed 2 lakh in India as both cases and deaths continue to rise at an alarming rate. For the first time since the beginning of the outbreak, India saw more than 3,000 deaths on a single day. There were 3,62,770 fresh cases and 3,286 deaths reported in the past 24 hours — both being the highest so far. Tuesday was also the seventh day in a row when India reported over 3 lakh cases and the eighth continuous day when deaths exceeded 2,000. A country-wise comparison shows that the USA has seen maximum covid deaths so far and the virus so far has killed 5.72 lakh people in that country. Brazil is the second with 3.92 lakh deaths while Mexico has seen 2.15 lakh covid related deaths. India’s death toll of 2,01,106 is the world’s fourth-worst.

They find time running out and the burden of logistics and confusion over vaccine procurement have put a cloud over the inoculation drive. It was only on Tuesday that the Maharashtra government requisitioned 12 crore vaccine doses from Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech for the next six months and sought information about a monthly supply from both companies. Read AlsoCovid-19 vaccine registration for 18+ from today on CoWin app: All you need to knowThe registration for the next phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive for citizens above 18 years of age started today. Eligible citizens will be able to book their slots online via government’s Co-WIN portal or the Aarogya Setu app, which was launched last year. Citizens can register an appointmentWhile Maharashtra health secretary Pradeep Vyas’s letter addressed to the heads of both pharmas wanted to know the procurement price and the availability of vaccines before starting the next phase, state health minister Rajesh Tope said they had not received any response as yet to the letter from either company. Coronavirus: Live updatesGoa government may not be able to start vaccinating people in the age bracket of 18-45 years from May 1 as it is yet to get vaccine stock. The directorate of health services has placed orders with SII, but they have not got a commitment for the supply yet. The vaccination of a new category of people would be subject to receiving the supply of vaccines, said Dr Jose D’Sa, director of the directorate of health services.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); “As per information from SII, they are not in position to supply immediately, as it has to fulfill requests placed by the government of India. Only then they will supply us, and it may take time,” said D’sa. The West Bengal government has decided to procure vaccine doses on behalf of private hospitals to ensure the inoculation drive does not come to an abrupt halt next month. But given the logistics issues of orders being placed and deliveries taking place in the few days that remain this month, there is cloud over the drive at private Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) from May 1.

With 3,293 new deaths, India's total number of fatalities now stands at 201,187. The country recorded 3,60,960 new Covid-19The state government on Monday had told private hospitals to directly buy their own stock from the manufacturers after April. But on Tuesday, private hospitals prevailed on the government to do the bulk procurement on their behalf, arguing that a single order would be streamlined rather than individual private CVCs placing fragmented orders. With private hospitals required to return the unused vaccines on April 30, there will be no more dose left with private CVCs till the state gets fresh ones from manufacturers that will come at a higher price. “Forget about the Phase-3 rollout, we will not have any dose left for people whose second doses are due from May 1. The inoculation drive is going to come to a halt in the private sector if the state does not come to our rescue,” said CEO of a private hospital in Kolkata. In Karnataka, private hospitals, which were receiving their quota of Covid vaccine from the Centre until now, may have to buy it directly from manufacturers from May 1. The government is yet to issue any order to this effect. BBMP chief commissioner Guarav Gupta told TOI that private hospitals will soon get a communication in this regard and added that a meeting may be convened if required. Multiple hospitals told TOI they have no clarity from the state government yet about the expanded vaccination from May 1 and no procurement process has started. Timely supply of doses remained a concern for Jharkhand too ahead of May 1. There are approximately 1.57 crore adults in the state, between 18-45 years, who are eligible to take the jabs in the upcoming phase. “As on Monday evening, we had 3.22 lakh doses of Covaxin and 2.75 lakh doses of Covishield. But it has to be administered only to the beneficiaries of the first two phases,” a health department official said. Health officials said the state has placed orders for 50 lakh doses with the Centre for existing phases. That apart, the government has also placed orders for 25 lakh doses for direct purchase from the manufacturers. “I do not know when the vaccines will come. If you ask whether we will start the drive (third phase) from May 1, I do not know,” said Jharkhand health secretary Arun Kumar Singh. The Telangana government has set itself a target of vaccinating 1.45 crore people between the ages of 18 and 44 in just three months. It has asked Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech to allocate a major chunk of its indigenously developed vaccine, Covaxin, to Telangana. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar met Bharat Biotech’s chairman & managing director Dr Krishna Ella on Tuesday to ensure enough stocks are available.

He said Sidhu was indulging in “total indiscipline” and had no claim to the post of state PPC chief or deputy CM. Breaking his silence after repeated jibes by his former cabinet colleague on the issue of sacrilege, Amarinder said, “Sidhu doesn’t even realise which party he is in. If he is in Congress, then this is total indiscipline. I think maybe he is planning to join AAP or go somewhere else.” Asked about Sidhu and his wife Navjot Kaur, a former MLA, camping in Patiala, Amarinder said, “He is most welcome to contest (from Patiala). In that case, he cannot continue in Congress. Someone who has been attacking his (Congress) CM means that he is preparing to go somewhere else… Last time, Gen JJ Singh (Retd) had come (to contest from Patiala) and his security deposit was forfeited. He (Sidhu) will meet the same fate.” On speculation that Sidhu was keen to take over as Punjab Congress president or deputy CM, Amarinder added, “Why should he (Sidhu) be the party president?

Former president of the state chapter of Indian Medical Association Dr Rajeev Ranjan Prasad said extremely-chilled water should be avoided as it irritates the throat. “The earthen pots keep the water at normal temperature. However, there is no scientific evidence of its benefits against Covid-19 infection,” he added. Meanwhile, many in the city are avoiding chilled water from refrigerators and switching to clay pots instead. One can cool water in pots in a chemical-free way. Mukesh Singh, a resident of Khajpura, said, “I have been using earthen pot since years, especially during summer, as it reduces my gastric problem and protects me from sore throat. Even kids at my home prefer water from these pots.” Pankaj Kumar, a resident of Kankarbagh, said, “Earthen clay pots are organic and don’t have any harmful effects on the body. My entire family prefers these pots.” Earthen pot sellers in the city too said the sales are normal despite a slump in the market. “Average sales are expected in the months of May and June despite the slump in the market. The demand is in fact higher this time when compared to last year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-switch-to-earthen-pots-this-summer-amid-pandemic/articleshow/82280430.cms||---

Aurangabad remained the hottest place in the state with the maximum temperature at 42.3 degrees C. Bhagalpur was the second hottest place with 41.4 degrees C. Similarly, the maximum temperature at Chhapra and Gaya were recorded at 40.6 degrees C and 40.9 degrees C, respectively. Weathermen claimed that the maximum temperature has been hovering in the range of 37- 41 degrees C at most places in the state. Any respite from the hot weather is unlikely at least over the next couple of days as gradual 1 to 2 degrees C rise in day temperature is expected during the next 48 hours. However, Patna Meteorological Centre has predicted isolated thundershowers on Thursday and Friday in east Bihar. It is expected to bring the temperature slightly down across the state. Aarti Gupta, a metereologist at Patna Meteorological Centre, said on Tuesday that a rising trend has been witnessed in the last two to three days owing to warm westerly winds blowing at most places in the region. “Maximum temperature has been in the range of 38-41 degrees C,” she said, adding that day temperature is expected to rise on Wednesday as well along with dry weather condition. However, people in east Bihar can expect some respite from the scorching heat for a couple of days from Thursday. “Mixing of dry westerly and moist easterly winds in the eastern parts of the state is likely to lead to formation of clouds along with slight drop in temperature. One or two places are likely to witness formation of thunderclouds along with lightning and light rain,” Gupta said. The districts where thunderstorms along with lightning at one or two places have been predicted on Thursday and Friday include Kishanganj, Supaul, Madhepura, Saharsa, Araria, Purnia, Katihar, Bhagalpur, Banka, Munger, Khagaria and Jamui. Such weather during peak summer season is locally called ‘Kalbaisakhi’ and Nor’wester in meteorological parlance. It occurs following moisture incursion amid high temperature condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-records-years-highest-temperature-aurangabad-hottest-in-bihar-at-42-3-degrees-celsius/articleshow/82279987.cms||---

Even people with mild to moderate infections can get respite if they practise yoga, experts claim. Dr Gangadhar of Govt Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Patna, said extensive work has shown that systematic tailor-made asana practices, dedicated pranayams and meditation could provide a broad-spectrum immune build-up in the body so that viral infection could be averted or its virulence reduced. As the upper respiratory tract is the portal of entry for the virus, the health of the respiratory system is very important in preventing fatality. Yogic exercises improve the pulmonary function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, he said. He said asanas like surya namaskar, pawan muktasana and some components of pranayams like bhastrika, kumbhak and bhramari are much beneficial for strengthening breathing system and improving our immunity. All the doctors and staff of the hospital undertake these yogic exercises regularly to keep themselves mentally and physically fit, he added. Director of Prayag Tirth Yoga Centre and former director of Patna University Yoga Centre, Dr Prabhakar Devraj, said yogic asanas and pranayam can do wonders in preventing the spread of the infection. He said not a single person out of nearly 600 people practising yoga at his centre has been found to be Covid-19 positive till date. Breathing exercises and pranayams like anulom-vilom, nadi shodhan, bhastrika and jal-neti are reported to have increased the oxygen saturation level by three to four percent in Covid patients, he said. He further pointed out that the entire medical fraternity has now been advocating the practice of asanas related to the respiratory system for the cure of Covid positive patients with breathing problem. He appealed to the people not to get panicky on getting infected. They should follow the necessary protocols, take up some light asanas and have healthy diets in home isolation. Yoga would also help them maintain their calm and mental health, he added. Dr Ramashankar Ojha of Jain Vishwabharti University’s local study centre observed that breathing exercises like vayu mudra, pran vayu mudra, nadi-shodhan and ujjayee can help a lot in lessoning the breathing troubles faced by Covid infected people. All yoga practices utilize deep relaxation, which could release all tension and stress to prevent immune suppression that would have otherwise weakened the responses to the onslaught of viruses and bacteria, he said. Yoga therapist Sanjeev Suman pointed out that nearly 10% of the people diagnosed with Covid-19 experience prolonged symptoms, including trouble breathing, blood clots, headaches, nausea, muscle pain and fatigue that last for weeks and months after testing positive for the virus. Yoga helps them ease stress and pain, maintain mobility and breathe easier. He said breathing exercises and stretching (asana or gentle movement coordinated with the breath) are important for their complete recovery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/breathing-exercises-beneficial-for-corona-patients-experts/articleshow/82279612.cms||B K Mishra

There are 8.71 crore beneficiaries of the PMGKY in the state. State FPDA president Barun Kumar Singh on Tuesday said if the demands are not met before April 30, its 55,000 members will go on a four-day symbolic strike from May 1 when they would wear black badges and submit point of sale (POS) machines in their block offices. "If the department remained rigid till May 4, then the FPDA members would go on indefinite stir from May 5," Singh added. The PDS shop owners\dealers have been demanding from the food and consumer protection department permission to put their thumb impression on papers to certify the release of foodgrain to the ration cardholders to avoid mass contact, amid the deadly surge of the coronavirus pandemic. Barun added that around 18 fair price dealers have already succumbed to the Covid-19 infection due to mass contact with the ration cardholders. On Tuesday, the FPDA president submitted memoranda, one each in the office of FCPD minister Leshi Singh and its secretary at the main state secretariat. Earlier, the same was done on April 18. The state FCPD minister Leshi Singh told media persons on Monday that the PDS shop owners have to use the POS machine fitted with an additional device for biometric identification of the ration cardholders. "The PDS owners have to just scan the iris of the ration cardholder to complete the identification process, as the POS machine is already linked with the Aadhaar card number of the beneficiary," she added. She further said the system will serve as security from Covid-19 infection, as it prevents mass contact. “The POS machine, attached with a biometric device, will require training of the personnel deployed. The department has been paying Rs 70 per quintal as margin\commission money to the PDS shop pwners\dealers, but we are demanding Rs 300 per quintal,” Barun said. “Our margin\commission money related to the coronavirus pandemic last year, at the rate of Rs 70 per quintal, has been pending for six months. Our dues were for eight months from March to November last year. The payment has been made only for two months,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pds-shop-owners-oppose-pos-machines-threaten-strike/articleshow/82279368.cms||Abhay Singh

At least three children admitted to the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur in the last 24 hours were diagnosed with AES. Sonakhi Kumari (3), Riya Kumari (4) and Piyush Raj (3) from Vaishali, Sitamarhi and East Champaran districts, respectively, were admitted to the paediatric unit of the SKMCH after they complained of high fever, convulsions, mental confusion and other symptoms of AES. The head of the paediatric department, Dr Gopalshankar Sahani, said the three children were diagnosed with AES. “Piyush has also showed signs of heatstroke. His condition is critical,” he said, adding the other children admitted to the PICU ward were showing signs of improvement. SKMCH superintendent Dr B S Jha said eight children with symptoms of AES have been admitted to the SKMCH since January this year. Six of them were diagnosed with AES, he added. Dr Jha said the reports related to the AES have already been sent to the health department. AES cases are reported during summer in flood-prone districts like Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Sitamarhi, East Champaran and Samastipur. This year’s first case of AES was reported on February 16 when two-and-a-half-month-old Akash Kumar was admitted to the SKMCH by his parents. Earlier, Muzaffarpur district magistrate Pranav Kumar had said that a massive awareness campaign was launched in Muzaffarpur to keep AES at bay. “District health officials have been asked to reach out to people in all villages and guide people on how to contain the likely outbreak of AES during summer,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-kids-diagnosed-with-aes-at-muzaffarpur-hosp/articleshow/82279480.cms||Ramashankar
---||Business||Coal plant insurance faces green hurdles||MUMBAI: Thermal power plants are finding it difficult to obtain reinsurance cover in international markets as global giants tighten their environment, social and governance (ESG) policies. This has created capacity constraints for insuring coal-fired power projects, which are too big for the balance sheets of domestic insurers. Most of the reinsurance markets in the West have closed the doors to coal-based projects. On December 10 last year, Munich Re had announced that it has stopped insuring coal-fired power plants. Last month, Swiss Re announced that it was accelerating its race to achieve net-zero status in carbon emissions in its portfolio. “We also revised our oil & gas policy in 2020 and, beginning in 2021, are gradually withdrawing insurance support for the most carbon-intensive oil and gas production,” the reinsurer said. Insurance marketplace Lloyds of London also said in December that it is scaling back its exposure to coal and oil sands. European primary insurers like Axa and Zurich had already pulled back from underwriting fossil fuels such as coal and oil sands. According to an insurance broker, scouting for cover for a power producer which is looking to arrange protection from global markets is proving to be a challenge. “Reinsurers in the West have been hesitant to cover thermal power projects in keeping with their environment, social and governance policies,” said GIC chairman Devesh Srivastava. He added that, given the use of coal in Indian power generation, capacity for reinsuring thermal power projects internationally has been an issue. However, companies can work around these issues by innovating on the policies. One method is to break up the assets for separate policies and looking at combined limits. “Most reinsurers worldwide have stopped writing coal on a facultative reinsurance basis. However, they permit reinsurance on a treaty basis,” said Marsh India country head & CEO Sanjay Kedia. Facultative reinsurance refers to the project-specific contracts that insurers enter into with global underwriters. Treaties refer to the contracts where the reinsures commit to sharing the risk of an insurer’s portfolio. “This is not like the issues faced in getting cover for nuclear plants where there are global restrictions on sharing know-how. This is purely from each company’s ESG standpoint. However, since most of the large western reinsurers are taking a hard stance on coal, we depend on other markets,” said Srivastava. In India, nearly three-fourths of the power generation is from thermal projects. Besides NTPC, the country has large projects owned by Adani, Reliance and Tatas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/coal-plant-insurance-faces-green-hurdles/articleshow/82281209.cms||Mayur Shetty

Tejashwi took to Twitter to attack the state government for its inability to deal with the Covid crisis. “I had suggested to set up real-time availability/booking of beds in Covid hospitals. If this is implemented half the problem (of bed shortage) will get solved,” he posted on Tuesday, adding, “It's beyond reasoning as to what is stopping Nitish Kumar Ji from doing so.” Highlighting the grim situation facing the state, the leader of the opposition said people were panicky and running from pillar to post to get admission in hospitals. Tejshwi lamented that lack of helpline numbers to guide people amid the pandemic. “What is even more worrisome is that no official is responding to phone calls,” he claimed. Tejashwi also mentioned the 30 point suggestions he had given on behalf of RJD at an all-party meet convened by governor Phagu Chauhan on April 17 to assess the situation arising out of the second wave of Covid19 pandemic in the state. However, none of them was implemented by the government. Meanwhile, LJP MP from Jamui Chirag Paswan wrote to CM Nitish Kumar requesting to make ventilators for Jamui Sadar hospital operational in the wake of the influx of Covid patients there. Chirag said all four ventilators were lying defunct due to the unavailability of technical staff. The LJP national president said the BJP MLA from Jamui Shreyasi Singh also took up the matter with the senior officials of the district administration but nothing has happened on this front so far. “The people are faced with problems due to lack of ventilators,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-attacks-nitish-over-lack-of-covid-beds-oxygen/articleshow/82279541.cms||Ramashankar

NBFCs have also sought liquidity support as the industry has been hit hard by the second wave of the pandemic. “It is feared that the second wave of Covid will peak sometimes in May and then possibly start climbing down in June. It will not be long before the NBFC industry starts reeling under the pressure of increased NPAs and, at the same time, handling the demand of moratorium and/or restructuring from its existing and deserving customers,” the Finance Industry Development Council (FIDC) said in its letter to the RBI. FIDC has said that given the lockdown, the ability of traders and retail customers to repay has gone from bad to worse. Any default by these borrowers would render them ineligible for further credit from any lender as their credit score would take a hit. The representation has asked the RBI to allow lenders to restructure any account that is classified as ‘standard’ as of March 31, 2021. FIDC said that NBFCs with assets of below Rs 500 crore need urgent support in the form of restructuring of their loans to avoid asset-liability mismatches. Seeking a liquidity facility for NBFCs, the council said that while the targeted long-term repo operations (TLTROs) have been extended to September 30, 2021, the data shows that around 88% of the funds raised by banks through this window were invested in NBFCs having a credit rating of AA and above. Further, under the second round of TLTRO 2.0, where the RBI had mandated that at least 50% of the funds raised by banks must be invested in small and medium NBFCs, there was a tepid response from banks. According to ratings agency Icra, asset quality pressures would play out fully for NBFCs in FY22 as the level of economic activities are yet to substantially pick up over pre-Covid levels, with risks further compounded by the recent rise in infection rate. It was expected that revival in gold loans, personal credit, rural finance and microfinance would bolster growth for finance companies. However, the fresh lockdowns have further delayed hopes of revival. NBFCs lending to the commercial vehicle segment and businesses were expected to take a longer time for revival even before the onset of the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nbfcs-seek-rbi-relief-over-default-fears-in-covid-second-wave/articleshow/82281182.cms||---

The incident happened on April 25 and came to light on Tuesday after family members lodged a dowry harassment complaint against the victim’s in-laws and husband. Police said the victim was identified as Savitri, a native of Yalluru village of Gospadu mandal in Kurnool district. Cops said Savitri married Pratap, as his third wife, in January this year. Within three months, Savitri returned to her mother’s home, claiming she was being harassed for additional dowry. Pratap then threatened to commit suicide if his wife was not sent back with him. Savitri was sent back and the following night, she was allegedly abused and attacked by her mother-in-law and younger sister-in-law, causing her to take the extreme step. Cops said Pratap’s first wife also committed suicide in 2003. He then married Savitri’s elder sister. The two later separated.

He said joint collectors should dedicate their services at the call centre and ensure that patients get hospital admission within three hours of making a call. The chief minister reviewed the Covid-19 situation and public grievances with district collectors through a video-conference. Jagan asked district collectors to make medical professionals available to attend calls at the 104 call centre. He said doctors should guide patients or their family members about the required treatment. He added that doctors should make an assessment about the need for admission of a particular patient to hospital and refer the case to the district administration. He asked the collectors to monitor the functioning of government and private hospitals providing treatment to Covid-19 patients. He said all hospitals should be segregated into clusters for better monitoring and the district task force and flying squads should continue inspections in hospitals to verify facilities and treatment provided to patients. The chief minister said that no patient or family member should feel let down by the government. He said medicines to patients staying in home quarantine should be provided free of cost. The chief minister also directed collectors to recruit doctors and paramedical staff through walk-in interviews without delay. He asked officials to adopt a three-pronged strategy to ensure better treatment, oxygen, quality food, medicine, water and sanitation facilities in Covid-19 hospitals, allotment of beds to Covid-19 patients and to check services at the 104 call centre. The chief minister made it clear that no private hospital should charge more than the prescribed fee. Jagan directed collectors to close down gyms, swimming pools and parks immediately and officials to ensure that no more than 50 people gather for any function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/bolster-104-call-centre-to-tackle-second-wave-cm/articleshow/82279866.cms||Samdani MN

The government appointed Tenali sub-collector to oversee the day-to-day operation of the dairy. The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) had arrested Sangam dairy chairman and former TDP legislator Dhulipalla Narendra Kumar and other key officials of the dairy three days ago. “The government is concerned about the genuine interest of milk producers, employees of the unit and consumer public. In order to ensure there is no further depletion of assets created with the support of the government and public monies and having regard to the state of affairs indicated in the investigation undertaken by Anti-Corruption Bureau, it has been decided to take over the control of the management of the dairy,” said Poonam Malakondaiah, special chief secretary (agriculture, dairy development). Malakondaiah explained that the government had in fact ordered an ACB probe into the dairy’s affairs following a report submitted by milk commissioner and registrar of milk cooperatives. She said the milk commissioner submitted that certain irregularities, including misuse of the assets of the government handed over for management of the day, were committed by then chairman and management of Guntur District Milk Producers Mutually Aided Cooperative Union Limited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tenali-sub-collector-to-oversee-sangam-dairy/articleshow/82279856.cms||Samdani MN

---||Business||Beware of isolation fatigue caused by remote working||By Maneesh MendaFor most people I know, 2021 has begun on an extremely busy note. If 2020 was about re-learning new approaches, this year offers an opportunity to put some of those learnings into best practices. The vaccination drives by the central and state governments are gathering momentum. And allowing private companies to offer vaccines might further aide a quicker reach. The vaccines will be available to the wider population in due course. In the interim, many organisations continue to largely work from home. Some have limited employees return to workplace with precautions and restrictions. As organisations prepare a return-to-work strategy, there is a need to reflect and review HR policies and the flexibilities that could be offered on an ongoing basis to colleagues. Historically, the work-from-home (WFH) arrangement was largely based on a request from an employee and was time-bound. The current WFH arrangement, as a response to the pandemic, keeps safety and wellbeing of employees at the centre. The learnings from experiences through the last one year highlight many opportunities for employers to create an ideal work environment of the future. But they do come with their own caveats. Here are some of the top opportunities in my view: * WFH may get integrated into new ways of working: Remember the days when everyone was apprehensive about working from home? Leaders historically had limited appetite to leverage WFH. The notion of managing several roles via a WFH scenario is almost academic now. The myths are busted. However, we must keep in mind that most organisations had to resort to WFH on a no-choice basis. As we follow the return-to-work strategy, the appetite for leaders and organisations to offer WFH will differ. Even more so when faced with an impact on productivity and delivery during this prolonged period of WFH. Leaders will, however, need to challenge their thinking and make the most of the positives and learnings through the pandemic. Employee wellbeing and infrastructure at home has to be accounted for more closely. * Work from anywhere: With the extended lockdowns and restrictions, many employees moved to their hometowns within the country to lean onto their inherent support systems and families. Many exited their housing leases and decided to work from locations of their choice. Staycations almost seem (in a short time) to have been a concept that always existed, with employees leasing/renting properties for longer stay. As organisations prepare to welcome employees back to the workplace, it would be interesting to see what amount of flexibility can still be offered and whether the expectation would be for employees to be in WFH mode and be in a city where the office exists or, in some cases, move certain roles entirely remote with planned touchpoints. * Optimising the property footprint: The current pandemic and WFH has led all organisations to re-think their physical infrastructure and property footprint. Office workspace and infrastructure used to be a key differentiator for an organisation’s brand. However, given that many companies delivered quite well even with employees working from home, organisations will want to capitalise and optimise this as an opportunity. Offices may become collaboration spaces, and these spaces itself then will be reimagined in the way they are designed and utilised. * Expansion of the talent pool: Organisations traditionally chose a location to exist, based on multiple external and business needs. Hiring was therefore based on proximity to this office space and employees were traditionally tagged to the closest physical location. Virtual working has, beyond doubt, proven the continued efficiency of certain functions and roles even in a permanently ‘remote working’ scenario with employees choosing to function out of distant locations and yet delivering their potential. This opens up a huge opportunity to widen the talent base and reach out to those in locations where there is no physical office space. Organisations with presence only in tier-1 cities will now be encouraged to hire from tier-3 & -4 cities. It also offers employees in these cities an ability to work for large corporations and MNCs without relocating. Even rehiring those who have left the organisation for personal relocation reasons, or women colleagues who find it difficult to step out of homes, becomes much easier in this context. But even to get to a complete framework on making things possible would mean examining closely the caveats: * Regulatory framework: All organisations will need to carefully examine the regulatory framework of employees working from home and assess any restrictions that would prohibit or restrict in any manner offering WFH as a proposition to employees. Also, if the role demands presence in office and is best delivered in the office environment, it would be going back to business as usual after the pandemic. * Employee-led requests for WFH: For companies following a hybrid approach, there is a need to differentiate the employee-requested WFH arrangement from those advised by the organisation. There may be an expectation for an employee to work from office, say, 2-3 days in a week. However, in situations where colleagues would want to work all five days a week from home. Then the flexi-working policies and guidelines will need to be revisited to ensure there are provisions for colleagues to opt for such arrangements. * Human beings are social animals: Prolonged remote working can lead to isolation fatigue. Virtual collaboration can address some of these challenges. However, for that to be effective, managers and people need more skills. Virtual collaboration needs effective communication and laser-sharp listening. In the new normal, managers will need to learn the art of articulating problems precisely and clearly. Also, teams will need to accept that out of sight is no longer out of mind. * Collaboration: In all of these, one can never discount the advantages collaboration brings to an organisation. Ideas, thinking and innovation are all a subset of human interaction and piecing together of numerous work experiences that often stem out of a collaborative work environment. And organisations will have to over time create micro as well as macro environments that enable a healthy idea exchange. * Employee wellbeing: The most underlying issue that can lead to poor employee engagement is lack of discipline and diminished focus on wellbeing. It is easy to give in to the temptation of “extra-hours at work” as you do not have your evening cab or train to catch. As the lines of work and office blur, it will be critical to ensure employee wellbeing is not hampered. Prolonged WFH has resulted in mental wellness issues and employees are eagerly waiting to get back to the workplace. However, I am sure not many are ready to get back to long hours of commute to workplace. Workplaces will continue to be important to ensure collaboration with teams. For those joining an organisation, it will be important they get to invest significant time at office to understand the work culture, build relationships with colleagues and stake holders, and get smoothly inducted. Organisations will need to evolve their thinking and firm up their return-to-work strategy keeping employees at the heart of all decisions. Flexibility will have a new definition and will continuously evolve.

The bank’s board in its meeting held on Tuesday considered it prudent to not propose any dividend for FY21, due to the pandemic-induced uncertainty. Axis Bank CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said that while it was still early days in the second wave, there has been a business impact. Chaudhry said that corporates are taking a wait-and-watch approach. While collections were not hit yet, he expected they would be in coming weeks. The bank is also seeing early signs of capacity expansion in steel and cement. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) fell to 3.7% of gross advances as on March 31, 2021, from 4.9% in the year-ago period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/axis-bank-posts-rs-2677cr-profit-in-q4/articleshow/82281155.cms||---

The state government has announced free vaccination for all above 18 years of age. Registration for the same will be done on the Union ministry of health and family welfare’s CoWin portal. Eligible persons can also register through Arogya Setu mobile application. Walk-in appointments for vaccination are not allowed in the third phase of the drive in the country to prevent crowding at the designated centres. The beneficiaries are required to log in to CoWin web portal to register and schedule an appointment. A confirmation message on their registered mobile number will come. It will be required to be shown at the vaccination centre. Meanwhile, youths in the city seem to be enthusiastic for taking their first jab from May 1. “Looking at the current scenario, vaccination seems to be the only respite for us. Apart from following guidelines and taking all precautionary measures, I now can move towards vaccination to safeguard my safety from the virus,” said Aakash Srivastava, a resident of Indira Nagar. Shivani Kashyap, a college student, said youth should participate in the vaccination drive in large numbers. “Even if the effectiveness of the vaccine is still questionable, it is the only way out to tackle the virus. People should be more aware about the campaign,” she further added. Satyam Watsalya of Gandhi Nagar near Patliputra railway station said people, especially between 26 and 45 years of age, are mostly in jobs and need to go to offices and meet people. They have their work commitments and vaccine will help them. “Immunity of this age group is comparatively better, but still the recent strain is hard upon us,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/if-you-are-18-register-for-vaccination-from-today/articleshow/82280507.cms||---

However, the Nalanda Medical College & Hospital (NMCH) had 116 beds (16 with oxygen) vacant till evening, with 384 patients in the ward with oxygen support. The bed status was changing almost every hour with discharge and new admissions. The NMCH superintendent, Dr Binod Kumar Singh, said the hospital had sent a letter to the DM with a request to maintain the supply of the oxygen cylinders, which has an average daily consumption of 1,000 cylinders. "We also requested for additional 250 cylinders on stand by as sudden shut down of this life-saving gas can create trouble at the hospital", he said. The deputy superintendent, Dr Satish Kumar, said a doctor of the paediatrics department, Akhilesh Kumar, has been appointed as oxygen officer to monitor the supply and availability of cylinders. A team of hospital staff would assist him in shift wise round-the-clock oxygen monitoring. All 106 beds in the Covid ward of the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) are occupied. The superintendent, Dr IS Thakur, said while 81 patients are in the general ward, 25 are in the ICUs. Besides, 30 beds in the newly set up 50-bed suspected covid ward were occupied. The hospital has issued a phone number of the Covid control room (0612 2304104) for the status of bed availability. Thakur said people who needed admission called the superintendent or other officials, who might not be updated on the bed availability status as it changed every hour. The Covid ward at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences- Patna ( AIIMS-P) was filled with 297 patients, said Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer. There is no complaint of shortage of oxygen or any other medicines at the hospital, he added. The Indira Gandhi Institute of medical sciences (IGIMS) Covid ward had 122 patients. Its superintendent, Dr Manish Mandal, said though six beds became vacant after discharge, new serious patients were admitted. "We have to reply over fifty calls every day on bed availability," he said. Covid wards at Paras HMRI and Ford Hospital similarly remained occupied to their full capacity of 100 and 75 beds respectively. The High Tech hospital near Saguna Mor, too, had 25 patients with no room for more. Meanwhile, a 100-bed Covid ward at Medanta Jaiprabha Superspecialty Hospital will also begin soon, Patna DM Chandrasekhar Singh said, adding the hospital management has sought a week to make the Covid ward functional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/all-covid-beds-occupied-in-most-big-hospitals-in-patna/articleshow/82280521.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Goa||Vaccination wait for 18-44 age group in Goa could get a bit longer||PANAJI: The Goa government may not be able to start vaccinating people in the 18-45 age bracket from May 1 as it is yet to receive its vaccine stock. The directorate of health services has placed orders with Serum Institute of India, but they have not got a commitment for the supply yet. The vaccination of a new category of people would be subject to receiving the supply of vaccines, said director of health services Dr Jose D’Sa. “As per information from Serum Institute, they are not in a position to supply immediately. It has to fulfil requests placed by the government of India and then they will supply us, and it may take time. Vaccination of people of 18 years and above will be rolled out after stock is received,” said D’Sa, . Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that Serum Institute’s CEO Adar Poonawalla has promised to supply 5 lakh vaccines to Goa. “I spoke to Poonawalla and requested him to supply us with vaccines on priority. He has promised to provide the stock as soon as possible,” Sawant told TOI. He said the moment stock is received, vaccination will begin of people from the new category. D’Sa said senior authorities of the Goa government have been in constant touch with Serum Institute to procure doses as early as possible so that vaccination can start as scheduled. He said they have also approached Bharat Biotech for Covaxin but haven’t got a positive response. With regards to registration formalities for the new category of beneficiaries, he said, they will be as per guidelines of the government of India which are expected to be received on April 30. Meanwhile, stock received from the government of India will be utilised to vaccinate people who are 45 years and above. Replying to questions at a press conference on Tuesday, health minister Vishwajit Rane said there have been cases of people testing positive after being vaccinated not just in India but even in the US. Goa Medical College (GMC) dean and in-charge of Covid hospitals S M Bandekar said that several of its doctors have tested positive after getting both doses. But all had mild symptoms that lasted for two to three days and none had a lung infection. “If a vaccine can prevent lung involvement then it is worth getting vaccinated,” Bandekar said. Replying to media queries, health officials said there has not been a single case wherein a person died after taking both doses. Tuesday’s mortality bulletin released by GMC mentioned one case. A 71-year-old woman from Salvador do Mundo who died after contracting the virus was vaccinated on April 14. The mortality bulletin, however, did not specify whether she died after taking the first or the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vax-wait-for-18-44-age-group-in-goa-could-get-a-bit-longer/articleshow/82282057.cms||Bindiya Chari

"We raided a few medicine shops, and some incriminating evidence has been seized from a medicine shop. Action will be taken against the proprietor of the shop," Jitendra Kumar Sinha, the drug inspector at Bhagalpur, said. He added, "We have issued directions to the medicine shop owners to display the price of medicines on the display-board at their respective shops. Suitable legal actions would be taken against medicine shop owners, who would be found flouting rules and indulge in unfair trade practices." Earlier, Bhagalpur DM Subrat Kumar Sen had issued a warning to medicine traders and other establishments for not indulging in any unscrupulous activities, such as making an artificial shortage of medicines and medical equipment. Residents welcomed the step and claimed that a section of medicine traders and shops were indulging in misconduct and were into black marketing of pulse oximeter and taking extra money for essential medicines prescribed for Covid-19 treatment. Ajit Sharma, Congress MLA from Bhagalpur and Congress legislature party leader in Bihar Vidhan Sabha, alleged that he has received complaints about the artificial shortage and exorbitant prices charged for essential medicines being prescribed for treating Covid-19 positive patients. "Pulse Oximeter and other medical equipment are being charged double of the normal price. I have written to Bhagalpur DM on this issue and about the problems being faced by Covid-19 patients and their family. The issue will be brought into the knowledge of CM Nitish Kumar as well," Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/raid-at-bhagalpur-med-shops-after-reports-of-blackmarketing/articleshow/82279604.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Patna||Bihar: Woman accuses father, bro of abetment to rape||PATNA: A married woman in Darbhanga accused her father, brother and five others of forcibly handing her over to a person, who allegedly raped her several times, police said on Tuesday. The woman, 25, lodged an FIR with Women’s police station in Darbhanga on April 23. She accused one Chandrabhushan Bhagat of raping her at parental house on several occasions. Women’s police station SHO Nusrat Jahan on Tuesday said the women had somehow managed to escape from her father’s residence under Singhwara police station area and reached her husband’s house at a village under Ashok Paper Mill police station area a few weeks ago. The SHO said it was being investigated if the victim’s father had taken loan from Chandrabhushan? “The father had taken money from the victim’s husband on a few occasions in the past in the name of repaying loans. He had again asked her daughter to give him some money for repaying someone. However, she expressed her inability this time,” she said. The SHO said Chandrabhushan along with the victim’s father and brother are evading arrest. “The woman, having a seven-year-old son, kept mum for several weeks even after reuniting with her husband. The family thereafter went to Odisha where her husband works,” Jahan said. She said the victim got terrified when her brother recently started making calls in Odisha asking her to return to Darbhanga. “Sensing something wrong, the woman’s mother-in-law asked her after which she narrated the ordeal,” the SHO said. SHO Jahan said the family travelled to Darbhanga from Odisha after which the woman lodged an FIR in this connection. Quoting the FIR, Jahan said the woman along with her son was brought back home by her father and brother from her husband’s place after marriage on December 23, 2019. “One night, Chandrabhushan barged inside her bedroom while she was asleep and tried to rape her. When she resisted, he threatened to kill her son,” she said. The SHO said he raped the victim several times in the last one year at her parental home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-accuses-father-bro-of-abetment-to-rape/articleshow/82279426.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Maner police station SHO Alok Kumar said Rai was shot in the chest and abdomen. He said the villagers spotted the body around 7am and informed the police. The SHO said Rai, aged around 37 years, was a native of Chhitnawa village under Maner police station area and had not returned home Monday night. “His family members had kept searching for him all night but in vain. Her wife Rajmuni Devi has lodged an FIR against 12 persons for hatching a conspiracy to kill him,” he said. SHO Kumar said Rai’s wife has alleged that Akhilesh Rai and his associates called him over the phone and shot him dead after reaching the spot. Kumar said the informant has alleged that her husband was killed due to rivalry over collecting extortion from boats involved in illegal sand mining from river Ganga. “The accused Akhilesh hails from Sherpur village. Police have come to know that he is involved in extorting money from the sand-laden boats while the slain Rai operated his own group for the extortion,” he said. The SHO said the body was handed over to the family after postmortem and raids were going on to nab Akhilesh and other accused who were evading arrest. Man arrested for looting Nalanda MP bodyguard’s pistol: Police arrested one Rakesh Kumar Singh alias Raka (45) from Purani Bazaar locality under Barh police station area in rural Patna late Monday night for allegedly looting government pistol and five live cartridges from Nalanda MP Kaushalendra Kumar’s bodyguard Dhananjay Kumar.

The SHO said Kumar’s bike had a minor dash against the car of Singh’s brother and a scuffle took place. The accused looted the constable’s pistol loaded with five live cartridges and ran away. He said the pistol and ammunition were recovered from Singh’s possession at the time of his arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-killed-over-illegal-sand-mining-extortion-in-maner/articleshow/82279502.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||HC reserves judgement on ex-MLA’s plea||VIJAYAWADA: The AP high court on Tuesday reserved its judgement on the quash petition challenging the order of the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) court, filed by former MLA Dhulipalla Narendra Kumar in the Sangam Dairy case. Narendra Kumar was arrested by the ACB for alleged misappropriation of government land while he was chairman of Guntur District Milk Producers Cooperative Union Limited. The ACB alleged that 10 acres of government were transferred to a trust that was founded and is being managed by Narendra Kumar and his family members illegally, which amounts to a crime under Prevention of Corruption Act. It was also alleged that Narendra Kumar connived with the then employees of the union and other public servants to illegally take over government land. Arguing on behalf of Narendra Kumar, senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao told the high court that none of the grounds as mentioned in the FIR was tenable. He said the feeder dairy was later converted into a mutually aided cooperative society and then into a producer company. The process of conversion was done according to norms. When the conversion to a mutually aided society took place, the government share capital was repaid, and it cannot claim any assets in society. He said the land was acquired with the money of stakeholders. He also contended the ACB cannot book a case against Narendra Kumar as he was not a public servant at the time of land transfer. He further argued that the section under which the case was registered was repealed in a subsequent amendment. Rao said the manner in which the investigation was initiated a day after the complaint was lodged and the haste with which the ACB acted and arrested Narendra Kumar shows the sinister motive of the ruling dispensation. Arguing on behalf of the state government, advocate-general S Sriram said land that was acquired with the financial support of the government will also have to be handed over to it when the union converts into a society. He said the management did not declare the assets acquired for the development of feeder dairy and only returned the share capital amount. Sriram said if the offence occurred when the repealed section was in force, it is still a crime even if investigation was taken up at a later date. A series of events took place with regard to transfer of land to a trust managed by Narendra Kumar’s family in which a hospital is being run presently, establishes prima facie a case of misappropriation of government land that needs further investigation. After hearing both sides, Justice R Raghunandan Rao reserved the judgement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-reserves-judgement-on-ex-mlas-plea/articleshow/82279840.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Kochi||Kerala: Kanjikode becoming a medical oxygen hub||PALAKKAD: Kanjikode, the second biggest industrial area of the state, is emerging as the ‘medical oxygen hub’ of the state after another major plant was set up to produce the life-supporting medical oxygen. The plant at Kanjikode, which is the sole producer of liquid oxygen and the biggest producer of oxygen in Kerala, produces 149 tonne of medical oxygen daily and has a storage capacity of 1,000 tonne. The plant sends oxygen to different states, including Delhi. Inox Air Products Pvt Ltd group is also one of the biggest producers of oxygen in the country with plants in many states. They provide a wide range of gases which can be supplied in quantity on requirement. For the low- to medium-volume users, cylinder gases are supplied through the nationwide network. They can also generate gases on-site. Another oxygen plant at Kanjikode — Sri Venkateswara Oxygen Pvt Ltd — which meets 80% requirement of industrial oxygen in the state has now started producing medical oxygen. They will produce 600 medical oxygen cylinders daily for use in hospitals, and are suspending the production of industrial oxygen, the company sources said. Another oxygen producing company was set up at Kizhakkencherry near Vadakkumchery in the district and it will start production from next week to produce 5,000 cubic metre medical oxygen daily. The plant was started under the guidance of Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organization (PESO). This air separation unit will produce oxygen separating from atmosphere and in an hour it can produce 260 cubic metre air oxygen and 235 litre liquid oxygen. They have a storage capacity of 40 kilolitre. There are two public sector companies in the state that produce medical oxygen: Kerala Metals and Minerals Ltd, Chavara, Kollam, has a capacity to produce six tonne per day and a storage capacity of 50 tonne. Another medical oxygen producer is BPCL-Kochi refinery that can produce 1.5 tonne of medical oxygen daily at Kochi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kanjikode-becoming-a-medical-oxygen-hub/articleshow/82280476.cms||---
---||Business||Pandemic may cut life policy cover||CHENNAI: Life insurance companies have turned cautious and tightened underwriting norms for high-value policies in the wake of the Covid pandemic and pullback by reinsurance companies citing low rates in India. Obtaining a cover is particularly challenging for those who have recently recovered from Covid as the company requires further screening. A year ago, a 35-year-old could purchase a Rs 1-crore term cover after a telemedical check-up. However, if he had contracted Covid, he would have had to undergo a battery of tests. Coronavirus: Live updatesA Mumbai-based doctor told TOI that a Rs 3.5-crore cover on HDFC Life’s Click2Protect, for which he received a quote, was downsized to Rs 1 crore. What shocked him was a WhatsApp message from the company’s employee stating, “Considering the overall profile of your — profession and medical history — rate has been revised a bit. Your sum assured has been revised to Rs 1 crore.” According to the doctor, the message was that they were wary of Covid frontliners. HDFC Life MD & CEO Vibha Padalkar, however, said that the revised quote had nothing to do with the profession. “We are in the business of covering lives and we have no reason to say no to anybody unless the risk profile of the individual is not covered by the reinsurer. The reason for not giving Rs 3.5 crore is not because of Covid, but on the grounds of financial underwriting norms.” Where the applicant stays, their background and access to healthcare for post-Covid recovery are some of the factors evaluated currently, according to HDFC Life. The situation in life insurance is similar to health where insurers are cautious in terms of accepting proposals from those who have recently recovered from Covid and impose a waiting period or exclusions. What made things difficult for the doctor, who contracted Covid in August, was that he wanted to buy a policy before he turned 35 to avoid falling into a higher rate bucket. However, the delays in appraisal caused him to miss the nearest birthday deadline. Pointing out that HDFC Life has issued 1,700 policies worth Rs 2,000 crore to doctors last year, Padalkar said that the company’s stance on all risk parameters is dynamic and that what applied in the first wave of Covid is not relevant now and a lot would depend on how the pandemic is managed. She added that a lot of the term insurance business is heavily dependent on reinsurance support. Speaking on life insurers turning cautious in underwriting cover, insurance aggregator Policybazaar’s head of term life Insurance, Sajja Praveen Chowdary, said, “Any medical condition of applicants in the recent past is looked upon by the underwriter slightly in-depth as a regular process. They might ask you for additional medical tests or physical medical tests. At times, they may postpone your cover for three or six months, in which case one has to reapply.” According to a CEO of a private life company, the pullback from reinsurers had started even before the pandemic. Covid only made it worse. What triggered it was intense competition in India, which resulted in term insurance rates falling to even below what is charged in Europe. This, despite Europe having better healthcare and mortality rate among the insured population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pandemic-may-cut-life-policy-cover/articleshow/82280942.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Varanasi||Uttar Pradesh: Chandauli gives oxygen tankers ‘VIP’ status to save transportation time||VARANASI: The Chandauli police on Tuesday formally gave the status of a ‘VIP’ to the oxygen tankers entering its border from several districts of Bihar. Under this arrangement, the ‘protocol cell’ of the police will put in place all necessary arrangements, including police escorts, to create green corridors and ensure safe and unhindered passage to the tankers. SP Chandauli Amit Kumar said, “We have developed a new system in UP districts from where oxygen tankers from Jharkhand and Bihar are entering the state. As per new protocol, the cops get an alert call from Mohania toll plaza in Bihar as soon as an oxygen tanker crosses it. From this point onward, we assign the tanker all protocols given to a VIP like pilot and escort teams to move with siren and beacon in order to create a green corridor and enable it to cross the district in bare minimum time. Before the tankers reach close to the border of Varanasi and Mirzapur, the cops there are alerted to take over the tankers for further journey.” Many oxygen capsules are being transported by the Oxygen Express service of Indian railways but liquid oxygen is being transported to UP districts by the tankers moving by road. Most of these tankers are coming from Jharkhand via Bihar and entering the state through Naubatpur border of Chandauli district. SP Chandauli said, “In view of the emergency need of oxygen in almost all districts in UP, our entire focus is on curtailing the time of its transportation. We have a protocol cell in place in districts that handles VIP movement. Till the challenge of meeting demand in all districts exists, I have upgraded the status of all oxygen tankers to a ‘VIP’. This has made the process of tracking, escort and creating green corridors for a fast and safer movement mandatory for the police in the district.” As the surge of Covid cases and need for oxygen started after April 20 in Varanasi, commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh ordered piloting of oxygen tankers up to 275 km, creating a green corridor on highways by cops to minimize transportation time despite beginning of Oxygen Express service by the railways. CP said that police teams for piloting and escorting oxygen tankers were rushed up to Dehri on Sone and Gaya in Bihar and ensured that it is reaching here in 12 hours from Jharkhand districts. Positive results of the initiatives of Varanasi police, which ensured early arrival of two tankers from Jamshedpur on April 23 and 24 at oxygen plants in Ramnagar, enabled to minimize the gap of demand and supply of oxygen for needy patients. According to ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan, police in districts bordering Bihar, including Chandauli, are now ensuring creation of green corridor for all oxygen tankers passing through it for reaching various destinations, including several districts of UP and other states in bare minimum time. About five to 10 tankers are entering through Bihar border every day and these initiatives by the men in khaki are helping to save four to seven hours for the oxygen tankers to reach destinations like Varanasi from Jharkhand units as piloting by police is not only ensuring fast movement of oxygen tankers on highways and avoiding stoppages even at toll plazas, but tanker drivers are also getting motivated to drive continuously for saving lives of the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/chandauli-gives-oxygen-tankers-vipstatus-to-save-transportation-time/articleshow/82280335.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

According to Siwan-based gynecologist Dr Ranjita Sinha, “PCOS/PCOD is a health condition that affects a woman’s hormone levels. Since Covid vaccine is injected intramuscularly, that is in your upper arm muscle and not in your veins, it is nowhere to disturb a woman’s menstrual cycle.” She added: “Everyone should get the vaccine. Women having PCOD/PCOS can also take the shot as the vaccine doesn’t affect the body internally. However, local reactions such as mild fever and headache can happen temporarily.” Dr Ranjana Sinha, a city-based obstetrician and gynaecologist, told this newspaper: “It is completely safe to take the vaccine. PCOS/PCOD is not any issue in vaccination. People should not believe in myths. Vaccine is important and it is saving lives. Vaccine has nothing to do with any hormone. Everyone should get vaccinated as soon as possible.” Riya Kumari (20), an undergraduate student from Kadamkuan area said: “I was worried after some reading some social media posts about menstrual cycle and vaccine. However, my doctor cleared the confusion and advised me to take the vaccine as soon as possible because people who are getting both its doses are safer.” Shalini Sinha (25), a postgraduate student from Gola road, said mild reactions are expected in any type of vaccine. “Covid vaccine will not create any hormonal problems as no data confirms that the vaccines create any changes in menstruation cycle. I will take the vaccine in the first week of May,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vaccine-does-not-impact-menstrual-cycle-doctors/articleshow/82280419.cms||---

The hospital currently has 168 Covid beds, including 100 in the mother-child hospital (MCH) block. Once the additional 82 beds are made operational, the hospital will have 250 beds for Covid patients. According to the district administration, 143 beds were occupied at ANMMCH till 5pm on Monday. At Abhay Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS) and the Arsh Hospital, the two private hospitals, 28 and 12 beds, respectively, were occupied till Monday evening. The district administration has claimed that there is no shortage of medical oxygen. Gaya DM Abhishek Singh, who inspected MCH and the emergency ward of ANMMCH on Monday, said at least 600 oxygen cylinders were being used per day in the MCH block of the hospital. He asked the officials concerned to ensure availability of pulse oximeter in each ward and keep tabs on the agency supplying oxygen cylinders. Sharing his personal experience, the DM said, “I have taken both doses of the vaccine. Despite being tested positive for Covid, I did not feel the need to get hospitalised. People should get themselves hospitalised only when their oxygen level goes below 94,” he added. At a meeting of the disaster management group, the DM said patients can get doctor’s advice by contacting the district control room on 8987277860. “Patients or other needy people can request for a video call by calling on 0631-2950140. A link will be shared on the cellphone number of the caller through which the doctor can be consulted for medical advice,” he added. During review of risk zones, the DM was informed that in Kharkhura and Dandibag localities, the number of infected persons is comparatively higher than other places. The DM instructed the officials concerned to ensure test of all the residents of the two localities. “Make the two localities containment zones by restricting movement of people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/addl-82-beds-being-readied-at-gaya-hosp-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82279559.cms||---

The three private hospitals recently declared as dedicated Covid care facilities by the district administration are yet to become functional despite more than 2,700 people having tested positive for the virus this month so far. The civil surgeon also admitted that all 10 the ventilators in Sasaram Sadar hospital are non-functional owing to lack of trained paramedical and medical staff. Sources said more than 60% of the medical and paramedical staff at Sasaram Sadar hospital have tested positive and are under home quarantine for the last 10 days. Residents rue that despite the grim situation, no concrete steps are being taken to increase the number of beds in hospitals and improve the overall healthcare infrastructure in the district. A trader at Sasaram said the State Health Society has named a few non-functional private hospitals for treatment of Covid patients. People are getting harassed after running to such hospitals. The additional chief medical officer (ACMO) at Sasaram Sadar hospital, Dr K N Tiwary, told this newspaper that due to protest by the local residents, a few nursing homes could not be made functional for Covid patents. Meanwhile, after reports of shortage of essential drugs, the civil surgeon on Monday held a meeting with local chemists and requested them to cooperate with the administration in the fight against the pandemic. “After the surge in Covid-19 cases, the administration is trying its best to increase the number of oxygen cylinders in government hospitals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rohtas-residents-rue-poor-health-infra-staff-in-hosps/articleshow/82279579.cms||Alok Chamaria
---||Kanpur||FIR lodged against Patara CHChead for laxity in Covid work||KANPUR: An FIR was lodged against the in-charge of Patara Community Health Centre in the district over dereliction of duty on Monday night after which he was taken into custody. According to reports, Dr Neeraj Sachan, in-charge of Patara CHC, who was also heading the Rapid Response Team and deputed at the Integrated Covid Command control Center (ICCC), allegedly failed to satisfactorily answer the queries of the district magistrate with regard to Covid-19 arrangements. Sources informed TOI that Dr Sachan had been asked to send Rapid Response Teams to contact Covid patients and distribution of Covid kits. The matter surfaced on Monday late evening when district magistrate Alok Tiwari convened a review meeting with regard to the team’s work at ICCC headquarter. In the meeting, city magistrate Himanshu Gupta apprised the DM about the alleged irresponsible approach of Dr Sachan, who was supposed to perform in the sector of planning to contact infected persons and distribute Covid kits. But he had so far distributed only 12 percent of the kits. The DM then questioned Dr Sachan, but he failed to satisfy him. The DM thereafter directed Dr R N Singh, in-charge of ICCC to take Dr Sachan to Swarup Nagar police station and lodge an FIR against him under the provisions of Disaster Management Act and Pandemic Act. Later, Dr Anu Sachan, wife of Dr Sachan too reached the Swarup Nagar police station and handed over a complaint against senior officials alleging harassment but did not name anyone in particular. She later said her husband Dr Sachan had taken charge of ICCC on April 23 last. Due to weak resources and heavy workload, it might be possible he could not manage the affairs properly. Therefore, lodging an FIR was not only injustice to him, but also very demoralising for him as well as the doctors’ fraternity. Later, a group of doctors of PHCs and CHCs also assembled at Swarup Nagar police station and demanded that action against Dr Sachan should be withdrawn. Inspector Swarup Nagar, Ashwani Pandey, told reporters, “Following a complaint by district authorities, an FIR against Dr Sachan under the Disaster Management Act and Pandemic Act has been lodged and further investigations are on in this regard.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/fir-lodged-against-patara-chchead-for-laxity-in-covid-work/articleshow/82280352.cms||---

Movement of vehicular traffic was also thin. Police constables were seen manning traffic at several crossover points of the town. Katihar DM Udyan Mishra had ordered complete shutdown in the district on Tuesdays to curb further spread of Covid. Only shops selling essential items were exempted from the order. An e-rickshaw fitted with a public address system was seen making rounds of several localities of the town, such as Mirchaibari, Hawai Adda, Sharifganj, Mangal Bazar, Driver Tola, Durga Asthan and others. Badalji (35), driver of a vehicle, said Indian Red Cross Society is carrying out an awareness drive against the deadly virus in association with the Katihar Chamber of Commerce. Jitendra (35), a constable who was handling traffic at Manihari Mor, said, “Movement of vehicles is below normal compared to other days. The town is witnessing a complete shutdown. Shops are closed because special restrictions have been imposed due to the second wave of coronavirus.” Chotelal Mandal (50), a home guard jawan, said shops were closed and very few vehicles were seen on roads on Tuesday. Abhay Kumar Jha, another traffic constable, near the Collectorate, said people of the town have started following Covid safety norms. Kamlesh Kumar, a coconut seller on Mirchaibari-Purnia Road, said, “Sales have dropped as people are not coming out of their homes. Drinking coconut water is healthy as it boosts immunity too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/shops-shut-in-katihar-to-break-covid-chain/articleshow/82279572.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Hotels in Bengal offer 2,000 more rooms to hospitals as patient rush grows||KOLKATA: The tie-up between hotel and hospitals for satellite beds is turning out to be a lifeline during the second wave of Covid. More than 70 per cent of the 1,000 rooms offered for this have been booked and the hospitality body in eastern India is preparing to offer over 2,000 rooms for the satellite centres. Most of the hospitals have a waiting list of 100 patients. That the Hotel & Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) joined hands with the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) was first reported by TOI during the first wave of the pandemic. Hotels have come forward to offer their rooms to serve as satellite centres for hospitals which are situated within a couple of kilometres. Sudesh Poddar, HRAEI president, said: “We have offered around 1,000 rooms across various categories of hotels, which can be attached to hospitals as satellite facilities. These centres will be used to accommodate Covid patients with mild to moderate symptoms, where the attached hospital will be treating them under the care and guidance of their medical teams, as per the guidelines and advisories framed by the Union health ministry and the state health department.” Rupak Barua, president of AHEI, pointed out that hospitals in Kolkata, Salt Lake, Rajarhat New Town and adjoining areas have tied up with hotels and almost 500 rooms have been added as satellite facilities of hospitals. Asymptotic patients admitted in such satellite centres will be treated under strict supervision of qualified medical teams of the associated hospital, with round-the-clock presence of doctors and nursing staff. According to him, more than 50 per cent of the rooms in these satellite centres have been filled up with asymptotic patients. “More and more hospitals are taking up such facilities and we expect more beds will be added at satellite centres over the next few days,” Barua added. Some of the hotels to have taken part in this initiative include Southern Plaza (with AMRI –Dhakuria), Sojourn Hotel and Monotel (both with AMRI), Visitel Hotel (with Apollo Gleneagles), Sree Balaji Guest House (with RN Tagore), Big Boss Palace and Orion West Willows (both with Belle Vue Clinic) and ASL Prime Hotel (with Woodlands).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hotels-offer-2000-more-rooms-to-hosps-as-patient-rush-grows/articleshow/82280948.cms||---
---||Business||SC’s Tata ruling has patent errors: SP’s review plea||MUMBAI: In its review petition filed before the Supreme Court (SC), the Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group has contended that the apex judiciary’s March 26 judgment dismissing all allegations of oppression and mismanagement at Tata Sons has led to “miscarriage of justice”. It argued that the judgment incorrectly interpreted provisions in the Companies Act, eroding governance standards and rendering a large swathe of minority shareholders remediless. Additionally, SP scion and former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry filed an application seeking removal of certain adverse remarks like “setting his own house on fire” from the judgment. The law permits “patent errors” in a ruling to be rectified in a review petition. The verdict, read SP’s review petition, has narrowed the test of “just and equitable” for minority shareholders to claim relief under sections 241 and 242 of the Companies Act. Such a narrow test would leave a large swathe of minority shareholders, including private equity investors and foreign companies, remediless. The apex court held that removal of a director “can never be oppressive” but, at the same time, it held that where the removal is oppressive, relief can be granted. It, however, did not specify the circumstances that will merit the removal of a director or justify grant of relief under section 242. Though, at many places, the judgment declared Mistry to be SP’s representative on Tata Sons board, yet it held his removal to be not an act of oppression, the construction-to-consumer durables group said. The top court also held that Mistry was not an MD of Tata Sons but only its executive chairman and hence the requirement of a shareholder resolution to remove an MD, according to the company’s Articles of Association (AoA) No. 105, would not be breached. This finding, said SP, was contrary to the record and stand of Tata Sons that held Mistry was indeed an MD. The judgment further declared that Tata Trusts nominee directors were unlike ordinary directors appointed under section 152(2). It, said SP, failed to recognise that all directors, including nominee directors, are appointed by shareholders at a general meeting. It overlooked the fact that while a director may be nominated by an institution, once appointed s/he has to act in the interests of the company and of all its shareholders under section 166(2). The judgment confused the duty of “independent judgment” expected of all directors with the qualification criteria for “independent director”. This confusion can set a dangerous precedent that will dilute the fiduciary duties of directors and erode governance standards under sections 149(1) and 166(3), which require every company to be managed by a board exercising independent judgment, SP said. Tata Sons is controlled by Tata Trusts and the public charitable organisation nominates a third of the directors on the board of the company. SP added that section 166 (2) requires independent decision making by the Tata Sons board, which would be rendered redundant if decisions are pre-cleared by Trusts nominee directors. The judgment has virtually licensed unrestricted sharing of information with majority shareholders ahead of board meetings, which is inconsistent with universal principles of insider trading, SP said. The top court had declined SP relief of separation on the reasoning that it had challenged Tata Sons AoA no. 75, which the judiciary erroneously held as an exit option. “This finding is contrary to Tata Sons’s own stand in these proceedings,” said SP, adding that the court could have put an end to further litigation by articulating the principles of valuation for the separation. “Leaving the valuation to be decided by an inimical majority would only lead to further oppression and deprive SP of just and fair compensation for its legitimate interest as a partner in Tata Sons for over 50 years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/scs-tata-ruling-has-patent-errors-sps-review-plea/articleshow/82281136.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Coimbatore||In home quarantine? Now, get tasty, nutritious food at your doorstep||Coimbatore: With the number of Covid-19 patients in home isolation crossing the 1,250-mark in the district, food catering services have come forward to prepare, pack and deliver food at their doorsteps at affordable rates. On offer is home cooked North or South Indian food, mostly pure vegetarian. Some caterers even agree to prepare the dishes as per the customers’ requirements. And three meals a day could be availed at Rs 150 and upwards. Poo Market-based Shree Café is one of the caterers that is willing to deliver food to Covid-19 patients at their doorsteps. Deva Govindaraju, café owner, says, “During the first wave, we mainly delivered groceries to the disabled people. Since many people are in home quarantine this time, we have decided to cater food to them. We deliver South Indian breakfast, lunch and dinner at Rs 150.” The food, he says, is delivered by a team of five volunteers, who have come forward to serve the people tested positive for the virus. Shree Café is presently serving food for around 65 houses across RS Puram, Saibaba Coony and Peelamedu. Harsh Lalka, who runs Healthy Treats, also serves all three meals for Covid-19 patients. He got the idea after his friend’s parents, who were discharged after treatment, did not like the food their maid prepared and requested him to deliver the same. “So, I started this as a service. Now, I am serving around 16 houses,” says Lalka, who delivers the meals himself within RS Puram and Saibaba Colony, wearing gloves and mask. Houses outside the circle could get food delivered via Kovai Delivery Boys. “It will be helpful if volunteers step forward. We can reimburse Rs 3 to Rs 4 per km, which will be cheaper than delivery agencies.” Komal’s Kitchen is, meanwhile, willing to serve North Indian food, which will be prepared based on the patient’s requirements. Its proprietor Sonam Punjabi says, “Food will be prepared at home based on the client’s preferences on with or without oil, spice and specific ingredients, because Covid-19 patients often have trouble digesting or tasting food.” Most of them consider this as more of a social service than as an enterprise. “I actually lose money, because the food has to be packed in silver or aluminium foil, and we provide basic kit comprising masks, gloves and hand sanitizer to the volunteers. While we charge Rs 50 per meal, we spend around Rs 56,” says Govindaraju. Lalka also says he manages on a no profit, no loss basis but is trying to find ways for patients to spend less on logistics and deliveries too. Shree Café could be contacted at 9047657700, Komal’s Kitchen at 9994302221/9543349774 and Healthy Treats at 9944520883.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/in-home-quarantine-now-get-tasty-nutritious-food-at-your-doorstep/articleshow/82281064.cms||---

The final decision will be taken by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Wednesday. “Similar kind of restrictions in Tricity will definitely help Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali to contain the spread of coronavirus. UT officials are in touch with their counterparts in Punjab and Haryana. The Tricity authorities will not stop inter-state movement but will impose strict night curfew with extended hours,” said a senior UT official. “As Punjab and Haryana have imposed restrictions, it is now time for us to do so,” the official added. 48 more containment zones, tally 228 Deputy commissioner Mandip Brar on Tuesday declared 48 containment zones in parts of sectors 8, 12, 15, 16, 22, 23, 24, 25, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 45, 46, 48, 51, 52, Khuda Lahora, Dhanas and Manimajra.

---||Kochi||Kochi: Navy trains non-medical personnel||KOCHI: The Indian Navy has started training non-medical personnel as battle field nursing assistant (BFNA) to prepare them for assisting in the fight against Covid-19, if needed. The decision was taken after the strong resurgence of Covid-19 in the second wave, and training has been started at INS Venduruthy under the Southern Naval Command (SNC). The BFNA would help doctors and paramedics in treating Covid patients in quarantine and isolation facilities. “Consequent to resurgence of Covid-19 pandemic, SNC has taken a slew of measures to counter the contagion Covid-19, viz to be prepared and equipped to assist the civil society in its fight against the disease and concurrently to ensure insulation of own personnel from infection as well as availability of personnel for all duties as required. Training of BFNA was extensively practiced during World War I to assist the medical staff, should the situation become overwhelming,” said a statement from the Navy. Presently, 80 Navy personnel are being trained every week to augment the BFNA team. BFNA teams are also being readied at all other stations under SNC. Earlier in 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic, a training capsule for BFNAs to train non-medical personnel to work as force multipliers in time of emergencies was created by the Covid core group of the SNC. The core team consisting of command medical officer, commanding officers of INS Venduruthy & INHS Sanjivani and command training officer have used the BFNA concept and developed a small capsule. The training capsule covers the basic concepts of hand hygiene, donning and doffing of PPE, concept of biomedical waste management and carriage of casualty in an easy-to-learn manner for the non-medical personnel. Simple strategies for infection prevention were also dealt with in this course. The training focuses on the importance of wearing PPE by health professionals and ensuring social distancing to prevent and contain the spread of coronavirus. SNC has also started reserving beds and quarantine facilities for Covid patients at INHS Sanjivani, the naval hospital. Meanwhile, the SNC is continuing with its Oxygen Express mission to ensure the availability of oxygen in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep (UTL). The 37 oxygen cylinders, which were brought empty from Lakshadweep Islands, were filled and returned on Tuesday evening on MPV Megna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/navy-trains-non-medical-personnel/articleshow/82280509.cms||---
---||Goa||With 31 deaths, 2,000 new cases, Goa tweaks treatment protocol||PANAJI: Goa’s tally of fresh cases continued to rise straining the already crumbling health infrastructure as 2,110 new Covid-19 cases were reported on Tuesday, taking the active count to 16,590 and pushing the positivity rate to 38%. There was no respite from mortalities as the state saw 31 deaths, taking the toll since the pandemic began to 1,087. With the wait for test results getting longer and home isolation monitoring in tatters, the directorate of health services (DHS) tweaked its protocols for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and said anyone taking a Covid test would be treated as a positive case and treatment would begin without waiting for the test result. With the new protocol, the state reckons that it may able to arrest the spread and most importantly begin early treatment, so that people don’t turn critical. The new protocol also places emphasis on better and stricter monitoring of people in home isolation. “As the double mutant strain has high infectivity and progression of the disease is very fast, early medication will help to reduce the severity and prevent the patient from turning critical. The protocol has been done in consultation with senior health experts,” Dr S M Bandekar, Goa Medical College dean and in-charge of covid hospitals, said on Tuesday. With no respite from rising cases, medical practitioners have been calling in for stricter curbs and efficient enforcement of the SOPs to contain the spread. “The mutant strain has spread across the state, and if you are not vaccinated, it is just waiting to attack. I know our economy is important. I’m not advocating a brutal lockdown like last time, but can’t mass gatherings, parties, visit to a casino, a wedding, religious festival and election rallies be deferred for a few days. Just do that for 15 days,” Dr Oscar Rebello, who was part of the state’s expert committee to tackle the pandemic, said. Of the 31 deaths reported during the day, 23 deaths were reported from GMC, five from South Goa district hospital, one each from ESI-Covid hospital, and private hospitals in South and North Goa. The youngest patient who died on Tuesday was a 38-year old man with diabetes and hypertension and died a week after hospitalisation. Several patients were below the age of 50. The average hospital stay of most deceased was five days. Meanwhile, BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar and state water resources minister Felipe Neri Rodrigues tested positive. Tendulkar through a tweet announced that he has quarantined himself after testing positive and requested those who came in contact with him should also isolate. Rodrigues, whose test report came late Monday evening, was hospitalised on Tuesday morning. “His oxygen saturation level is satisfactory, but he is weak. He was feeling unwell for the past few days,” a doctor of a private hospital where Rodrigues has been admitted told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-31-deaths-2000-new-cases-state-tweaks-treatment-protocol/articleshow/82282118.cms||Bindiya Chari

M D Dharmadhikari, CBSE’s regional director for the Pune region which includes Maharashtra, Goa, Daman & Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, said he is unaware of any such circular. “We don’t know anything about it,” he said. When asked if this circular was issued by him, he said, “It is not.” But principals said the students need no panic. “As far as Std X internal marks are concerned, it is possible to send because we were supposed to do it before the board exam. It was an internal process. Not all students were able to appear for the practical exams because one or two of them tested positive or someone in their family tested positive for Covid-19. Schools uploaded the marks and let it rest. The final submission was not done. CBSE has requested to upload marks of practicals done to date. We have time to conduct the remaining practicals in June. In my school, we have not been able to conduct the economics practical because of a teacher-tested positive. It will be held in June and the scores will be sent offline,” Jayshree Venkatraman, principal at SNBP International School in Rahatani, said. The principal of the Army Public School said they were sticking to the previous circular by the CBSE which says they have to submit the data by June 11. They have students and staff testing positive and have not attended the practicals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cbse-institutes-to-fill-handy-internal-and-practical-marks-rest-by-june-11/articleshow/82285229.cms||Ardhra Nair

On Tuesday, the portal kept loading for several minutes before showing a message that it was unable to fetch data due to heavy traffic and asked website visitors to try after some time. However, until late evening the portal remained defunct. Officials of SMC’s health department were not available for comments. The portal was relaunched on April 21 and the hospitals and health centres were asked to timely update the availability of beds. After its launch, citizens had complained that it was not user friendly as it only displayed the total number of beds available and there was no bifurcation of ICU beds, beds with oxygen and beds for mild symptomatic patients. The bifurcations were added a couple of days ago but that too was of little help as the hospitals were not updating the information. Patients or their family members had to call every hospital to ask if the beds were available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/smcs-portal-for-bed-availability-crashes/articleshow/82279550.cms||---

But when it was needed the most, patients have been forced to rush to private radiology clinics having the facility.The machine was installed at the hospital in 2005 and inaugurated by the then minister I K Jadeja from the BJP. While it is certainly lying unused presently, different versions prevail regarding the time since it has been gathering dust. A letter by Panchmahal MP Ratansinh Rathod to deputy chief minister Nitin Patel says that the machine has not been used till date and the matter should be taken up at the earliest.At the other end, Panchmahal district panchayat president Kamini Solanki wrote to deputy CM saying that the machine was allocated to Godhra on November 28, 2004 and has been in a dead condition since December 21, 2009. She says that the positions of a staffer to manage the facility were also removed from the rolls of the hospital.Solanki has said that the existing machine should be scrapped at the earliest and a new machine should be installed. She said that the machine was much needed in the present situation and staff for the same should also be allocated.Panchmahal collector Amit Arora said that the machine has been lying unused since around 2014. “It seems that it has been declared unusable as there was no possibility to repair it. I have sought necessary documents and details to look into the matter,” he said.A CT Scan is being considered as an important diagnostic tool to ascertain the extent of infection in the lungs. In several cases, it is the scan that reveals that the patient is infected with Covid-19 even if the RT-PCR test is negative. There are two private radiology clinics that have CT Scan facilities in Godhra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ct-scan-machine-lies-defunct-at-godhra-hospital-for-over-a-decade/articleshow/82279571.cms||Sachin Sharma

The daily caseload in the city on Tuesday was 3,999. On Tuesday, the rest of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region reported 6,032 cases, much higher than Mumbai, while deaths there were equal to Mumbai’s daily toll of 59. However, cases in the rest of MMR have also dipped as the region reported 10,031 on Tuesday as against 16,202 on April 20. Deaths in this region have remained more or less constant, with 118 deaths recorded on Tuesday and 115 on April 21. Mumbai had seen 34 deaths on April 20 and 75 on April 22, and the toll in the city was 59 on Tuesday. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force, said the numbers looked “encouraging,” but former Maharashtra chief minister and leader of opposition in the legislative assembly Devendra Fadnavis blamed the downward trend on the lower number of tests carried out. Fadnavis said that fewer RT-PCR tests were being conducted even though 20% of the total deaths in the state were in Mumbai. In a letter written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Fadnavis highlighted Mumbai’s test numbers in the last eight days: 36,556 on April 19, 45,350 on April 20, 47,270 on April 21, 46,874 on April 22, 41,826 on April 23, 39,584 on April 24, 40,298 on 25 April and 28,338 on April 26. “With a 40 lakh population, Nagpur is conducting over 26,000 tests every day. Pune is also doing higher tests with their 68 lakh population. But Mumbai, which has a four times higher population than these two cities, can’t even reach an average of 40,000 tests every day,” Fadnavis said in the letter despatched to Thackeray. However, a senior BMC official said that instead of looking at the test numbers in the city, one should concentrate on the positivity rate, which is between 12% and 13% in these two days. Dr Pandit said there is a need to increase testing and aggressively trace contacts of those positive. “We have to work to bring down positivity rate to less than 5%,” he said. The daily Covid caseload in Mumbai hit its lowest in over 30 days on Monday at 3,840, largely owing to the weekend effect. Tests are usually lower on the weekends. But on Sunday, 28,328 tests were carried out in the city as against the daily average of about 40,000. The Central health ministry had on Monday acknowledged the plateauing of cases in Maharashtra, saying that it had crossed its daily peaks. Experts said that while cases are dropping or are consistent in the state, the daily case fatality rate in the state has gone up. Of the total deaths in the state on Tuesday, 392 were recorded in the last 48 hours, 179 were reported last week and the remaining 324 were from a period before that. At the state level, Nashik region has reported 17,064 cases, highest in the state, while Aurangabad circle reported 185 deaths, highest in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-nos-encouraging-claims-state-fewer-tests-says-ex-cm/articleshow/82281081.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Mumbai||Two new insect species discovered in Western Ghats at Satara||Aurangabad: Two new species of damselfly have been discovered in the Satara district — in the northern part of the Western Ghats. It was a dream come true for a group of researchers from Maharashtra and Kerala who have discovered the new species of damselfly, commonly known as torrent darts — large insects belonging to genus Euphaea. Named Euphaea thosegharensis and Euphaea pseudodispar, the newly discovered damselflies are endemic to the Western Ghats. Shriram Bhakare, who was part of the research team, said the two species were probably overlooked in the past for their superficial similarity to other Euphaea species found in the Western Ghats. “The newly discovered damselflies are distinguished by their external features and colouration. Both new species are restricted to the high elevation streams and riparian patches of the Satara district around Thoseghar and Kaas lake in Maharashtra,” he said. Besides Bhakare, the research team included honorary wildlife warden Sunil Bhoite and Pratima Pawar from Satara along with Kalesh Sadasivan and Vinayan Nair from the TNHS Odonate Research Group (Trivandrum). The discovery has been published in the recent issue of ‘Journal of Threatened Taxa’. Euphaea thosegharensis, which has received the nomenclature after the place Thoseghar, located around 26km from Satara, is similar to Euphaea cardinalis, but the upper part of hind legs of the new specie is black while it is red in E. cardinalis. E. pseudodispar is very similar to E. dispar, but is differentiated easily by the absence of yellow patch on the legs. “So far, only three endemic species of Euphaea are known in the Western Ghats. The new discovery of two more species highlights the need for more systematic survey of damselflies and dragonflies among other odonates in the northern Western Ghats,” Bhoite said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-2-new-species-of-insects-discovered-in-satara/articleshow/82281053.cms||Prasad Joshi

The dismissal of the petition by judges UU Lalit and Hrishikesh Roy has paved way for the voting scheduled for May 2. Ravindra Dattatray Patil had filed the petition in the Bombay high court which was rejected following which he moved apex court. Louis Shah, legal adviser to Gokul dairy, said, “The SC has allowed the election to take place by following all Covid-related safety guidelines. The court has also asked to double the voting centres from 35 to 70 to ensure that social distancing is followed.” There are 3,650 voters who will elect the next governing body of the dairy. Now, at every polling booth, only 50 voters will cast their votes. High stakes are involved for the political leaders who have been divided into two camps irrespective of their parties. The campaigning for the election has has already heated up with both factions moving their voters to resorts to avoid poaching. Few voters have also tested positive for Covid. Satej Patil, district guardian minister and leader of one of the fronts contesting the election, said, “The Covid positive voters will wear PPE kits while exercising their franchise. The ruling front was trying to cancel the election by all means. Now, as the SC has given the green light, everyone must be ready for the voting.” The counting of votes will take place on May 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/gokul-dairy-election-to-take-place-on-may-2/articleshow/82278867.cms||---

The daily count of corona cases also remained above 12,000 as 12,604 more people tested positive for the virus, as reported by the health department on Tuesday. With the increase in the number of new cases, active caseload in Bihar mounted to 94,274. These new positive cases were detected out of the 1,00,328 samples tested, taking the positivity rate to 12.56%. Of the 85 official deaths, maximum 22 were from Patna, followed by 10 from West Champaran district. Patna also reported the maximum number of new cases among the other districts with 1837 people testing positive, taking the active cases in the district to 17,094. After Patna, Gaya reported the maximum 769 cases, followed by Bhagalpur (654), West Champaran (639), Begusarai (611) and Saran (543). Twenty-one patients died within 24 hours at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, a dedicated Covid-19 facility in Bihar. Among the deceased, 16 were from Patna itself. While 46 patients were admitted, 48 got discharged as there were 384 Covid patients in the hospital on Tuesday. AIIMS-Patna, another dedicated Covid hospital, also reported six deaths. As per the information shared by the hospital administration, 34 patients were admitted and 21 were discharged as there were 297 patients in the hospital on Tuesday. Shortage of beds in the government and private facilities continued even on Tuesday as many attendants could be seen pleading for help on social media and running from one hospital to another to admit their patients. “Every day we get messages on WhatsApp seeking help for beds across the state. The situation is grim,” said Raja Bazar resident Uzma Naz. Meanwhile, 7,65,643 beneficiaries got their Covid-19 shots on Tuesday, including 49,826 who got the first shot. Registration for those above 18 years will also begin on Wednesday. Though the schedule to begin their vaccination is from May 1, sources in the health department said they have ordered for one crore vaccines from Serum Institute, but it has asked them to give their monthly requirement instead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-logs-highest-85-deaths-in-one-day/articleshow/82279574.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The man had died of Covid. The body lay unattended for close to four hours near the Garfa Girls’ School before locals informed police and the former local councillor stepped in to transfer the body to the MR Bangur hospital morgue. Police have summoned the driver to record his statement. The couple’s son who lives in Bengaluru has come down to perform the last rites. “On Friday we went to a private hospital at Panchasayar and got tested. The next day, we went to the same hospital where they stated that my husband was Covid positive. We asked them if he needed hospitalization but they refused stating all vital parameters are in check. His condition deteriorated on Sunday night. On Monday, I saw him sinking and took him to a hospital in Jadavpur. The doctor said that he had passed away and advised me to take him back home,” recalled the victim’s wife. The woman claimed that the hospital arranged for an ambulance free of cost. “This probably irked the ambulance driver.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ambulance-driver-quizzed-after-dumping-of-body/articleshow/82280516.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolhapur||Hospitals warned against asking patients’ kin to buy remdesivir||Kolhapur: The district administration has warned all private hospitals to refrain from forcing the relatives of Covid-19 patients to buy remdesivir vials from outside. The hospitals have been told to arrange for the drug on their own and failure in following the rule will lead to registration of criminal charges against the hospital administration. All private hospitals are facing acute shortage of remdesivir and a demand of over 23,000 vials have been placed to the war room set up at the district collector’s office as against supply of 3,000 vials. The retailers are not part of the supply chain and stockists have been asked to supply the vials directly to the hospitals — that too only when a demand has been placed with the war room. Prasad Sankpal, district disaster management officer, said, “Private hospitals must not force the relatives to get remdesivir injections from outside or they will face criminal charges. We are trying our best to provide the required number of injections to the private hospitals and we expect that supply will be normal in a few days. Currently, we are getting a demand of 1,000 to 1,300 injections.” District collector Daulat Desai had asked the health officials to randomly visit private hospitals and check whether remdesivir doses are being used as per the guidelines. However, the health officials have still not carried out any surprise visits. Ashok Pol, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation’s chief health officer said, “We have provided the revised guidelines of remdesivir use to the private hospitals. We have also appealed to the citizens to approach us if they are forced by the hospitals to buy injections. Accordingly, we can visit and check whether the patients are given the medicine as per the guidelines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/hospitals-warned-against-asking-patients-kin-to-buy-remdesivir/articleshow/82278878.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Number of fatalities now same as during first wave||KOCHI: Covid deaths in Kerala strangely remain constant during the first and the second waves. Case fatality rate (CFR) has come down from 0.4% last month to 0.36% now. When the state reported an average 5,000-plus daily Covid cases during the first wave, the daily deaths registered were 20-plus. During the peak of the first wave, when Kerala reported its highest surge of 11,758 cases in a single day on October 10, the number of deaths reported was 23. And even now, when the number of new cases reported daily has increased by almost four to five times (more than 20,000 cases) since April 21, the number of deaths reported daily is an average of around 25. “The pattern of deaths in Kerala is not following a normal course. I know of several deaths that have not yet made it to the official records. So far, there has been undercounting of Covid deaths and transparency has been an issue as we don’t give information on daily Covid and non-Covid deaths in the Covid bulletin like several other states. However, the next few weeks are crucial,” said internal medicine expert Dr Arun N M, who has been analyzing the Covid death trend in Kerala. According to Dr Arun, the state’s revised discharge guidelines issued on April 25 also helps the government keep mortality numbers low. Government has said that category C patients need to be Covid negative in rapid antigen tests after 14 days. Most patients test negative after 10 days even though they may be critical in a hospital. Later, if they die, they will make it to official records as a non-Covid patient,” he added. It is pertinent to note that about 44% of the active cases were hospitalized during the peak in the first wave as per health department’s data. But now it is the lowest at 9%. One reason for this could be that due to mass testing, we are detecting more asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms who are being home quarantined. However, ICUs and ventilators are fast filling up with about 1,462 patients in ICU and 451 in ventilators on Monday. “We will know the actual Covid deaths in another two weeks. ICU admissions has now doubled in the second wave when compared to the first wave and it is worrisome,” said Dr Anoop Kumar, member, state government’s medical advisory panel on Covid management and critical care physician at Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode. Incidentally, even now it takes anytime from four days to a week from the actual date of the death, for it to be entered in the official records. As on April 22, nearly 332 deaths have not been included in Covid-19 death list of Kerala since “the reason for death is merely not attributed to Covid”, of which 18 occured in April. “Presently, the situation is under control in the state. Deaths are seen at places where healthcare facilities have exhausted. Though our government hospital beds are almost full, we have now increased the Covid admission capacity in private hospitals too. In the coming days, as the number of cases increase our dependence on private hospitals will also grow. By then, the government should consider taking over a few private hospitals to ensure that no one dies due to lack of treatment,” said Dr Santosh Kumar S S, deputy medical superintendent, Thiruvananthapuram medical college, who had gone to work among Covid patients in Mumbai during the first wave. “In the present situation, even as the number of cases spike, the number of deaths reported from other states is comparatively lower except in cities like Delhi or Mumbai which have seen hospitals overwhelmed by complicated Covid cases converging from many places. The main reason for this is probably improved Covid treatment experience and infrastructure in the last one year. With a younger population affected, complications are fewer and recovery is better,” added Dr Jayakrishnan AV, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) committee for vaccination promotion and coordination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/number-of-fatalities-now-same-as-during-first-wave/articleshow/82280519.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Nagpur||85-year-old Covid-19 patient walks out of hospital, dies at home||NAGPUR: An 85-year-old Covid patient with constantly dipping oxygen levels walked out of the NMC’s Indira Gandhi Rughnalaya (IGR) and died in a day after reaching home. Narayan Dabhalkar had reached the IGR on April 22 and after staying for around a couple of hours he opted for a discharge against medical advice (DAMA). This is an option for a patient to be taken out against the doctor’s advice to continue treatment. Dabhalkar’s family members say that he decided to go back home after seeing a woman pleading to get her 40-year-old husband admitted. He decided to give up his bed so that a much younger person’s life could be saved, said the kin. As TOI inquired at the IGR, a senior official confirmed that records show a DAMA against Dabhalkar’s name. The official, however, clarified that even if a patient voluntarily leaves, a bed cannot be given to any specific person on his request. “Whom to give the bed to is the prerogative of the doctors. Although Dabhalkar’s leaving would have certainly eased the pressure by creating space for someone else.” said the source at IGR. Hospital sources said Dabhalkar’ himself was in the casualty section and was yet to be taken inside the Covid ward. The casualty area itself is of limited capacity and can take 5 patients at a time. Dabhalkar could have stayed even at the casualty ward till he was shifted to the Covid ward. Even leaving the casualty ward would have eased the pressure, the official said. The official clarified that IGR does not have any advanced oxygen facilities like ventilators that may be needed for critical patients. On Monday, a post on social media that Dabhalkar had sacrificed a bed much against his relatives and doctors’ advice for a young patient went viral. “Our entire family is down with Covid. On April 16, we got his samples tested and the results came on April 19. The treatment continued at home,” said Dabhalkar’s daughter Aasawari Kothiwan. However, when his oxygen level dipped on April 22, we rushed him to IGR. “We got a bed after great effort, but he was back home in a couple of hours,” she said, adding, “Even doctors said that he was in a critical state.” “My father said he would prefer to spend his last moments with us rather than the hospital. He also told us about the young patient. ‘I have already lived my life and would rather leave it to fate instead of blocking a bed for two-three days at the cost of a younger patient’,” said Aasawari. “The last moments were painful. His nails turned black and limbs had become numb. He died after having a few morsels from my hand,” she said. An employee of the state government’s department of statistics, Dabhalkar was an active member of the RSS and was associated with the Shriram Shakha Pawan Bhumi. The deputy chief of Nagpur RSS Shridhar Gadghe offered his condolences to Dbhalkar’s family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/85-year-old-covid-19-patient-walks-out-of-hosp-dies-at-home/articleshow/82281060.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Despite fire drill, Virar hospital staff didn’t have emergency no.||Mumbai: The staff of the Vijay Vallabh hospital in Virar, where a fire in the ICU charred to death 15 Covid patients on Friday, delayed calling the fire brigade as they did not have the emergency numbers, said the police. The blaze in the second floor ICU, caused by a short circuit in the air-conditioner unit, was communicated to the fire brigade control room by hospital doctors Dilip Shah and Shailesh Pathak, after the doctor, nurses and ward boys on duty alerted them. Over 15 minutes were lost as the staff tried extinguishing the fire. A police officer said that although staff claimed to have undergone fire training in the hospital, they was not aware of the emergency number. The staff on night duty when the fire occurred have also been named in the FIR, along with Shah and Pathak, but not arrested. The two doctors are in police custody till Wednesday. A preliminary investigation shows that despite a short circuit in the AC unit, the power supply was on for some time, causing continuous sparks. The sparks led to an explosion that engulfed the beds and patients. A police officer said documents pertaining to fire safety are being collected from the hospital. The licencing agency M/s RAV Fire Services, appointed by the hospital to carry out its fire audit is also under police scanner. A police officer said that available documents show that the agency had in July 2019 certified that the fire installations of the hospital were well maintained and was in a good condition. The certificate was valid till December 2019. Advocate Siddhesh Naik, representing Dr Shah and Dr Pathak, said the hospital had got fire audit for the period January 2021 to June 2021. Meanwhile, the fire audit of Covid hospitals in the Vasai-Virar region has begun. Civic sources, however, said the fire audit is an eyewash as a team of two contractual firemen have been asked to conduct the fire audit. The Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation was set up in July 2009 and all the 150 odd firemen are on a contract basis. A doctor from a Covid hospital in Virar said that the firemen visited the hospital on two consecutive days but were reluctant to move inside the premises due to Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-despite-fire-drill-virar-hospital-staff-didnt-have-emergency-no-/articleshow/82282083.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Chandigarh||Mohali needs 26MT O2 daily: Panel||Mohali: The district requires 26 metric tonne (MT) of oxygen daily to treat Covid patients in hospitals. The oxygen management committee made this conclusion following a survey. The committee took the requirement from various hospitals. The team also learnt that some major manufacturing plants were directly supplying oxygen into the plants of bigger hospitals, while smaller hospitals were dependent upon cylinders. Mohali deputy commissioner found that Mohali has very high demand of oxygen. He said, “We need 26 MT of oxygen daily but we are getting 20 MT. The requirement will rise with the increase of L-2, L-3 beds in the hospitals. We have high number of beds with high positivity, so the high demand for oxygen.” He said all industrial or other units in possession of oxygen cylinders shall make them available to the Committee. The DC said he has ordered all industrial or other units in possession of oxygen cylinders to make them available to the committee headed by Pavitar Singh, estate officer, Gmada. The nodal officer for procurement of cylinders is Sukhdeep Singh, district programme officer. The owners and management of the units shall be held personally responsible for any lapse in this regard, the orders said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-needs-26mt-o2-daily-panel/articleshow/82279576.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Last year, during the lockdown, vendors and cab drivers were given ration and vegetables for a month. “Several NGOs came forward last year to supply ration and vegetables to the needy. We request more NGOs to come forward to help them this year also,” the collector said.While farmers supplied vegetables for the drive, the district administration arranged grocery. Covid-19 awareness pamphlets were also distributed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/grocery-veggies-distributed-to-street-vendors/articleshow/82281062.cms||---

The chief minister seems to have finally realised the gravity of the situation as he said the “pandemic has threatened the whole world and also caught our state in its grip”. Sawant maintained the state did not want to impose lockdown but said it will enforce the rules strictly to curb the spread of the virus. “The state is passing through a serious situation and we will have to help people,” he told a meeting of deputy collectors and mamlatdars of all the talukas, and instructed them to shoulder the responsibility and “initiate steps as and when required”. Sawant, who also held meetings with the officials of the home department, directed them to initiate necessary measures and act strictly against the violators of the guidelines and protocols. He expressed his concern over people, especially those who are asymptomatic, not availing the Covid care facilities or taking proper treatment leading to worsening of the situation. The chief minister urged the deputy collectors and mamlatdars to hold meetings with representatives of local self-bodies and workout plans or measures to control the situation. He also advised them to go through the Covid bulletin published every day to monitor the situation closely. Sawant told them that the state has to control the spread of the virus and reduce the mortalities “at any cost”. He also called upon the officials of the revenue and home departments, health workers, representatives of local self-bodies and public to work together to overcome the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-declare-super-spreader-areas-as-containment-zones-cm/articleshow/82282084.cms||---

A police officer said the accused - S Vijay, of Chengam in Thiruvannamalai district - had fractured his right shoulder in the incident and was undergoing treatment at the government hospital in Tirupur. His condition is said to be stable. The officer said the vehicle was parked near the Tirupur city municipal corporation office. “Its driver Rajaguru, who is attached to the Tirupur city armed reserve police, had left the key inside the vehicle. Vijay, who came there in an inebriated state, saw the vehicle with the key in it and drove that away without grabbing the attention of policemen in the locality.” After a while, Rajaguru realized that someone had stolen the vehicle and informed his superiors, who alerted all police stations in the district and instructed cops to conduct vehicle checks. Meanwhile, the Uthukuli police received an information that a police vehicle was involved in an accident near S Periyapalayam on Uthukuli Road. “People had rescued Vijay, who was severely injured, from the vehicle and alerted the108 ambulance services, before the Uthukuli police reached accident spot. Police later took him to the government hospital,” the officer said. He said Vijay was a car driver. “Vijay had driven the police vehicle away for at least 7km from the city municipal corporation office, before ramming the truck, which was coming from the opposite direction. The police vehicle had overturned in the impact of the accident.” The officer said they have initiated an inquiry against the police vehicle driver, who is likely to face charges of dereliction of duty. “Once the inquiry is over, a detailed report will be submitted to the city police commissioner G Karthikeyan, who will take further action.” Police are also likely to register a first information report against the drunk man who drove away the vehicle and take action against him after he gets discharged from the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/drunk-man-drives-away-police-vehicle-hits-truck/articleshow/82281086.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Coimbatore||700-year-old stone tells saint Sundarar’s tale||Coimbatore: Archaeological enthusiasts have traced the historical importance of a stone with the emblem of Pandya dynasty that the villagers of Ganapathipalayam near Mukkonam in Tirupur district have been worshiping for the past decade.The stone, which is 90cm high and 33cm wide, was found abandoned in a nearby farmland a decade ago, said S Ravikumar, director, Virarajendran archaeological and historical research centre. He said the stone was at least 700 years old.“While the front portion of the stone depicts the image of saint and religious philosopher Sundarar with a half-moon above him, and a crocodile with a child in its mouth - commonly known as ‘muthalaivai sirppam’ - beneath him. It represents the incident that took place in the Avinashi Siva Temple. After hearing that a crocodile had swollen a child, the saint had rushed to the temple, sung hymns of Thevaram and rescued the child. The incident was recorded in many sculptures at Siva temples across the state,” he said.The backside of the stone has auspicious symbols like trishul and lamp. The other two sides have the emblem of Pandya dynasty and a Tamil inscription that reads “the land donated to Avinashi Siva Temple should be protected and anyone misusing the donated land shall amount to a sin for seven generations”.Explaining that it was not known whether the land from where the stone was found was donated to the temple or it speaks about some other land, Ravikuma said Ganapathipalayam village was mentioned as Perur Karuva Nallur in the inscription. “The Kongu region was ruled by Kongu Pandiyas - Veerapandian and Sundarapandian - from 1265 to 1312. Also, the script inscribed in the stone was used during the 13th Century and the early 14th Century. Based on these two factors, we believe that the stone is at least 700 years old.”Agreeing that the stone should be 700 years old, Ramachandran, epigraphist, Rural Education and Conservation of Heritage Foundation said, “The inscription has mention about Perungkarunai Nallur and Avinashi Aludayar. The script used is same as in the 14th Century.”The villages had also found another stone sculpture that is 130cm high and 30cm wide. It depicts woman with ornaments and anklet (silambam) in a worshipping posture. While lotus is found on her both sides, below her a cow and two fishes with a lotus in between them could be seen. The stone seems to have sculpted to honour the woman, Ravikumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/700-year-old-stone-tells-saint-sundarars-tale/articleshow/82281087.cms||---

After the state government issued fresh notification to contain Covid cases on Tuesday, the Vadodara Vepari Vikas Association (VVVA) members decided to keep their shops closed to contain spread of infection.“The government notification says that all shopping complexes and shopping malls should remain closed. We will keep our shops closed till May 5. Only those selling necessary items like fruits, vegetables, medicines and milk will remain open,” said Paresh Parikh, convenor, VVVA. The association had been demanding complete lockdown for last two weeks after a spike in Covid cases in the city.“Every other shop owner or his family members have been infected with Covid. All of us were scared and hence kept demanding for a lockdown despite the fact that we would face losses. I hope that Barodians now follow the government guidelines and stay indoors,” Parikh told TOI. “A temporary lockdown will help break the Covid chain. Once we return to normalcy, business can resume,” Parikh added. City police commissioner Shamsher Singh said, “We have issued notification wherein all shops, shopping complexes, malls will remain closed. There is a list of exempted shops and services. Also, all offices should operate with only 50% staff.” He added that the cops will conduct surprise checks at offices and those found flouting the notification will be booked.Over the past one week, members of associations like Baroda Optical Association, Baroda Sanitary Association, Baroda Tiles and Marbles Association and Mangal Bazaar Electric Association were shutting down shops by 3 pm. The traders had been urging customers to follow Covid guidelines strictly amid monitoring by the civic authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/traders-body-shuts-all-shops-except-essential-items-till-may-5/articleshow/82279587.cms||---
---||Nagpur||A noisy city can affect your health: Doctors||NAGPUR: If the constant noise of an ambulance siren in Covid-19 times is troubling you then it’s the right time to know which noise can affect your health and in which way. On the eve of International Noise Day (April 28), TOI spoke to an expert to bring to the fore various facts about noise pollution. Dr Prashant Nikhade, president of the Vidarbha chapter of Association of Otolaryngologists, says in a city like Nagpur, transportation, construction of buildings, highways, industrial noise, loud speakers etc are causing noise pollution and adverse effect on people’s health. “Noise is a Health hazard. Noise pollution, constant exposure to loud noise (more than 85 dB) is common and can lead to higher frequency sensorineural hearing loss,” said Dr Nikhade. “Noise can damage physiological and psychological health. High blood pressure, ischemic heart disease, stress-related illnesses, sleep disturbance, hearing loss and productivity loss are some problems related to noise. It can also cause memory loss, severe depression and panic attacks,” he added. However, we have to live with noise for which we need to know our capability and limits. Sound is measured in decibels (db). 0 dB is the quietest sound and each 10 dB increment will double the sound intensity. The higher the decibels, the shorter is the amount of time one is exposed to before hearing loss occurs. “A whisper is 30 dB, conversational speech is 60dB and shout from an arm’s length is 85 dB. Total 8 hours for shouts a day can cause health hazards. Just 15 minutes at 100 dB sound can cause hearing loss or pain in the ears,” Dr Nikhade said. Head phones which do not screen out background noise encourage users to raise the volume to levels that may cause long-term hearing damage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/a-noisy-city-can-affect-your-health-doctors/articleshow/82281090.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Aurangabad||AMC cleans 15-km stretch of nullah||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), as part of the initiative to clean Kham river, on Tuesday cleaned a 15-km stretch of nullah that ends up in the river. This is the first time that not only the Kham river is being cleaned, but also all the sources of clean and unclean water bodies connected to it. A civic official said so far over 154 trucks of silt have been removed from the nullah that passes through the city, making it cleaner, wider and deeper. The AMC and Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Limited (ASCDCL) led by Astik Kumar Pandey recently took up the ambitious project for rejuvenating river Kham. They were soon joined by the Cantonment Board Aurangabad, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), industrial houses and NGOs. As part of the project, steps are being taken for cleaning the city nullahs especially the ones ending up in Kham River. Notably, this project has been spearheaded by the in-house team of the AMC without the involvement of any contractor. Nandkishor Bhombe, head of AMC’s solid waste management cell, said a nine-member special task force has been created for this purpose in which a staff from every zone has been included. This team works under sanitation inspector Sachin Misal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/amc-cleans-15-km-stretch-of-nullah/articleshow/82278895.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Need extreme caution against mutant virus: CM||Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has cautioned against the rapid spread of the mutant Coronavirus in the state. “Testing will be increased, there is high chance of an increase in death rate and steps are onto increase the oxygen stock in the hospitals in the wake of this new development,” he said. The risk assessment study conducted on the three genetically-modified viruses found in the state evaluated the spread of the disease, the risk of death and the ability to make the vaccine ineffective. Accordingly, they have been found to accelerate the spread of the disease. Another issue is whether mutated viruses increase mortality. “If the number of patients increases beyond the handling capacity of our health system, the situation will turn awful. We need to strictly follow the disease preventive measures to avoid such a situation,” the chief minister said. “If the caseload increases further, then hospitals will be flooded with patients and we would not be able to provide adequate care and treatment. Such a situation should not arise here. Hence, we have decided to take all the precautions now itself,” the CM said. He said the numbers of Covid-infected people and the rate of the disease spread continue unabated. “There is the presence of genetically mutant virus (double mutant variant) on a large scale. There has been a 255% increase in active cases in the state in the last two weeks. The situation across the state is grim,” he added. The core committee reviewed the stock of the oxygen in the hospitals and directions have been given to increase the oxygen production to meet any emergency. It has also been decided to increase the number of oxygen beds in the hospitals and the Covid first line treatment centres. The ESI hospitals have also decided to set apart the beds for the Covid positive people, the CM said. “Screening will be augmented at railway stations, airports and in places where there is a large number of guest workers. Oxygen requirements will be proactively addressed and steps have been taken to increase the number of oxygen beds,” he said. We still have a limitation on the number of healthcare workers. The Covid Brigade has 13,625 personnel, including doctors and nurses, but this is inadequate in the present situation. More people should come forward to join the Covid Brigade, he added. The issues related to online registration for vaccination can be resolved only if enough vaccine stocks are available. The government is taking necessary steps to address the vaccine shortage, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/need-extreme-caution-against-mutant-virus-cm/articleshow/82280558.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Open up sections of mosques for Covid care centres, says cleric||Mumbai: Maulana Mufti Huzaifa Qasmi, senior cleric and organising secretary of leading religious organisation Jamiatul Ulema-e-Hind (Maharashtra), has appealed to the Muslims to open sections of their mosques for Covid care centres to help fight the second wave of the pandemic. The Bhiwandi-based cleric spoke to a local channel, requesting trustees of those mosques that are big and have enough space to start Covid centres and not to wait for worsening of the situation. The video of his interview has gone viral. “I am saying that only those mosques that have enough space other than the main prayer area can be converted into temporary Covid care centres. These facilities will be open for all. A lot of deaths are happening due to lack of oxygen and beds in hospitals. Not all patients need immediate hospitalisation and ICU admission. These centres will have oxygen facilities and round-the-clock monitoring by doctors,” said Qasmi. He gave an example of a young Islamic scholar Mufti Aijaz Arshad who died last week in Delhi because he couldn’t get treatment in time. Precious hours were wasted in looking for a bed in a hospital as his oxygen saturation level had gone down and, by the time he was admitted to one, it was too late. Activist Dr Azimuddin who is part of a campaign to offer oxygen cylinders by mosques backed Qasmi’s suggestion. “I know several mosques that can convert their additional space into Covid care facilities. This will not only help the needy, irrespective of caste and religion, it will also send a good message to our fellow Indians,” he said. Activist and advocate Salim Yusuf endorsed Mufti Qasmi’s advice to the community and mosques’ management committees. “This is the time we all must do whatever we can to help people. Our hospitals are overburdened and it will help if some of the burden is taken off by community initiative,” said Yusuf. — Mohammed Wajihuddin||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-open-up-sections-of-mosques-for-covid-care-centres-says-cleric/articleshow/82280562.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

Despite warning of strict action for overbilling, the private panel hospitals are not missing any chance to overcharge patients. In a complaint lodged on April 26 last, the complainant had alleged that Rs 3.50 lakh was charged from him as overbilling in the last seven days after which the district administration issued a notice to the management of the hospital on Tuesday after conducting a preliminary inquiry. The preliminary inquiry was conducted by the additional city magistrate (I) and a government doctor and they found the charges true. District magistrate Alok Tiwari on Tuesday ordered to file an FIR against the hospital when its management failed to give a satisfactory reply. According to the district magistrate, the administration has appointed static magistrates and sector magistrates to check overbilling issues in private panel hospitals. Moreover, the administration had already floated mobile numbers for the public to lodge any complaint of overbilling. Earlier in the morning, the district magistrate made a random inspection of the LLR hospital and Neuroscience Covid building and directly communicated with family members of the patients. The kin informed him that their patients were getting good treatment. ADM (city), principal of GSVM medical college, chief medical superintendent and doctors were present during the visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/fir-lodged-against-private-covid-hospital-for-overbilling/articleshow/82281265.cms||---

A division bench comprising justices Ashok Menon and Murali Purushothaman asked state attorney KV Sohan to obtain instructions from the government and director of health services on the issue by April 30. The bench is considering a petition filed by advocate Sabu Thomas alleging that private hospitals and diagnostic centres are charging high prices and is exploiting the pandemic situation and the people’s fear. A tariff was fixed for hospitals and diagnostic centres last year and it should be re-fixed, the petition said. Urgent action is being sought by the petitioner in view of the second wave of the pandemic. Available resources are fast depleting and patients are returning due to lack of resources such as hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators, it is alleged. A majority of the population belongs to middle- and low-income categories and they are deprived of treatment as adequate facilities are lacking in government hospitals while the charges of private hospitals are unattainable, the petition said. The government should ensure that all citizens are able to avail Covid-19 treatment at government or private hospitals, the petitioner demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-seeks-govts-views-on-uniform-rates/articleshow/82280564.cms||---

He had transported 23 Covid-19 patients to various hospitals in Haldwani and ferried 12 bodies to the cremation ground. Depressed and stressed at the constant sight of disease and death that he saw unfold for more than a year, Pandey said he was feeling extremely low and was about to drop due to exhaustion when he spotted a baraat passing by. The sight of festivities and people dancing sparked a sudden joy of life within him and despite the exhaustion, Pandey parked his vehicle and joined in. The sight of a PPE-clad ambulance driver, grooving to the tunes of peppy Bollywood numbers played by band wallahs at a stranger’s wedding procession, soon went viral on social media. In the minute-long video, Pandey, along with ambulance attendant Mohit Kumar and technician Rahul Singh, can be seen dancing with abandon. The incident has also brought into focus the challenging circumstances in which frontline healthcare workers are battling the pandemic. Pandey told TOI that he hasn’t been home for the last 25 days as he is afraid that his kids and wife will get infected as he regularly deals with Covid patients. “When the Covid-19 cases started surging last year, I remained away from my family for six months. I did not want them to get infected because of me. The situation returned to normal around December and I moved back home. The cases started increasing again in April so I have once again left my family. I moved to a rented accommodation to keep my wife and kids safe,” he said. Pandey works with Devbhoomi Ambulance Seva Samiti (a private trust that provides ambulance services to Haldwani town). The organisation employs 25 other ambulance drivers and helpers, who share a tin shed accommodation at the samiti office. The drivers are paid Rs 1,000 per day and on some days, work for nearly 24 hours. They also help bereaved families with setting up pyres and placing bodies on them as help is hard to find at crematoriums. Raj Kamboj, president of the trust, said that they usually work for free but as coronavirus cases had now skyrocketed and government payments were also delayed, they charged a minimal amount to cover petrol costs. “At the tin shed, cots are arranged for the drivers to sleep in. Many of them have not been home in weeks. Some just go outside their homes and wave at their children from afar when they miss them too much,” Kamboj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/stressed-ambulance-driver-clad-in-ppe-shakes-a-leg-at-strangers-wedding-to-beat-covid-blues/articleshow/82279609.cms||Ishita Mishra

Her two accomplice — Gunvant Joshi and Bharat Mehta— are already behind bars in the same case.Police said that Vaishali was arrested by Visavadar police on Monday in connection with a case lodged by Ashok Taraiya, a resident of Visavadar town. He had alleged that Vaishali had fled with Rs 45,000 within a few days of their marriage.“Gunvant and Bharat were arrested five months ago.

---||Pune||Held in jeweller suicide case, woman lawyer falls to death at Sassoon hospital||PUNE: City lawyer Deepti Kale, recently arrested on the charge of abetment in the suicide of jeweller Milind alias Balwant Marathe, died around 4pm on Tuesday after falling from the eighth floor of the Covid care centre at the Sassoon general hospital, where she was being treated under judicial custody. City police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI, “The woman (Kale) was shifted to the Covid care centre after she had tested positive. She visited the washroom and opened the window louvers in a bid to escape but lost balance and fell to her death.” Deputy commissioner of police (Zone II) Sagar Patil told TOI, “We have prima facie concluded that Kale died while trying to escape from the eighth-floor washroom window. Our conclusion is based on the fact that she had removed the window glass louvers and twisted an iron grille in a bid to escape. We suspect she tried to hold on to a pipe to scale down but lost balance and fell. She had gone to the washroom telling the centre’s staffers that she wanted to have a bath and wash her clothes.” Patil said, “We have registered an accidental death case and also an FIR under section 224 of the Indian Penal Code, which refers to escaping from lawful custody.” Additional director-general (prisons) Sunil Ramanand said, “A magisterial inquiry will be conducted to probe the lawyer’s death because she was remanded in judicial custody.” Police said some hospital staffers noticed Kale having fallen down. She had not come out of the washroom for quite some time and the centre’s staffers opened the door fearing something amiss. They found her missing, the louvers removed and the grille twisted. They called the Bund Garden police. DCP Patil said, “There were no eyewitnesses to the fall. A section of the Covid care centre is used for treating inmates in judicial custody. Four policemen have been deployed outside the centre.” Sassoon hospital’s medical superintendent Ajay Taware told TOI, “I received information from the resident medical officer about the woman’s death. The police are investigating and an internal inquiry will also be conducted.” Kale’s lawyer Tosif Shaikh told TOI, “After her arrest on April 17, Kale had filed a written complaint on April 23 before a magisterial court alleging police atrocities against her and that they had forcibly injected her with some medicines. On April 26, she was remanded in magisterial custody and sent to the Covid care centre of the hospital after testing positive.” Shaikh said, “On April 19, Kale’s husband had written to the chief minister stating that his wife apprehended physical danger from the city police. We want a post-mortem done and an investigation by an independent agency.” MCOCA, extortion casesOn Sunday, the city police had invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) provisions against Kale and her aide and followed up by registering a case of alleged extortion against her and two others based on an FIR lodged by the wife of a city-based land developer. Assistant commissioner of police (Swargate division) Sushama Chavan, who took over the MCOCA case probe, told TOI on Tuesday. “Kale’s aide is already in police custody till May 3.” The police claimed that Kale had five cases to her name, including two of attempts to murder, registered with various police stations. The Marathe case investigation revealed that she was running an organised crime syndicate involving some more persons who would also be arrested soon, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/held-in-jeweller-suicide-case-woman-lawyer-falls-to-death-at-sassoon-hospital/articleshow/82281110.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Mumbai||Are crematoriums able to handle the load?: Bombay HC to BMC||MUMBAI: Taking “judicial notice” that furnaces at crematoriums in Mumbai are not in full working condition, the Bombay high court on Tuesday directed the BMC to reply with details of conditions at crematoriums in the city and the number of bodies cremated daily. It also directed the state government to apprise it of measures taken at crematoriums all over Maharashtra. The directions by a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni came while hearing three PILs on the shortage of Remdesivir injections, oxygen, beds and delays in releasing test results. Advocate Simil Purohit urged for the scope of the PIL to be expanded saying crematoriums in Mumbai are unable to handle the current load and this had resulted in hardships to families. He said there are queues outside and few gas/electric furnaces are working. “Every time a Covid body is lying at a crematorium it increases the risk of a spread. There has to be dignity in death,” Purohit said. The judges asked BMC how many gas/electric furnaces are available in Mumbai. “Are there any reports of congestion at crematoriums?” asked the CJ. Justice Kulkarni gave the example of Walkeshwar where the gas furnace is not working and where use is made of the “Indian method with wood and all.” “Why don't you (BMC) take steps to operationalise gas crematoriums?” he asked. The judges also referred to the incident at Beed where Covid bodies were piled up in an ambulance and taken to the crematorium. They said the government will have to institute a mechanism for the state. “It can't be that bodies are lying or awaiting actual cremation at the crematoriums,” said Justice Kulkarni. The CJ added, “There must be alternative arrangement made. If there is no place at crematoriums, you should not be releasing bodies.” While the State's advocate said it’s the duty of the civic body to coordinate with the crematorium, the CJ said, “Don’t try to pass on the buck. Throughout the State all must work hand in hand.” In their order, the judges said, “…we take judicial notice of the circumstance that some of the furnaces are not in proper working condition. BMC’s reply has to indicate “the present condition of the crematoriums that are in operation within its jurisdictional limits, the number of corpses that each of such crematoriums are dealing with daily and all ancillary matters in relation there to.” The State’s reply has to give “facts and figures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-to-bmc-are-crematoriums-able-to-handle-the-load/articleshow/82281127.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Pune||Cops examine connection in two robberies||Pune: The city police are not ruling out the possibility of the involvement of the same group in the Sunday night’s Rs15.8-lakh robbery at a bungalow in Sindh Housing Society in Aundh and a similar incident at a retired teacher’s bungalow at Panchavati in Pashan on March 3. While investigators from the Chatushrungi police are working on clues obtained from the CCTV footage to establish the identity and trace the culprits in the latest incident, they have so far not made much headway. Apart from examining CCTV camera footage, dumb data and other technical aspects, they are examining if the Sunday night’s robbery was the handiwork of someone familiar with the society and its occupants. Senior inspector Rajkumar Waghcaure of the Chatushrungi police said, “There is a possibility that Panchavati and Sindh Housing Society robberies are committed by the same group. The modus operandi in both the incidents is the same, as the robbers chose bungalows where elderly couples were staying. Second, the robbers carried out their crimes in the late evening hours.” The police questioned workers of a construction site in the Sindh Housing Society to check if anyone was missing or some of them had executed the robbery. They have also questioned the security guards on duty when the robbery occurred. “None of the security guards manning the five entry and exit points of the society saw any suspicious activities or the suspects entering or leaving the society premises,” Waghchaure said. “We suspect that someone who knows the society premises and its residents well might have passed on information to the robbers. We are trying to identity him or her,” he added. An analysis of the CCTV footage revealed that the robbers had entered the society premises through an old empty bungalow near the Bremen Chowk in Aundh.  The trio then proceeded straight to the victim’s bungalow, the officer said. “From what is seen in the CCTV footage, we can say that the three persons were aware about the occupants of the bungalow and also its entry points,” said Waghchaure. They entered the society from the Aundh side after scaling the society compound wall and then jumped inside the empty bungalow, Waghchaure added. The TOI on Tuesday had attempted to speak with a few residents of the society. But he residents had refused to comment on the issue. Three masked men, one of them carrying a knife, had barged into the bungalow of a former land developer (76) at Sindh Housing Society on Sunday night and robbed him and his wife (73) of diamond and gold ornaments, cash and US dollars, totally worth Rs15.8 lakh.  The elderly couple have been staying in the bungalow with their cook (44) for the past 35 years. Their son and daughter live in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-examine-connection-in-two-robberies/articleshow/82281095.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Long queues, refusals rule the day as vax stocks run out||Kolkata: Those in the age group of 18 to 44 might be waiting for the Co-Win registration to start from Wednesday so that they can get a shot against Covid at the earliest, those above 45 years continue to be harassed with vaccination centres either not operating or shutting down due to lack of stock. Covid vaccination centres have already started restricting the number of first dose recipients to accommodate more second-dose ones, many of whom found their booked appointments cancelled on Tuesday. “My parents’ second dose of Covishield was due on Tuesday. They went to a private vaccination centre at Dum Dum, but were told the centre had run out of vaccine and asked to come back another day after confirming availability,” said school teacher Sudeshna Basak of Nagerbazar. Uncertainty over vaccine stocks running out next month when it opens up for citizens aged 18 to 44 and a jump in vaccine price have led to the rush for the jab. That many now feel that a dose will be some protection against the pandemic has also added to the queues. “The queues are getting longer. But we have restricted beneficiaries to 300 a day and preference is being given for second dose,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO, Peerless Hospital. Most hospitals have stopped taking appointments from May 1 due to uncertainty over vaccine supply. “We have been flooded with calls from people whose second shot is due after May 1, asking if they will get it at our centre. There is a lot of anxiety over supply from next week,” said a vaccination officer at a private facility. At AMRI Dhakuria, people started lining up since morning and by afternoon, the queue had turned serpentine. But many had to return home without getting the jab as the turnout outnumbered the allotted doses for the day. “People are realising vaccine works and so, the rush. Even a few weeks ago, we had to mobilize people to take the jab. We are giving priority to people whose second dose is due,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhyay of ID Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/long-queues-refusals-rule-the-day-as-vax-stocks-run-out/articleshow/82280563.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The number is also slightly less than the average cases last week. Officials and experts are optimistic, but said any conclusion of a dip in second wave can be confirmed only after monitoring data for one week or more. The district registered 6,287 and 5,852 positive cases on Tuesday and Monday respectively, for a total of 12,139 cases. Daily average of cases for these two days comes to 6,069. On Saturday and Sunday, there were 7,999 and 7,771 cases respectively, for a total of 15,700, and daily average of 7,885. Thus, cases declined by 3,631 in last two days. The district had recorded a new high of cases daily between April 21 and 25. There were 37,828 cases in these five days for a daily average of 7,566. Daily average of cases in last week (April 15 to 21) was 6,650. So, cases in last two days are less than the average of last week, five days of new high, and also the last two days. The number of tests also went down in last two days. There were 41,905 tests in last two days for a daily average of 20,952. On Saturday and Sunday, there were 50,001 tests for a daily average of 25,000. In simple numbers, tests declined by 8,096 in last two days. Daily average of tests in last week (April 15 to 21) was 24,303. After many days, 134 beds with oxygen supply were vacant in private and government hospitals followed by five beds in ICU as per NMC’s evening data. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “There were 85 vacant O2 beds a day ago. We have not reduced testing centres or restricted anyone. NMC’s testing centres are also witnessing decline in people coming for tests for last two days. Cases are stagnant and slightly reduced. All these are positive indicators. But we will have to wait for one week or more to come to a conclusion that district has passed the peak and cases have started to decline.” The civic chief said, “If cases continue to decline, it will also prove that infectivity reduced due to lockdown and restrictions in the city. There are various more things to do. Vaccination is most important and all above 18 years need to get inoculated. Lives can be saved only if over 80% are vaccinated and we achieve herd immunity.” Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “Growth rate has declined in the district. But we will have to wait for one week or another ten days to come to any conclusion. Chances of temporary dampening in cases for two-three days also cannot be ruled out. But we are optimistic seeing decline in growth rate.” Only worry is rise in deaths. The district has recorded 190 deaths in last two days. There were 169 fatalities on Saturday and Sunday. Daily average of deaths in last week (April 15 to 21) was 88. After peak of first wave in last two weeks of August and entire September, cases had started to decline from beginning of October last year. But deaths continued to be high in October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-cases-drop-by-3k-hosps-see-vacant-beds-in-last-two-days/articleshow/82281100.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

We have to participate in online meetings, receive calls and draw up reports, which require focus. Meanwhile, my two sons also attend online classes. My children are often disturbed as me and my husband are on the phone attending meetings. Similarly, we also get disturbed when our children watch television during our work hours,” said Sarita Dhawan, IT employee. Sumaiirah Abdulali, founder of Vaghmi Foundation and director of Safe Road Foundation, who worked on projects aimed at reducing noise pollution levels in the city before the pandemic, said, “There are ‘no honking’ signs in front of schools to ensure that students are not disturbed while they are attending classes, but there is no such provision to ensure that they are not disturbed while they are attending online classes at home. Senior citizens are also greatly affected by the noise at home, with everyone going about their own work. In times such as these, it is important to be mindful of others -- family members, roommates, or even neighbours.” Noise pollution activist Yeshwant Oke, said, “Noise has serious psychological effects, leading to a person losing temper and turning violent.”  Mangesh Dighe, environment officer, Pune Municipal Corporation, said, “There has been a noticeable reduction in traffic-related noise, not just because of decreased number of vehicles on the road but also due to significant increase in electric vehicles.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/noise-source-home-neighbourhood/articleshow/82281118.cms||---

We will certainly take action against them,” Krishna Prakash said, adding, “Exorbitantly overcharging patients is an inhuman act. Taking disadvantage of the situation, the ambulance drivers are charging patients or their relatives under the name of some trust or social organisation.” The Regional Transport Office (RTO) has already fixed the rates of the ambulance service in the district. “All the ambulance providers must follow these rates,” the police commissioner said, adding that there were no charges for taking a body to the crematorium in hearse ambulances in the PCMC limits, but relatives were still made to cough up money for the service. Krishna Prakash said that he also received overcharging complaints against crematoriums’ staffers. “The corporation has appointed agencies for the cremation of Covid-19 patients. These agencies were paid by the corporation. But, still they take money from the relatives. In the rural areas, the relatives had to bear the charges of five cylinders at the crematoriums. They too had to pay more than the actual cost,” Krishna Prakash said. The police commissioner also appealed to the people to alert police if they come across such type of harassment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ambulance-providers-to-face-criminal-cases-for-overcharging/articleshow/82281143.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The Kolkata Municipal Corporation has decided to set up these fast-track vaccination centres to tackle the rush of citizens to get the jab from May 5, when the state begins to vaccinate all adults. After a brainstorming meeting held at the KMC headquarters, it was decided that the civic body would set up large vaccination centres at major auditoriums and community halls owned by KMC. In all, there will be 10 fast-track Covid vaccination centres across the city. The numbers will be augmented if the situation so warrants. It was also decided that these new vaccination centres will be dedicated to the applicants who will be in the age group 18-44, a KMC health department official said. According to a KMC official, the existing vaccination centres across 144 wards were recording heavy footfalls and will be unable to take the additional load from May 1. At present, KMC is running over 100 vaccination centres across the city where around 11,000 citizens are getting vaccinated daily. “The 10 fast-track centres apart, we will also open our community halls in wards to meet the vaccination demand,” a KMC health department senior official said. The KMC is hiring paramedics to run the fast-track centres. A civic official said the civic body was running short of para medical staff to run its existing centres for six hours a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-to-convert-city-auditoriums-into-fast-track-vaccination-centres/articleshow/82280576.cms||Saikat Ray

The state government is trying to help private hospitals that administer vaccines against payment,” the minister said in New Delhi on Tuesday. The functioning of CoWIN app was deliberately disrupted as the state government tries to shove hapless people to private hospitals where the vaccine costs Rs 250, Muraleedharan said. “Why is the government trying to set aside vaccines for the private sector by ignoring the public health system? If those who create problems in the CoWIN app are the agents of private hospitals, why is the government not ready to take action against them? Instead of taking steps to run the system effectively, the Kerala government and CPM are trying to mislead people,” he alleged.

---||Nagpur||Immunity important, don’t delay 2nd vaccine dose, advise doctors||NAGPUR: As cases of Covid-19 keep rising, many people feel delaying their second dose will help them avoid risk of infection at vaccination centres. However doctors say such a decision is nothing short of a ‘blunder’ as vaccine offers the best chance of protection against the virus. Dr Nitin Shinde, well known infectious disease specialist, said people must not even think twice over going for that second jab. “I just don’t think it’s a good idea to delay the second shot, if you are eligible for it. One must wear protection kits (masks etc) while going for vaccination. In fact, at every centre all safety protocols are are being followed anyway, so it really does not make any sense to be overly worried about it,” said Dr Shinde. Dr Sanjay Marathe, an authority in immunization and vaccine research, said delaying the second shot of vaccine will in fact decrease their immunity. “While I understand their concern that during these times, when cases are quite high, there is a fear of getting infected if you step out. But it’s important to remember that the vaccine provides you with a very healthy level of immunity. That second dose will complete your vaccination schedule and almost guarantee that you will not get a severe level of Covid-19 infection,” said Dr Marathe. Dr Shishir Shrivastava, who’s treating many Covid-19 patients at his hospital, said vaccination is our best chance of achieving herd immunity. “We need 70% of our population to develop anti-bodies to achieve herd immunity. Now these anti-bodies can be developed either through vaccination or through infection, and I am sure any sensible person will prefer the former method. Also after two doses you may still get infected, but your chances of getting hospitalized are virtually nil,” said Shrivastava. Dr Sandeep Mogre, who’s running both a Covid-19 hospital and a vaccination centre, said people coming for vaccination will have to take care but that should not be interpretated as ‘dangerous’. “In these times you must consider everyone as Covid-19 positive and take due care. Wear a double mask and face shield as this is one the best protection you can get for yourself at a vaccination centre. But do not even think of delaying the second shot because right now that’s the only protection we know of, that works against the virus,” said Dr Mogre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/immunity-imp-dont-delay-2nd-vaccine-dose-advise-doctors/articleshow/82281132.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Pune||200 sites stay shut amid serious shortage of vax||Pune: Scores of beneficiaries on Tuesday had to return from vaccination sites without their jabs as shortage of doses forced nearly 200 sites in the PMR to stay shut. Sites that had some doses left had to close their sessions early. At the Bindumadhav Thackeray Hospital in Karvenagar, for instance, many who had started to queue up early in the morning had to go back without being given their shots. “There were nearly 300 people in the queue, but only 30 got their jabs. We were among the lucky few,” said Jayashri Sathaye, a senior citizen who had turned up at the Bindumadhav Thackeray Hospital as early as 4am on Tuesday. The shortage of vaccines caused a sharp fall in the day's coverage. Only 30,095 people were covered, compared to the over 78,000 who received their jabs on Monday. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Health services, Pune circle, said, “We did not receive the usual fresh supply on Tuesday. And there's no guarantee there will be supply on Wednesday." On why citizens are not being given updates on vaccine availability — information that could spare them long hours in queues — Deshmukh said their department will get more clarity on vaccine availability, till April 30, from the state government. He said citizens will be given the updates. No supply on Tuesday also meant the PMC and the PCMC now have less than 2,000 doses of Covishield left between them. The Pune rural administration has about 8,276 doses of the vaccine left. Varsha Dange, the PCMC's assistant medical officer, said, “Most of our vaccination sites will be closed on Wednesday due to the vaccine shortages. We tried to get some from the PMC and the Pune rural administration, but they are out of shots too. We have around 2,000 doses of both Covishield and Covaxin left." Pune rural has just over 8,000 doses of the vaccine left in its reserves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/200-sites-stay-shut-amid-serious-shortage-of-vax/articleshow/82281152.cms||Piyush Bhusari

She instructed that the vaccination drive should be expedited and vaccinations should be completed in a time-bound period,’’ revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat told TOI. Thorat said she was keen on availability of emergency medicines and oxygen for needy patients. “I said the state government is trying its level best to provide best available treatment to Covid-19 patients across the state. It said preventive measures have been taken to ensure there is no further surge,’’ Thorat said. He said the state government ensured complete transparency. “Whether on the number of Covid-19 patients or deaths, we are not hiding information. In fact, our information is available to people on a dashboard,’’ Thorat said. He said Maharashtra had achieved a rare distinction of most vaccinations on Monday. On whether the vaccination drive for 18-45 population will be launched from Maharashtra Day, May 1, Thorat said it will be decided by the cabinet on Wednesday. “We are keen, but all will depend on availability of vaccines. We will have to draft a new strategy,’’ he said. Sonia and Rahul Gandhi have said vaccination should be free. If those aged 18-45 are to be vaccinated free, it will cost the state nearly Rs 4,800 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-satisfied-how-mva-handling-covid-pandemic-says-sonia/articleshow/82281177.cms||---

Many said with no online appointments available, they had to stand for hours in long queues outside vaccination sites. Apurv Gaurav, a city-based working professional, said he's been trying to get his parents a slot since March 15. “Our appointment was cancelled twice due to shortage of doses. And no new slots have been available for days now. On Tuesday, when I visited a site in Wagholi, there were over 200 senior citizens in the queue. One person had arrived at 6am. The site had run out of tokens for walk-ins and my parents couldn't get their jabs.” Health department officials said citizens will not see slots unless hospitals activate sessions. “And they can do that only if they have enough doses,” one official said. There are some technical reasons too. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director of Bharati Hospital, said, “Half of the doses a private hospital gets are reserved for online appointments. The rest are for walk-ins. A CoWIN session is published based on how many doses we have for those booking appointments.” He added, “Once appointments are booked, a session will not show under the PIN code entered on CoWIN. On Sunday, we got 100 Covishield doses. We published a session on CoWIN at 9pm that night and within 10 minutes, all slots were booked. That is the reason why a centre stops showing up under a PIN code search, as slots are booked in a matter of minutes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccination-slots-become-scarce-across-the-region/articleshow/82281147.cms||Neha Madaan

Her “alcoholic” son Ajay, a labourer, refused to turn up for her last rites and her daughter Manju, who wanted to perform the rituals, had no money to visit Shahjahanpur from Powayan area of the district where the family lived. The body lay at the mortuary of Shahjahanpur medical college, where she was admitted on April 21 and died two days later. Ajay had got his mother admitted to the district hospital after she was referred from Powayan CHC, but was turned away as soon as she tested positive for Covid-19. “My brother is an alcoholic and refused to come for the last rites of our mother fearing Covid infection. My mother used to love him the most, but he had hurt her even after her death,” said Manju. Amid such circumstances, a local journalist, Mirazuddin Khan, 42, who has been reporting from the hospital for his private news portal, came to know about the matter and with the help of an ambulance driver pooled in money and got the woman's last rites performed by her daughter on Tuesday. Khan said, “When I contacted the woman’s son, he refused to come for the cremation because of the infection. His younger sister agreed, but she didn’t have the money. Then an ambulance driver, Veeru Kumar, and I collected money and ensured that the final rites of the woman were completed in the presence of her daughter.” “My brother did not come, but I got many brothers here. They ensured that the last rites of my mother were performed following the rituals so that the departed soul could rest in peace,” Manju told TOI after performing the last rites at Garrah cremation ground in Shahjahanpur. Chief medical superintendent Dr UP Sinha said, “The woman’s son didn’t turn up after her death on April 23 fearing that he would get the infection. On Tuesday, however, her daughter claimed the body. She was having financial difficulties, but was helped by locals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/son-refuses-to-cremate-covid-ve-mothers-body-journalist-ambulance-driver-help-daughter-cremate-her-4-days-after-death/articleshow/82278946.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Madurai||HC agrees to hear plea on closure of Tasmac shops||Madurai: The Madras high court has agreed to hear a plea which sought to close all the Tasmac liquor shops due to increase in Covid-19 cases in the state. On Tuesday morning, an advocate made a mention before the HC Madurai bench seeking to bring an urgent motion to hear a public interest litigation to close all the Tasmac liquor outlets. After the advocate’s mention, a division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi agreed to hear the plea. The public interest litigation filed by B Ramkumar Adityan, an advocate who is the resident of Tuticorin district, is likely to be taken up for hearing this week. In the petition, the petitioner stated that after the steady decline in Covid-19 cases for about five months, the number of people infected with Covid-19 is increasing in several parts of the country including Tamil Nadu. People gathering in large numbers during election campaigns and rallies organised by the political parties without following Covid-19 protocol was also a reason for the increase in cases. He stated that the state government had imposed several restrictions such as night curfew and complete lockdown on Sundays. However, there was no restriction imposed for the functioning of Tasmac shops, except for orders to close the bars and permitting retail sale of liquor. The petitioner stated that WHO says consumption of alcohol increases the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, one of the most severe complications of Covid-19. Hence, there is a need to impose a ban on the sale of liquor for the next few months. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-agrees-to-hear-plea-on-closure-of-tasmac-shops/articleshow/82281154.cms||---

The court was hearing a petition filed by A Papanasam, father of the deceased youth P Muthu Mano, 27, who sought a CB-CID probe into the incident. He sought to perform an autopsy by a team of two doctors having masters degree in forensic medicine and as per the norms laid down by a division bench of this court and to videograph the entire process. He also sought to invoke sections under SC/ST Act against all the accused and sought to invoke Section 176(1)(A) of CrPC so as to enable the judicial magistrate to inquire into the incident. The petitioner further sought to initiate departmental action against the prison officials. When the case was taken up for hearing on Tuesday, the additional advocate general (AAG) K Chellapandian submitted that all the prayer sought for by petitioner in this petition has already been complied with. He submitted that the case was transferred to CB-CID, sections under SC/ST Act were invoked, all the accused arrested and six prison officials suspended. The AAG further submitted that though postmortem was performed on April 24 by following all the norms, the relatives are yet to receive the body from the Tirunelveli Government Medical Ccollege Hospital. In response, the petitioner’s counsel submitted that he had already advised the relatives to receive the body and perform the funeral. He also sought the court to monitor the progress of investigation in this case. Recording the submissions, justice G Ilangovan adjourned the case to June for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/state-to-hc-pleas-in-petition-abided-by/articleshow/82281146.cms||---
---||Nagpur||TTEs to double up as Covid volunteers||NAGPUR: After asking the train ticket examiners (TTEs) for working in special squads aboard crowded trains and later doing a U-turn, the South East Central Railway (SECR) has now asked their TTEs to double up at the vaccination centre set up by the NMC on Kamptee Road. Due to their nature of work, many TTEs and their family members are turning positive. On April 15, the SECR commercial department had chalked out a special ticket checking program aboard overcrowding trains. However, it was withdrawn later amid criticism. Now, the TTEs have been deputed at the ongoing vaccination drive at Mangal Mandap on Kamptee road. From Tuesday, two TTEs have been asked to report to the assistant divisional medical officer (ADMOs) to assist them at the centre. Some of the TTEs who have been asked to report to the vaccination centre are also doing their routine checking duties. Being frontline staff, TTEs are becoming more vulnerable to Covid-19. Yet, they are being posted at sensitive places. This is despite the DRM office remaining closed as many employees turning Covid positive. Senior divisional commercial manager (SrDCM) Vikas Kashyap said, “I don’t see any problem in the issue. It is our social responsibility to help the nation and people at the time of crisis.” However, the ticket checking association members say, “Why only TTEs? We are ready to do our routine duty. What purpose does it solve posting us at vaccination centres where already RPF men are there to manage things? The department somehow wants us to be on move,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ttes-to-double-up-as-covid-volunteers/articleshow/82281151.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Presidency University students extend helping hand with data on Covid hospital beds, oxygen||KOLKATA: Domjur’s Suman Ghosh and Rahara’s Shreyash Ghoshal are grateful to Presidency University students for helping them in their hours of crisis. A helpdesk formed by the students provided them with all the information when Suman struggled to get verified numbers to procure oxygen for his mother and Shreyash looked for a hospital bed for a Covid-positive relative. Suman’s mother is now doing better, thanks to the timely help from the group. “My mother’s oxygen saturation level had dropped to 87. This helpdesk gave me the leads. Though ma is still weak, the critical phase is over. I am extremely grateful to this group,” Suman said. Shreyash’s relative was in home isolation. “Covid paranoia had gripped him so badly that he took a lot of cough syrup. This increased his sugar level, leading to immediate need for hospitalization. A friend told me about the helpdesk. With numbers provided by them, my relative was hospitalized on Sunday and is recovering from Covid now,” said the 19-year-old student from Rahara. Coming to the rescue of hundreds of people, desperately seeking help for their Covid-positive relatives, 156 students at Presidency University have formed a helpdesk to provide updated and verified information on hospital beds, oxygen cylinder, ambulance, plasma banks/donors, medicine, food and quarantine centers. The main aim of their Facebook page—Covid Helpdesk by Presidency—is to collect, verify and share the information, maintaining a proper database among the people of Bengal . Nilotpal Sarkar, who is part of the administration of this group, which includes with Debnil Paul, Tanmay Sarkar, Debkanya Sengupta, Sriroopa Dutta, Kaushiki Dutta Chaudhary, Suryadeep Karmakar and Moubani Biswas, said it was the brainchild of Presidency University Students’ Union. “We were there to help the Amphan-ravaged Sunderbans. We coordinated with locals to help distribute kits containing masks, sanitizers and books,” said Nilotpal, a PG-I student of life science. Director Srijit Mukherji, an alumnus of the university, shared an online post n this group, along with the numbers of four volunteers. “I am proud of them. Many other colleges, organisations and individuals are doing this, cutting across political colours, institutions and ages. I am wishing all the best to Presidency’s helpdesk,” he said. “The members are mainly SFI students. We got help from SFI students outside our university. We got in touch with DYFI volunteers from Dum Dum, Rajarhat, Barrackpore, Kalyani, Barasat and Bidhanagar for information. We also shared their contacts with those in need in those areas,” Sarkar said. The Facebook page has 2.6 K members. Any post uploaded on the page is first verified by the administrators or trustworthy organisations. Yet, challenges remain since the ongoing crisis is so huge that the resources are getting exhausted by the second.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/presi-students-extend-helping-hand-with-data-on-cov-hosp-beds-oxygen/articleshow/82280583.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Doctors at the Covid CHC under Narauli police station in Chandausi, set up a special "labour room" for the patient where she delivered two healthy girls.  team of three doctors put out a statement that said, “The woman, in her 30s, was admitted to the hospital in its emergency unit with oxygen saturation of 87 a day before, and was put on oxygen support, following which it went up to 97”. At about 4 am on Tuesday, she went into labour and delivered in the specially arranged ‘labour room’."Dr Khilendra Saxena, who works at the Narauli CHC, said, “The doctors under the supervision of Dr Vishwas Agarwal, attended to the woman. All precautionary measures and Covid guidelines were followed in the emergency room during the time of delivery. She gave birth to twins. The first child was healthy and normal. The second child, who was delivered after a few minutes, had some breathing complications initially and was given oxygen but she improved later. Both infants are healthy now and Covid-free. It was a normal delivery.”Official sources said that since the woman is still Covid-positive, she was shifted back to the Covid ward. Dr Manoj Junabai, nodal officer, Covid-19, Sambhal, told TOI, “It is not necessary that if the mother is Covid positive, then her child will be too. However, as a precautionary measure, the babies will again be tested for Covid-19 two days later. As of now, they have been separated from the mother and handed over to family members.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/covid-woman-delivers-healthy-twins-in-facilitys-makeshift-labour-room/articleshow/82278962.cms||Maria Khan

---||Aurangabad||2 new insect species discovered in Western Ghats at Satara||AURANGABAD: Two new species of damselfly have been discovered in the Satara district — in the northern part of the Western Ghats. It was a dream come true for a group of researchers from Maharashtra and Kerala who have discovered the new species of damselfly, commonly known as torrent darts — large insects belonging to genus Euphaea. Named Euphaea thosegharensis and Euphaea pseudodispar, the newly discovered damselflies are endemic to the Western Ghats. Shriram Bhakare, who was part of the research team, said the two species were probably overlooked in the past for their superficial similarity to other Euphaea species found in the Western Ghats. “The newly discovered damselflies are distinguished by their external features and colouration. Both new species are restricted to the high elevation streams and riparian patches of the Satara district around Thoseghar and Kaas lake in Maharashtra,” he said. Besides Bhakare, the research team included honorary wildlife warden Sunil Bhoite and Pratima Pawar from Satara along with Kalesh Sadasivan and Vinayan Nair from the TNHS Odonate Research Group (Trivandrum). The discovery has been published in the recent issue of ‘Journal of Threatened Taxa’. Euphaea thosegharensis, which has received the nomenclature after the place Thoseghar, located around 26km from Satara, is similar to Euphaea cardinalis, but the upper part of hind legs of the new specie is black while it is red in E. cardinalis. E. pseudodispar is very similar to E. dispar, but is differentiated easily by the absence of yellow patch on the legs. “So far, only three endemic species of Euphaea are known in the Western Ghats. The new discovery of two more species highlights the need for more systematic survey of damselflies and dragonflies among other odonates in the northern Western Ghats,” Bhoite said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-new-insect-species-discovered-in-northern-part-of-western-ghats/articleshow/82278965.cms||Prasad Joshi

People can call the number printed on the posters on the autorickshaw to avail the free service. These autorickshaws are not driven by drivers who carry a licence. “We offered to pay them, but they declined. So we give them food, fill fuel, have breakfast together and help them in kind,” he said.

---||Nagpur||Protected myself for over a year of pandemic, mask slipped once & the virus pounced on me||NAGPUR: I have developed over 8,600 antibody titer from vaccination against Covid. My oxygen saturation level and chest scan score were like an 18-year-old on April 15. I followed all Covid protocols since the pandemic began a year ago. On April 9, I was on a round in the Covid ICU and my mask with silicon lining slipped due to sweating. Around five to six days later, I tested positive for the first time in this pandemic. This was the only inadvertent lapse on my part which allowed the virus to attack me. Thanks to Covid vaccination, I was saved from severe diseases. Initially, I had a mild soar throat. Next day, mild body pain followed by high grade fever made me sick. The intensity of the pain too increased on the third day. All biochemistry, including inflammatory markers, were normal with CT scan score of 1. From the fourth day, I had no symptoms, fever or pain and had a sense of well-being. On April 22, the fresh CT scan show score increased to 6. On April 24 morning, the eighth day of the symptom onset, I experienced bradycardia (low heart rate). After bradycardia, I did routine biochemistry with inflammatory markers and cardia enzyme, ECG, echo. All were normal except sinus bradycardia in ECG. My senior pulmononary medicine friends Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, Dr Milind Bhursundi, Dr Nirmal Jaiswal, Dr Mahesh Fulwani and Dr Mahesh Sarda debated whether I should start Remdesivir and other aggressive management. But it was decided to continue only with multivitamin and vitamin C with strict monitoring of oxygen, heart rate and respiration. I repeated the CT scan on April 26 which came to be more or less same at 7. This proved that our collective decision not to take Remdesivir was correct. I have now resumed work from home with the social meeting app taking stock of patient care at GMCH. I must once again thank the immunization programme which prevented the severity of Covid. Thanks to senior buddies who supported my decision not to start the anti-viral course. I would say all must take the vaccine. It is effective and safe. Continue with all precautions like mask, hand hygiene and distancing. This should be part of your personality. Sleep hygiene, a balanced diet, regular exercise, a positive attitude and rational use of investigation and modern medicines hold the key in the fight against Covid.

---||Patna||Bihar lacks tankers to procure daily quota of liquid oxygen: Govt to HC||PATNA: The state government on Tuesday admitted before the Patna high court that it was unable to procure even the Centre’s daily quota of 194 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen due to the lack of cryogenic tankers.  A division bench of the high court, while hearing a batch of three PILs on Covid-19 crisis in state, directed the government to first make arrangements to procure the entire daily quota of liquid oxygen to help patients undergoing treatment against the virus in hospitals. The state government is presently procuring 60 to 80 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen daily from various industrial plants outside Bihar. The high court also came to know about the oxygen crisis in hospitals when IGIMS director himself had complained of severe crisis of oxygen at his hospital for treatment of Covid-19 patients. The IGIMS director was one of the nine initial complainants, who wrote to the high court through its special email address, rgphccovidcomplain@gmail.com, about the oxygen crisis, urging the court solve the issue as soon as possible. The email has been issued by the high court on Monday for common people to inform its administration if anyone is denied admission in hospitals due to oxygen crisis or other issues so that the authorities concerned could be directed to sort out the problem. Meanwhile, looking at the severe condition of Covid-19 in state, the high court decided to hear the PILs daily so that the state be directed to take immediate steps for handling the crisis. It once again directed the state to increase the daily RT-PCR testing rate. It also asked why RT-PCR test reports were coming after four to five days of sample collection. The court also expressed surprise over the state’s submission that it takes less time to give RT-PCR report if the sample is positive while the reports of those tested negative take more time to come. The court observed that not a single dedicated bed for Covid-19 patients has been increased between April 22 and 27 in Bihar, showing that lots of work need to be done by the state government for increasing the facilities, including at IGIMS and PMCH in Patna. Besides, the bench orally directed the state to explore the possibility of transforming the private hospitals, which have only limited beds for Covid patients, into a dedicated facilities for people fighting against the virus. The high court also asked the state to reply how patients in home isolation could be provided with oxygen when required. The bench directed the state to take stern action against any black-marketeer or hoarder of medical oxygen or medicines. It also directed the government to invoke Bihar Medical Service Institution and Person Protection (Amendment) Act, 2014 against those attacking or harassing doctors or paramedics amid this crisis situation. Meanwhile, the court was apprised about formation of a central government committee comprising two heads of the departments of AIIMS-Patna and a regional director-ranked officer for monitoring the Covid-19 situation in Bihar and providing all necessary assistance. Additional solicitor general KN Singh represented the Centre while senior counsel of the Supreme Court, Ranjit Kumar, along with additional advocate general Anjani Kumar, appeared for the state. Binay Kumar Pandey represented AIIMS-Patna while Sumeet Kumar Singh appeared for one of the three petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-lacks-tankers-to-procure-daily-quota-of-liquid-oxygen-govt-to-hc/articleshow/82280557.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Pune||Fortnight delay in 2nd jab ‘shouldn’t be a problem’||Pune: Central health officials on Tuesday said there’s no need to worry if the second dose of the vaccine is delayed by a fortnight (even after set intervals).Thousands of citizens are due for their follow-up shots amid vaccine shortages. Experts said a longer wait will not hurt. “Second dose should be as per schedule. But because of some unavoidable circumstances, people can push it by a fortnight even. We should not crowd vaccination sites out of worry,” a central health official said. Dr T Jacob John, clinical virologist and former professor of Christian Medical College, Vellore, said the two-dose schedule ensures best possible protection. “The first shot is a primer. The second one dose is the booster. In ideal circumstances, if the second shot does not come at the appointed time one need not worry. It’s safe even if it is delayed by a year — you don’ t have to take a first dose again. But in the current situation, because of the high rate of spread, we should take the second dose on time, or at the earliest,” he said.In Maharashtra, 1.49 crore people have been vaccinated against Covid; 21.39 lakh from this number have received both doses. Covaxin has an interval of 28 days. Covishield can be taken after a gap of six to eight weeks. In the UK, studies of Oxford-AstraZeneca trial trial data (the Covishield vaccine in India) have said it's okay to push the interval to 12 weeks. Dr D Prabhakaran, from the Public Health Foundation of India , said small delays due to vaccine scarcity should not be a problem. He said, “One or two weeks, here or there, should not be an issue. There have been some instances of infection even after half or full vaccination. But the symptoms have been mild. So what is important is, we all take the vaccine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fortnight-delay-in-2nd-jab-shouldnt-be-a-problem/articleshow/82281161.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Hopefully, a mechanism to address the current impasse in liquor sales would be ready by next month, said Bevco CMD Yogesh Gupta. Following the recommendations of the all-party meeting chaired by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday, the government has ordered the closure of bars and Bevco liquor outlets for an indefinite period from Tuesday. “We are not sure when the supply chain could be restored and fully. Hence, we are working out several options, including home delivery of liquor. It’s not easy to establish a fool-proof home delivery system in short notice. It also needs the political approval and much more. We are weighing several options to tide over the crisis,” Gupta said. The corporation is also toying with the idea of bringing back into force the controversial BevQ mobile app, introduced during the last lockdown period for queue management through pre-booking in the virtual queue system. “The home delivery option would require large-scale technology intervention. It would require real-time update of stock in every Bevco outlet and much more. The service of a technically sound aggregator is a must. It would also need to work out tie ups with agencies that can manage the logistics. Moreover, it would require changes in the existing excise policy and political clearance. In short, the road to home is bumpy,” said a senior official with the Bevco. Though there were plans to get liquor delivered at doorstep, the proposal did not get the government clearance due to widespread criticism. Meanwhile, excise minister T P Ramakrishnan said the government has not discussed the home delivery proposal yet.

Besides, 151 people succumbed to the infection in the past 24 hours, taking its toll to 12,608. The region added 8,988 new cases on Tuesday, which took its tally above 8 lakh to 8.08 lakh. Of the new cases, as many as 3,871 were recorded in the PMC limits and 1,985 in the Pimpri Chinchwad areas.

The total recoveries in PMR are expected to cross 7 lakh-mark on Wednesday, with the total rising to 6.99 lakh in the last 24 hours. Lower daily case tally, experts said, could be attributed to lesser testing in the PMR. Till Sunday, over 40,000 tests were being conducted in the region on daily basis. On Sunday, however, testing decreased to 31,272 and the tally stayed at 33.665 on Tuesday. The PMC checked about 16,650 samples on Tuesday, while the rural and PCMC areas conducted over 3,000 and 2,770 tests, respectively. The region’s total testing has now reached up to 39.19 lakh. Health officials said the positivity rate, which had dropped below 20% on Monday, increased to 26.7% on Tuesday.

---||Pune||Case doubling rate surges to 52 days in PMC limits, further rise in sight||PUNE: The case doubling rate of Covid-19 has increased to 52 days in April as against 11 days in March in the Pune municipal limits, indicating that the mitigation measures employed by the authorities worked. The doubling rate indicates the time taken to double the number of Covid-19 cases in a particular area. A higher doubling rate means that the disease spread is happening at a slower pace. “The increase in doubling rate can be attributed to restrictions on movement of people and the restrain shown by the citizens themselves,” senior PMC official Sanjeev Wavare told TOI. PMC officials said the rate had dropped considerably after a rapid rise in cases from February-end. A similar trend was also seen during the peak in September 2020. The civic and district administrations had introduced restrictions during that time too, helping in improving the case doubling rate. “The current strain is more infectious, due to which the doubling rate dropped. Covid restrictions and other measures have worked in favour of reducing the spread. The impact is visible now. These steps have increased the doubling rate to 52 days,” a senior PMC official said. The PMC officials said vaccination also played an vital role in controlling the spread, with 4 lakh people immunised in the PMC limits. “Almost 90% of the total frontline and healthcare workers have taken the shot. These people are directly in contact with the Covid-19 patients. This too has worked in favour of increasing the case doubling rate,” another civic health official said. “The human-to-human transmission has come down due to reduced contact among people since the strict measures were adopted. We may see further rise in the doubling rate in the coming days,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/case-doubling-rate-surges-to-52-days-in-pmc-limits-further-rise-in-sight/articleshow/82281187.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||46% drop in Aurangabad city’s active patient tally since April 10||Aurangabad: The total number of active Covid cases has almost halved within the municipal limits of the Aurangabad city in just about a fortnight. The city had 9,225 active Covid cases on April 10. By April 15, the number had dropped to 8,576. The active case count further fell to 4,948 by April 26, showing more than 46% drop since April 10. The significant drop has eased the burden on the health machinery to some extent and also addressed the bed-availability problem. Dr Neeta Padalkar, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) health officer, on Tuesday attributed the drop in the number of active cases to ramped-up Covid testing and the vigorous vaccination drive among other efforts. “The civic administration is ensuring 4,000-6,000 daily Covid tests within the municipal limits. Meanwhile, more than 2 lakh vaccines have been administered as a part of the mega-vaccination drive. These factors are helping limit the number of fresh infections,” she said. The health authorities added that the stringent curbs, which have been in place since the night of April 14, have restricted public movement. This too has played a part. Of 4,948 active patients in Aurangabad city, 1,498 are in home isolation and 1,450 are admitted to private hospitals. Another 1,250 patients are in the Covid care centres, reveals the official data. Meltron Hospital, which is serving as a DCHC, has 330 patients, while the Aurangabad GMCH and the district civil hospital — both serving as DCHs — have 300 and 120 patients, respectively. On Monday, the city had reported 497 fresh cases making it the second consecutive day with fewer than 500 new patients. However, cities like Nashik and districts like Satara, Solapur and Sangli have been recording a spike in active Covid cases. The number of active cases in Nashik city increased by almost 30% in about a week. The case-count, which was hovering around 21,000 between April 8 and 18, went up to 27,700 in the next seven days. Between April 8 and 18, the gap between the number of fresh cases reported daily and the number of patients recovering had reduced significantly. Now that gap has again increased. Among the four western Maharashtra districts, Satara has the highest number of active patients. Currently, there are more than 15,000 active cases here. Meanwhile, Solapur district has more than 12,000 active cases and has so far recorded over 6,000 deaths. Sangli, the smallest in the four districts, also has over 10,000 active patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/46-drop-in-aurangabad-citys-active-patient-tally-since-april-10/articleshow/82278981.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: With results out in a day, 4.9k MBBS grads to fight Covid||Nashik: As many as 4,923 fresh MBBS graduates will be available for 40 government and private medical colleges and hospitals across the state as the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) has declared the final-year MBBS winter 2020 exam results on Monday — a day after the completion of the practicals. These MBBS graduates will now start the mandatory one-year internship in these medical college hospitals (MCHs), which will enable these institutes to deploy them for treatment of Covid patients. MUHS has sent the list of successful examinees to the state directorate of medical education and research. While the theory exams took place between March 8 and 24, the practicals took place between March 30 and April 25. A total of 5,152 students had appeared for the exam. MUHS controller of examinations Ajit Pathak told TOI that since there is a huge need for frontline health workers in government and private medical colleges and hospitals, the varsity took up the challenge of declaring the results as soon as possible. “Under the rules, the results have to be declared within 45 days of the completion of the exam. But we could declare the results within a day as we had planned in advance to declare the results fast due to the Covid situation in the state,” said Pathak. According to him, the assessment of the answer scripts began in 32 medical colleges immediately after the exams kicked off on March 8. “The evaluators, who treat patients at the MCHs, took out time from their busy schedule and checked the answer scripts,” added Pathak. Acting vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar, varsity registrar Kalidas Chavan and the varsity’s Board of Examinations guided through the process to declare the results early, added Pathak. N S Arvikar, the dean of Dr Ulhas Patil Medical College and Hospital in Jalgaon, said some medical colleges and hospitals are short of interns to treat Covid patients. “It’s a boon for all these institutes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-results-out-in-a-day-4-9k-mbbs-grads-to-fight-covid/articleshow/82282205.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Goa||As Goa’s healthcare system crumbles,patients battle more than just virus||PANAJI: While health officials blame Covid-19 deaths on people reaching hospitals late, citizens have a different story to tell. They say that the overwhelmed healthcare system not only releases their test results late, but also leaves them waiting for hours in casualty wards when their symptoms worsen. In addition to this, they wait in hope to get a hospital bed. In one such instance, a senior citizen who had been waiting for his RT-PCR result turned breathless and had to be rushed to hospital. His daughter, Rima, said his results came five days after he had taken the test and three days after he was admitted to hospital. “He initially assumed he had gotten the common cold as he had eaten a cold dessert, and began taking paracetamol. Every time we inquired about his test result, those concerned told us it would come. The infection ultimately reached his lungs and he had a bad CT score,” Rima told TOI. Unfortunately, family members who were unaware of the senior citizen’s status and tried to help him, also ended up contracting the virus. Although he was taken to the North Goa district hospital and put on oxygen, just four hours had passed when the hospital’s authorities told the family to shift him to the GMC owing to a shortage of beds. “After making a few calls at the GMC, were were able to get him into the casualty ward where a CT scan was done and hospitalisation at the South Goa district hospital was recommended,” Rima said. “He waited for almost three hours for the ambulance to take him from GMC to the South Goa district hospital as only one patient in allowed in an ambulance at a time. By the time he was admitted, it was past 4am.” A doctor told TOI that beds cannot be freed up on time at the South Goa district hospital as ambulances that transfer patients from there to a step-down facility like the ESI hospital, take time to arrive, leaving patients waiting for hours. Another health official said there is intense pressure on the ambulance service as it has to attend not only to Covid-19 patients but also to non-Covid cases. In a similar incident, a young man who was Covid-positive with high fever went to the GMC at around 9.30am and after getting a CT scan done, was recommended hospitalisation at the South Goa district hospital. “I was sent there at 1pm in an ambulance but had to wait for four hours in casualty for a bed to be freed,” he told TOI. He said that although he had contacted a doctor at a private hospital for a bed and was put on the waiting list, he hadn’t yet received a call. What’s more is that he received his RT-PCR report three days into home isolation, when his fever began to rise. A mother of two who tested positive but wasn’t being monitored during home isolation by the government doctor concerned, was also referred to the South Goa district hospital casualty by a private doctor when her fever didn’t subside. She got out of the hospital after seven hours feeling worse. “There was a big queue in casualty. There were serious and not too serious cases there, while others were being brought from the GMC. Once I got inside, there was another queue after which a doctor checked my temperature, blood pressure, oxygen levels and told me to do an X-ray. I was then told that the radiologist had gone to Hospicio to conduct a sonography and would be back around 6pm,” she told TOI. “I decided to wait until the radiologist arrived at 730pm. I felt so sick while waiting that I had to go back into casualty and ask for some tablets as my fever was rising. There was a woman who was almost fainting and others more serious than me. It was a very sad scene,” she added. Karen, a Panaji-based citizen, said it was “ridiculous” and “irresponsible” for the government to blame people for coming in late. “When they come in on time, where is the infrastructure for them? Some are waiting for results and don’t know what to do with their symptoms. The government should have foreseen the rise in testing and shouldn’t have let a backlog build up,” she said. A private doctor, on the other hand, suggested rapid antigen testing for symptomatic people so as not to waste time in providing treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-goas-healthcare-system-crumblespatients-battle-more-than-just-virus/articleshow/82282203.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Nagpur||We need to tell God to protect Covid-19 patients, till they receive Remdesvir: High court||NAGPUR: Slamming the Maharashtra government for its failure to provide information about Remdesvir’s supply from the Centre and manufacturers and its district-wise distribution, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Tuesday observed that they “need to tell God to protect Covid-19 patients, till they receive the life-saving injection”. Censuring the government for wasting precious time of the court, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote asked what it was doing to cover the shortfall of 1.13 lakh Remdesvir doses that were not received from April 21-25. “We’re not supposed to tell the government how it should manage the distribution of medicines. Micro-level management is required. Can’t we improve our management by exercising our skills? What’s the difficulty? The government seems to be in a hapless condition and we want results,” the bench said. Citing the Centre’s order on Remdesvir distribution, the judges said it was specific and it ought to be followed in letter and spirit by all states, particularly Maharashtra. “It’s in this regard that we would like to have specific information from the government, which is not forthcoming. There’s no point depending on the Central government. Have you asked the manufacturers to provide data?,” the judges asked government pleader Ketki Joshi, who had a hard time answering their queries. Pointing out a positive development due to the fallout of their April 23 orders, the judges noted that the Central government had made a revised allocation of Remdesvir to 4.35 lakh from April 21-30 after the state applied for an increase in quota, in view of the highest number of cases in entire India. While hearing a suo motu PIL where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed as amicus curiae assisted by Sejal Lakhani, Joshi informed the HC that the government was planning to import Remdesvir from Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Singapore and other countries and that the Centre’s permission was sought. She submitted the chief secretary’s April 22 letter to the Centre’s cabinet secretary, stating that the latter’s response was awaited. The bench then directed assistant solicitor general (ASGI) Ulhas Aurangabadkar to seek instructions from the Centre on this issue. Reminding the respondents of its April 21 order, the judges pointed out that divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar had informed that the government had received bids for its tenders to manufacture Remdesvir and Cipla being the lowest bidder was likely to be considered for supplying two lakh vials. “However till date, no further information has been furnished to this court. We would expect the state to also include specific information in the affidavit to be filed on or before the next date,” the bench said before adjourning the hearing till 2.30pm on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/we-need-to-tell-god-to-protect-covid-19-patients-till-they-receive-remdesvir-hc/articleshow/82281220.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

After conducting a primary search in the area, the shopowner, Manoj Manna (36), of Kasba Peth lodged an FIR. According to the complaint, the said employee was working with the shop for the last five years. In the last three to four days, the shop received gold from four jewellery shops in the vicinity for polishing, the police said.

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra wants 12 crore vaccine doses from SII, Bharat Bio||PUNE: The state government on Tuesday requisitioned 12 crore vaccine doses from Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech for the next six months and sought information from both companies about a monthly supply. State health secretary Pradeep Vyas’s letter addressed to the heads of both pharmas wanted to know the procurement price and availability of the vaccines before starting the next phase of vaccination for the 18-45 age group. “In this context, we would like you to inform us as to how many doses of vaccine you would be in a position to supply to the state every month for the next six months beginning from May,” the letter to both companies said, requesting an early response. State health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday told TOI that they had not received any response yet to the letter from either company. Representatives of both companies were unavailable for their comments. Earlier in the day, Tope said in Mumbai that SII had informed them that their stock was blocked by the central government till May 20 and the pharma company cannot deliver the vials before that date. The health department has submitted a proposal with various options for vaccination, including free doses, import of vaccines, and whether people who can afford it should be told to pay. Tope told TOI that he has spoken to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to make vaccines available free for the poor. The state can expand its vaccination centres to 4,193 immediately to increase coverage, Tope said. “Maharashtra has 2% vaccine wastage. On Monday, 5.24 lakh people were immunised. The country is heading for a massive vaccination drive. Seeing Maharashtra’s performance, the Union government should provide help where required,” he added. State chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Tuesday told TOI that the government will take a final decision on the global tender and pricing for procuring vaccines in the cabinet meeting on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/state-wants-12cr-vax-doses-from-sii-bharat-bio/articleshow/82285610.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Aurangabad||Crime branch arrests 7 for remdesivir black marketing||Aurangabad: The crime branch of the city police in the wee hours of Tuesday arrested seven suspects and busted an inter-district racket involved in illegal sale and supply of remdesivir injections. The accused were found selling each vial for Rs 20,000 to relatives of the patients who were prescribed the injections. The suspects have been identified as Dinesh Navgire (28), Sainath Wahul (32), Ravi Dongre (30) of Bhagyanagar, all from Aurangabad, Sandeep Ragde (32), Pravin Borde (27), Narendra Sable (33) and Afroz Khan. Police have also seized five vials from the suspects in addition to a car and seven mobile phones. Preliminary probe has revealed these vials may have been stolen from the Covid ward at the Jalna civil hospital. Crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav said, “After receiving input from our sources, multiple teams along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials were deployed and the suspects were arrested from Aurangabad and Jalna districts.” The crime branch team first received a tip-off about Navgire and his accomplices providing remdesivir injections without any medical prescription. Accordingly, he was contacted by crime branch constable Vishal Patil posing as a customer and an online advance payment of Rs 20,000 was made to the bank account of the accused. In the wee hours, the suspect contacted Patil and called him near the doctors’ quarters at the Government Medical College and Hospital for handing over the vial. “We laid a trap and nabbed Navgire. During preliminary probe, we found that there is an entire racket that is involved in stealing remdesivir injections from the Jalna civil hospital and selling them illegally at an exorbitant price,” assistant inspector Manojkumar Shinde said. Based on the complaint lodged by FDA official Rajgopal Bajaj, an offence against the suspects has been registered at Begumpura police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/crime-branch-arrests-7-for-remdesivir-black-marketing/articleshow/82278998.cms||Mohammed Akhef

State health secretary Pradeep Vyas’s letter addressed to the heads of both pharmas wanted to know the procurement price and availability of the vaccines before starting the next phase of vaccination for the 18-45 age group. “In this context, we would like you to inform us as to how many doses of vaccine you would be in a position to supply to the state every month for the next six months beginning from May,” the letter to both companies said, requesting an early response. State health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday told TOI that they had not received any response yet to the letter from either company. Representatives of both companies were unavailable for their comments. Earlier in the day, Tope said in Mumbai that SII had informed them that their stock was blocked by the central government till May 20 and the pharma company cannot deliver the vials before that date. The health department has submitted a proposal with various options for vaccination, including free doses, import of vaccines, and whether people who can afford it should be told to pay. Tope told TOI that he has spoken to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to make vaccines available free for the poor. The state can expand its vaccination centres to 4,193 immediately to increase coverage, Tope said. “Maharashtra has 2% vaccine wastage. On Monday, 5.24 lakh people were immunised. The country is heading for a massive vaccination drive. Seeing Maharashtra’s performance, the Union government should provide help where required,” he added. State chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Tuesday told TOI that the government will take a final decision on the global tender and pricing for procuring vaccines in the cabinet meeting on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-wants-12cr-vax-doses-from-sii-bharat-bio/articleshow/82285605.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Venkatesan said that the “Centre can foot the whole bill for vaccine by resorting to additional revenue generation for which the Central government has powers.” He suggested increase in corporate tax, introduction of inheritance tax, wealth taxes and taxes on the super rich.He also suggested scaling up production by involving all state owned medical institutions such as Hindustan Bio tech (Chengalpet), Bastier Laboratory (Nilgiris), BCG Lab (Chennai) and Central Medicine Research Centre (Simla). tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mps-suggestions-on-covid-vax-under-review-by-centre/articleshow/82281216.cms||---

The temporary hospital was virtually inaugurated by chief minister Vijay Rupani on Tuesday. The Covid care hospital near the AM/NS India Hazira manufacturing plant will admit only patients who need oxygen. This facility will be scaled up to a 1,000-bed centre in the near future. “AM/NS India will ensure speedy transfer of patients via ambulances to nearby hospitals in case they require more intensive medical intervention. Keeping in mind the logistics challenges and technical limitations involved in transporting oxygen to the hospitals, the decision was taken to set up this facility, thus ensuring continuous oxygen supply in addition to saving time,” an statement issued by the company read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/250-bed-covid-hospitals-starts-at-hazira/articleshow/82279746.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cops above 50 yrs to work 12 hours, get next day off||Mumbai: As the city in the grip of a second wave of Covid-19, the Mumbai Police has asked its personnel who are above 50 years of age to work 12-hour shifts and then take a day off. The same instructions have been issued to personnel with medical conditions like pregnancy, diabetes, blood pressure, cancer or any life-threatening disease, in addition to two weekly offs, in a circualr issued on Tuesday. The circular also stated that personnel below 50 years of age and without any comorbidities should work 12-hour shifts and take 12 hours of rest. In addition, senior police inspectors should provide accommodation near the police station to personnel who take an hour to reach their homes and grant them two weekly offs so that they can visit their families. The order, signed by joint police commissioner (law & order) Vishwas Nangre Patil, is applicable to all personnel from the rank of constable to assistant sub-inspector. “The new rules will provide major relief for those aged 50 and above and those having comorbidities as it will help reduce the chances of spreading the virus,” said S Chaitanya, deputy commissioner of police (PRO). He added that the force has also been asked to wear double masks and face shields as extra layers of protection, maintain social distancing, use santisers and take all precautions. While the circular has been issued to curb the spread of the virus among Mumbai police personnel and their families, many aged below 50 are not happy with working 12-hour shifts. “It’s very difficult to wear a mask and face shield and do nakabandis and other duties, like take an accused to court not knowing whether he is infected, and get only a 12-hour break? It is not fair,”complained a police constable, requesting anonymity. Last year, Mumbai Police had asked its personnel above 55 years of age and those having comorbidities to stay at home. Now, they tweaked the rules fearing that if a police personnel stays away from work for more than a week and if he dies due to Covid-19, he will not be entitled to the Rs 50-lakh compensation from the state government. In the last one year, 105 Mumbai Police personnel, from constable to ACP rank, have succumbed to Covid and 90% of the aggrieved families have got compensation. Mumbai Police as frontline workers were among the first to receive the vaccination on priority basis. Police officials said that this time, the force is more prepared to tackle any situation as many of them have got inoculated. “Till now 72% of the force has taken the first dose of vaccination, and 35% has taken both doses,” said Rajkumar Watkar, joint commissioner of police (administration). “In the last one month, six cops who had comorbidities and other health issues have died, but the situation is under control. Only one Covid care centre at Kalina police headquarters is operational where 48 patients are currently undergoing treatment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-above-50-yrs-to-work-12-hours-get-next-day-off/articleshow/82281235.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Madurai||Security tightened around Sterlite plant||Tuticorin: Police stepped up security arrangements in and around Tuticorin following Tuesday’s Supreme Court’s directive to reopen the controversial Sterlite copper smelting plant temporarily to produce oxygen to help the country tackle its deepening Covid-19 crisis. Though many organisations warned of protests against the state government’s decision to reopen the sealed copper smelter unit, there was no major opposition on Tuesday. About a dozen villagers staged a protest at Pandarampatti village in the evening and at Pudhu Theru near Therespuram at night. The protesters cleared the place after Tuticorin district superintendent of police S Jayakumar and other police officers held talks with them. They explained to them about the apex court directive for the temporary opening of the plant. Police personnel were deployed at the 11 villages around the city where strong protests were held in 2018. Additional director general of police K Jayanth Murali reviewed the security arrangements on Tuesday. More than 600 police personnel have been deployed for security. It includes 400 personnel from the Tuticorin district police unit and 200 from the neighbouring districts. Police bandobast has been increased at Sterlite plant, Tuticorin district collectorate, the district court and places where the public could assemble. “If needed, the strength can be increased as there is a backup plan to rope in more personnel from other districts,” SP S Jayakumar said. Inspector general of police (in-charge) T S Anbu and SPs G Suguna Singh (Tenkasi) and V Badri Narayanan were also deployed for tight security as many organisations had threatened strong protests if the copper smelter plant was reopened. District collector K Senthil Raj held a series of discussions with officials and stakeholders with regard to the preparatory arrangements that are to be in place before reopening the plant that stopped production in March 2018. The plant was sealed on May 28, 2018, following the riots and police firing on May 22 and 23 that left 14 dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/security-tightened-around-sterlite-plant/articleshow/82281228.cms||---
---||Nashik||Helpline launched for pvt hospitals||Nashik: A helpline has been started by Nashik administration for private hospitals to inquire about the availability of medical oxygen. Additional district collector Dattaprasad Nade has appealed to the owners and management of the private hospitals in Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) and in rural parts of the district to contact on 9405869940. The helpline has been set up in the control room at the district collectorate to address problems related to supply of medical oxygen. “Currently, the number of patients infected by Covid-19 is constantly increasing across the district due to which the number of patients in need of medical oxygen is also increasing continuously,” Nade said. He added that the hospitals should continue taking medical oxygen from their suppliers as usual. The food and drug administration (FDA) has put up a system in place between private hospitals and medical oxygen suppliers so that it is binding to the suppliers to provide oxygen as per the agreed terms. However, owing to the rising number of patients and the medical oxygen in short supply, the hospitals are at times unable to get the oxygen from their suppliers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/helpline-launched-for-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/82279015.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Medical colleges can employ final-year postgraduate doctors||Mumbai: An advisory issued by the National Medical Commission allows medical colleges to use the services of final-year postgraduate doctors (residents), until the fresh batch of first-year students join them. With NEET-PG (for admissions to postgraduate medical courses) postponed indefinitely, medical colleges across the country are likely to face a shortage of doctors in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases. Colleges have been advised to extend accommodation facilities and stipends to these resident doctors till their services are being used. Maharashtra, however, may take a call only after the final-year exams are conducted in June. The tenure of postgraduate doctors completes on April 30. A similar directive also has been issued by the Directorate General of Health Services. The circular stated that the service of the final year PG students should be extended by two months or till the first-year PG students join the institute. A similar circular was issued last year as well. A representative of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors said they are willing to help, but they require 45-day study leave before their exams on June 24. The state can consider using the medical interns and doctors on bond service to fill the shortage, he said. TP Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research, said they will decide on the matter only after final-year PG exam. “Their exams cannot be delayed further,” he said. — Yogita Rao||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-medical-colleges-can-employ-final-year-postgraduate-doctors/articleshow/82282275.cms||---

Stalin also made an appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure that the requirement of Tamil Nadu is met with the production from Sterlite. He said that no injustice should be rendered to the people of Tamil Nadu at this time of crisis.Since the number of Covid-19 cases is on the rise in Chennai and many other places in the state, the demand for oxygen will go up in the days to come. So it would be appropriate only if the state’s demands are met during the crisis, he said.Justifying the reasons for which his party extended consent to reopen the sealed plant at the all-party meeting convened by the state government on Monday, he held the state government responsible for failing to present the facts before the SC properly, resulting in the apex court directing the government to handed over the oxygen produced at Sterlite to the Union government.MDMK general secretary Vaiko criticised the state government for failing to present the facts before the SC and accused it of indirectly facilitating backdoor entry for Sterlite. “It is a big injustice for Tamil Nadu,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/state-govt-draws-flak-for-not-presenting-facts-before-sc/articleshow/82281230.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Long queues for oxygen tell different story||NEW DELHI: Anil Goswami stood with hundreds of others in a serpentine queue at Mohan Cooperative Industrial Estate for over three hours on Wednesday. With a large cylinder by his side, the Sangam Vihar resident fretted at the slowness of the line’s progress, knowing his mother’s oxygen saturation level was declining at home. Many would sympathise with Goswami, wracked with worry but unable to do anything in a hurry to alleviate his mother’s distress. Despite Delhi government asserting that oxygen availability had improved in the city now and Delhi high court directing the streamlining of oxygen distribution, there were reports on Wednesday of avenues of oxygen, especially in industrial areas like Mayapuri and Naraina, having shut down. With hospital beds almost impossible to get, oxygen at home is a desperate gamble in saving lives. At the refilling station in Mohan Estate, Usman Chaudhary, an AC repairman who had come from Okhla after spending the whole day trying to get access to the gas, said defeatedly, “The crowd here is too large. I cannot risk wasting time here as my friend’s father gasps for life. I will go search elsewhere.” He placed the empty cylinder on his scooter and revved away. Kabir Nagar resident Jameeluddin rolled the iron cylinder with his foot. “The gas situation has worsened, there are no options we can rely on. And now we hear police will not allow refills without the district magistrate’s permission,” he said, desperation clear in his voice. “My brother's oxygen level is at a precarious level, but no hospital is admitting him. Where should I go now?” The desperation has an edge of anger to it. Gaurav Bhatia, a businessman from east Delhi’s Geeta Colony, has been distributing cylinders to friends and neighbours. “The government insists we treat Covid patients at home. But without oxygen, how is that possible?” he bristled. “While we have helped 120 people in the past two weeks, now the situation is dire. Refilling takes hours, from 11am to almost 5pm because refilling stations at Mayapuri and Naraina have been closed.” Bhatia resented that ambulances and hospitals were being given preference at oxygen stations. “Those with a single cylinder should be catered to first rather than ambulances that are bringing scores of cylinders,” he said. The crowd intimated Shobhit Rawat of Vasant Kunj so much that he left as soon as he arrived. “I cannot risk infection by being so close to so many people,” he said and disappeared with his small cylinder. Very few expressed satisfaction at Okhla. Shoaib, a student from Jaffrabad, was one of the few exceptions. “This gas is for my mother. Her SPO2 level is hovering at 70. I am happy that after hours of standing in the sun, I have finally got my cylinder refilled.” His elation was shared by Ashima Sarkar of Ambedkar Nagar who got her cylinder after three hours. “People are needlessly panicking. If they are patient, they will get a refill,” she philosophised. Many other sources of oxygen in the city have dried up. At Batla House and Shaheen Bagh, the crowds are missing. “Just a few days ago, hundreds were coming here throughout the day for refills, but now it is becoming difficult for us to procure oxygen,” admitted Shariq Husain, a Batla House resident, who was providing free refills. “Around 450 people came here from Delhi and western UP. Now we cannot get the oxygen from UP and Faridabad.” Bhogal resident Gurvinder Singh had also started his free service, Oxygen Seva, funded by contributions from people of Punjab.  “We got nine cylinders of 70kg each and have benefitted over 30 patients who came and used the cylinders in Bhogal market,” said Singh. But the do-gooder regretted that he had had to terminate operations for lack of oxygen availability. “We plan to restart helping people at Damdama Sahib Gurdwara where there is enough space for people to gather,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/o2-situation-is-improving-tell-this-to-them/articleshow/82299347.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Chandigarh||NIA files charges against 8 KLF terrorists||Mohali: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday filed a charge sheet against eight terrorists of the outlawed Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) for their alleged involvement in the murder of Shaurya Chakra awardee Comrade Balwinder Singh Sandhu. Sandhu, who fought terrorism in Punjab, was shot dead at his residence-cum-school in Tarn Taran on October 16, 2020, by two unidentified men. A case was registered in this regard at Bhikhiwind police station in Tarn Taran on October 16, 2020. NIA had re-registered the case on January 26, 2021 after taking up the investigation. The charge sheet was filed before a special NIA court in Mohali under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Arms Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. It names eight persons, all from Punjab, as accused — Inderjit Singh alias Inder of Rashiana village in Tarn Taran; Sukhraj Singh alias Sukha and Gurjit Singh alias Bhaa of Lakhanpal; Sukhdeep Singh alias Bhura of Kharal and Sukhmeet Pal Singh alias Sukh of Bhikhariwal in Gurdaspur district; Ravinder Singh alias Ravi Dhillon of Hussainpura, Akashdeep Arora alias Dhaliwal of New Janakpuri in Salem Tabri, Jagroop Singh of Karamsar Colony in Ludhiana district. The NIA investigation has revealed that Comrade Sandhu’s murder was executed with the intent to strike terror in the minds of people of India, especially those opposed to Khalistani ideology. The transnational conspiracy in the instant crime was hatched by Pakistan-based self-styled chief of KLF Lakhvir Singh Rode and top foreign-based KLF terrorists who provided arms/ammunition and funds to the accused persons. A well-oiled terrorist-narcotics-criminal nexus, wherein narcotic drugs along with weapons were smuggled by Pakistan-based entities from across the international border into Punjab for generation of funds for executing terrorist acts, has also been unearthed. The NIA had earlier investigated eight similar incidents of targeted killings/attempted killings by the KLF between January 2016 and October 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/nia-files-charges-against-8-klf-terrorists/articleshow/82281241.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Kolhapur||Trains, flights from Kolhapur cancelled||Kolhapur: A drastic fall in the number of people travelling due to Covid-related restrictions imposed by the state government has led to cancellation of flights and trains from Kolhapur. The Central Railways has announced cancellation of a daily train to Mumbai and bi-weekly train service to Nagpur. Station Incharge of Rajarshi Shahu Chhatrapati Terminus AI Fernades said the decision has been taken after the passenger count dipped below 50% for several days. “The train services to both these cities will remain cancelled for next couple of weeks,” he said. Now, train service to Tirupati and Dhanbad continues, but they are also likely to be cancelled in couple of days as there are no passengers. Meanwhile, flight service to Ahmedabad from Kolhapur airport will remain cancelled for some time. The airport authorities claim the decision has been taken owing to infrastructural work that is being carried out at Ahmedabad airport. Also, the flight service to Tirupati which was a hit among locals will be scheduled based on the passenger turnout. The flights to Bangalore and Hyderabad too are likely to be reduced or re-scheduled due to shortage of passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/trains-flights-from-kolhapur-cancelled/articleshow/82279023.cms||---

Officials said that water is flowing in through two out of four inlet openings. The tank already had about three feet of water and officials are confident of increasing the level by another three feet in the next couple of days. An official from Madurai Corporation said that water was released from the Vaigai dam on Saturday and it reached the city on Sunday night. The water will be released from the dam till April 29. “The shutters of the check dam at the Albert Victor bridge have been downed so that it can be diverted through Panaiyur channel to reach Teppakulam. We are confident of increasing the water level up to six feet,” said an official from the engineering wing of Madurai corporation. Filling water in the tank will not only enhance the beauty of the tank, which was built in 17th century, but will also help to enrich the underground water table. Residents around it have never faced water shortage whenever water was available in the tank. The tank has been holding water continuously for five months now, which is a rare feat, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/water-from-vaigai-dam-fills-up-teppakulam/articleshow/82281233.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Doses in short supply even as state, city post new highs||Mumbai: Maharashtra completed administering 1.5 crore vaccines on Tuesday, the highest among states, a little over three months after the national Covid vaccination drive began in the country. Mumbai, too, hit its single-day high of 72,606 vaccinations on Tuesday. The milestones, though, came on a day when several vaccination centres across districts were scraping the bottom of the barrel for doses. Of the 1.5 crore vaccinations, 1.27 crore are first doses and 21.39 lakh second doses. People above 45 years account for 1.15 crore vaccinations, while healthcare workers and frontline workers account for 16.94 lakh and 16.97 lakh first and second doses given in the state. Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Gujarat are the other four states to have surpassed one crore vaccinations. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state can vaccinate up to 8 lakh people in a day provided there were adequate doses. He urged the Centre to streamline the supply. In terms of coverage, however, Maharashtra has a long road ahead before it can fully vaccinate even 50% of its 3.86 crore population above 45, since only 29% of the age-group have taken the first dose since March 1. Further, a miniscule 2.8% have taken the second dose. Among healthcare and frontline workers, 90% and 96% have taken their first doses respectively. But only 49% of health workers have finished the second dose despite being the first on the priority group to get the vaccine in January. Only 33% frontline workers have taken the second dose. A senior state official blamed the slow uptake of the second dose on the erratic supply of the vaccines from the Centre while underplaying any hesitancy. Incidentally, a day after creating a national record by vaccinating 5,34,372 people in a single day, stockouts were reported by both public and private centres on Tuesday. On Monday, Pune district had surpassed Mumbai to vaccinate 77,561 people while Mumbai had vaccinated 69,922 and Kolhapur lapped the third position with 48,820 vaccinations, leaving behind districts such as Nashik and Nagpur. In Mumbai, the uncertainty over vaccine doses was back by Tuesday evening. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said that the central vaccine depot was empty and whatever stocks available were with the respective vaccination centres. “Depending on their stock positions, they will be able to vaccinate on Wednesday,” she said. Dr Gomare said that they were yet to hear from the state whether fresh stocks could arrive in a day or two. Hospitals like Nanavati in Vile Parle told people only the second dose of Covaxin would be given. Dr Vaibhav Deogirkar of Hindu Mahasabha Hospital in Ghatkopar said they may vaccinate only if they get doses. Dr Joy Chakraborty, COO of Hinduja Hospital said they had adequate doses for Wednesday and Thursday. Hospitals like Holy Spirit in Andheri gave preference to senior citizens and those coming for the second dose. A civic official said many senior citizens want to finish their second dose before May 1, fearing younger people will crowd the centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-doses-in-short-supply-even-as-state-city-post-new-highs/articleshow/82281262.cms||Sumitra Debroy

With these deaths, the toll now stands at 3,806. Also, with 16,089 new infections, total cases in the state reached 5,46,964, taking active cases to 1,55,182. So far this month, the state has seen 2.13 lakh new Covid cases along with the continuous increase in active cases. Also, in yet another grim first, Jaipur saw 21 deaths and rush at crematoriums when ambulances had to wait with bodies for cremation. The Aadarsh Nagar crematorium saw the funeral of 26 people, including five that of bodies from nearby districts. The continuous rise in daily cases has taken active infections in Jaipur to 1,00,651. Be it is RUHS or private hospitals, every one of them is flooded with the Covid patients. Likewise, the continuous surge in cases has affected the supply of oxygen and other life saving injections severely. State education minister and PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra also tested positive on Tuesday. With 21 deaths, Jaipur's toll rose to 659. Twenty-two people died in Jodhpur, taking its fatalities to 497. While 14 died in Udaipur, taking its toll to 253, five more deaths in Kota saw its toll climb to 238.

---||Jaipur||Severe oxygen shortage hampering treatment of patients, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot tells PM||JAIPUR: Even as three senior cabinet ministers — health minister Raghu Sharma, Shanti Dhariwal and BD Kalla — are in Delhi demanding more oxygen to treat Covid-19 patients, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday took it upon himself to speak to the prime minister on the oxygen crisis facing the state. The government said that the consignment of medical oxygen, allocated by the Centre and to be supplied from Jamnagar in Gujarat, has not yet arrived in the state. The shortage of tankers has been a major obstacle in supplying oxygen to Rajasthan from Gujarat as well as from Odisha and Jharkhand. The state only has 23 tankers available for transporting oxygen. Speaking to the PM, Gehlot said, “The way the Government of India has brought the entire oxygen production and distribution under its control, it should also bring the use of tankers under it and allocate the same according to the needs of states.” He said without tankers, oxygen will not reach the states. Patients were increasing continuously in various districts was a matter of grave concern, he said. In the second wave, a large number of young people were also being infected by the virus. In such a situation, proper distribution of all life-saving resources should be ensured according to the number of patients and the severity of infection.The chief minister asked the Centre to include tankers for transportation in the 'national plan' of allocating oxygen to the states. Meanwhile, health minister Raghu Sharma pointed out while the consumption of oxygen was about 6,500 cylinders per day in the state three months ago, it has now increased to 31,425 cylinders daily. With experts warning of a surge in patients in hospitals in the coming days, the situation would turn very grave if the state does not beef up oxygen supply, he said. According to Sharma, the demand for oxygen in the state has been estimated at 365 metric tonnes (MT) by April 30, 541MT by May 9 and 900MT by May 30. “The Union home minister assured us of cooperation and timely supply. We spoke of buying oxygen from many states, but for us transportation is a big challenge. For this, we will need at least 65 oxygen tankers by May 9,” he said. Secretary (medical and health) Siddharth Mahajan said the state government has made all efforts on a war footing to address the oxygen crisis. Oxygen tankers are being airlifted from Jamnagar in Gujarat. Also, a new plant has been set up in Alwar district with a capacity to produce 1,000 cylinders per day. By next week, a plant with a capacity to produce 1,200 cylinders per day will be started by Hindustan Zinc Ltd in Dariba, Rajsamand. Apart from this, production of 500 cylinders will start soon. GPS systems have been installed in oxygen tankers to ensure timely supply and vehicles are being monitored from the state control room, he said. The supply of oxygen for industrial purposes has been stopped and all oxygen will be used for medical purposes only. Cylinders used for industrial work have been acquired and made available for medical treatment. State officials are being posted at oxygen production plants to supervise the entire operation, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/severe-oxygen-shortage-hampering-treatment-of-patients-cm-tells-pm/articleshow/82281260.cms||Joychen Joseph
---||Chandigarh||Chugh: Capt govt is playing politics||Chandigarh: BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh has questioned the alleged presence of Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar in the state cabinet meeting that was presided over by chief minister Amarinder Singh. It was a glaring breach of official protocol, he said. In a statement, Chugh said extra-constitutional powers had started running the state. He lambasted the chief minister for deputing Jakhar to brief the media about cabinet proceedings. He said Jakhar not only gave misleading details about cabinet decisions but also didn’t share the whole truth. Jakhar, on the one hand, offered his resignation and on the other came to defend failures of the Capt Amarinder government. “It’s an alarming trend in the Congress government where extra-constitutional people like Prashant Kishor and Jakhar are more important than the cabinet ministers,” the BJP functionary said. Chugh criticised the “drama of resignation” that Jakhar and cabinet minister Sukhjinder Randhawa reportedly played over the investigation in the Kotkapura firing case. He said the fact was that the chief minister never wanted to punish the culprits in the Guru Granth Sahib sacrilege cases. “It’s gravely unfortunate that the chief minister and his cabinet have been playing politics over the sacrilege incidents,” he added. Chugh said for four years the CM had been fooling the state over the investigation in the Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan firing incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chugh-capt-govt-is-playing-politics/articleshow/82281252.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: All eyes on choice for Margao chief’s post||MARGAO: With the Margao Civic Alliance forged between Goa Forward Party (GFP) and Congress winning 17 of the 25 seats of the Margao Municipal Council (MMC), all eyes are now on which alliance partner claims the coveted post of the chairperson. With GFP’s Fatorda Forward panel winning nine seats, one more than the tally of seats won by Congress’s Model Margao, GFP president Vijai Sardesai is likely to make the first moves over the choice of the candidate for the chairperson, sources said. Though names of a couple of councillors were making the rounds, no official word has come out from either of the two alliance partners so far. In the 2015 elections, where a similar alliance was formed by GFP and Congress, 11 candidates from GFP’s had won, while Digambar Kamat’s panel ‘Model Margao’ had won in six wards. The power sharing formula between GFP and Congress had resulted in GFP-backed Babita Angle Prabhudesai getting elected as chairperson, and Kamat-backed Dorris Texiera as her deputy. However, following a change in political equations after GFP joined the BJP-led government in 2017, GFP’s Tito Cardozo replaced Texiera as the vice-chairperson, allowing GFP to have complete dominion over the Margao municipality. Sardesai managed to assert his supremacy over the council throughout the term despite his ouster from the BJP-led government in July 2019. A change of guard saw Pooja Naik holding the reins of the council from November 2019 until the end of the tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/all-eyes-on-choice-for-margao-chiefs-post/articleshow/82281263.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Oxygen, vital drugs and hope in short supply as capital crisis refuses to abate||NEW DELHI: Hospitals in Delhi continued to struggle with oxygen for the ninth day on Wednesday. Aastha Hospital near Vikaspuri sent a distress message at 2.32pm after it ran out of the gas. The hospital authorities claimed an ambulance with the cylinders had waited at an oxygen plant for 39 hours, but were turned away late the previous night. Indian Spinal Injuries Centre in Vasant Kunj reported being unable to refill oxygen cylinders and confronting a crisis. Speaking to TOI, Dr Sanjay Jain, owner of Aastha Hospital, said, “We are facing a severe crisis and have also informed the authorities about our position. We were short of supply even on Wednesday afternoon and raised an SOS around 2.30pm, following which we were provided some cylinders, but enough only to last till 10pm. We have been scrambling around to get our cylinders refilled. We have to send cylinders in an ambulance. After waiting for 39 hours at a gas plant in Bawana, we were told that the supply was exhausted. The hospital has 50 Covid patients, of whom 30 are critical. Patients in other wards too need oxygen support.” Some of the doctors TOI spoke to stated that the smaller hospitals and nursing homes were facing more problems in arranging replenishment of oxygen. “If our doctors and staffers have to spend the day approaching gas vendors, how will they manage the patients? And we are using ambulances to transport cylinders,” said an executive at a small hospital. “The government should consider the problems of small hospitals such as ours.” Gandhi Hospital in Uttam Nagar seemed to have stemmed the tide after a harrowing Tuesday. But it too complained of lack of support from the authorities. Alisha Gandhi, who is looking after oxygen matters, said, “My sister who is a cardiologist has patients to look. But she had to take on the responsibility of arranging the refilling of cylinders. A system needs to be put in place to prevent hospital staff and doctors running around and standing in queues waiting for refills.” At Saroj Hospital, the supply of the oxygen has of late been consistent. But the medical staff is still apprehensive. “The uncertainty is unnerving,” said Dr P K Bhardwaj, chief executive director and head of surgery. “If we knew that every day at a certain hour, we would receive supplies, then we could admit patients accordingly. If we get more oxygen, we can take in more sick patients.” Saroj Hospital had to shut down three of its departments after the coronavirus hit them hard. “The departments of cardiology, labour and neurosurgery have been shut after 53 doctors tested positive,” said Bhardwaj. Batra Hospital in south Delhi continued to grapple with scarcity and said on Wednesday that it needed a committed oxygen supply to keep going. Dr SCL Gupta, medical director, said, “We even told the court that if we were assured of a consistent supply at a specific time every day, then our intake of patients can increase. Currently, we gasp through half a day because we don’t know if the supply will come at 4pm or 6pm or 8pm.” Replenishing its oxygen stocks was proving a major trouble for Indian Spinal Injuries Centre. “Our vehicles are stuck at different vendors. Some have called to say they aren’t being supplied, others that they are in long queues,” a doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/oxygen-vital-drugs-and-hope-in-short-supply-as-capital-crisis-refuses-to-abate/articleshow/82299365.cms||---
---||Kochi||78 Covid deaths yet to find ‘place’ in any local body||Kochi: The health department is yet to include 78 Covid-19 deaths, including those who died last year, under any of the local bodies in the district. As per records, their place of residence has been listed as “not available”. They are those whose permanent address is outside Ernakulam but died while undergoing treatment in Ernakulam.  The district has so far recorded 489 confirmed Covid deaths till Monday night with the first case reported on March 28, 2020. Meanwhile, 30 Ernakulam natives had died of Covid outside the district. The highest number of 99 confirmed Covid deaths was reported in the city corporation limits. Kochi corporation is the most densely populated corporation in the state. It is followed by the deaths of 78 Covid patients, who could not find ‘place’ in any local body. Only five local bodies –– Tripunithura, Thrikkakara, Koovapady, Kadungallur and Alangad –– other than the corporation have reported Covid deaths in double digits. Other local bodies recorded these deaths in single digits, which health officials admit that situation is different in the ground. However, the government declares only less than five Covid deaths in Ernakulam each day. On some days, the district is seen recorded with no Covid deaths. Health authorities anticipate that the district would witness another 250 to 500 Covid deaths after May 7 depending on the cumulative number of cases reported by that time and admissions to ICUs. Sources said there were around 100 Covid deaths reported from both government and private hospitals in the last 10 days. “There have been more than 1,200 Covid deaths in Ernakulam so far. Of which, only 488 deaths have been confirmed. We have 19,121 positive cases between April 23 and April 27. Even with current fatality rate, around 150 deaths are expected. Of which, 50% will be directly attributed to Covid. We get more than 15 Covid deaths per day from the periphery of the district as against one or two deaths earlier. We forward all the Covid death reports received from hospitals here to the state government. But there is inordinate delay on the part of the government in declaring the deaths as they examine whether the person died of Covid or not,” said a health department official. Meanwhile experts confirm there is widespread underreporting of deaths due to ‘political interest’. “The original Covid deaths will be three times higher than the deaths declared by the government. District officials are sending report to the government. But those in Thiruvananthapuram are picking cases randomly and declaring it as Covid death. Antigen test will be negative in many normal Covid death cases as viral replication comes down in one week. The replication happens in the first seven days of the infection and the body fight against it and suppress the replication in around seven days. But the body loses much in the fight, especially among multi-comorbid people and aged and they die eventually. Many such cases are not reckoned as Covid deaths in the state,” said Dr N M Arun, an internal medicine specialist in Palakkad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/78-covid-deaths-yet-to-find-place-in-any-local-body/articleshow/82279796.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Don’t have enough Remdesivir despite the Centre’s allocation’||Mumbai: The Maharashtra government has floated a global expression of interest (EOI) for procurement of oxygen concentrators and other medical equipment on an emergency basis.,The state is also seeking to set up 134 PSA oxygen plants that will use atmospheric air to separate oxygen for medical use. These are plants with much bigger capacity and will be set up on government hospital premises. The EOI also states that Maharashtra wants to purchase 25,000 MT of liquid medical oxygen and 27 oxygen ISO tanks for storing the life-saving gas as buffer stock for emergency use. “All powers have been delegated to a high-powered committee for the procurement of these quoted items,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope. He said the state will also be buying 10 lakh vials of remdesivir, which is also in short supply. “Though the Centre has increased our allocation to 4.3 lakh, we are still falling short in our daily demand and so we will be buying remdesivir on our own,” Tope said.Officials said that they are not expecting to get all the equipment in the same quantities as listed by the state government, as there is demand from across the world. “Since these items are required urgently, many tender conditions and clauses too have been relaxed so as to attract more bidders,” said a state official.Maharashtra has been requesting the Centre to increase its quota of Remdesivir and oxygen supply to the state. The state has also said there should be proportionate distribution of these items with the number of active cases in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-dont-have-enough-remdesivir-despite-the-centres-allocation/articleshow/82281307.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: ‘Merger valid, 10 ex-Congress MLAs can’t be disqualified’||PANAJI: Terming the merger of 10 out of the 15 Congress MLAs with BJP as valid, speaker Rajesh Patnekar said the 10 former Congress legislators, including deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar, could not be disqualified. “It is not in dispute that on July 10, 2019, the strength of Congress was reduced from 15 to five because 10 MLAs that constituted 2/3rd strength of the party merged into BJP. My office received the intimation and seating arrangements in the House were accordingly changed,” Patnekar observed. His order stated that a decision by a political party regarding a merger was not required to be proved as per paragraph 4(2) of the Xth Schedule of the Constitution of India. GPCC president Girish Chodankar’s case was that the 10 former Congress MLAs had voluntarily given up party membership, making them liable for disqualification under the Xth Schedule. According to Chodankar, apart from 2/3rd of Congress MLAs deciding to merge with BJP, there was a requirement of a decision by the political party to the effect, too. “Reading paragraph 4(2) of the Xth Schedule, the defence available to the former Congress MLAs is that there is a merger. It is undisputed that 10 out of 15 MLAs of Congress in the Goa state legislative assembly merged into BJP. This undisputedly means that 2/3rd of the total number of Congress MLAs merged with BJP. Therefore, it is clear that the test in paragraph 4(2) of Xth Schedule is satisfied,” the speaker observed. He said Chodankar’s argument that there was no valid merger was in fact contrary to the statement in the disqualification petition which said that 10 out of 15 MLAs constituting 2/3rd of the MLAs of Congress joined BJP. In response to the GPCC president’s argument that there was no decision by Congress to merge with BJP, the former Congress MLAs stated that on July 10, 2019, a meeting was convened by the state unit of Indian National Congress under the leadership of its then general secretary and opposition leader Chandrakant Kavlekar to discuss issues relating to merger of the party with BJP. The meeting was attended by 10 out of the 15 MLAs of the Congress Legislature Party and several members of Congress too. “It was unanimously resolved that the legislature party merged into BJP after details were discussed in the said meeting and a resolution to this effect was adopted,” the former Congress MLAs said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/merger-valid-10-ex-cong-mlas-cant-be-disqualified/articleshow/82281270.cms||---
---||India||Oxygen supply up 36% this month||NEW DELHI: Production of liquid medical oxygen has increased nearly 36% from the start of the month and is now just shy of 9,000 tonnes a day with almost the entire output earmarked for medical purposes, barring a small amount set aside for the pharma sector, units making vials and ampules and defence establishments. At a meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday, it emerged that daily production is projected to cross 9,250 tonnes by the end of the week. With other steps including imports and airlifting of supplies from overseas, the situation is expected to ease in the coming days, provided the pace of new cases does not accelerate considerably. Over the last few days, the government has stepped up efforts to improve liquid medical oxygen supply as demand has shot up in the wake of a steep rise in patients suffering from breathlessness on account of their lungs getting damaged. Modi has asked officials to work closely with states to start Pressure Swing Absorption oxygen plants at the earliest. He stressed on the need to ensure that specific guidelines and strategies evolved regarding Covid management needed to be properly implemented by the relevant agencies in states, an official statement said. It further said an empowered group of officers briefed the PM on efforts being undertaken to ramp up availability of beds and ICUs as well as steps to break the chain of transmission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oxygen-supply-up-36-this-month/articleshow/82283368.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Hospitals get more panic calls from patients||KOCHI: Rise in Covid-19 cases and reports of deaths due to oxygen shortage in other states have triggered panic among many Covid positive patients. Telemedicine services and hospitals are receiving calls from relatives and patients even when the latter show slight variation in blood pressure, due to panic. Doctors warn that getting panic would adversely affect their health and advise Covid positive patients to accept the fact first and remain calm. Doctors also say that news reports of deaths due to shortage of oxygen and pathetic situations of patients in other states accelerate fear among patients. They advise patients to stay away from monitoring the appalling condition of Covid patients. “Even when a small variation in the condition of a Covid positive patient is noted, they panic and call us for availability of bed. When they have some symptoms, they get tense. We feel the large number of inquiries might be because of it,” said spokesperson of a private hospital in the city. While mental health doctors noted that some refuse to accept the fact that s/he is a Covid positive patient. “Asymptomatic patients do not have any panic problems. But symptomatic patients panic. When such a patient reads or watches a report of oxygen shortage, s/he will be more anxious,” said Dr Soumya Raj, nodal officer of district mental health programme (DMHP). “The symptoms of panic attack include breathlessness, racing heartbeat, shivering of hands and legs, stomach pain and restlessness. The problem arises when the patient refuses to accept the fact that s/he is a patient. When you deny that, again it is a problem. To address this issue, s/he has to remain calm, accept the fact that s/he is a patient, monitor health conditions, take rest and stay away from watching news on bad situations regarding Covid. Deep breathing exercises can help reduce anxiety and stress. If a problem is developed, one should check whether it is relevant or not and approach medicine service,” said Dr Raj. Doctors in the telemedicine team in Ernakulam also aired the same views. “We give advice to patients when they panic. We did the same during the first wave too. When one gets panic, breathing issues occur. Besides, if choking problems are surfaced, s/he gets panicked. We get such calls from houses and hospitals daily. If one needs hospitalization, we shift them to hospital immediately,” said a doctor in the telemedicine team in Ernakulam. The team handles around 700 to 1,000 calls per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hosps-get-more-panic-calls-from-patients/articleshow/82279812.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Parties in blame game over looted cash||THRISSUR: Police remained tight-lipped on the political links in the case where money was reportedly looted from a car which was allegedly ferrying huge sums for the election work of a national political party at Kodakara recently. Both CPM and BJP blamed the other in this case. According to reports, the money was looted by goons who followed the car in two other vehicles and intercepted it by staging a fake accident near Kodakara on April 3. As per the complaint filed by the driver of the car, Rs 25 lakh was looted from the car. However, there were allegations that Rs 3 crore was taken away by the assailants. The car was proceeding from Bengaluru to Kochi. CPM leaders had alleged that the money was being brought on behalf of BJP leaders for use in Kerala elections. But, BJP leaders denied it and alleged that CPM was spreading lies to damage the party’s credibility. During his daily briefing on Tuesday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the police received clear information about the owner of the money. However, the remand report on the seven people arrested in connection with the case submitted at Irinjalakuda munsiff court is silent on the political connection. When contacted, Thrissur (rural) SP G Poonguzhali said it would be too early to divulge the political connections in the case. “I will not deny that or endorse it. Investigations are on. The people who have been arrested are only carriers and their associates. We have to identify whose money it is, and for whom it was being taken,” she said. She said three more people, including the main accused are yet to be arrested. “Only after their arrest and interrogation we will be able to identify the political links,” she added. The DGP had submitted a report to chief election officer Teeka Ram Meena on the incident. “Police informed the election commission that the investigation is going on in the case. They have not named any party in the report. Let them complete the investigation; if there are lapses we will seek further clarification,” he said. Meanwhile, BJP district president Aneesh Kumar said his party had no links with the case and CPM was making false allegations. According to him, every cash transaction was being accounted for and the police have not said anything in this matter. “But, CPM was trying to create an impression that the BJP was like CPM which indulges in such illegal activities,’’ he said. CPM district secretary MM Varghese had earlier issued a statement demanding a detailed probe in the incident in the backdrop of media reports that the money was being brought on behalf of BJP and the looting was stage-managed by other people in that party. CPM acting state secretary A Vijayaraghavan also said on Tuesday that the investigations will bring out the truth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/parties-in-blame-game-over-looted-cash/articleshow/82280672.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Kolkata||In Maniktala, footballer takes on eight-time MLA||KOLKATA: A 44-year-old former national level goalkeeper has been visiting the length and breadth of this north Kolkata constituency ever since the BJP passed on its baton to him at Maniktala that had seen the Trinamool Congress edging past them by barely 816 votes two years ago during the Lok Sabha polls. He has attended major rallies with national leaders, held street corner meetings and door-to-door campaigns. There are reasons why Kalyan Choubey, BJP’s Maniktala candidate, felt he had a fair chance — the saffron party has been on an upswing here right from 2014 due to the popularity it enjoys among the non-Bengali population here. The alleged factional feuds in the ruling Trinamool camp have also come as an advantage for BJP. The fight, though, will hardly be a cakewalk. Trinamool Congress has fielded an eight-time MLA, who still enjoys considerable clout in the area and is known to work all year despite his failing health. His organization is still enviable and despite four changes made in the Trinamool line-up for the Kolkata seats, he had no problem in getting a re-nomination. State consumer affairs minister Sadhan Pande said he didn’t have an “iota of doubt” that he would trounce his opponents at Maniktala and that Mamata Banerjee would be the next CM. “The voters here know me for the past 40 years. I am now a part of the life of North Kolkata residents. I have set up schools and a college with almost no support from the Left government. I had brought education to the slums. Whether it’s bringing electricity or maintaining roads, I have spent money on jobs,” said Pande. When told that his lead had decreased considerably in 2016, he said: “People voted for Modi in the Lok Sabha elections because they found no other alternative from the opposition. Tell me, is there any other alternative to Mamata Banerjee here?” TMC vote managers, too, insisted that the “house is in order”. “We know our strengths and weaknesses,” quipped a youth leader at Muraripukur. Maniktala, like several other constituencies of Kolkata, is a mix of the urban upper middle class and middle class residing at apartments in Maniktala, Ultadanga and most importantlyin Phoolbagan-Kankurgachhi. Yet, out of the 2.1 lakh voters in Maniktala constituency, about 1.4 lakh live in slums located across Ultadanga and Muraripukur. Chaubey, though, insisted that he was battle-ready. “I have been receiving fantastic vibes. People want a change here. They have an MLA who is mostly absent here. They will act wisely before casting their votes for someone (Pande) who is 70-plus and is no more active. I pray for his long life but he too needs to take rest,” he said. CPM’s candidate, Rupa Bagchi is a former MLA from this constituency and a three-time councillor.  “I am ready if people compare the work I did here between 200 and 2011 and what Sadhanbabu has done in the last 10 years. The people are tired of the Trinamool Congress misrule,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-maniktala-footballer-takes-on-eight-time-mla/articleshow/82280670.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Residents flag violation of Covid-19 norms by vendors||New Delhi: Residents of different areas in the city have complained of Covid guidelines not being followed during the lockdown. There has been no restriction on movement of visitors, domestic workers and hawkers inside colonies and many of them do not even wear masks properly, they claim.The residents’ welfare association of Jangpura Extension approached the local police for help on Monday. “Fruit and vegetable vendors were freely roaming in lanes. At places, car cleaners and domestic workers were seen without masks. This has been the case when so many Covid positive cases have been reported from the area. The viral infection even claimed a life in N block recently,” said Kapil Kakkar, president of the association.“When we failed to get any help from the local police station, we went to social media questioning the purpose of implementing the lockdown. On Tuesday, I also tagged the DCP, southeast Delhi in a tweet,” said Kakkar.Delhi Police, however, was quick to respond. “Your complaint has been forwarded to ACP Lajpat Nagar for necessary action,” said a tweet from the DCP. “I will ensure that lockdown as per guidelines will be implemented,” tweeted the Lajpat Nagar ACP later.Similar issues were highlighted by Mayur Vihar-I residents as well. “All shops in Acharya Niketan Market are closed, but there is no control on the number of hawkers selling fruits and vegetables. A majority of them barely maintain social distancing or wear masks properly. I have received similar complaints from residents in the neighbouring areas too,” said Sanjay Bhargava, resident of Mayur Vihar-I.Vinod K Nair, RWA president of Mayur Vihar-III Pocket-D, also said that it was getting difficult to restrict the movement of visitors and domestic workers in the area. Many residents are not ready to cooperate, he pointed out.“The purpose of lockdown was to stop the movement of people and minimise the chances of spread of the infection. As per Delhi government order also, only essential services were allowed during the curfew,” he said, adding that “household workers and visitors roaming freely will only increase the risk.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/residents-flag-violation-of-covid-19-norms-by-vendors/articleshow/82281357.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Kochi||Class X student from Chellanam to write to Prez again||Kochi: Edgar Sebastian, a Class X student in Chellanam, wrote a letter to the President of India in July 2020 seeking his intervention in resolving the sea erosion in his coastal panchayat. The letter has been forwarded by the Rashtrapathi Bhavan to the state government asking to take necessary actions and inform the boy about the development. On April 19, 2021, after nine months since his letter, the irrigation department sent a letter to Sebastian informing him about the developments and it is clearly visible that nothing major, except a few tenders and estimates, had been done in Chellanam to make the coast ready to face the upcoming monsoons. Sebastian plans to write again to the President citing the irrigation department’s “ineffectiveness” in resolving the woes of his people. According to the letter signed by the assistant engineer of the irrigation department, Manassery section, tendering has been initiated for the repair of seawall between Fort Kochi and Chellanam. It stated that work estimates to repair the breakwaters and install geobags as temporary protective measures have also been prepared. However, Sebastian and his parents said that nothing had been done over the past 10 months and these tenders and estimates are likely to remain in papers. They said Chellanam is expecting severe sea erosion by mid-May and the effect would be more intense as the seawall was completely broken in most places. “I wrote the letter requesting help from the President as the promises given by various politicians that they would protect us and our houses from the sea erosion remained mere promises. Despite the President’s directive to the chief secretary to take immediate action, hardly any measures were taken over the past nine months. Even though the government had announced coastal protection project, all those are yet to be a reality,” said Sebastian, who is writing his SSLC board exams now. Jinson Veluthamannungal, Sebastian’s father and coordinator of Care Chellanam, which is an association formed to raise the residents’ concerns, said that there was no use in placing the geobags once the monsoon has begun. “The irrigation department has submitted a proposal worth Rs 2.5 crore to make a wall using geobags but it is not yet approved. It might be approved only after the new government is formed. By that time the sea erosion would begin,” he said. Residents are also worried about the severe pandemic situation and if the sea flooding happens it will be difficult for them to move to relief camps. In July 2020, they have faced double whammy in the form of Covid and sea attack when nearly 400 houses were flooded by seawater at a time when Chellanam was one of the worst Covid containment zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/class-x-student-from-chellanam-to-write-to-prez-again/articleshow/82279825.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

Sumangala is the nom de plume (pen name) of Leela Namboodiripad, who was a respected presence in the Malayalam literary field. Even though she was popular in the children’s literature field, she had also made a mark as translator, and novelist. She had penned about 70 books for children which are still read passionately. Born on May 16, 1934 as the daughter of renowned Sanskrit scholar late OMC Namboodiripad of Olappamanna Mana, and Uma Antharjanam, Leela began her literary career in 1959. She was married to late D A Namboodiripad of Desamangalam Mana. Sumangala has won a number of awards, including Kendra Sahithya Academy Award and Kerala Sahithya Academy Award (twice). Her book ‘Pachamalayalam Nighandu’ (dictionary of colloquial Malayalam) is a serious work giving deep insights into diverse facets of Malayalam language. She retired as the publicity officer of Kerala Kalamandalam. Writer and Gandhian activist K Aravindakshan recalled that Sumnagala was a very powerful woman writer who had deep insights into the gender issues. “She was a revolutionary and completely secular. She could be critical even about mythological narrations, though many of her writings were based on them. Above all people who had the opportunity to get acquainted with her will cherish the affection and care she had showered on all of them,” Aravindakshan said. Kerala Sahithya Academy president Vaisakhan and secretary K P Mohanan said Sumangala was a voracious reader who was familiar with the diverse literature across the globe. Sumanagala had made remarkable contributions in familiarising the rich mythological tradition of India to the younger generation. Sumangala is survived by her daughter Usha Nambudripad, D Narayanan and D Ashtamurthy||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/writer-sumangala-no-more/articleshow/82280675.cms||T Ramavarman

The contest, announced during the lockdown in 2020, had one major rule — everything from acting to editing had to be done in a remote environment and the film could not exceed 140 seconds, including the end credits. Among the judges, director of ‘Rising Star’ Michihito Fujii, whose film, ‘The Journalist’, received the best film, best director and best screenplay award at the 43rd Japan Academy Award 2019, personally selected Miles’s film, securing the Goa team the Directors Choice Award. The remote film contest was organised by Alphaboat and Toha Cinema in Japan. “In a festival full of Zoom films, Miles created a proper cinematic experience on a very high level. I was surprised to learn that he not only directed, but also wrote and acted in the film. If he managed to do this much alone, I can’t imagine what he would be capable of with a big budget,” Fujii said. The most recent award came from The Strasberg Film Festival, which is held annually at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York. This Institute, where Miles trained for two years, has been the alma mater to major Hollywood stars such as Alec Baldwin, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, Lady Gaga and Marilyn Monroe. “The driving motivation for making the film was to provide myself a platform to showcase my acting potential. This film provided me with an opportunity to give myself a decent role in a film genre that I am a fan of. It freed me from the struggles of auditioning and type-casting,” Lobo said. Lobo’s next project is titled Dog Fighter – an experimental film that sees Goa as a setting for a gritty action thriller.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goan-bags-awards-at-japan-us-film-fests/articleshow/82281341.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Delhi||Delhi: 62-year-old woman dies waiting for bed||NEW DELHI: The kin of a 62-year-old Covid-positive woman who died waiting for a bed at Apollo Indraprastha Hospitals in southeast Delhi clashed with the security personnel at the healthcare facility on Tuesday afternoon though neither the hospital nor the family filed any police complaints later. Around 2am on Tuesday, Beermati, 62, was rushed to the hospital but couldn’t be admitted due to unavailability of beds. She was on her own oxygen support when her condition deteriorated around 8.30am and she died. Her family claimed to the cops that they had asked the hospital to admit her as her oxygen was getting depleted, their pleas went unheard. The woman’s relatives returned later in the day, vandalised hospital property and engaged in a scuffle with the security staff. “We met the hospital authorities. None of the parties has filed a complaint,” said R P Meena, DCP (South-East). “No one suffered any major injury, though the deceased’s son had a minor cut on his hand. The police officials already deployed at the hospital brought the situation under control quickly. Later senior police officers went to the hospital and spoke to the authorities. No case has been registered so far.” Apollo issued a statement saying, “The hospital received a lady in a critical condition at the Emergency in the early hours of April 27. Immediate medical attention appropriate to her condition was given by the team. Given the paucity of beds, the family was advised to shift the patient to another facility with available beds. Unfortunately, the patient died around 8am, post which the patient's family members resorted to vandalism, destruction of hospital property and assault on our doctors and staff.” The hospital further stated, “While the hospital deeply condoles the death of the patient, it is deeply shocked at the behaviour of the patient's family against doctors and healthcare workers who are providing untiring services amidst the pandemic.” Dr Vikas Bajpai, executive member, Progressive Medicos and Scientists Forum (PMSF), asserted that creating the facilities for the needs of the people at this difficult time was the responsibility of the government. He said, “Doctors or other hospital staff do not have it in their power to create even one extra bed or provide essentials like oxygen and drugs, which are in short supply. Rather the doctors, nurses and other hospital staff have been rendering service in extremely trying circumstances, exposing themselves the risk of infection.” In a statement, PMSF said that it was of cardinal importance to realize that all healthcare facilities could be used for providing treatment to the patients only if the doctors and other health staff could render their duty without any fear and threat to their personal safety. The forum appealed to the people to use their perfectly understandable anger to “make the government of the day and the ruling party politicians to stand to account for their misdeeds”, which had caused families to suffer the loss of their near and dear ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/62-year-old-woman-dies-waiting-for-bed/articleshow/82281351.cms||---
---||Delhi||Greater Kailash-II RWA sets up 32-bed quarantine facility||NEW DELHI: The Greater Kailash-II RWA, in association with the local administration, finally set up and made operational a 32-bed quarantine facility at a community hall on Wednesday. The RWA has hired four nurses and deployed five doctors from the community for giving online consultation and visiting the centre when required. The centre will run according to government guidelines and no critical patient, pregnant women, child, etc will be allowed here. The cost will be borne by the RWA and the facility will be reserved for GK-II residents and their staff. “We were asking the RWA to develop such a facility for a long time. After rounds of meetings and inspections by the southeast district magistrate and the sub-divisional magistrate, work finally started on this project. I have developed a web portal, which will help in videoconferencing of patients with doctors, writing digital prescriptions and entering patients’ details regularly. Nurses will help patients consult doctors through this portal,” said Shwetika Kumar, a resident of GK-II. The district administration has provided an oxygen concentrator. “We will only admit patients with mild symptoms. We will not take people with comorbidities and those below 10 years and above 65,” said Dr Deepak Kapoor, who is also a resident of the area. “Nurses have been asked to raise the alarm if saturation level reaches below 95. Since it’s a facility for people with mild symptoms, we have to guide people to look for hospitals in case the oxygen level goes down,” said Dr Kapoor. Besides consultation and coordination, residents have also come forward to supply food and other material. “We are getting supply of medicines on the direction of the DM besides one oxygen concentrator. We are also looking for arrangement of oxygen cylinders for any emergency situation. Till Wednesday evening, three people were admitted here,” said Sanjay Rana, GK- II RWA president. In New Delhi Municipal Council area, a quarantine facility started at Birla Mandir Dharamshala. The civic body is taking care of monitoring of patients, issuing of passes, lifting of biomedical waste, etc at this facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/greater-kailash-ii-rwa-sets-up-32-bed-quarantine-facility/articleshow/82299465.cms||Vibha Sharma

If the sheer number of candidates isn’t enough to trigger curiosity, the profile of the candidates is set to interest the voters further where an auto driver, an electrician’s wife and a deliveryman is up against an established high court lawyer, a government researcher and the leader of a bus syndicate, who happens to be the two-time MLA of the constituency. Welcome to Entally in north Kolkata, where burning poll issues like water scarcity, sanitisation, condition of roads and air pollution have taken a backseat with the profile and number of candidates coming up as the major talking point. While the primary contest is between the Trinamool Congress, BJP and Sanjukta Morcha affiliated Rashtriya Secular Majlish Party, there are seven independent candidates contesting the poll from this constituency apart from candidates from parties like Janata Dal, Bahujan Samaj Party, Bharatiya Nyay-Adhikar Raksha Party, All India Minorities Front and West Bengal Socialist Party. “There are so many parties and candidates campaigning this time that it is difficult to remember all the names,” said Indranil Sinha Roy, resident of a high-rise off EM Bypass, that falls under the constituency. While independent candidates like auto driver Md Imran and an electrician’s wife, Mousumi Roy, said they were contesting the election with a hope to provide better amenities to their neighbourhoods, at least one independent candidate, Ashok Das, said he was contesting just for fun. “There are a lot of issues like poor supply of drinking water and limited number of public toilets in our area. Hygiene and sanitisation is a major issue and the TMC has done nothing about it,” said Mousumi’s husband Ratan, speaking on her behalf. Ratan arranges electrical connections at all BJP party camps in the area. Imran and Das said they did not have any specific agendas as of now. “This is my second election. The ruling party has done amazing work in our constituency,” said Das. The mainstream leaders shrugged off the independents and candidates from lesser known parties as dummy candidates fielded only to increase the number of polling agents inside booths. “Fielding independents are long time election strategies. The contest here is mostly between us and TMC and I am confident of a victory. The TMC has done nothing in the last 10 years and people here want a change,” said Priyanka Tibrewal, BJP candidate. Sitting MLA Swarnakamal Saha, a businessman and leader of a bus syndicate gave himself 100 out of 100 in the constituency work marksheet. “I have changed the entire look of the constituency in my tenure. There is almost no work left now. We have an equal distribution of rich, poor, middle class and lower middle class people in my constituency and almost none has anything to complain,” said Saha. But ask the residents and they differ with Saha’s claims. “Water supply is a long standing issue in this area along with waterlogging,” said Tabrez Alam, a resident of Topsia. Silver Spring Complex resident Indranil Chowdhury spoke of severe air pollution, courtesy stubble and tyre burning at Mathpukur area, that forces the complex residents to shut their windows through the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/poll-curiosity-in-entally-over-the-highest-number-of-candidates/articleshow/82280681.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

A final decision is expected to be taken at the cabinet meeting on Wednesday. State relief & rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar told the media that cases have dropped in Mumbai, but not in other parts of the state. “After the increase in curbs in the state, Covid cases reduced in Mumbai, but are still on the rise in Vidarbha, Marathwada and other parts.” He added that the cabinet will take a decision after reviewing the situation. A senior official said the state was taking stock of new cases daily and curbs will not be lifted in one go, but gradually. “Relaxation cannot start unless new cases come to below 35,000-40,000 for few days,” he said. Another official said the state will carry on vaccination to cover maximum people during lockdown curbs. “Both measures, restrictions and vaccination, may help control infections in few days,” added an official. The state had imposed additional restrictions from April 14 to May 1. It put curbs on inter-district and inter-city travel and reintroduced e-passes for inter-district and inter-state movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/lockdown-like-curbs-likely-to-be-extended-in-maharashtra-by-15-days/articleshow/82281389.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Delhi||Delhi can’t breathe easy as oxygen supply still falling short||NEW DELHI: On Tuesday morning, Gupta Hospital in Vivek Vihar sent an SOS that it had oxygen only for two more hours. Batra Hospital and Indian Spinal Injuries Institute too complained of inconsistent gas supply. Clearly, oxygen supplies for city hospitals are yet to be streamlined despite the crisis having created a national hubbub. Gandhi Hospital in Uttam Nagar was desperate around 4.30pm with just an hour of oxygen left. It has over 60 Covid-positive patients, of whom 36 are in ICU. “Our supplier himself got affected and is admitted in the hospital. We have been sending our vans with cylinders for refilling, but the queue is long,” said Alisha Gandhi, who is in charge of gas requirements. “Our requirement is around 150 cylinders per day, but we have been having a difficult time in the last five days. The hospital is admitting patients, but only those who don’t require oxygen.” For a couple of hours on Tuesday, Panchsheel Hospital in Yamuna Vihar, a 50-bedded facility, did not have oxygen stocks. Hospital director Dr V K Goyal told TOI, “Our vendor in Ghaziabad informed us on Tuesday afternoon that he couldn’t send us gas due to a shortage there. I called up all my resources and, not finding any help, informed the authorities at 2.30pm. I send out ambulances holding 6-8 cylinders for refilling. But this is a time-consuming and lives are at risk.” The additional district magistrate of North-East district later put the hospital on notice. The notice, a copy of which is with TOI, states, “It has come to our notice that Panchsheel Hospital, which is a designated Covid hospital, has not been keeping adequate oxygen so far and, therefore, put the safety of patients in peril. This is a violation of the orders of the competent authority regarding use of oxygen in designated Covid facilities. You are hereby directed to immediately scale up the oxygen storage facilities on par with beds. In case of failure to comply, action will be taken against you.” Goyal was crestfallen. “I try to refill the cylinders but this takes 8-10 hours. What can I do when there is no other way to manage the shortage?” he said. Shanti Mukund Hospital in Karkardooma had a peculiar problem. “Our suppliers were changed,” explained Sunil Kumar Saggar, CEO. “When I called our supplier, he said I should call a new supplier who had been assigned to supply our hospital now. I accordingly called the second supplier, to whom the old oxygen order from the hospital hadn’t been forwarded from the original supplier. I told both of them that the lives of patients were at stake and they would be held responsible. Finally, my original supplier delivered the gas, but won’t from Wednesday.” At Indian Spinal Injuries Centre Tuesday was no different from the troubled Monday. “We have been sending cylinders for refilling, but everything is uncertain. Perhaps by the evening we will receive replenishments, but we need consistent supply to function properly,” said a doctor at the hospital. Batra Hospital received some supplies. “We actually need more than what we are receiving,” claimed a doctor there. “We need consistency, because every 24 hours we are struggling for oxygen. There is just one government nodal officer and it is difficult for him because he has to listen to 400-odd hospitals calling him all at the same time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-cant-breathe-easy-as-o2-supply-still-falling-short/articleshow/82281385.cms||---

This is the second instance the contempt petition has been filed. The first contempt petition was disposed in January 2020 after recording the government statement that the implementation of the scheme to install digital meters in taxis on pilot basis had been successful and the notification as regards the fare rates will be issued by the state government in 15 days. It was further stated that no sooner this notification is issued, the installation of digital meters will commence. Earlier in July 2019, the court had asked the government to proceed with the decision to install digital taxi meters. The government had assured the court that implementation on pilot basis would take place between July 16, 2019 and July 31, 2019, and implementation on regular basis would begin on August 1, 2019 and conclude within six months. As this order was not complied with, the association sent a legal notice to the government in September 2019 and later a contempt petition was filed that was disposed in January 2020. In its second contempt petition, TTAG stated that the government “wilfully disobeyed and disregarded” the orders, made “no efforts whatsoever to comply” with them and didn’t not obtain necessary orders from the court extending the time limits. The government is “therefore liable to be prosecuted for having committed contempt of this honourable court,” the association stated. The high court was constantly monitoring the implementation of digital face meters for motor cabs in Goa and passed various orders.

---||Goa||Goa: Taximen deny attack, hit out at travel body||PANAJI: The tourist taxi association has cried foul over the recent arrests of two cab operators, and denied allegations that they attacked a film crew for travelling in GoaMiles vehicles. “All we did is question the crew about carrying out film shootings in Goa when Section 144 is imposed in the state. Is this law only applicable to taxi operators, while filmmakers from other states are allowed to gather for their shoots?” said Laximan ‘Bappa’ Korgaonkar, a private taxi operator, who was arrested last week. He further alleged that it was the film crew who attacked the taxi operators first. The operators also alleged that the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) doesn’t have the best interests of taxi operators in mind. Citing videos that are being circulated online of cabbies forcibly stopping GoaMiles vehicles and passengers, the line producers and TTAG on Sunday held a press conference and demanded action against operators who threaten guests coming to the state for film shootings. “We condemn TTAG’s claims that we are looting tourists in Goa by overcharging. What about the fares they charge to take tourists to take to waterfalls and sightseeing? ” another operator said. “We will not support any taxi operator overcharging any customers beyond the meter charges. Let the government come out with a helpline. Please don’t defame us unnecessarily,” said another operator at a press briefing in Panaji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/taximen-deny-attack-hit-out-at-travel-body/articleshow/82281359.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cong braces for tough fight on Adhir turf||Behrampore: Congress Lok Sabha leader Adhir Chowdhury from home isolation has written to Election Commission accusing Trinamool Behrampore candidate Narugopal Mukherjee of “taking away” postal ballots of employees in the Behrampore Municipality engaged in poll duty. Chowdhury has appealed to the EC to cancel those postal ballots. Chowdhury’s allegation two days ahead of the Behrampore polls on April 29 has sent ripples in the town. A section of Behrampore citizens wonder why Chowdhury was bothered with postal ballots when the Congress had a lead of over 80,000 votes from Behrampore, only two years ago in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It provides a clue to the “mood swings” among voters that has turned a “safe seat” for the Congress into a see-saw. Adhir’s lieutenant, three-time MLA and Congress chief whip in the West Bengal Assembly Manoj Chakraborty was moving places till the other day to prevent a “split” in the Congress vote bank. A cursory look at Behrampore’s demography bears out that unlike in the Murshidabad district where Muslims constitute 66% of the population, Behrampore has a majority Hindu population with 68,000 minority voters in the total 2.7 lakh electorate. Pitted against Chakraborty is Trinamool’s Narugopal Mukherjee who served the municipality and has a grip on the organization. BJP, on the other hand, has fielded Congress-turned-Trinamool-turned-BJP leader Subrata Maitra (Kanchan) who has been running a flourishing NGO in the town. Congress veteran Manoj Chakraborty’s advantage is his experience and Chowdhury’s support, while the other two contenders bank on their public contact. The Adhir magic during 2019 LS polls and his “unnanayer kandari” didn’t draw the expected crowd at Indraprastha in Behrampore town and also in the adjoining Haridasmati area. Few citizens also remembered how the Trinamool candidate gave service during the first Covid wave in the town last year. Both Trinamool and BJP candidates have a young brigade working for them. While outgoing Congress MLA Manoj Chakraborty banks on poll mathematics, his two contenders eye on the changing chemistry on Adhir turf.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cong-braces-for-tough-fight-on-adhir-turf/articleshow/82280714.cms||Sukumar Mahato
---||Delhi||O2: Delhi to import ready-to-use plants||New Delhi: With the capital facing an acute shortage of oxygen for Covid-19 patients in the past few days, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said Delhi government had decided to import 21 ready-to-use oxygen plants from France and 18 oxygen tankers from Thailand. Within the next one month, the chief minister said, the city will get 44 oxygen plants, out of which eight will be installed by the Centre and the rest by Delhi government.“We are trying our level best to increase the amount of oxygen available in Delhi. It has been noted that the oxygen allotted to us by the central government is also not reaching us in its entirety. A major issue facing us today in the supply of oxygen is the shortage in the number of tankers,” the chief minister said during a digital press briefing. Even when the government finds oxygen, transporting it to Delhi becomes a problem because of this shortage of tankers, he pointed out.“Delhi government has decided to import 18 tankers from Bangkok, which will start reaching Delhi from Wednesday. For this, we have requested the central government to lend us the Air Force planes,” he said, adding that Delhi government’s interaction with the Centre had so far been positive. As the Centre had helped earlier, Delhi government is hopeful of receiving its support this time too, he added.“The 18 tankers from Thailand will help us in the transportation of oxygen and ensure that our allotted amount reaches us,” Kejriwal said. The 21 ready-to-use oxygen plants from France will be “installed at different hospitals in Delhi ensuring a steady supply of oxygen at least in those hospitals”. Kejriwal said positive responses had been received from several chief ministers and industrialists in the country who were requested to help to tide over this crisis. Many have promised help but wish to remain anonymous, he added. “It is only with the aid that we are receiving right now that we are being able to transport tankers from Bangkok and oxygen plants from France.”The chief minister said the period between Thursday and Saturday were particularly critical for Delhi. “Oxygen was running especially low and we were fearful of a major mishap. We spent nights trying to arrange oxygen. However, since then, we have seen a major improvement,” he said. “The number of SOS messages received from hospitals has reduced. I am not saying there is no SOS message, we still receive a few each day. However, the situation has seen improvement from last week.” On Tuesday morning, the Centre, which is also importing tankers, has allotted five additional tankers to Delhi, Kejriwal said. “We are thankful for their help.” The eight oxygen plants that the central government is going to install in the national capital will hopefully be ready by April 30, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/o2-delhi-to-import-ready-to-use-plants/articleshow/82281394.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Oximeter, inhaler prices up as demand rises||AHMEDABAD: With reports of hospitals gasping for oxygen and patients waiting for beds, Amdavadis have been making a beeline for pharmacies to stock on ‘essentials’ like steam inhalers, pulse oximeters, and thermometers among other devices. So much so that chemists are running out of stock. Everyone is scared of catching the virus and are buying everything possible to keep the family protected, or if they test Covid-positive, help in the cure. “We ran out of our stock of pulse oximeters and steam inhalers a week ago. The demand has increased manifold. Even dealers have run out of stock. This has led to a rise in prices, too. An oximeter, which used to cost Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,500, is now being sold for Rs 1,900 to Rs 2,500 depending on the customer. It is sold at a higher rate to walk-in customer compared to a regular customer,” said Pravin Shah, who owns a pharmaceutical shop in Navrangpura. Pravin Ahir, who has a pharmaceutical unit in Celebration Centre in Bopal, said that in the last month, there has been an increase in demand. “Even walk-in customers now come looking for oximeter. It is not a necessity for non-Covid people. Yet, people are buying it and keeping it handy. The demand for vapouriser kits has also increased.” Alpesh Patel, president of the Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists’ Association (FGSCDA), said, “There has been a tenfold surge in the sale of pulse oximeters. In fact, this device is currently in short supply.” The average sales of oximeters stood at about 50 pieces a month (around 2 piece a day) at any chemist counter during November last year to the first week of March this year. "Given the unprecedented surge in demand, 20-25 oximeters are sold every day by a single chemist. There are 35,000 chemists across Gujarat, of which 22,000-25,000 are retailer chemists. Imagine the number of oximeters sold, even if at least 10 pieces are sold on an average by each one of them," he added. According to chemists, the never-before-seen demand has also pushed up the prices of pulse oximeters. The device, which used to cost Rs 700-800 a piece, are now supplied to chemists at Rs 1,500 per piece. The price to consumer is obviously higher. As far as steam inhalers are concerned, their demand has also shot up considerably. "However, steam inhalers are easily available in the market and there is no variations in prices of steam inhalers," added Patel. A big pharma unit on CG Road said that earlier they used to sell 50 oximeters a month but the second wave and the surge in cases has driven up the demand .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/oximeter-inhaler-prices-up-as-demand-rises/articleshow/82280685.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Kolkata||E-W project hit as contractors shut office after staffers test +ve||Kolkata: With only 220m of tunneling left, the East-West Metro project is now staring at a fresh crisis as many staff members of contractors ITD ITD-Cementation have been infected with Covid-19. The company has shut its office from Tuesday till May 2 to break the chain. Tunnel boring machine (TBM S-616), nicknamed Urvi, is currently burrowing the last stretch of the East-West Metro. Engineers of Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), implementing agency of the 16km Line 2, said the TBM has crossed the Bank of India, Bowbazar High School and would complete its journey around May 20. “Fortunately, the tunneling team is safe this time. But several staff members of the front office have been infected. So we have closed our office for the next few days to prevent spread,” an official of ITD-Cementation said on Tuesday. There are three upcoming holidays – poll day on 29 April, May Day and 2 May, the day of counting. “We are closing the front office until May 2 for a continuous break to snap the chain of spread,” the official said. In July last, the other tunnel’s digging was stalled as engineers from the tunneling team tested positive. On January 4, Urvi started its journey from below Sealdah station to bridge the last 800m gap of the westward tunnel. It took a month’s break on January 27 to create space to shove its own 75m length inside and started digging from March 1 again. On October 9 last year, Urvi delivered the eastbound tunnel of East-West Metro till Sealdah station. It then started filling the last section of the westbound tunnel that sibling TBM Chundi had left incomplete after hitting an aquifer at Bowbazar on August 31 in 2019. Because of tunneling disaster, the same TBM had to take a U-turn from Sealdah Metro station to dig from the opposite end. ITD ITD Cementation, contracted to build the last 2.45km Esplanade-Sealdah stretch of the East-West Metro, deployed both TBMs in early 2019, aiming to finish the tunneling by March 2020. But work was stalled for six months as buildings at Bowbazar’s Durga Pituri Lane collapsed due to large-scale subsidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/e-w-project-hit-as-contractors-shut-office-after-staffers-test-ve/articleshow/82280716.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Hyderabad||Telangana govt to fast track vax drive, inoculate 1.45 crore in 3 months||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government has set itself a target of vaccinating 1.45 crore people between the ages of 18 and 44 in just three months. Officials told TOI on Tuesday that they want to start the exercise in May under the liberalised vaccine policy of the Centre, and finish it by July end. At present, Telangana is administering vaccine to around two lakh people daily. It can reach its target if this momentum is maintained, sources said. As a first step, the government has asked Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech to allocate a major chunk of its indigenously developed vaccine, Covaxin, to Telangana. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar met Bharat Biotech’s chairman & managing director Dr Krishna Ella on Tuesday to ensure enough stocks are available. The chief secretary urged the Bharat Biotech boss to give priority to Telangana. “Bharat Biotech has responded positively to the state government’s request,” Somesh Kumar said. Telangana principal secretary (industries) Jayesh Ranjan and Bharat Biotech executive director Sai Prasad were also present in the meeting. Sources told TOI that a similar meeting will be held with officials of Serum Institute of India (SII), the other vaccine manufacturer in India, so that enough doses can be procured. Telangana requires nearly 2.9 crore vaccine doses so that it can keep its promise of giving the jabs free to all residents, including migrants. The Centre has eased vaccination norms for those above 18 years from May 1 and Telangana is one of many states that have decided to give the antidote free at government hospitals. This would put an additional financial burden of Rs 2,500 crore on the state exchequer but officials say that they are ready for it. Sources added that the state government is not even haggling with these companies to bring prices down so that they can get as many doses as possible. Bharat Biotech has announced that it would supply the vaccine to state governments at Rs 600 a dose while private hospitals would have to pay double that amount. SII said it would give vaccines to state governments at Rs 400 each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-govt-to-fast-track-vax-drive-inoculate-1-45-cr-in-3-mnths/articleshow/82282374.cms||Koride Mahesh

Apart from Habeeb Nagar, we also cleared the garbage accumulating behind Anwar-Ul-Uloom college, Komat Konda compound, Hasheem ground, Nampally cricket market and other places in Mallepally,” said Yasmeen Begum, GHMC corporator, Mallepally. According to the locals, the issue of garbage being dumped in the open was persisting for several months before the officials took the initiative to clean the entire space. “Despite complaints to the local civic authorities, people would repeatedly use the space as a dumping ground. With the number of Covid-19 cases increasing, it is very important that we keep our surroundings clean,” said Ryan Shaheryer, a resident who highlighted the issue. “Although we are happy that the GHMC has cleared the garbage. There is a need for a permanent solution to this problem. The civic body should also take initiative to spread awareness among the locals to not dump the garbage on the street,” he said. Another citizen from Nampally said that the officials must conduct regular inspections in the area to see that the problem does not resurface. “The garbage was piling up so much that it was blocking the road and causing severe inconvenience to the commuters. This will only get worse during monsoons and will lead to severe mosquito menace if there is no permanent solution,” said Farhan Ahmed, a resident of Aghapura in Nampally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/garbage-cleared-out-of-habeeb-nagar-within-48-hrs/articleshow/82281426.cms||---
---||Goa||To break Covid chain, Lobo looks at sealing Calangute for 10 days||PANAJI: With the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in North Goa’s coastal belt, ports minister Michael Lobo on Tuesday said that “major containment zones are likely to be declared” in the coastal belt of Calangute constituency on Wednesday. “The major containment zones should be for at least 10 days, to check if we can break the chain,” Lobo said, while adding that “the people of Calangute constituency are demanding a partial lockdown”. “We want to seal the Calangute area so that outside people do not enter. We will also have nakabhandis in Calangute,” he said. However, Lobo’s statement is at variance with his recent stance that enforcing health protocols would deter tourists from coming to Goa, and that Section 144 didn’t apply to tourists. The Calangute MLA had opposed a move to make Covid-negative certificates mandatory for tourists and had said that “Goa’s economy survives on tourism”. “If you make SOPs stricter and you harass tourists, which tourist will come to Goa? We have to take precautionary measures, but at the same time, you cannot stop business because Covid-19 cases are increasing,” Lobo had said. In a prediction model recently prepared by the preventive and social medicine department of Goa Medical College to identify hotspots for Covid-19 cases and where stringent measures are required, Baga and Calangute in North Goa were at nos. 1 and 2, respectively, with Candolim, Sinquerim and Arpora also featuring in the list that pinpointed high risk areas. “We have requested chief minister Pramod Sawant to declare containment zones. He has asked us to hold a meeting on Wednesday and said the deputy collector will do the needful,” Lobo said. Present at the meeting with Sawant were Calangute sarpanch Shawn Martins, Arpora sarpanch Rajesh Morajkar and Candolim sarpanch Blaize Fernandes. Lobo said that he will hold a meeting with the deputy collector, deputy superintendent of police and police inspectors to chalk out a plan to declare containment zones at Calangute, Candolim, Baga, Arpora, Nagoa and Sinqeirim. While stating that essential commodity shops would be allowed to open from 6am to 1pm, Lobo also said Covid-19 cases are is also spreading in Anjuna, Vagator, Chapora and other parts of coastal belt. “There is a need to stop the spread of the virus. Tourists who are already in hotels, can continue to stay there,” he said. Lobo, who is also the minister for science and technology, said that they have shifted vaccination drive to the Candolim ground as the people are scared to go to the health centre. He also said that “the chief minister has assured to allot more nurses to the Candolim health centre”. Lobo said that all panchayats will write to the owners of halls and ask them to stop wedding receptions at their venues. “The situation is going out of hand in Calangute and nearby villages. Young people have lost their lives,” Martins said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-break-covid-chain-lobo-looks-at-sealing-calangute-for-10-days/articleshow/82282382.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Come clean on Covid-19 fatalities, display boards on deaths: HC to Telangana||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Tuesday found fault with the state government for apparently hiding the real number of Covid-19 deaths and directed it to disclose all such details. “Let there be display boards at the crematoriums and burial grounds that depict the true picture,” the judges said. The bench refused to believe the death figures being furnished by the state and sought to know the number of electric crematoriums in Hyderabad and in the state. It said that it was hearing a disturbing trend of dead bodies piling up in hospitals and burial grounds. Perturbed over distressing accounts emanating from hospitals and burial grounds along with the high positivity rate in Telangana’s districts, the court reviewed the supply situation of essentials like oxygen and drugs. It also directed the state to conduct an oxygen audit. Addressing advocate general BS Prasad, the bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said, “If the state’s intention in hiding death figures is to see that people do not panic, then it may no longer work. Tell them the grim reality. Then they will start taking precautions and adhere to the norms and this will help flatten the curve.” The bench also noted the scant regard being shown to the mortal remains of those who succumb to the virus. It directed the state to keep a sufficient stock of body bags in all hospitals and use them while carrying the dead to crematoriums and burial grounds. “Family members are finding it difficult to get vehicles to carry the dead to the burial grounds because the uncovered bodies are an unwelcome phenomenon. Instead, cover them with body bags and accord the dignity the dead should get,” the bench said. Upset over reports of government drivers at the Gandhi mortuary fleecing devastated families by taking Rs 20,000 for shifting the body from the hospital to their home, the judges directed the state to curb the menace. Also, arrange a sufficient number of hearse vehicles at every hospital, the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/come-clean-on-covid-19-fatalities-display-boards-on-deaths-hc-to-t/articleshow/82282380.cms||---

Talking to TOI, Ayodhya Mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay, said, “We are distributing firewood for free and creating a wood bank in Ayodhya so that kin of the deceased don’t have to pay for last rites of dear ones. We are helpless before God’s wish. According to belief, Ayodhya is ‘mokshdayni' or those cremated here go to heaven, but the cremation count has gone up manifold. After chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed that funerals of Covid victims would be free, I am personally arranging firewood with help of social organisations and creating a wood bank. The money spent is not from the coffers of Ayodhya Municipal Corporation or any government agency.” The mayor’s move comes amid dwindling firewood stock in crematoriums across the state amidst rising Covid fatalities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-mayor-creates-firewood-bank-for-free-cremation-of-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82281452.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Lucknow||‘Ek duje ke liye’: Cop launches a helpline to ease pandemic panic||Lucknow: With the rise in Covid-19 cases, stress and anxiety are clearly at play, especially among people tested positive. In order to help people facing mental fatigue and anger amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, a 46-year-old sub-inspector in PAC Anoop Mishra has launched a mental and physical well-being helpline that acts as a bridge between patients and doctors. Counsellors at ‘Ek duje ke liye’, a stress solution medi-helpline launched two days ago, have been fielding calls on many psychological, medical issues on pre-Covid vaccination and post Covid vaccination in light of the aggressive second wave of Covid-19. Since its inception, the toll-free helpline (9918317707), which is operational from 8 am to 8 pm every day, has received about 50 calls. However, services on the WhatsApp group are available round the clock. As per Mishra, the helpline has been getting a lot of calls, including late night ones, with people expressing panic, anger and a feeling of hopelessness, not knowing when and how the crisis is going to end. “There is confusion about vaccines and protocols. Callers are depressed with the situation being back to square one. They have concerns and fears about the new strain,” Mishra said. Sharing an instance where a caller called him around 1.30 am, Mishra said, “He was so stressed and fearful with his 91 oxygen level that he couldn’t resist calling us so late. “He was consoled only when I gave him my personal example of oxygen level dropping to 85 and few home remedies,” Mishra added. The helpline, which currently has nine doctors from three medical disciplines – allopathy, homoeopathy and Ayurveda, and 10 counsellors, helps people in providing correct information on a range of Covid related issues, apart from providing emotional support. According to psychiatrist Dr Shashwat Saxena, people are extremely distressed and anxious. “They are complaining of obstructions in sleep. People are frustrated by making rounds of the hospital and this is where hopelessness is creeping in. People are also worried about the future of students. We are advising callers to remain calm and focus only on curing the illness,” Dr Shashwat said. Part of the team,psychologist Dr Madhubala said housewives are complaining of excessive workload. “Women are now more responsible to look after their family members, and are finding it difficult to care for themselves. They are more irritable and complain of mental fatigue,” she said. Mishra said that people facing problems can leave a direct message or send messages on the helpline number and they will be allotted time to call a doctor/counsellor from his team. “In case people are unsatisfied, they can come back to us and we will help them again,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ek-duje-ke-liye-cop-launches-a-helpline-to-ease-pandemic-panic/articleshow/82281491.cms||Isha Jain

Although Maqsusi is known for helping the needy since several years, he says that since the past two months, he has had to scale up his food distribution programme due to the Covid crisis. Azhar Maqsusi distributing food to the poor“The number of people to whom we distribute free food has increased manifold since the second wave of Covid hit the city. I cook food for nearly 1,500 people every single day and feed not just the attenders of patients but anyone who is hungry,” said Maqsusi. From harsh weather conditions to paucity of funds, he has seen several obstacles come in his way, but never stopped feeding people. “I have understood within a short time after I started this programme that I cannot afford to relax or stop. There is no holiday for hunger. Neither do we differentiate between caste, creed or religion,” said the 40-year-old, who runs a Plaster of Paris business in the city. After he is done distributing food near Gandhi Hospital, the 40-year-old moves to another location near Dabeerpura flyover, where a large number of people wait for him under the flyover where he also set up a tent for people to eat comfortably under the shade. “I have been eating here from the past two weeks. I don’t have a source of income for the past six months nor a family that I can go to for help. This man has been feeding us free of cost and doesn’t expect anything in return,” said K Janardhan, a beneficiary at Dabeerpura. In addition to food distribution, Maqsusi has come up with a unique idea to start a ‘Wall of Face Mask’ at Dabeerpura flyover for passers-by who can pick up a mask for free to stay safe from coronavirus. The face masks are lined up on a specially-created wall between 4.30 pm to 7 pm every day. “It is just a small contribution from me to create awareness on the use of face mask. Also, there are many people who cannot afford to buy a face mask and they can get it here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hunger-hero-bizman-feeds-the-needy-gives-free-masks/articleshow/82281620.cms||Moulika.KV

The advocate general also admitted that the situation was very much under control a few days ago, but the sudden surge in cases have made a sea change, coupled with the oxygen shortage and the lack of trained manpower. The judges questioned the planned triage to reduce the queue of ambulances outside hospitals and observed that there appeared to be no developments in 15 days. Justice Bhargav Karia questioned the preparedness of the system to deal with the situation in the near future. “What will happen on May 1, when patients will double? Are you ready for that? All patients will be brought and you will allow them to die? There is a projection of an increase to half-a-million patients in 15 days. What is your preparation?” The government conceded that there are barely 50 beds left now. Justice Karia said, “Today we have 14,000 cases and 10% require oxygen beds. There will be estimated 30,000 cases by end of next week. There will be a need for 3,000 beds per day. From where will you bring them?” The judge countered government’s defence that the DRDO hospital can take some pressure off the system. “That will be filled within half a day. Breaking the chain is important.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-to-govt-are-you-ready-for-when-cases-double/articleshow/82280775.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Lawyers seek order to avoid O2 deficit||Ahmedabad: During the hearing of a suo motu PIL on surge of Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, lawyers requested the Gujarat high court to pass urgent orders to address the expected deficit of oxygen in near future, which may result in law and order problem. Senior advocate Shalin Mehta quoted figures from the government’s report and said that the state government received only 975 MT oxygen against requirement of 1,000 MT on April 21. He sounded an alert about the coming days when the state is estimated to require 1,200 MT on April 30, and the Centre has fixed 900 MT allocation on that day. He said that this 300 MT shortfall is little worrisome. He also cited chief secretary Anil Mukim’s letter written on April 16 to the Centre, requesting to increase allocation for Gujarat and estimating the demand of 1,500 MT in future. Advocate Mehta said, “The centre has to allocate. Gujarat is manufacturing oxygen and is giving it to other states like Madhya Pradesh. Gujarat may face shortage today. Some urgent orders are required to avoid the deficit. This could result in law and order problem. Let the Centre immediately allocate adequate quota.” He also called for replication of Vadodara’s decision to keep oxygen filling centres working 24x7. He also sought HC directions for installation of PSA plants in major hospitals. In reply, the state government’s law officer submitted that Gujarat was in comfortable position earlier, but the oxygen demand is increasing day by day. There will be shortage of 292 MT oxygen on April 30 against the allocated quantity. He also said that the state government is pressing hard for increase in allocation. In the meantime, it is focusing on avoiding leakage and wastage by trying to plug loopholes. “We cannot say now, but we were (oxygen) surplus state earlier,” the law officer said. The HC has sought a report on the condition by next week and it also asked the Centre to be ready with necessary material to address the court on May 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lawyers-seek-order-to-avoid-o2-deficit/articleshow/82280726.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Candidates going to polls with new visions for Kolkata’s ‘mini-India’||KOLKATA: One candidate wants to put the area on the international tourism map, another wants to decongest its markets and strengthen infrastructure, while the third candidate wants to improve the living conditions of the workforce that forms the backbone of this constituency. Different candidates have different visions for Jorasanko, the central Kolkata assembly constituency that will go to polls on Thursday. Jorasanko has a diverse population which has earned it the moniker of mini-India. People from almost all parts of the country — and also many Indian Chinese — stay in this area. The constituency boasts of iconic temples, mosques and churches, along with the College Street boipara, Indian Coffee House and Marble Palace. “I will set up a website called Jorasanko.com which will be about the diverse culture, food and languages spoken in this constituency. It will have a list of all the iconic buildings and places to visit. So, somebody visiting Kolkata from Europe or the USA will know that Jorasanko is a must-visit place,” said Vivek Gupta, TMC’s candidate from Jorasanko. He has also been a TMC Rajya Sabha MP. Since Independence, Jorasanko has always elected candidates from the business community, barring on one occasion. In fact till 2001, the Jorasanko assembly constituency was called Burrabazar assembly constituency. Jorasanko also has the largest number of wholesale and retail markets like Posta, Burrabazar, Canning Street and MG Road. It also has the biggest mandis of fruits, flowers, spices and grains. BJP has fielded Meena Devi Purohit for this seat. She is a local resident and has been a ward councillor since 1995. She feels the area needs immediate decongestion and better infrastructure to help the business community. The fate of the Vivekananda flyover which crashed in 2016, killing several people, is still in a limbo. “It is still hanging precariously. So many lives are at risk. My priority will be to find a solution to this problem,” said Purohit. Ajmal Khan of Sanjukta Morcha feels the condition of workers, too, needs to be improved. “They form the backbone of the business ecosystem in Jorasanko, but they live in a very poor condition. We need to modernise their slums, ensure proper water supply and medical facilities,” said Khan. Jorasanko has 11 wards, out of which at least 5 have a substantial Muslim population. Both the TMC and the BJP have changed their candidates this time. “Jorasanko is going to witness a keen contest because both BJP and TMC have good support. The Sanjukta Morcha is trying to harm TMC by eating into its minority vote bank,” said a TMC ward co-ordinator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/candidates-going-to-polls-with-new-visions-for-kolkatas-mini-india/articleshow/82280728.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Ahmedabad||Aadhaar needed only for AMC-quota beds||Ahmedabad: The AMC on Tuesday clarified that the Aadhaar card is mandatory only for the 1,200 beds reserved in hospitals under the corporation quota. It said that currently 152 oxygen beds are available in the city. The AMC said that corona infections are at their peak in the city and the state. “A large number of hospitals in Ahmedabad are flooded with patients from other parts of Gujarat as well as other states,” the AMC said. “It is estimated that currently about 800 patients from outside Ahmedabad are being treated in Ahmedabad hospitals.” The AMC said that with infections surging, most hospitals in Medicity, and Sola Civil, SVP, VS, LG and Shardaben hospitals are full. Currently, most patients require oxygen and hence as on Tuesday only 152 oxygen beds are available in city hospitals. The AMC said that it has designated 168 hospitals as Covid facilities and 180 nursing homes and hospitals as Covid health centres. In addition, 34 hostels, hotels, and halls have been designated as Covid care centres. The city at present has more than 15,000 beds; the figure was only 7,500 in March. During the past fortnight, more than 2,000 oxygen beds have been added. The AMC said some reports indicated that Aadhaar was necessary to get treatment at city hospitals. It reiterated that the card was necessary only at hospitals where it has reserved 20% beds. Aadhaar was necessary for these beds as these facilities have been created for the citizens of Ahmedabad, the AMC said. Currently, about 12,500 patients are taking Covid treatment in Ahmedabad in over 350 hospitals and nursing homes and no Aadhaar was required for admission to these hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aadhaar-needed-only-for-amc-quota-beds/articleshow/82280778.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Police told to act firmly against violators: Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday said that police have been given a free hand to act against those violating Covid norms with the aim to control the spread of the virus. Police will take strict action against violators from Wednesday, he said.  “I have told police that there will be political pressure to not act against violators, but that they carry out enforcement strictly,” Sawant told reporters. He also directed them to initiate stern action against those violating the guidelines and restrictions imposed under Section144. “I have told the PIs to strictly implement all Covid protocols during night curfew and during the day,” the chief minister said. Earlier, Sawant held a meeting with chief secretary Parimal Rai who is also the home secretary, director general of police Mukesh Kumar Meena, DIG, superintendent of police and police inspectors of all police stations across the state over strict implementation of SOPs in the state. “Minimum people should attend social and political events and religious functions in temples, weddings can be held with a maximum of 50 people. We have not asked people to stop weddings, but they should take permission and we will not allow more the 50 persons at a venue and if required we will ask people to leave the wedding venue,” he said. He also said that religious functions like zatras should be stopped and only a few members of the temple committee can perform the necessary rituals. Sawant said that people should offer prayers at home instead of going to temples and mosques. “We have not told to stop economic activities. If a hotel is organising any function with 50% capacity, then let it continue. Economic activities can run with 50% capacity. Film or TV serial shooting is also allowed in the state. But activities at public places have been stopped,” he said. The chief minister said that weekly markets can be organised, but at bigger places, so that there is social distancing. He also said that the state government will not increase the fine for not wearing a face mask. Reacting to the lockdown in Karnataka and Maharashtra, Sawant said that there will be no shortage of essential commodities due to lockdowns in the neighbouring states of Karnataka and Maharashtra as the governments there have not stopped transportation. “I have spoken to those chief ministers and they have assured me that they will not stop transportation,” he said. Asked about health minister Vishwajit Rane’s tweet that around 200 people will die daily due to Covid in the next 10 days, Sawant said that the health minister should be asked to explain his statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/police-told-to-act-firmly-against-violators-sawant/articleshow/82282412.cms||---
---||Meerut||10 people dead in a span of 48 hours in a Meerut village||MEERUT: Ten people have died under mysterious circumstances in Sadharanpur village in Meerut district in the past 48 hours. They were aged between 25 to 60 years. Some of the locals alleged that the deaths were triggered by spurious liquor distributed in the run up to the third phase of panchayat election on Monday, but police maintain they died of natural causes. It all began on Sunday when two people suddenly died. In the next 12 hours, the toll climbed to five. And on Tuesday, the total number of dead was 10, which led to considerable panic among the locals. Family members of some of the deceased claimed the deaths were caused by consuming liquor distributed by the pradhan election candidate. Meanwhile, senior police officials in the district admit to have detained and interrogated two pradhan candidates -- Sanjay Kumar and Maharaj -- after their names surfaced for allegedly distributing liquor among the villagers. “The tenth person who passed away today died of Covid. Of the two who died yesterday, one suffered a heart attack and other was ailing from lung infection. We are investigating the cause of death in every case," said Keshav Kumar, Meerut superintendent of police (rural areas).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/10-people-dead-in-a-span-of-48-hours-in-a-meerut-village/articleshow/82279873.cms||---

The advocate general requested the HC if it could make an observation . The court said, “Why do you want observations? You just call them. You have powers under special laws, you just have to enforce them.” The CJ asked the government to call final year students of MBBS, MD and MS and put them to service. He said even students from nursing and laboratory technician courses can be asked to join in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-told-to-use-powers-to-command-students-doctors-for-hospital-duty/articleshow/82280794.cms||---
---||Meerut||Death of 135 teachers on UP poll duty: HC send notice to EC||MEERUT: Taking note of the reported deaths of 135 teachers, shiksha mitras and investigators assigned panchayat election duty, the Allahabad High Court on Tuesday issued notices to the Uttar Pradesh State Election Commission (UPSEC) and asked why it failed to check non-compliance of Covid guidelines during multiple phases of panchayat elections . The court further asked why action should not be taken against it and its officials, and why those responsible for Covid violations should not be prosecuted. A division bench of Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar further directed UPSEC to “take immediately measures in the remaining phases of panchayat elections to ensure Covid guidelines are complied with, else action would be taken against officials involved in the election process”. “At least 200 teachers” have lost their lives to Covid-19 within a week of returning from panchayat election duties and over 2,000 others are infected, prominent unions representing teachers in Uttar Pradesh have said. In separate letters written to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the associations have appealed that the counting of votes slated for May 2 be shelved. One of the unions asked for the cancellation of voting for the last phase of rural polls, saying several crore people will again throng polling booths amid the raging pandemic and “many more will die”. The unions gave a break-up of deaths in each district and demanded Rs 50lakh in compensation for their families. They also said over 400 family members of the teachers who came in contact have also died. Virendra Mishra, UP spokesperson of Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, told TOI that teachers will boycott the counting if the government doesn’t postpone it. “This was our second letter. The first one was sent before the beginning of the third phase of polling. The real figure of the deaths could be well beyond 200, because figures from several districts have not reached us. Fourth phase is on Thursday and after that there will be counting on May 2. If these two events are postponed, a lot of lives can be saved.” Panchayat elections in UP, which engaged over 2 lakh state government employees, kicked-off on April 15 with at least 2 crore people thronging booths to exercise their franchise in the first phase. UP’s minister of state (independent charge) for primary education, Satish Chandra Dwivedi said, “Election is not conducted by the basic education department. The Election Commission holds it. I cannot comment on the unions’ announcement of a boycott. Their memorandum of demands has been given to the chief minister and a decision will be taken by him.” . TOI had reported earlier that many of the teachers who died were already ill when the call for poll duty came. They had appealed for leniency but it was rejected. Skipping election duty invites legal action. After a show-cause notice, an FIR is registered against those who don’t report to training or reach the designated polling booths. The fear forced thousands in UP to fall in line. UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri district witnessed arguably the maximum casualties at 28. Among them was Poonam Jaiswal (55), a mother of two children and a popular teacher. Her younger sister told TOI, “She had mild symptoms a day after election duty. She was tested at a government facility on April 21, but the report never arrived. Later a test at a private lab confirmed that she was positive for Covid on April 25.” She added: “Poonam’s health deteriorated on April 26. After several hours of struggle, we managed to get a bed but there was no electricity, and no staff to take care of her. As her oxygen level dipped, we started looking for an ambulance to take her Lucknow. But there was no ambulance with an oxygen cylinder. She died as we were trying to arrange the cylinder.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/death-of-135-teachers-on-up-poll-duty-hc-send-notice-to-ec/articleshow/82279891.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Lucknow||Covid-19 testing capacity to be doubled by May 10: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said the Covid-19 testing capacity of the state will be doubled by May 10 and added that full cooperation from private labs will be required to achieve the target. The highest number of tests conducted in a day so far is about 2.25 lakh. The CM said this in a meeting with health specialists, paramedical staff and those associated with private hospitals on Tuesday. To increase participation of private hospitals, nursing homes and Ayush doctors in Covid care, Yogi will be holding virtual meetings with all stakeholders, including nigrani committee members, to convey what the government expects from them. “The virus in this wave is 30-50 times more transmissible than the one in previous wave. To defeat coronavirus we have to be 10 steps ahead of it. I have heard of reports that some doctors are not going for rounds in Covid hospitals. This is not right. We have to think about patients. I have also received complaints that some private hospitals are charging more than prescribed rates. This is condemnable in such a crisis. I appeal to everyone to publicly denounce such people,” the CM said. “In the light of high number of cases, it is necessary to have a back-up for everything, be it workers or other facilities. Retired doctors can be roped in to increase availability of medical staff,” Yogi added. “We have had some good indications over the past few days. The recovery rate is improving. Lucknow has been most affected but in the last four days, data shows that the number of new cases are less than those being discharged,” he added. The CM stressed on the need to strengthen teleconsultation services with the help of IMA and Nursing Homes’ Association. He asked health workers to use print, TV and social media to tell people when they need to be admitted, who requires Remdesivir, and how one can get well staying at home. Giving examples of high risk category people who have recovered, the CM said it would send positive message to the people and reduce fear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-19-testing-capacity-to-be-doubled-by-may-10-yogi/articleshow/82281539.cms||---

The work on setting up of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) had also commenced at the DCHC. “Our endeavour is to complete the six-bed ICU with ventilator facilities in the next two to three weeks. As of now, we are referring patients in need of ICU services to hospitals in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. The upcoming ICU will cost Rs1 crore. We have received adequate funds from the state’s disaster relief fund.” Khadki has recorded a total of 4,755 Covid-19 cases since the outbreak of the virus last year. Of these, 3,781 have got cured, 99 succumbed to the virus and 875 are active cases. The KCB hospital needs 70 to 80 jumbo oxygen cylinders daily. “We had faced oxygen supply issues for few days in the recent past. However, now it is smooth. We are confident of running the oxygen beds comfortably as we are getting supply from three to four agencies now,” Singh said. The KCB had procured all the necessary equipment and machines required for the ICU in the recent past. “But, we could not get a civil contractor to for the construction work. Now, we have found the agency to complete the work,” Ranjit Bhonsle, KCB’s resident medical officer, said. “This facility is a must as we couldn’t shift our critical patients to other hospitals in time due to unavailability of ventilator beds. We had to maintain patients on oxygen supply for some hours. As most of the patients admitted at our hospital are from humble families, they can’t afford treatment at private hospitals. So, this ICU facility would be a big relief,” Bhonsle added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kcb-adds-15-o2-beds-icu-work-begins-at-general-hospital/articleshow/82281573.cms||Sandip Dighe

The Surendranagar district administration refuted claims of Dr Parth Patel, a class-2 medical officer and said that he faced action for misconduct and providing incorrect information.Dr Patel, an MBBS, had joined Dasada CHC in August last year. Recently, Dr Patel wrote a letter to Surendrangar district collector stating that oxygen cylinders were required for emergency treatment but Dasada CHC’s name did not figure in the oxygen cylinder distribution list. “The letter is typed in a hurry. I had empty cylinders and I wanted the district authorities to refill it because the patients first approach CHC and if their SPO2 level is low I need to provide them primary treatment including oxygen support before referring them to covid hospital,” said Dr Patel.He said that CHC was not a covid centre so he had to refer patients to Patdi or Surendranagar hospitals. There are five small oxygen cylinders provided at the CHC. He also claimed that this was the first time he had asked the administration to refile the cylinders.Commenting on the issue, Surendranagar district collector K Rajesh said, “He (Dr Patel) gave wrong facts in the letter that there are 25 covid patients at the CHC. When I checked there was no covid patient admitted there. He himself made the letter written to me viral on social media.”“There were two jumbo cylinders at the CHC for emergency use. I have reported about the conduct of the medical officer to the health department,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/controversy-erupts-over-dasada-chc-doctors-transfer/articleshow/82279984.cms||---

A thousand of them will have ventilators and other paraphrenalia to treat seriously ill Covid-19 patients. Four hundred of these beds will be given to the state-run Gandhi Hospital. At a press conference here on Tuesday, health minister Eatala Rajender said the government had decided to ensure additional supplies of oxygen to hospitals going by what several states had experienced in the past one week over oxygen shortage. “We need 270 tonnes of oxygen and we got allocation of 470 tonnes. Within the next one week, 3,010 additional oxygen beds will be made available. At present, there is a shortfall of oxygen for 500 to 600 beds,” he said. The minister said 300 additional oxygen beds will be allocated to TIMS. MGM Hospital in Warangal, Chest Hospital, Nacharam and Ameerpet hospitals will be given additional oxygen supply. ESI Hospital with 350 beds will also be given oxygen supplies. “We are also making arrangements to see that patients are sent to isolation centres for quick recovery,” he said. He said oxygen support units are made functional in Gandhi, Bhadradri, Karimnagar government hospitals and TIMS, Gachibowli. The minister five oxygen generator machines were permitted by the Centre to Telangana, which can generate 62 lakh liters of oxygen daily. “In addition to this, we have appealed to the Centre to grant another 12 machines to generate oxygen,” he said. He said oxygen shortage is felt more in smaller hospitals which depend on dealers.  “A team of IAS officers is monitoring the oxygen supply and procurement,” said the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/big-boost-as-govt-hosps-get-3k-more-oxygen-beds/articleshow/82280970.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Take stringent measures to arrest Covid-19 surge, says experts||HYDERABAD: Pandemic and health experts in Telangana have warned that coronavirus cases could rise significantly if more stringent steps are not taken to contain the virus. As the state reported over 1.36 lakh cases between March 17 and now, experts said the same number was reached in five months in 2020 from March 2 to August 2020, during the first wave. Experts say the beginning of the second wave can now be identified as the third week of March and the state’s caseload has been racing upwards ever since. The caseload increased at a much faster rate over the last ten days when little over 70,000 cases were reported. Experts are also worried about the high positivity rate in the state. “The increasing Covid-19 positivity rate from less than one per cent three months back to almost around five to six per cent now shows that the Covid-19 cases are increasing at a higher rate than expected in Telangana during the second wave,” Dr Subodh Kandamuthan, professor and director at ASCI’s Centre for Health Care Management said. “Cases are increasing not just in GHMC area but also in other districts. A high positivity rate despite the government increasing daily testing over the last few days is a cause of worry as it indicates that there could be a further surge,” Dr Kandamuthan added. According to ICMR-certified researcher Dr Kiran Madala, WHO considers a 5% test positivity rate as a threshold. “When compared to neighbouring states, the situation is comparatively better in Telangana,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/take-stringent-measures-to-arrest-surge-experts/articleshow/82280902.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Shuaib Khatib, chairman of Juma Masjid of Bombay Trust, said many members of the community have been hesitant to take the jab and therefore they are of the opinion that starting a centre in their premises would encourage them to put aside their apprehensions. “The premises were kept reserved for medical purposes only, so what’s better than starting a vaccination centre on a temporary basis? Cold storage and other necessary infrastructure would be provided by our trust for the benefit of the public,” said Khatib. Amin Patel, Congress MLA from the area, said he has already forwarded the trust’s request letter to the BMC and will be pursuing it. Patel, an MLA from Mumbadevi, said he has also given the BMC a list of six other locations, including municipal dispensaries, where vaccination centres can be started. “One of it is also the Najam Baug banquet hall, which was turned into a Covid centre in the past,” said Patel. Meanwhile, Andheri MLA Ameet Satam has also written to the BMC to make use of the Andheri Sports Complex and start a mega vaccination centre at the spot, considering the facilities and holding capacity. “With increasing queues for vaccination and scenes of senior citizens waiting in scorching heat for their turn, it has become extremely important to streamline a plan and strategise the vaccination exercise by taking it to big centres that have a lot of space and facilities,” said Satam in his letter. BJP corporator Nehal Shah, too, has written to the BMC to begin vaccination centres in two schools at Dadar East and Antop Hill. Shah said it was important to open more centres for citizens where physical distancing can be maintained. BMC officials said while they have already begun talks with all political representatives for starting vaccination centres, schools may be avoided in case they needing to reopen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/juma-masjid-offers-bmc-its-south-mumbai-premises-for-vax-drive/articleshow/82282482.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Dehradun||Spot report: Traffic snarls witnessed on the first day of ‘Covid-19 curfew’ in Dehradun||DEHRADUN: Despite a ban on unnecessary movement of private vehicles, traffic was witnessed in almost every part of the city on Tuesday, the first day of the Covid-19 curfew restrictions. Long queues of vehicles were witnessed at check posts set up by the police. Those who had ventured out of their homes without a valid excuse were fined by the officials. "I witnessed heavy traffic in the Race Course area when I stepped out of my house to purchase milk. This curfew will only work if people avoid unnecessary movement," said Anuj Lal, a resident of the Race Course area. A TOI spot visit revealed that auto-rickshaws and e-rickshaws continued to ferry travellers despite curfew restrictions. The drivers of these commercial vehicles avoided using main roads to not get caught by the police. “If we sit at home for a week, our families will die of starvation.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Marginal drop in corona tally for second day on trot||LUCKNOW: The daily count of coronavirus cases recorded a decline for the second consecutive day in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday. As per the state health bulletin, 32,993 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours. “This was about 500 cases lesser than the Monday count of 33,574,” said additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad. However, data indicatedthat the number of new cases declined only because of dip in the number of daily tests. While 1,84,144 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours, 1,86,346 tests were conducted a day before. The number of tests declined despite chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s order to conduct at least two lakh Covid-19 tests every day. “Over 50% of these tests must be conducted through RT-PCR methodology,” the CM has instructed. Experts warn against turning complacent. “Decline in daily cases may appear to be good news, but numbers can be deceptive. Here the decline is an outcome of the decrease in number of tests and, therefore, is in no way indicative of any relief from the pandemic,” said a senior researcher at King George’s Medical University, Lucknow. Public health experts have advised people not to lower the guard against the virus. “The peak is yet to arrive in UP. In fact, as per the indications from various mathematical models, UP is likely to record Covid-19 peak between May 12 and 15. And so far, prevention has proved to be the best safeguard against the disease. The other dependable tool is vaccination but then many are yet to take the jab,” said SGPGI director Prof RK Dhiman. Meanwhile, the new cases took the state tally to 11,53,097, including 3,06,458 active cases, of whom 2.5 lakh are under home isolation. Of the total, 8,34,961 cases, including 30,398, have recovered while 11,678 died. In the past 24 hours, Covid claied 265 lives in UP. Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Meerut and Gorakhpur remained the biggest contributors to the list of new cases and deaths in the past 24 hours. UP first state to conduct 4cr Covid tests: UP became the first Indian state to have conducted more than four crore Covid-19 tests in the country on Tuesday. ACS, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said more than four crore Covid-19 tests have been done in UP since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020. Data from the Indian Council of Medical Research shows that 14.2% of the over 28 crore Covid-19 tests undertaken in the country have been done in UP. 40 new RTPCR machines to intensify testing: In a bid to intensify Covid-19 testing, UP government has placed order for 40 new RT-PCR machines. An official release citing the CM said the proportion of RT-PCR tests must be intensified so that any hidden cases are identified at the earliest. The CM also congratulated health and medical education department officials for enabling the state become the first in the country to have undertaken four crore Covid tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/marginal-drop-in-corona-tally-for-2nd-day-on-trot/articleshow/82281569.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Under the agreement, Dr Reddy’s and Hetero, along with Cipla, Emcure Pharmaceuticals and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, will manufacture and supply Molnupiravir to India and over 100 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Merck said it has inked these agreements to accelerate Molnupiravir availability in India and other LMICs following approvals or emergency authorisation by local regulatory agencies. The announcement comes a day after Hyderabad-based Natco Pharma and Optimus Pharma said they have applied for emergency approval to conduct Phase III clinical trials of Molnupiravir on mild to moderate non-hospitalised Covid patients. The oral antiviral drug, being developed by Merck in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, inhibits the replication of multiple RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. It is being studied in a Phase III trial for the treatment of non-hospitalised patients with confirmed Covid-19. “The scale of human suffering in India is devastating and more must be done to help alleviate it. These agreements will help accelerate access to Molnupiravir in India and around the world,” Merck chairman & CEO Kenneth C Frazier, said. Hetero Group chairman, Dr B Partha Saradhi, said: “We are vertically integrated to manufacture and commercially ready to supply this product to patients swiftly across the country. We will be immediately approaching the DCGI to seek regulatory pathway...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/merck-inks-pact-with-dr-reddys-hetero-for-molnupiravir/articleshow/82280993.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

By the use of Unani formulations, the researcher hopes to break the receptor protein of the novel coronavirus by using poly protein strategy (four different types of proteins needed for the architecture of the virus). This would inhibit the virus from infecting the host cells (humans). The formulation is a combination of plant-based Unani drugs, including aloevera, commiphora myrrh and saffron. Currently, 300 volunteers are under trial for a known Unani preparation, being researched by Dr Hasmi’s Unani Medicine Observation and Research Foundation, Hyderabad. They were registered for clinical trials by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) two months back. “The clinical trials have commenced and the Broad Spectrum Antiviral Prophylactic Medicine (Unani) has started giving positive results. The subjects in the clinical trials are administered oral medicine in the form of tablets in dosage of 1 tablet each before food in morning and night. The immunity level of the subjects have improved and this medicine is targeting spike proteins, which is the main cause for the coronavirus to multiply in the host subject. The number of subjects taken up for trial till now are 300. There are no adverse effects to the oral medicine administered to the subjects,” Dr Mujtaba Ali Hasmi, the principal researcher, said, adding that around 150 more volunteers would be included in the trials. The research is based on previous evidence of herd immunity through similar medicines. “The literature in Unani system of medicine shows the use of BSAPM to induce immunity and herd immunity against various types of virus-induced diseases,” as per the research paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/countrys-only-unani-trial-to-tackle-coronavirus-underway-in-old-city/articleshow/82281016.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||CBI court to hear YSRC MP’s plea on Jagan bail cancellation||Hyderabad: Principal special judge BR Madhusudhan Rao of CBI courts in Hyderabad on Tuesday brushed aside the objections of the court registry over maintainability of a case filed by disgruntled YSRC MP K Raghu Rama Krishna Raju seeking cancellation of bail given to AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in the quid pro quo case. The judge directed the registry to post the case for hearing. The registry had raised the objection because in such cases it is only the prosecution or some related party that can raise such pleas. Third parties who were not related to the criminal case cannot interfere was the crux of the objection. Petitioner’s counsel S Sri Venkatesh furnished to the court the orders of Supreme Court that held that even ordinary citizens can approach the court in such matters. Citing judgments of the SC, the petitioner said the plea for seeking cancellation of bail can be filed by aggrieved third parties also. The CBI court may issue a notice to Jagan when it takes up the hearing of the plea. The Narsapur MP in his petition charged Jagan with excessive use of police force for suppressing dissent voices in the state. He alleged that a fear psychosis is prevailing in the society due to Jagan’s high-handed approach. Added to this was the behaviour of his partymen who are intolerant of any criticism of the party and its leadership. Expressing an apprehension in his petition, Raju said: “Since all the witnesses cited by the prosecution in the quid pro quo case have now become subjects of Jagan, he will influence them not to depose against him before the trial court.” The MP alleged that Jagan was abusing his official position for the purpose and cited important positions given to persons who were co-accused in the quid pro quo case.  The appointment of accused IAS officer Y Srilakshmi as a special chief secretary and retired IAS officer and co-accused M Samuel as an advisor to the government were also mentioned by the petitioner. The CM’s complaint against a sitting SC judge, who later became CJI, and his critical approach towards the AP high court was also mentioned. Non-appearance before the trial court and seeking exemptions were also cited as violations of bail conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbi-court-to-hear-ysrc-mps-plea-on-jagan-bail-cancellation/articleshow/82280761.cms||---

It has requested the Centre to consider increasing remdesivir quota for Gujarat on priority basis, principal health secretary Jayanti Ravi has claimed in her affidavit.The government has said that against its orders for procurement of 10.39 lakh remdesivir vials since April 1, it has received 5.17 lakh injections till date.On HC’s direction to frame a state policy, the government said that it has modified distribution policy in the changed scenario and now the distribution channel is managed by the Gujarat Medical Supplies Corporation Ltd (GMSCL). It distributes injections on pro-rata basis to each district and corporation after receiving their requirements. The district authorities will send injections to all hospitals after they send details of patients requiring remdesivir. GMSCL considers requests of private hospitals also. The government explained the mechanism to send remdesivir to private hospitals. Between April 21 and 23 in Ahmedabad, GMSCL gave 16,220 vials to hospitals including 2,160 injections to AMC hospitals, 1,305 to designated hospitals and 1,010 injections to private hospitals. It said that the government has come up with a detailed treatment guideline for all types of Covid patients depending upon their severity. It asserted there are “no studies to state that remdesivir clears viral load”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/remdesivir-quota-cut-after-centres-policy/articleshow/82264226.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Poll-bound areas a concern as cases spike||Hyderabad: Areas heading for municipal polls such as Warangal, Khammam, Siddipet, and Nagarkurnool are beginning to add more cases of Covid-19 to the state tally. As per Tuesday’s reports, the state’s daily case tally crossed the 10,000-mark since the pandemic outbreak of which 653 cases were recorded in Warnagal Urban, the highest daily count ever recorded for the area. The trend of cases has been similar in other poll-bound municipal areas too, especially for corporations of Warangal and Khammam where political parties have been flexing their muscles to wrest power. In Khammam, 424 cases were added as per Tuesday’s reports, a jump from 118 cases just 48 hours before. Both these districts, where winning the municipal corporation has become a matter of pride, had reported below 200 cases just five days but are now accounting for some of the highest numbers in the state. The situation is similar in Nalgonda where 469 cases were recorded — sixth-highest in the state — and Siddipet where 230 cases. With many refusing to take part in campaigns, regular pre-surveys for such elections have also stalled. “In fact, it has been observed that political parties are hiring labourers to campaign for money as they don’t have any work due to current situation. This might lead to a crisis among poorer sections who won’t be able to afford treatment if they contract severe disease,” said SK Vali, a resident of Nakrikel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/poll-bound-areas-a-concern-as-cases-spike/articleshow/82281029.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Eatala said the government had issued directives to hospitals on charges to be collected but some of them had been charging more. He added the government is trying to help small hospitals get injections from the companies directly.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Private labs violating govt pricing caps, charging exorbitant rates for RT-PCRs||HYDERABAD:With more locals testing positive, private diagnostic laboratories which are essential in identifying infections have started exploiting the situation by charging more than the government-fixed price caps. Current prices for testing have been capped at Rs 500 but it has been found that laboratories are charging anywhere between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,000 for a single RT-PCR test for samples collected at the lab. Similarly for home collection of samples, these labs are charging anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,200. The government-fixed cap for testing with home collections is capped at Rs 750. Posing as a potential customer, TOI contacted at least half-a-dozen private diagnostic centres located in various parts of the city. None of these labs had an explanation as to why they were charging above the price cap. “I had to get my 62-year-old father tested for Covid-19 because he started showing symptoms. Since he is an aged person, I ordered a home collection from a private diagnostic centre. I was expecting they would charge me Rs 750 per as per government order, but it cost me Rs 2000,” said Zubeida Begum, a resident of Aghapura. While the government has 19 designated centres for RT-PCR testing, 56 private labs have been approved for testing as per data from health ministry. TOI has also acquired copies of receipts from customers who have been charged above the government-fixed prices. “While the cap for testing is fixed at Rs 500 for sample collection at labs, I was charged Rs 1000 for my son’s tests at a private diagnostic centre in Kondapur,” said K Pravalika, a resident of Moosapet. Despite agreeing to charging Rs 1,000 for each RT-PCR test at their branches, executives at the private diagnostic centre refused to connect TOI with higher officials when asked for a clarification. “It is the government’s priority to increase testing and they must ensure that these private laboratories do not overburden citizens. They must demand all details from such laboratories,” said patient care coordinator at Osmania General Hospital, Dr P Rohith. Dr P Rohith, patient care coordinator at Osmania General Hospital said. When the issue of charging Rs 1,050 for testing by a private diagnostic centres was raised by a user on Twitter, public health director G Srinivasa Rao said that his department will get it enquired.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/private-labs-violating-govt-pricing-caps-charging-exorbitant-rates-for-rt-pcrs/articleshow/82280946.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Meerut||Medical college principal suspended after 40 oxygen cylinders found unused for months due to disrepair||MEERUT: At a time when acute shortage of oxygen cylinders is leading to deaths of Covid patients, at least 40 cylinders with faulty nozzles were found lying unattended at a medical college in Uttar Pradesh for several months. The medical college is an L3 Covid facility and has 300 beds allocated for Covid patients. There were 215 patients on Tuesday. When the news about the criminal negligence came to light, state administration suspended principal Dinesh Kumar Singh Mataolia of Saharanpur's Shaikh-Ul Hind Maulana Mahmood Hasan Medical College. The medical college has in its possession 300 cylinders out of which 40 were in the state of disrepair. There are allegations that despite repeated reminders by oxygen supply in-charge and the firm that refills cylinders, no adequate steps were taken. "Wear and tear of cylinders keep occurring in course of usage, and since no technician comes for one or two cylinders so these faulty cylinders keep piling up. Now, there is a sudden requirement of oxygen supply due to Covid surge. Hospital authorities and district administration were also informed," Nawab Singh, the oxygen in-charge, told TOI. "The demand for oxygen cylinders is very high at present. We need around 600-700 cylinders on a daily basis. We procure them through multiple agencies like BHEL Haridwar, Roorkee, Meerut and local agencies," Singh said. Taking cognizance, the UP health department, in its order, observed, "The principal has been found to be of lackadaisical attitude not only in the repair of oxygen cylinders but also too much delay in the RT-PCR (Covid test) reports. Investigation revealed that the results of at least 5,000 RT-PCR reports were lying incomplete as on April 20." There are more than 3,000 active Covid cases in Saharanpur at the moment, and over 30,000 daily positive cases in the state. The suspended principal could not be reached for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/medical-college-principal-suspended-after-40-oxygen-cylinders-found-unused-for-months-due-to-disrepair/articleshow/82279970.cms||Sandeep Rai

With the second wave of Covid-19 in Bengal, do leaders now regret for not being more cautious about wearing masks in their rallies? On Monday, Parno Mitra, who is BJP’s candidate from Baranagar, took to social media to share that she had tested Covid positive. Currently, she is in home isolation and has a “bad headache”. “My sister had tested Covid positive 15 days ago. I wasn’t at home then. Now I’ve come home after more than a month. My mother has a separate entry and so she is safe.” On being asked about wearing masks on the trail, she said, “I wore it when it was possible. People want to see the face. I was constantly wearing a mask on the 17th – the day of polling. My sister, who didn’t attend any of my rallies, also got infected. In fact, I didn't get it when she was infected. My reports came in on Sunday,” she said. Parno Mittra on her campaign trailBJP’s Tollygunge candidate Babul Supriyo is in home isolation. On being asked if he regrets not wearing a mask always, he said, “No. I am a public servant. I have worn masks on most occasions and also tried to tell everyone to wear it too. But people want to see the face. While campaigning, I would stand on top of a jeep. So, there was a distance between me and the people. I would open my mask when it got very hot.” Barrackpore’s TMC candidate Raj Chakrabarty, whose wife Subhashree Ganguly is now recovering from Covid, got an RT-PCR test done before returning home on Saturday. When he had refused to open mask, he was accused of being arrogant. “When I had refused to open his mask, I was told ‘jetar aagei katha shunchhen na toh jitle ki hobe? (You are not listening before winning. Wonder what will happen afterwards!)’ I had to oblige. From 8 am to 2 am, I was out. My kurta would be dripping wet and it was difficult to keep the mask on. Subhashree was repeatedly asked to open her mask. When she said she had a child at home, mothers would point at their own kids and say she needn’t worry,” he said. But in hindsight, Raj feels he ought to have been “more careful” and “firm”. Death of candidates unnerved him too. On April 15, Congress candidate for the Shamshergunj constituency Rezaul Haque had died of the infection. Jangipur’s Revolutionary Socialist Party candidate Pradip Nandy has also succumbed to the virus. “The death of Kajal Sinha, TMC’s Khardaha candidate on Sunday, is shocking. On May 2, I am going to wear the mask all the time. I cannot take any more chances,” Raj added. Bankura’s TMC candidate Sayantika Banerjee got her Covid test done on April 2. “Initially, I was skeptical about campaigning without a mask. But I was assured by locals and medical team that the first wave had not impacted people much there. Now I am always wearing a mask,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/had-to-take-off-masks-on-occasions-say-candidates/articleshow/82280745.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Delhi||Toll goes past 15k with 381 fresh Covid-19 deaths in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Amid its deadliest wave of Covid-19 cases, the capital witnessed two grim milestones on Tuesday — the highest number of fatalities in a day at 381 and the overall toll crossing the 15,000 mark. In the past 24 hours, 381 people succumbed to Covid-19, surpassing the figure of 380 recorded on Monday. Earlier, on Thursday and Saturday, Delhi had reported maximum 357 deaths in a day. On Tuesday, the overall toll reached 15,009, since the first death recorded in Delhi on March 13, 2020. This month, the capital has recorded 3,982 deaths, with an average daily count of 147.5. In March, the average was around 4. The number of new cases recorded on Tuesday was 24,149, with a positivity rate of 32.72%. In the past 24 hours, the health department data shows, 73,811 tests were conducted — 46,581 RT-PCR and 27,230 rapid antigen tests. The number of active cases has reached an all-time high of 98,264, of which 54,578 are in home isolation. In April second week, the city conducted over one lakh tests, of which nearly 70,000 were done using RT-PCR, considered the gold standard for testing Covid-19. While the number of tests has come down, the positivity rate remains high. On Tuesday, it was slightly less than 35.02% recorded on Monday, when fewer tests were carried out. The figures show that the infection is still widespread with nearly every third person tested being positive. Delhi reported 36.2% positivity rate, the highest so far, on April 22. The huge surge in cases have meant that the availability of ICU beds has fallen sharply. As of 11.30pm, only 13 of the 4,742 ICU beds were available for Covid-19 patients, with many looking for the same in neighbouring Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida and even Greater Noida. Out of the 20,751 oxygen beds, 18,841 are occupied. The dedicated Covid Care Centres have 5,525 beds, out of which 528 are occupied, and, of the 196 beds in Covid Health Centres, 168 are occupied. The number of containment zones in Delhi has also reached an all-time high of 31,570. The doctors say only 15% of the Covid-19 patients require admission to hospitals. The rest, 85%, can be managed at home. Doctors say patients under home isolation should check oxygen saturation at least once in six hours. “If oxygen saturation is staying about 94%, there is nothing to worry about. If it is falling, one should consult his or her physician to decide the next course of action,” Dr Arun Gupta, president of Delhi Medical Council, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/toll-goes-past-15k-with-381-fresh-deaths/articleshow/82281608.cms||---
---||Kolkata||In death too, doc gives new lease of life to four||Kolkata: In a career spanning three decades, obstetrician/gynaecologist Amiya Bhusan Sarkar had got many babies delivered and saved several lives. In death, too, he gave a new lease of life to at least four persons who will get his organs. Sarkar’s organs were harvested after he was declared brain dead on Monday. He was undergoing treatment at a city hospital following an accident on Thursday, in which he had sustained serious head injuries. This is the third organ donation in Kolkata this year. The first organ donation was done on February 5 and the second on March 2. But this was definitely the most challenging, said doctors, in the middle of a second wave that is more infectious than the past. Doctors at Apollo Gleneagles not only overcame the challenges to ensure that the wish of Sarkar's family was honoured but doctors at four other hospitals, where his organs were transplanted, also did a commendable job. Sarkar's heart went to Narayana Super Speciality Hospital where it will be transplanted on a 30-year-old man. This is the second heart transplant for the Howrah hospital team to take up this year after the one in March. The liver was flown to Artemis Hospital, Gurgaon while the kidneys were sent for transplant to RN Tagore and Command Hospital. Since no match was found for liver, it has been offered to the National Organ & Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO). The lung was also in a good shape but no patient could be found for it. “Hats off to the doctors and medical team of all hospitals where the organs will be transplanted during this pandemic. Everyone owes a special thank to the family of the deceased as they stepped forward for the donation,” said nephrologist and Regional Organ & Tissue Transplant Organization (ROTTO) joint director, Arpita Raychaudhuri. The rare AB blood group of the donor posed a challenge to Apollo and even ROTTO and NOTTO after the family consented to donate his organs as prospective recipients were hard to come by, recounted Apollo Hospitals Group CEO (eastern region), Rana Dasgupta. The donor’s son, an orthopaedic surgeon, said: “My father always wanted to serve the people. That was his practice of religion. That’s why it was easy for me to take this decision.” An alumnus of Medical College, Kolkata, where he did the MBBS, and SSKM, where he did the MD and G&O, Sarkar had worked during the pandemic without taking an off and had even got infected once during the first wave. Though a resident of New Town, he lived in Tamluk where he was posted at the East Midnapore District Hospital. On Thursday evening, he was returning from the hospital when he met with the fatal accident. He was brought to Apollo Gleneagles the next day. The first cadaver organ donation in eastern India since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, had also happened at Apollo Kolkata on August 17, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-death-too-doc-gives-new-lease-of-life-to-four/articleshow/82280787.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The hospitals have claimed that they have been struggling to meet the growing oxygen demand with almost “little or no help” from the district administration. A video of patients struggling to stay afloat in the absence of oxygen at state-run Lala Lajpat Rai Medical College here also surfaced on Monday. “There are 48 patients (both Covid and non-Covid) at our hospital who have been on continuous oxygen support. We need 150 oxygen cylinders every day. Even as we keep trying to manage cylinders the entire day, most of the time we get it at the last moment,” said Praveen Kumar, a medical staffer at a private hospital. Kin of the patients admitted to these hospitals have been on their toes to arrange oxygen cylinders with the hospitals alerting them about the shortage. Despite the state government putting a cap on the individual supply, people have been queuing up outside oxygen refill centres desperately looking for a cylinder for their ailing kin. The situation has worsened for those who have their ailing kin on oxygen support at home. “So many retweets, yet no help. We have been running from one point to another to get oxygen refilled in this scorching heat daily. My parents are on oxygen support, and I am crying for help,” said Umam Khanam, a city-based law graduate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/patients-gasp-for-breath-as-several-hospitals-run-out-of-oxygen/articleshow/82279978.cms||---

The court also summoned the concerned records from the trial courts. A bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha and justice Rajeev Singh passed the order on the three appeals filed individually, conducting hearing through video conferencing in the matters. The Lucknow’s special MPMLA Court in last week of December 2020 had acquitted Mukhtar in three cases for want of evidence. Filing appeals against the acquittals, the state government pleaded that there was evidence of one witness who had deposed against Mukhtar in his examination in chief but the trial court erred in not relying on the said evidence. It was also pleaded that in the Gangster Act case, the same trial court again failed to appreciate the evidence on record and the purpose of the Act in recording Mukhtar’s acquittal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mukhtars-acquittal-govts-appeals-to-be-heard-after-3-weeks/articleshow/82281619.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Colva police inspector Anand Shirodkar said that a special drive was undertaken in February against those violating standard operating procedures by not wearing masks in public. The fine for not wearing face masks is Rs 200. The inspector said that a large number of defaulters wear masks below their mouths which is as good as not wearing a mask. “We not only collected fines, but also tried to educate tourists and locals visiting beaches on the need to wear masks to contain the spread of the virus,” the inspector further said. In the past few weeks since the rise in Covid-19 cases across the country, including Goa, the footfalls on beach stretches have drastically dropped.

Treatment, tracking and vaccination are the other three. Many people in the cities are not getting their reports. We have information that testing is extremely low in the rural areas. If the state falters on pillar number one, how can the virus be ever defeated,” she said, asking the government to increase testing centres. In a 10-point charter of suggestions, Priyanka said: “Don’t hide Covid-19 cases and deaths. Rather introduce transparency to effectively manage the situation.” Priyanka also offered to help the state government in coronavirus containment. In her letter, Priyanka also raised concern over the shortage of life-saving medicines and black marketing of oxygen was adding to the misery of the grief stricken families. Stating that middle men were taking advantage of the crisis situation and over-charging from the people she urged the CM to think about the plight of the middle and lower class people. She said that she was pained to see how relatives were suffering at crematoriums and burial grounds for hours to get their dear ones a respectable end and asked the CM to introduce a proper system to make it easier for the aggrieved families. “Please don’t leave people to their fate in this battle of human survival,” she said. The last concern raised by Priyanka related to the slow pace of vaccination in the state. “It has been over four months since the vaccination programme was launched in UP but not even one crore persons have been vaccinated in the state. This is a missed opportunity,” she stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dont-hide-covid-19-data-priyanka-writes-to-yogi/articleshow/82281595.cms||Shailvee Sharda

In the wake of the prevailing pandemic situation, final-year students of Delhi University (DU) are demanding that the online open book examination should be deferred. The online exam for final-year undergraduate and master’s students is scheduled to be held between May and June. Different student organisations have written to the university in this regard and an online petition, which states that this is not the right time to make students sit through an exam, has also been started. With the #StudentLivesMatter, students have started the petition on change.org asking for either cancellation or postponement of exams. “Covid-19 has in the past month wreaked havoc on the lives of so many of us — our families, friends, professors are all reeling from its onslaught. The virus has taken far too many lives, and each day is a struggle to keep ourselves physically and mentally strong and safe. In light of the fear and uncertainty that this has brought us to, it is quite appalling that students and teachers alike are expected to proceed with the scheduled OBE. The distress of our times should have warranted a sensitivity to our well-being, overriding this need to achieve targets and keep to schedule,” read the petition. Students have also questioned the university’s proposal to hold offline exams for those without internet. “With the absence of any real possibility of taking the exams offline for students who lack internet resources, given the sudden surge in cases, the university’s offer of an offline mode as alternative is bizarre,” it added. All India Students’ Association has requested the university to find an alternative form of assessment. DU officials did not respond to queries on this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/our-lives-matter-defer-exams-at-du-students/articleshow/82281671.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Ministry of Defence on Tuesday identified 51 “high-pressure” ECHS centres across the country. Pune, Khadki and South Pune (Lohegaon) figure among these “high-pressure” centres, which will get contractual staff, including one medical officer, nursing assistant, pharmacist, driver and chowkidar. They will be hired through the respective station headquarters for night duty, beyond normal working hours, for a period of three months. A senior army officer told TOI, “Many veterans at different locations can’t get required help at night as the ECHS does not have staffers to work at night. The veterans have even complained to the service headquarters and the ministry about the problem. Considering the current need, the ministry has taken the decision to ensure availability of medical help at night.” An ECHS centre in-charge here said, “This will be a big relief as veterans will get proper medical advice, medicines in crisis time and other emergency assistance from the team. Their mandate will be to address concerns raised by veterans. The centres will even tie up with impanelled hospitals to provide timely medical care to needy patients in the city.” Commander Ravindra Pathak (retired), said, “Now, ECHS work during the day. There is no dedicated mechanism to help veterans. In the midst of Covid emergency, the ministry has taken an apt decision as many veterans have to run from the pillar to post for help. Many veterans are in their 70s and 80s and they need support. Even telephone consultation will help them.” Colonel Vinay Dalvi (retired) said, “The respective station headquarters should hire staffers at the earliest as we are passing through a very difficult situation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/soon-night-time-medical-consultation-for-ex-servicemen-from-echs-centres/articleshow/82281640.cms||Sandip Dighe

Before the announcement of lockdown in April, 275 buses were operating. Now, only 50 buses are plying. The revenue from these city buses is just Rs 2.80 lakh per day as compared to Rs 20 lakh per day when situation was normal. According to information received from the department, before lockdown around 85,000 passengers were travelling in the city buses per day that has now gone down to 14,000 per day. The revenue of the department has decreased and employee’s association has demanded at the time when there is lockdown and most of the employees are not vaccinated, then the buses should stop functioning. JCTSL Employees Union spokesperson Babulal said, “The minimum cost to run a bus is around Rs 14 per km but at present we are able to generate only Rs 5. None of the staff is vaccinated. Then why are we running the buses at present. We are demanding to pause the operations till the situation improves.” A senior JCTSL official said, “We understand that there is a demand to shut down the bus services, but at least we are able to generate some revenue. If we will shut down the entire machinery then how we are supposed to pay the salaries that are already delayed.” He further said that even in lockdown 14,000 passengers are still travelling as some form of public transport is needed. The department has claimed to be taking all the necessary precautions including sanitisation daily, all the passengers will have to sit in the seats available instead of standing. There is an order issued about the rules to be followed in the buses however, with the number of cases rising department might force to take a decision sooner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jctsl-revenue-takes-a-nosedive/articleshow/82281633.cms||---
---||India||Oxygen demand to spike in Delhi, 6 states by April 30: Govt in SC||NEW DELHI: If medical oxygen demand is an indicator of the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Centre’s affidavit before the Supreme Court predicts a harder time for seven populous states — Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi and Chhattisgarh — where demand for oxygen is estimated to increase significantly by April 30. Forecasting the requirement of medical oxygen by April 30 in its affidavit, the Union government said Maharashtra would require 2,000 tonnes (as against 1,500 tonnes on April 20), Gujarat 1,200 MT (1,000 MT), Uttar Pradesh 800 MT (400 MT), Madhya Pradesh 700 MT (445 MT), Delhi 445 MT (300 MT), Chhattisgarh 382 MT (215 MT) and Tamil Nadu 465 MT (200 MT). Forecast for oxygen requirement for Karnataka was 111 MT on April 30 as against 300 MT on April 20 and that for Punjab was 82 MT (126 MT). On April 30, the 12 high caseload states will require 6,593 MT of medical oxygen, the Centre said and thanked the steel industry for giving the country the much needed gas at a time of dire need. “Steel industry has supplied 1,43,000 MT of medical oxygen since September 2020. In April, the supply of medical oxygen by the steel sector increased from 1,000 MT a day in the first week of April to around 2,600 MT on April 21,” the Centre said. Appearing for the Centre, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the government has banned supply of oxygen for all industrial purposes except for the medical industry since April 22 as “medical oxygen is a critical component in treatment of Covid-affected patients”. Narrating the national mechanism that monitors oxygen production, availability and supply chain 24x7, Mehta told a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S R Bhat that oxygen express trains were given green corridors for non-stop transportation. He said 50,000 MT medical oxygen would be imported in the next three months and India was on the path to increase oxygen tankers from 1,224 at present to 2,000 tankers. “Efforts are being made to increase availability of oxygen tankers to more than 2,000 through conversion of 50% of existing nitrogen and argon tankers (around 600) to transport oxygen as well as through import of 138 cryogenic tankers for oxygen,” he added. The Centre’s affidavit said, “The Union government, with active and constant supervision and direct involvement of the prime minister and the home minister, is augmenting oxygen supply on a war footing”. On supply of Remdesivir injections, the Centre’s affidavit made a detailed presentation of the availability of the medicine that appears to be in short supply. The Centre said seven Indian companies were under licence from Gilead, US, for manufacturing Remdesivir. Because of the lull before the storm in the present second wave, the companies had considerably scaled down their production. But the seven companies, which were producing 27 lakh vials per month, are expected to produce 90 lakh vials per month by May, as the government on April 12 approved 31 additional manufacturing sites for the seven companies in addition to the 22 existing ones. The Centre said it had allotted 11 lakh vials of Remdesivir to states between April 21 and 30. On April 24, it revised the allocation to 16 lakh vials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oxygen-demand-to-spike-in-delhi-6-states-by-april-30-govt-in-sc/articleshow/82283588.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Swamy (83), in his appeal filed in the HC on Monday, has challenged an order passed by a sessions court here last month refusing him bail. The jailed activist is seeking bail citing his old age and on the grounds that he is suffering from multiple ailments. The sessions court, while refusing bail to Swamy, had noted that factors like old age will not go in favour of the accused considering that there was a prima facie case against him for hatching a “conspiracy to overthrow the government”.

---||Ahmedabad||‘People need to restrict themselves’||Ahmedabad: Lockdown is not a solution and the people themselves should consider strict restrictions, said Gujarat high court on Tuesday after lawyers raised the demand for imposition of lockdown to curb Covid-19 spread. Citing looming oxygen deficit, senior advocate Shalin Mehta submitted that though HC cannot impose lockdown, the government may consider it like Germany, London, Singapore, and New Zealand. He argued that if Maharashtra can go into lockdown and reduce the number of Covid cases, and Karnataka can also opt for it, this is the only way to break the virus chain. To this, Justice Bhargav Karia of division bench said, “Lockdown is not a solution. By doing this how many people will lose their earning? This is not Germany, London or New Zealand. This is India. Why can we not have our own restrictions? Why should people depend on the government for such restrictions. This is about the will of the people whether they want to break the chain or not.” The chief justice said that people have started realizing this and gave an example of deserted roads in the city. But he added, “We are neither suggesting nor do we know…It is for the government and the expert to take decision on how to break the chain and how to control Covid-19.” He said that the cases are on the rise and the government cannot remain mute spectator. Earlier, the high court suggested shorter lockdown, but the government was content with increasing night curfew hour and extending restrictions to 20 cities. The government informed the HC about the announcement of restrictions imposed on Tuesday and about clamping night curfew in 29 cities of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/people-need-to-restrict-themselves/articleshow/82280804.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Long wait for Covid reports leaves patients anxious||JAIPUR: As demand for Covid testing surges across the state, laboratories that process samples are experiencing backlogs that have left anxious patients waiting for at least three days to know about their status. The state government has released a list of 67 laboratories, which have a capacity to test 78,373 people. But, after the samples are being collected, patients are forced to wait. Hari Mohan Rathore, whose brother is admitted to Rawatbhata hospital said, “The RT-PCR test report of my brother took four days as samples were sent to Jaipur . Patients can get instant treatment after receiving timely reports. However, that’s not the case. If a person does not have steady Covid symptoms, they have to wait for an RT-PCR test report.” In the state, samples have increased mainfolds and labs are struggling to give reports on time. As per government figures, total number of samples collected on April 26 and 27 were 83,22,104 and 84,11,797, respectively. Urmila Singh , whose daughter is having moderate influenza like illness said, “On Wednesday, the samples for testing will be given. The report will be delivered in 48 hours as we were informed there are more samples and limited resources. Some of them labs we tried are not taking more samples than their daily capacity.” The testing capacity of RT-PCR labs has taken a hit owing to manpower crisis amid a fresh surge in cases. “Though, we are not completely denying, but samples are not collected on urgent basis of 1 or 2 hours. If a patient agrees for the given time slot, we are taking samples from patients who are at home. The home calls have increased by about four to five times. We are trying our best but home collection is not possible for all.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/long-wait-for-covid-reports-leaves-patients-anxious/articleshow/82281646.cms||संजीव कुमार
---||Pune||Token system, 30 minutes for shopping at Pimpri Chinchwad markets; Rs500 fine for rule breach||Pune: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and the Pimpri Chinchwad police have decided to introduce a token system from Wednesday for allowing a limited number of people to enter local markets as part of a measure to check overcrowding. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said that the token system will be introduced at Sangvi, Pimpri and Chinchwad vegetable markets in the first phase, and eventually it will be expanded to cover other markets in the civic limits as well. Officials said that those entering the market to buy vegetables, fruits etc will be allowed 30 minutes to complete shopping, beyond which they will be fined Rs500 by the civic authorities under Section 43 of the Bombay Police Act and other legal provisions. Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said that it had been observed that people spend a lot of time in the vegetable or fruit markets. “We have decided to take special measures along with the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation to check unnecessary crowding, thereby preventing the spread of the virus,” he said. Section 43 of the Bombay Police Act gives powers to the commissioner or the district magistrate to take special measures to prevent disease outbreak at crowded places. It also gives the power to levy a fine if anyone fails to follow the order. “At a time, 50 people will be able to enter the market with tokens. They will have to pick up vegetables or fruits within 30 minutes. Then, next the batch of 50 people will be allowed. The PCMC will charge Rs500 fine for exceeding the time limit,” Krishna Prakash said. Elaborating on the decision, Patil said, “We have observed that strict curbs implemented for the past few weeks have failed to yield results as many people give excuses of going to the market to buy vegetables or groceries and roam around till 11am. This results in unnecessary crowding, which needs to be regulated.” Box Crowd control # 50 people will be allowed to enter the market at a time #They will have to pick up vegetables or fruits within 30 minutes and step out #Then, the next batch of 50 people will be allowed to enter the market #The PCMC will charge Rs500 fine for breaching the time limit #The token system will be initially introduced at Sangvi, Pimpri, and Chinchwad vegetable markets||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/token-system-30-minutes-for-shopping-at-pimpri-chinchwad-markets-rs500-fine-for-rule-breach/articleshow/82281648.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Ahmedabad||Drug for one should not go to another: HC||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday asked the state government to ensure that remdesivir injection sanctioned for one patient should not reach any other person. The bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia insisted there should be enough supply of injections for a patient, for whom the sanctions have been received and the quota has been released. The issue was discussed after the state government informed HC that allocation of remdesivir has been now centralized and state’s procurement has reduced from daily nearly 20,000 vials to 16,500 vials. The Gujarat High Court Advocates Association complained that hospitals are not getting enough injections. It cited an example of a Vadodara hospital and submitted that against the demand of 36 injections, only seven were provided by the authority. The state government also submitted that the state has created a policy for distribution and every district is getting vials on pro-rata basis. To this, the judges questioned how injections are distributed on pro-rata basis, and questioned how seven injections are enough for 36 patients. The CJ said, “The government should see that the injection is assigned to a patient on the basis of his/her condition. First, complete with the patient you have started. Don’t take another patient. It should not be diverted to another patient. That injection must go to a particular patient.” The government added that it placed orders for 10,39,000 remdesivir vials since April 1, and has received 5,17,535 vials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drug-for-one-should-not-go-to-another-hc/articleshow/82280800.cms||---

The accused are A Laxmi Narsimha Reddy, 37, a TV actor from Masjid Banda in Gachibowli and M Jayanthi Goud, 31, a social worker from HB Colony in Moulali. According to the police, Laxmi had told the complainant, Sindhura Reddy, 31, a businesswoman from Khajaguda in 2017, that he has four acres of land at Gandipet worth Rs 100 crore. In August 2017, the complainant entered into an agreement with Laxmi to invest Rs 1 crore in the business with him. “The complainant paid Rs 85 lakh in cash and through cheques. Even after the amount was invested, the accused failed to show any development on the land as per the agreement,” Raidurgam inspector G Rajagopal Reddy said. When the complainant asked Laxmi to return the amount, the accused threatened her with dire consequences and tried to extort Rs 50,000 from her by blackmailing her, the inspector said. Based on a complaint lodged by the victim, police arrested the duo and sent them in judicial remand on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-held-for-duping-woman-of-rs-85l/articleshow/82280802.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||ULB poll campaign ends amid Covid fears in Telangana||HYDERABAD: With Covid shadow looming large, campaigning for the elections to seven urban local bodies and nine wards in civic bodies came to an end on Tuesday. The polling will be held on April 30 and counting of votes taken up on May 3. The campaign by political parties, its candidates and independents was held at a time when there was a rapid surge in Covid-19 cases. A majority of the roadshows, rallies and street-corner meetings were held in violation of Covid-19 guidelines with leaders, followers and party cadre not maintaining social distance and not wearing masks. Those who wore it, had the mask below their mouth and the guideline that sizeable gatherings are not allowed was also violated. At stake are 66 wards in Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation, the second largest civic body after Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation in the state and another 60 wards in Khammam Municipal Corporation. Five other municipalities too are going to polls with 43 wards in Siddipet, 27 in Jadcherla, 20 each in Nakrekal and Atchampet and 12 wards in Kothur. Also at stake are nine other wards going to bypolls, including Lingojiguda division in Greater Hyderabad. Election is likely to be unanimous in four of the nine wards as only one nomination in each of the four wards was filed. Congress, BJP, CPI, CPM and TJS urged the State Election Commission and the government and also sought intervention of the governor to postpone the polls until Covid-19 cases subsided. But, the government asked the SEC to go ahead with the polls. As per the Municipal Act, the SEC has to consult the government on finalising or postponing election dates. Political parties and its candidates made a last-ditch effort to win the hearts of the voters on the final day of campaigning by holding roadshows, going to their doorsteps and organising street-orner meetings. During the campaign, the ruling TRS charged the opposition parties, mainly Congress and the BJP, with failing to tell the people what it would do for the development of the local bodies. Welfare minister Koppula Eshwar said Congress and the BJP spent the entire campaign on criticising the state government. While the TRS chanted the development mantra and welfare schemes being implemented by the government, Congress and BJP tried to expose backwardness of urban local bodies and failure of the TRS to deliver its promises like 2bhk housing, unemployment allowance, government vacancies not being filled up and failing to effectively handle the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ulb-poll-campaign-ends-amid-covid-fears/articleshow/82280806.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Lucknow||UP plans for 100-day employment to 25 lakh||LUCKNOW: Amid reports of reverse migration in UP following the surge in second wave of coronarvirus pandemic, the state government has charted out a plan to scale up employment under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) by engaging gram rozgar sewaks and women mates who will ensure 100 days of employment to at least 25 lakh families. Top sources in state rural development department said a proposal had been mooted which could come into effect any time after panchayat elections. Sources said the state government seeks to provide 100 days of employment to over 25 lakh families through this measure. “We are receiving reports of people coming back to UP because of the massive increase in coronavirus pandemic,” a senior official said. Unlike gram rozgar sewaks who are in all 59,000 gram panchayats, women mates are engaged in selected MNREGS sites, essentially comprising women labourers. The state government now plans to engage a woman mate in every gram panchayat. The government had earlier provisioned employment of a women mate to supervise a group of 50 women labourers. The number of labourers has now been reduced to 20 for effective monitoring of works done under MNREGS. During 2020-21, the state managed to engage 1.11 crore workers, essentially men. The deployment of women mates would help the state government generate employment for women at work sites. Data show that while the state recorded a whopping jump of 87% in terms of employment under MNREGS in 2020-21, in comparison to previous year, the share of women workers largely remained unchanged at less than 33%. “This is an opportunity to create additional employment for men as well as women under MNREGS,” said a senior official in rural development department. He said both gram rozgar sewak and women mate would prepare their list of families which need employment separately. “These families will be at their disposal. They will try to provide them 100 days of employment,” he said. These families would subsequently be registered with the labour department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-plans-for-100-day-employment-to-25l/articleshow/82281691.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Kolkata||Give us oxygen, gasping patients’ SOS calls overwhelm Lalbazar traffic control||Kolkata: Two phones at Kolkata Police traffic control room in Lalbazar have been ringing off the hook, driving cops crazy. From pharmacies and medicine shops wanting to place bulk orders for oxygen cylinders to hapless family members seeking beds in hospitals, the phone lines have been inundated with requests. This follows an apparent misinterpretation of a post that Kolkata Police had made on its micro-blogging site, urging hospitals and oxygen supplies to seek help for movement of oxygen tankers and cylinders to hospitals. On April 24, Kolkata Police wrote on its official Twitter handle: “All concerned including Hospitals and Oxygen suppliers are requested to inform us at 033-22505096/033-22143644 of any movement of oxygen tankers/cylinders etc in the city of Kolkata so that we can provide exclusive corridor for their swift movement.” The post, translated in Bengali, got tweaked to a message that read: “One call and Kolkata Police will deliver oxygen. Kolkata Police has taken the initiative to prevent black-marketing and faster delivery of oxygen. Force will reach immediately on dialling these numbers. After that oxygen cylinders will be delivered to hospitals or homes in a green corridor.” The two phone numbers were provided alongside the message. Within minutes, a deluge of distress calls drowned the cops attending to the two numbers. Though the department was forced to issue a disclaimer, it hasn’t helped yet. “It’s becoming extremely stressful for us. We are trying to make people understand that when they are calling us. While some are realising the mistake, there are many who are even being abusive,” said an officer at the control room. Senior police officers at Lalbazar though admit the sheer number of distress calls points to the severity of the problem that people are facing on the ground. Police have already formed a special cell with Kolkata Municipal Corporation to ensure that the dead are released quickly from hospitals and there is no unnecessary waiting at the Dhapa crematorium. Joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar said the force was stretched due to the elections. “We are trying to stand with the people in our own way. But we have limitations as well, particularly at a time like this. We understand the anxiety and share the pain,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/give-us-oxygen-gasping-patients-sos-calls-overwhelm-lalbazar-traffic-control/articleshow/82280848.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

He blamed Gehlot for not having a cryogenic tanker to expedite the supply of oxygen. “The Centre has given them the facility, but the absence of tankers has not able to utilise the offer.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-not-giving-facts-on-oxygen-supply-min/articleshow/82281678.cms||---

This new rural focus rides alongside the relaunch of its India brand through a new name, new logo and new slogan. Kia has changed the name of its Indian entity from from Kia Motors India to Kia India to signal a shift in focus to ‘long range of sustainable mobility solutions’. “All our expansion in sales and service touchpoints this year will be in Tier 3 and Tier 4 towns and cities and we are adding around 45 new towns to our network. These are markets that are growing faster than metros and we are tapping into this demand,” said Hardeep Singh Brar, VP & head of sales and marketing, Kia India. Kia is currently present in 175 cities and all the expansion this year will be in smaller towns and cities, he added. In all Kia has 300 touchpoints countrywide.The hinterland focus comes despite the fact that Kia has ‘no plans’ to get into compact sedan or compact hatchback market, the cheaper cars that enjoy bigger volumes beyond metro markets. “Although the top 20 cities contribute 80% of the SUV sales which is the segment we are focusing on, we see incremental volumes coming from smaller markets too,” said Tae Jin Park, executive director & chief sales and business strategy officer, Kia India. The company is planning to get its third shift operational from June-July “if demand goes well,” he said. Kia sold around 55,000 vehicles in the first three months of the calendar and is targeting production of around 2,00,000 units this year. The company has a peak capacity of 3,50,000 units. “We have been facing production constraints due to the supply of semi conductors,” said Park. The company had announced targeted production of 1,80,000 units last year which has been revised to 2,00,000 units this year. “We are still evaluating impact of the second wave of the pandemic,” said Park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kia-to-focus-on-rural-with-a-new-name-logo-slogan/articleshow/82305496.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Oxygen crisis increasing in small districts||JAIPUR: Hanumangarh chief medical and health office (CMHO) is on its toes keeping a track of the timely departure of the empty oxygen pickup van from its civil hospital and arrival of the refuelled oxygen cylinders from Sri Ganganagar every day. Though the small town has an oxygen plant that produces 30 cylinders, the growing number of Covid patients is at mercy of timely arrival of refuelled cylinders daily. “Our requirement is 100 cylinders every day. This is likely to increase in the coming days to come. Every day, our pickup van is escorted by police leave for a neighbouring city which is 65km to provide a lifeline for our critically ill patients,” said Navneet Sharma, CMHO, Hanumangarh. For the hospital, every minute matters as any delay forces the hospital to ration the use of cylinders in order to have a smooth transition of empty and refuelled oxygen tanks. A delay of even 15 minutes puts the officials in stress leaving them to call up police escorting the vehicle and passing instructions to the hospital staff to ration the use of oxygen. The state government has allocated 700 cylinders in its last order leaving them with just 100 on Tuesday. Every day, local authorities in small districts struggle to receive oxygen on time to ensure no one dies for want of the gas. The situation highlights the state unpreparedness in the supply chain management system. The crisis is not restricted to Hanumangarh, it is a tale in every small district which has to outsource its oxygen from the next big district. The tribal-dominated districts—Dungarpur and Banswara — rely on Udaipur, which is the hub for oxygen supply. Here the difference is the distance which is close to four hours. An oxygen distribution committee member in Banswara said since the demand is unprecedented, the district cannot meet it with its limited resources. “Refuelling is being done from Udaipur from the state distribution channel. So far, the supply and demand are barely manageable. It will escalate if the surge continues and can reach the horror we are witnessing in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi,” said the member, who sent 100 cylinders for refuelling to Udaipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/o2-crisis-increasing-in-small-dists/articleshow/82281692.cms||---

To rectify this situation, the BMC has now decided to set up 700 beds with oxygen support at the centre. Of the around 800 beds at the Byculla centre, only 20 have oxygen support and there are no ventilator beds. As only 150 beds are currently occupied by asymptomatic patients, politicians urged the BMC to increase the number of oxygen beds and create 50 ICU beds instead of setting up new centres. TimesViewIt’s a good move that the BMC is setting up more jumbo Covid centres. These centres have proven to be a game changer in the city’s fight against Covid-19. But, the BMC must ensure that all existing centres are fully utilised and capacity is not wasted. Also, ICU and oxygen beds must be increased wherever there is a scope at jumbo centres.On Monday, Samajwadi Party corporator and MLA Rais Shaikh visited the Byculla centre and found 80% of the beds vacant. He then wrote to additional municipal commissioner (city) Sanjeev Jaiswal to start an oxygen support unit and ICU at the centre urgently. “The BMC was housing international travellers here, but now there are no travellers. There is a desperate need for ICU beds with ventilators and Bi-PAP machines. So the BMC must create a 50-bed ICU here, instead of adding regular beds in other centres,” Shaikh said. “If all 800 beds get oxygen support, the entire caseload of south Mumbai can be taken care of.” The Richardson & Cruddas jumbo centre was set up in July 2020. In December, the BMC offered free institutional quarantine to returnees from Europe, the Middle East and South Africa at the centre. Congress MLA Amin Patel said the BMC had shut down centres in haste. “The BMC is paying crores of rupees as rent for this Byculla centre, so it must be used well. The BMC must set up a mega ICU here on a war footing and appoint doctors,” he said. Jaiswal said: “We have already given orders to install an oxygen pipeline at the centre and will soon have 700 beds with oxygen support. We are also placing dura cylinders, but for the long term we will install a liquid medical oxygen storage tank of 5 kilo liters capacity. It will be ready soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-80-of-beds-vacant-at-byculla-centre-but-bmc-plans-new-ones/articleshow/82281695.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

It is unclear how he contracted the virus as 61-year-old Rajan is lodged in the high security cell of Tihar in isolation. Rajan doesn’t share a cell with anybody as he is considered to be a high-risk inmate. He was arrested and incarcerated in 2015 after his deportation from Bali.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Narratives change as second wave plays havoc||JAIPUR: If we thought that the thousands of migrant workers with bags on their head or slung on the shoulders walking hundreds of miles home last year would remain the enduring images of the Covid pandemic, the second wave is proving that wrong. Now, it’s about oxygen, desperate calls of family members and friends, hospitals and the governments to save lives. There are other narratives that have changed in the second wave of the pandemic. Herbal immunity-boosting kadhas seem to have lost the new ground they made last year because of the entry of the vaccines. After the outbreak last year, the state government asked for donations from companies and individuals to the CM Covid fund. But this time, no such appeals have come through. Explaining why the labour migration is not an issue this time, N K Jain, president of the Employers Association of Rajasthan, a non-profit, said, “If the government has learnt any lesson from last time, then it must be the management of labour. Migrant workers are more afraid of losing their jobs than getting infected with the virus. This time, all the factories were allowed to operate, shrinking scope for any mass migration.” But Kadha returning to its base of believers and practitioners is not difficult to understand. Vaccines create a far better shield against the virus than kadha. “Now people want to be vaccinated to ensure they have a better chance to deal with the virus. That’s why kadha is not as popular as it was last time around. But certainly, ayurvedic remedies have gained a better acceptability than earlier. Today, people are more aware about building natural immunity against all kinds of illness. Vaccine is not 100% effective. In that case, general immunity through ayurvedic remedies compliments the vaccine,” said Prof Abhimanyu Kumar, Vice Chancellor, Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan Rajasthan Ayurved University, Jodhpur. As regards to government not appealing for donations this time, the reasons are more than one. Industry representatives said that the state government knows the precarious financial condition of the industry after the lockdowns. Secondly, the government somehow managed to garner the tax revenues it wanted to. Suresh Agarwal, president of Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry, said, “The condition of the industry was better before the lockdown and the pandemic as a national calamity was new. That’s why when the chief minister appealed, the industry and individuals responded. Now the government knows what kind of difficulties the industry has gone through in the past one year. That may be the reason why there is no direct appeal this time for donations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/narratives-change-as-2nd-wave-plays-havoc/articleshow/82281705.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Remdesivir will be free for needy patients in pvt hospitals||LUCKNOW: Remdesivir injections prescribed by private hospitals will be given for free to underprivileged and needy patients in UP on producing valid prescriptions. This followed a directive on Tuesday by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who also asked district magistrates to act against hospitals that refuse admission to patients despite bed allocation by the integrated command and control centre. Sector magistrates will be appointed to keep a watch on patients and hospitalise them in case of emergency. “Remdesivir is free in government hospitals, but if someone is prescribed the injection by a private hospital and it’s beyond their means, the government will help them. If patients are critical and their kin can’t arrange for the medicine, the district magistrate or chief medical officer can be asked to urgently provide Remdesivir,” a government spokesperson said. The official said, there is no shortage of Remdesivir and other lifesaving medicines and vials will be provided to districts on demand. While the government was supplying Remdesivir to government hospitals, it could replenish stocks of private hospitals if the need arose, he added. The CM has directed all district magistrates to start a sectoral system in their districts under which pointspersons will be appointed for each area. They will ensure patients are given beds, oxygen, ventilators or any lifesaving medicines. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said, these sectoral magistrates should have a hotline with the integrated covid command centres to keep themselves abreast of bed availability in hospitals and ensure swift ambulance service. The CM said, bed allocation and discharge policies should be implemented correctly. In districts where the government order is violated, the concerned district magistrate and chief medical officer will be made answerable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/remdesivir-will-be-free-for-needy-patients-in-pvt-hosps/articleshow/82281702.cms||Neha Lalchandani

She only stated that he did bad act with her. Only on the basis of word ‘bad act’, it cannot be construed that accused had physical relations with victim,” the court said. It was the prosecution’s case that between March 4 and 19, 2013, the accused took the girl to Nashik and Gujarat. He allegedly took a premises on rent and forged documents to marry the minor. The girl’s father had lodged an FIR after she went missing from school. She was subsequently found. The girl now married to another a man and a mother of two kids deposed in court. The defence submitted that her parents were against her relationship with the accused as they belonged to different castes. The court said that it could not ruled out that she was pressured into deposing against the accused. “There is no material to show that accused had dishonest intentions to prepare forged documents of marriage. In the totality of the circumstances, the evidence on record is not sufficient to bring home the guilt of the accused for the offences charged,” the court said. The accused has been out on bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-held-for-raping-13-yr-old-acquitted/articleshow/82281715.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||From corporate frontliner to Jain ascetic||AHMEDABAD: A year ago, when the pandemic struck the world, Prakash Shah quit the materialistic way of living, letting go of the accolades and wealth drawn from a distinguished stint in the corporate world. After retirement, Shah, now 64, on April 25 took diksha, the Jain path of renunciation. Clad in plain white clothes, he and his wife Naina Shah took diksha at a ceremony held in Borivali, Mumbai. Shah completed the BTech and MTech courses in chemical engineering at IIT-Bombay. Then he began working with Reliance Industries Ltd, from where he retired as vice-president (projects) last year. Shah’s younger son became a Jain monk long ago. Shah’s son earned the BTech degree in chemical engineering from IIT-Bombay and won a silver medal for his academic performance. He became a monk at the age of 24. That was more than seven years ago, recalls the son, Bhuvan Jeet Maharaj, while talking to TOI. He got this name after taking diksha. “As a child, I was always inspired to take diksha. There can be no comparison between materialistic pleasures of worldly life and spiritual bliss of Jain ascetic life,” said Bhuvan Jeet Maharaj. His brother works in the private sector. “My parents inspired and supported me. They longed to walk this path for quite some time. It’s good to see them here on this side,” he said. He sees no direct connection between the ongoing pandemic and his parents’ decision to take diksha. “We see our own karmas as more penetrating and painful than the Covid virus. To overcome these karmas, my parents took diksha,” according to Bhuvan Jeet Maharaj. Shah and his wife are now known as Prashant Bhushan Vijayji Maharaj Saheb and Bhavyanidhi Sadhviji Maharaj Saheb. They were given diksha by His Holiness Gachchhadhipati Acharya Sh. Yugbhushansuri Swarji Maharaj Saheb. Shah is the third IITian to become a disciple of the guru. “The true way to meditate in life is by walking the path of diksha,” according to Bhuvan Jeet Maharaj. Asked why so many young people today are taking diksha, he said though the world has developed in a materialistic sense, it is not able to provide true happiness to young people. “So, they are choosing the spiritual and ancient path of Jainism,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/from-corporate-frontliner-to-jain-ascetic/articleshow/82280850.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Pune||Health dept wants zones in care hubs as per need||Pune: The state health services department has in its new guidelines for rational use of oxygen advised hospitals to classify their areas into six zones in accordance with the patients’ requirements of the gas essential for the treatment of Covid-19. The department has also directed the hospitals to create an admission and discharge committee to continuously identify and classify patients and put them in the appropriate zone to save oxygen. Medical experts opposed the move saying it would strain the already stressed manpower in the hospitals. An official from the Annasaheb Magar Stadium jumbo unit said the move was “illogical” and shuffling over 700 patients in the facility would be next to impossible. The official said, “We are trying our best to conserve oxygen as per the state task force’s guidelines. But creating different zones and monitoring the patients and shifting them when their health improves or deteriorates will be a huge ordeal.” Jitendra Osawal, deputy director, Bharati hospital that has over 300 oxygen beds, said, “Creating zones or moving the patients from one zone to another will not be possible. The patients’ health can rapidly improve or deteriorate in current conditions. We have created our own system — wherein they have put up stickers above every bed showing how much oxygen level needs to be maintained for that particular patient.” Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, said, “The authorities must work on improving the daily oxygen supply. Each and every hospital is working on conserving oxygen. Monitoring the oxygen supply is something that has to be done by all the staff members, regardless of a new directive.” Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation commissioner Rajesh Patil said, “We will have a word with the hospitals and try to get to know their issues related to oxygen. But the guidelines should be taken in the right spirit and the focus should be on oxygen conservation and better monitoring of the patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-dept-wants-zones-in-care-hubs-as-per-need/articleshow/82280855.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Since January 16 when the inoculation drive started, 1,26,53,991 people have got the shot so far. Over the last 10 days, there has been dip in the number of vaccinations as the state is getting a very limited supply of doses. Also, the sudden spike in cases and fear in the minds of those who plan to go for vaccination are also a couple of factors for the dip. “Our supply is limited and we have been seeing 1 to 1.5 lakh people coming for vaccination,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, nodal officer, vaccination. On Tuesday, out of 98,815 who were vaccinated, there were 12,142 people above the 65-year age group who got their first shot while 34,259 got their second.

The proposals include construction of oxygen storage and filling facility at Naidu Hospital as well as procurement of oxygen storage tanks for various other civic hospitals. The PMC will spend around Rs 50 lakh on these facilities. “The demand for oxygen has increased, so we have decided to create facilities for supply. The proposals for augmenting oxygen supply have been cleared,” said standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane. As per the proposal, the oxygen cylinders will be used for the jumbo centre at Ganesh Kala Krida Manch. These cylinders have higher storage capacity as compared to others and they will help reduce the usage of manpower for supply. 10 such cylinders, each of 210 litre capacity, will be fitted in the make-shift hospital and will cost PMC approximately Rs 27 lakh. Another proposal to set up oxygen a filling station at Naidu hospital at an expenditure of Rs 19 lakh was also approved. The PMC standing committee also gave a green signal to introduce foreign languages as an optional subject at municipal schools. The proposal to make use of artificial intelligence for revenue generation for PMC was also approved. Software and other related computer systems will be developed using AI.

According to the proposal, domestic users will now have to shell out 0.25 paise more for every unit of electricity they consume above 200 units. The new tariff will be effective from April 1. Meanwhile, the people living in snow-bound districts and the BPL families using up to 100 units of electricity per month have been exempted from the recent power tariff hike. They can continue to pay their electric bills at the old rate. Similarly, small non-domestic consumers using up to 50 units per month would also not need to pay according to the revised tariff rate. Besides, people paying their electricity bills digitally will be given a rebate of 1.25% of their monthly bill. Those paying electricity dues through cheques, demand drafts, and other bank instruments will be given a rebate of 0.75% of their monthly bills. UPCL officials have claimed that the hike was necessary to meet its power purchase cost and other expenses. UPCL had projected a revenue gap of Rs 952 crore during the FY 2019-20. The hike in power tariffs is believed to cover a major portion of the revenue gaps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-approves-hike-in-power-tariff-for-domestic-users-who-consume-over-200-units/articleshow/82280128.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The police registered a case against nine people, all residents of Pethapur. In the complaint lodged with Pethapur police on Sunday, 23-year-old Kinjalba Vaghela stated that Rajni Pandya, a resident of Sector III in Gandhinagar who is a friend of her husband Mahavirsinh Vaghela, called them to inform them of her mother-in-law’s demise. She died of natural causes. Pandya and Vaghela took the body to Sector-30 crematorium where they were told that they would have to wait. In fact, they were asked to take the body to Pethapur for cremation. As Mahavirsinh’s elder brother Shailendrasinh ran a transport business in Pethapur, the family decided to take the body to Pethapur. Shailendrasinh, who knew people in the town, also accompanied them for the cremation. After returning from the cremation, Mahavirsinh went for a bath and Shailendrasinh was standing outside the house when Digvijay Vaghela, 30, Narendrasinh alias Jenbha Vaghela, Ajaysinh Vaghela, Vijaysinh Vaghela and five others arrived there on two-wheelers and a car, and began abusing Shailendrasinh and Mahavirsinh. The group was reportedly irked by the cremation of an outsider’s body in Pethapur town. The men were carrying sticks and threatened the two with dire consequences. When the neighbours intervened, the group left the area, Kinjal told police. She added that the group said they should have been informed before the body was cremated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rioting-over-cremation-of-outsider/articleshow/82281737.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Shukla seeks questionnaire, FIR copy in tapping case||Mumbai: Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)’s special director general Rashmi Shukla will not appear before Mumbai police on Wednesday to record her statement in a phone-tapping case due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. She has asked that a questionnaire be supplied to her to reply online as well as a copy of the FIR registered by the cyber police. Shukla was the commissioner of Maharashtra’s state intelligence department last year when it tapped telephones of influential people. Some of the people were politically connected and were allegedly heard discussing transfers and posting of police officers, including IPS officers, in exchange for money. She had submitted a report to the then DGP Subodh Jaiswal last year with request to forward it to the chief minister for immediate inquiry against those mentioned in the phone tapping. The government did not act on the report. Jaiswal and Shukla were allegedly not on good terms with the state government and they opted for central deputation. Mumbai’s cyber police cell has registered an offence to probe procedural lapses in alleged phone tapping and leak of the confidential report under Official Secrets Act. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte had submitted a report to the chief minister stating phones were tapped by misleading the government. On Monday, Mumbai police issued her a summons asking that she remain present at her Mumbai residence at 11pm on Wednesday for questioning in the case. On Tuesday, Shukla replied to the police via email stating that considering the pandemic, they should send her list of the questions in the form of a questionnaire. Shukla said she would reply to them as soon as possible to avoid any delay in the investigation. Shukla, who heads CRPF’s southern zone, is currently posted in Hyderabad and has a house in Mumbai. She showed her inability to leave her office for Mumbai, saying they have a wide jurisdiction and responsibilities during the pandemic. It is stated Mumbai police is not satisfied with her reply and may soon issue a second summons to her. Shukla’s confidential report became public after former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh made corruption allegations against the state’s then home minister Anil Deshmukh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shukla-seeks-questionnaire-fir-copy-in-tapping-case/articleshow/82280151.cms||Vijay V Singh

While the disaster management and relief and rehabilitation department issued the EOI on Tuesday and the last day of submissions is May 10, in the current situation the state will start scrutinising the bids received and placing orders in the next three days, officials said. According to the EOI, a copy of which is with TOI , the state has sought to purchase 40,701 oxygen concentrators, of which over 35,000 are of 10ml/minute capacity, while the rest are of smaller capacity. They will be distributed in dedicated Covid hospitals and rural hospitals and primary health centres. The state is also seeking to set up 134 PSA oxygen plants that will use atmospheric air to separate oxygen for medical use. These are plants with much bigger capacity and will be set up on government hospital premises. The EOI also states that Maharashtra wants to purchase 25,000 MT of liquid medical oxygen and 27 oxygen ISO tanks for storing the life-saving gas as buffer stock for emergency use. “All powers have been delegated to a high-powered committee for the procurement of these quoted items,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope. He said the state will also be buying 10 lakh vials of remdesivir, which is also in short supply. “Though the Centre has increased our allocation to 4.3 lakh, we are still falling short in our daily demand and so we will be buying remdesivir on our own,” Tope said. Officials said that they are not expecting to get all the equipment in the same quantities as listed by the state government, as there is demand from across the world. “Since these items are required urgently, many tender conditions and clauses too have been relaxed so as to attract more bidders,” said a state official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-govt-floats-global-tenders-for-med-supplies/articleshow/82282638.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Chandigarh||No oxygen cylinder flow meters in Tricity, all taken by Delhi||Chandigarh: No oxygen flow meters (gauge that regulates the flow) for cylinders are available across the Tricity. The cylinders are used domestically and in hospitals for the severely ill Covid patients. The flow meter is fitted on top of the cylinder to read the pressure and volume of the oxygen. The suppliers say that most of the people from Delhi have procured it from the city. “Without these flow meters, it is not possible to know what is the extent of oxygen being supplied. They are not a part of the cylinder purchase and have to be bought separately. The main suppliers are based in Delhi,” said Anil, a proprietor in a city-based chemist shop. The cost of an oxygen cylinder is Rs 6,000, while the refill is for Rs 400. However, as the supply is running dry, prices have escalated to more than double. “Even if we get the medical oxygen, without this meter it is of no use. So, we are not able to provide the same to the patients,” said a doctor in a private hospital in Mohali. Besides the absence of these flowmeters, the cylinders are also being black-marketed. A chemist owner on the condition of anonymity said, “These cylinders are being hoarded and sold at a higher price even without the meters. Those who buy them, do not know that the meters which are bought separately are not available.” Even while government hospitals across the city have their own medical oxygen plants and generators, 90% of the patients who are mild to moderate and in need of oxygen are recommended for the usage by doctors. “We have kept the cylinder for my ailing grandmother who is admitted with Covid. When she will be back, we still would need it,” said Renu Garg, a resident of Panchkula. Price ranges from Rs 2k to Rs 8k Oxygen cylinder flowmeters cost anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 8,000, depending on the consumption for domestic or hospital usage. “We have no idea when the supply will be replenished. There is hope that it will be available soon. But we cannot assure you,” said a supplier of medical devices in a Sector 16 chemist shop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-oxygen-cylinder-flow-meters-in-tricity-all-taken-by-delhi/articleshow/82261596.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Due to shortage of oxygen supply, the administration will provide the facility only on 50 beds against the capacity of 768 beds. An official said, “On Wednesday, admission of patients will be made for 50 beds with oxygen facilities. The number will be increased once supply of more oxygen cylinders is received.” Covid patients and their families were requested to call either on the help desk (7023557768) or the control room (7568652770) before taking the patients there. The patients should be taken only after receiving the confirmation. The OPD developed at gate no. 4 of RSSB was made operational on Tuesday. A team of 50 doctors including medical staff has been deployed at the centre. It was informed that the administration has fixed three parameters for admission at the centre. “Patients having positive RT-PCR report; also, the oxygen level is between 88-93; and lastly, HRCT (CT score) is less than 13. After doctor’s examination, patients with negative RT-PCR report will also be admitted,” added the official. Out of the total number of beds, 384 are reserved for women and 384 beds for men. The number of beds will be increased as required. A senior Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) official said, “ The preparations at the centre are complete. On 50 beds, oxygen concentrators have been installed and tested, and admissions will start from Wednesday.” At the Centre, the JDA has developed facilities like toilets, power supply, fans, circuit television cameras, among others. The RSSB management would provide drinking water, tea, breakfast and meals to patients and attendants at the centre. Moreover, it has also committed to providing ayurvedic decoction to patients to boost their immunity. The Jaipur Municipal Corporation and police administration will assist the JDA to manage the centre. The campus of RSSB is spread over an area of 10.12 lakh square-feet where 5,000 beds can be set up as per requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-centre-at-radha-soami-satsang-beas-to-start-today/articleshow/82281726.cms||---

The N-95 masks will be made available for Rs 20 per piece and surgical masks at Rs 3 per piece, which is much lower than the market rates,” Anjana said. Registrar cooperatives Muktanand Agarwal said that the masks provided by the federation are as per Indian standards as well as European and American standards. He said that it is necessary to wear a mask of high quality to protect oneself from Covid-19. Agarwal said N-95 masks will come in five different colours and surgical masks in two colours. The N-95 mask is of five layers capable of stopping small viruses up to 0.3 micron, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-co-op-to-provide-n-95-mask-at-rs-20/articleshow/82281743.cms||---
---||Goa||FC Goa to field all-Indian squad against Al Wahda as foreigners leave for home||Margao: FC Goa will field an all-Indian lineup for their concluding AFC Champions League group E clash against Al Wahda at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Thursday. Spanish defender Ivan Gonzalez was the only player initially unavailable due to a double booking. But with Covid-19 cases rising alarmingly in the country and foreign countries putting India on a travel red list, the club has decided to allow the foreigners to leave before the conclusion of the ACL. The decision comes on a day when chief minister Pramod Sawant announced a four-day lockdown, starting Thursday, in Goa. “If they don’t make it to Spain tonight, they may get stuck here for another month,” a club source told TOI. “Spain will impose a mandatory quarantine for everyone travelling from India. There could be a travel ban too, besides we don’t know about restrictions or a lockdown here. It made sense for them to leave immediately.” Besides the Spanish players – Ivan, Edu Bedia and Jorge Ortiz -- coach Juan Ferrando and conditioning coach Javier Gonzalez have also packed their bags for home. Australian defender James Donachie is also on the flight to Madrid via Paris from Delhi. The news of the foreign players’ departure comes at a time when Ferrando was plotting to upset Al Wahda – who they held goalless in the first leg -- and register a first win for India in the AFC Champions League. “This is the target,” Ferrando said at the pre-match media briefing earlier in the day. “Our mentality is to get three points. That’s the plan. Whether we have success or not, depends on a lot of factors. But our target all the time is to win games.” Goa almost registered a historic win in the previous clash but conceded a last-minute equaliser against Al Rayyan, coached by France’s 1998 World Cup winner Laurent Blanc. Goa are third in the group, ahead of Al Rayyan, with three points. Significantly, the debutants have lost games only against group leaders and last year’s finalists Persepolis FC from Iran. “It’s a difficult game against Al Wahda. They have chance of qualifying for the next stage. We are thinking of finishing third. I told the players, ‘don’t relax, thinking this is the last game’. This is the Champions League. We have to be strong, find the best XI and ensure we have the best tactical plan in place.” With Persepolis expected to top the group, Al Wahda are hoping to advance as one of the three best runners-up. A win against Goa and 13 points should be good enough for the four-time UAE Pro League champions. “We want to win but it will not be an easy game as we have a couple of players suspended. It will be hard because FC Goa are still in search of their first win and they will do everything to get the three points,” said coach Henk ten Cate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-to-field-all-indian-squad-against-al-wahda-as-foreigners-leave-for-home/articleshow/82298728.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The facility will receive an uninterrupted supply of oxygen gas from its steel manufacturing plant in Hazira, the company said in a media statement. The hospital, inaugurated virtually by Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani, started functioning from Tuesday with 250-bed facilities that will be ramped up to 1,000 beds in the near future. The Covid care centre has come up in a span of three days. “I thank the government of Gujarat and Shri Vijay Rupani for their support due to which we were able to set up this Covid care hospital in 72 hours. The Hon’ble Prime Minister last Friday had requested suggestions for tackling the current COVID situation and since AM/NS India produces oxygen gas in the Hazira facility we decided to build this hospital near the facility to help those in need. This will overcome the bottleneck in oxygen supply,” said Lakshmi Mittal, executive chairman of ArcelorMittal while speaking at an online event to inaugurate the facility. This dedicated 250-bed Covid care hospital near the AM/NS India Hazira manufacturing plant will admit only those patients who need oxygen. AM/NS India will ensure speedy transfer of patients via ambulances to nearby hospitals in case they require more intensive medical intervention. Keeping in mind the logistics challenges and technical limitations involved in transporting oxygen to the hospitals, the decision was taken to set up this facility, thus ensuring continuous oxygen supply in addition to saving time, the company said in a statement. This temporary hospital was virtually inaugurated by chief minister Rupani from his Gandhinagar office. BJP state president and MP from Navsari C R Paatil, Kishor Kanani, minister of state health and family welfare, medical education and Dilip Oommen, chief executive officer, AM/NS India, were present at the online event. “As part of our continued endeavour to serve the community, we have introduced the concept of bringing hospital to the vicinity of the oxygen plant, instead of transporting oxygen to hospital. Considering the speed at which the pandemic is spreading, we have also factored in the ramping up of the number of beds,” said Oommen. ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel is primarily producing gaseous oxygen for steel production at Hazira. However, it has ramped up the production of liquid oxygen substantially to 210MT per day for medical use. “As the Covid pandemic is becoming severe in the region, we are utilizing the gaseous oxygen for medical purpose which otherwise cannot be transported,” according to the company statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/am/ns-india-opens-250-bed-covid-centre-in-72-hours/articleshow/82281768.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||I am now more grateful for life||By M Koti Raja Sekhar “There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness. We must have felt what it is to die, Morrel, that we may appreciate the enjoyments of life. Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget, that until the day God will deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is contained in these two words, 'Wait and Hope’.” This quote by the famous French author, Alexandre Dumas, sums up the present situation in the most lucid way. In fact, this is the new lesson I learnt during this pandemic. Just before Covid, I had to undergo a critical surgery to regain my otherwise deteriorating health and my mental condition then was such that I was listening to all the people who are near and dear to me. But finally, I decided to go under the knife as per the doctor’s advice. While I was in bed rest, I was going through all the information relating to Covid and how it was affecting other nations. When our nation went into lockdown, initially it was all comfort for me and my family but when social media circulating all the information regarding pandemic and people sufferings and its long consequences, I eventually found myself under a lot of mental stress as it was the time when I decided to change my profession. Unfortunately, the pandemic was not allowing me to test waters all afresh to restart my life from level zero. My mind was vacillating. But then, all my doubts were put to rest with the unflinching support of my family. Little acts of patience and positive thinking helped me spend a lot of time with myself. Since the need to go out was minimal, it proved to be a blessing in disguise as it paved way for a paradigm shift in my thought process and self-exploration began. It helped me understand my strengths and weaknesses and wherewithal. When you know there is no hurry to finish the task and no timelines are designed to judge your abilities and skill sets, half the mental stress is automatically put to rest. This is what the pandemic, exactly taught me in these unprecedented times. With all the time in the world at my disposal, I focused on my fitness like never before, got in touch with my friends, well-wishers and ex-colleagues -- to plan my career -- and re-launch myself as a professional. Had it not been the pandemic, what else could it have been? The lockdown time provided me with an opportunity to rebuild all my professional relations and by the time things started to unlock, I was rearing to go with new vigour and enthusiasm all over again. The pandemic brought a lot of changes in lifestyles, great loss of wealth, lives and is still continuing. But it also helped me revisit my life and plan, process and execute it. Now I am looking at my life with a little more gratitude as it taught me the wisdom of ‘Wait and Hope’.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Kin cremate Covid victim without Bundi administration help||KOTA: In a shocking act of negligence by medical and health department and Bundi district administration officials, the wife and a few family members were on Tuesday forced to perform cremation of a Covid victim on Tuesday morning without any support of the government. The medical staff at hospital allegedly asked the aggrieved family members to purchase PPE kit for the body and to hire an ambulance. The Bundi municipal council’s squad, deputed as per state government’s direction to conduct last rites of deceased Covid patients, reach the cremation ground only after the family members had left after performing the last rites. According to sources, Sampatlal Gurjar (45), a native of Ramganjbalaji village who worked as a daily wage labourer in Bundi city, tested Covid positive around four days ago and was undergoing treatment at Bundi district hospital. Acfgter his death, the medical staff at hospital asked the deceased’s family members to purchase PPE kit for the body and hire an ambulance to take the body for last rites. The family members allegedly managed to purchase a PPE kit for Rs 500 and hired an ambulance and took the body to Ramganjbalaji, about 5km from the district headquarters, where the local cremation ground was found filled with bodies.  The family members then brought back the body to Bundi city and took it to the cremation ground on Sukh Mahal road. The family members did not find any vacant space there too following which the family members performed the last rites at a corner. Admitting the negligence of the medical staff, principal medical officer (PMO) of Bundi hospital Dr Prabhakar Vijay said the municipal council’s squad deputed for last rites of deceased Covid patients could not be informed of the death in the morning and the family members themselves brought an ambulance to take the body. The medical staff at hospital, mistaking the hired ambulance for an ambulance from Bundi municipal council, handed over the body, which the family members took for the last rites, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kin-cremate-covid-victim-without-bundi-admn-help/articleshow/82281764.cms||---

Police have sent the woman’s body for postmortem and are investigating the case. Devi Singh Meharat (40), a resident of Rajiyawas village in Beawar, was a security guard with an electricity company and was posted at a power house in Bhilwara district. He married Laxmi Devi (35) about 12 years ago and had two children — a 7-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter. His relative Bijandra Singh said that he had come to his village last week. He fell ill and had fever and later developed problems in breathing. He went for the test in the health centre of his village and found that he was Covid-positive. On Monday evening, he went to Beawar and was admitted at the Government Amrit Kaur Hospital alone and on Tuesday, he died at the hospital. Hospital management informed the relatives. When his wife Laxmi Devi suspected about something being amiss, then she was told her husband’s condition was serious and that they are taking him to a Jaipur hospital. But as soon as Laxmi Devi came to know that her husband had died, she went inside her house and consumed poison. Sarpanch Brajpal Singh said, “We rushed to save her and snatched the bottle of poison which is used as pesticide in crops and rushed her to the hospital.” But by the time she was taken to the hospital, the doctors declared her dead. Beawar police took statements of relatives and locals and sent her body for postmortem and registered a case. Devi Singh’s parents were residing with him and he also had one brother who was living away. Now, the two children are left behind with their old grandparents in the village. The villagers mourned the tragedy and didn’t cook to observe a day of mourning. The sarpanch appealed to the villagers to maintain social distancing and wear masks in the village to prevent Covid from spreading.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/woman-ends-life-after-husband-dies-of-covid-19/articleshow/82283747.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||May 1 nears, but no info on vax to 18+||Chandigarh: Even while some of the states, including Punjab and Haryana, have decided to supply free vaccination for the age group above 18 years from May 1 onwards, there is no such information conveyed to the UT health department. However, doctors believe that there will be a lot of chaos as large number of beneficiaries is expected, while the vaccination roll-out from the manufacturers is limited in the country. At the moment, nearly two lakh people have been vaccinated in the city, which is around 17% of the city’s population. And when the beneficiaries will increase next month, one can expect that the coverage will shoot to double the rate. “But this will not be feasible as there is shortage of vaccines in most of the states. The city also got its next consignment of one-lakh doses last week when the supplies were almost over,” said a doctor. According to the government guidelines, there were sites in Panchkula, where vaccine sessions could not be held due to non-availability of vaccines. “Every day, we vaccinate around 5,000 people. At this rate, we can exhaust one-lakh supply in another 20 days. However, if all age groups will be opened, the supplies will get over within half the time,” said an official in the UT health department. Sources said those waiting for the second dose should get it done sooner as doses can run dry after May 1. There are 64 session sites in the city, where there are 19 private and the remaining are the public sites. “Session sites can be stretched and manpower engaged can be asked to work more. But in the absence of required vaccines, the sessions cannot run. We should not have opened for all age groups at this stage when the supplies are limited,” said a public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/may-1-nears-but-no-info-on-vax-to-18/articleshow/82281745.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Pune||Pune hospitals despair for oxygen cylinders, many reduce beds||PUNE: Panic gripped small and medium-sized hospitals on Tuesday after vendors and distributors expressed inability to supply the daily requirement of oxygen cylinders. “Authorities were quick to bring in 80% oxygen beds at hospitals under Covid-19 care. But where has this alacrity gone? They are sermonising us to make judicious use of medical oxygen when. But in reality, they have conveniently missed on making oxygen available to us,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India (HBI), a representative body of small and medium-sized hospitals in Pune. Senior medical expert Siddharth Dhende who runs a small hospital at Nagpur Chawl in Yerawada said, “Though I have reduced the number of oxygen beds from 20 to eight, I need the support for those in need. I have purchased three oxygen concentrators. But I need at least a jumbo cylinder, as oxygen concentrators heat up after an hour and need to be stopped for a few minutes to begin again.” Orthopaedic surgeon Ramesh Ranka, medical director of Ranka hospital, said, “Two of my vendors said they could not meet my daily requirement of oxygen cylinders on Tuesday. The vendors said the refilling station has run out of raw material used to refill the cylinders with the liquid medical oxygen. Our daily requirement is 40 jumbo cylinders. The hospital has reduced its number of Covid-19 beds to 21 from 35.” Consumption of medical oxygen in the Pune district has reached 383 metric tonnes as against its full daily production capacity of 350 tonnes. Pune has over lakh active cases of Covid-19, and about 20% of them — an estimated 20,000 — are on oxygen support, the highest for any district. Consumption of medical oxygen in the Pune district has reached 383 metric tonnes as against its full daily production capacity of 350 tonnes. The district has over one lakh active cases of Covid-19, and about 20% of them — an estimated 20,000 — are on oxygen support, the highest for any district. “The situation will keep worsening if urgent steps are not initiated. Over 70,000 patients are in home isolation. Many of them need immediate hospitalization and medical support if their condition deteriorates,” health activist Abhijit More said. The situation is equally disheartening in Pimpri Chinchwad. A private hospital owner in Pimpri Chinchwad said the smaller hospitals were under tremendous pressure to procure oxygen. “The private vendor supplying us oxygen said he could provide only 10 cylinders on Tuesday, following which we had to take the civic body’s help,” he said. Pramod Kubade, secretary of the Pimpri Chinchwad Hospital Owners Association, told TOI, “We need a concrete solution to this (oxygen shortage) problem. At present, we are just delaying our problems to the following day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospitals-despair-for-oxygen-cylinders-many-reduce-beds/articleshow/82280895.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Metro tunnels under Mutha ready in just three weeks||PUNE: The excavation of Metro tunnels under the Mutha river on the Civil Court-Kasba Peth stretch was completed recently successfully. Two tunnel boring machines (TBM) had started the excavation at the beginning of April and reached the other side of the river completing 240-metre-long tunnels 13 metres below the riverbed. The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) has now started the excavation towards the Kasba Peth station — the next stoppage on the underground stretch. No hurdles were experienced during the tunnel work below the river as the stretch had unbroken basalt rock foundation. This was the first underwater tunnel constructed in Pune, a MahaMetro official said. The excavation began from the Civil Court end at the beginning of April. Another official from MahaMetro said, “A detailed plan was in place to complete the excavation at the earliest. The alignment of the tunnels was fixed. Both the TBMs progressed according to the plan and reached the other side of the river. One TBM has completed excavation of 240 metres, while another has covered 223 metres. The tunnels are placed about 18 metres below the ground level while crossing the river.” The Metro’s underground stretch begins from the Agriculture College grounds. It is aligned via Shivajinagar, Civil Court, Kasba Peth, Budhwar Peth and Mandai up to Swargate. The Metro would cross rivers in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad at three more locations through elevated bridges. Hemant Sonawane, the general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, said, “The excavation from the Agriculture College up to the beginning of Kasba Peth has been completed. Two machines are marching towards Mandai, while the third has started the tunnelling work from the Swargate-end towards Mandai. These machines will meet at Mandai, where they would be pulled out.” Another official from the MahaMetro said the work of the underground Metro stations had been speeded up besides the tunnelling work. The work at Civil Court, Shivajinagar, Kasba Peth and Swargate stations was expedited in the last three months, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-tunnels-under-mutha-river-readytbms-cross-river-in-just-three-weeks/articleshow/82281763.cms||Sarang Dastane

The police registered a case against Anil Patani, the younger son of deceased Laxman Patani. Constable Digvijaysinh Bharatsinh, in his complaint with Meghaninagar police, said that he was on duty on Sunday night when he received a message from Ajay Patani that his father had been strangulated. Digvijaysinh went to the spot but did not find any external injury on Laxman. So, he sent the body for post-mortem examination. The doctor opined that Laxman had died due to asphyxia as a result of pressure over neck. Ajay said that on the day of the incident his father had a heated argument with his younger brother over his lack of contribution towards household expenses. The other family members intervened and stopped the fight. At 2 pm when Ajay’s mother went to give water to Laxman, she found him dead. Based on the post-mortem report, the police registered a case and called Anil for interrogation. During interrogation, he revealed that around 12 midnight, his father got up and hit him on the head. Since his head was bleeding, he went to a local doctor for treatment. When he returned from the clinic, he found his father alone as everyone else had gone to meet his aunt.

The MahaMetro said no worker had left in the last week. Around 1,600 of the 6,000 workers had left work after Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad reported a spike in Covid-19 cases this year. Hemant Sonawane, the general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, said, “Initially, a drop was reported in the workers’ count as many preferred to return to their hometowns. However, since last week, no major drop has been reported at the sites”. Sonawane said the work had not stopped at any of the sites. “More workers had returned to their hometowns during last year’s outbreak than this time. We had prepared alternative plans. Similar steps are being taken now to ensure that there is minimum impact.” The MahaMetro said it had taken up vaccination of eligible workers and had taken safety measures at the sites. An official said the workers had been given basic training of social distancing and other measures to be taken. The body temperature checks of all the workers are conducted at the sites. The workers have been told to report any basic symptoms or if they require any medical assistance, the official added. The Metro work is under way in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad limits in underground and elevated sections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/workers-have-stopped-returning-to-hometowns-mahametro/articleshow/82281777.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Delhi||Shift Younger Patients To Places With Beds To Save Lives: Doctors||New Delhi: People in their 30s and 40s who would normally have a very good chance of surviving Covid are dying — not from the infection, but from lack of hospital beds to treat them. Frustrated from seeing younger people dying, doctors in several hospitals are demanding that the government puts in place a mechanism to transport patients to places where beds are available instead of letting them die waiting outside casualty departments of hospitals across the city. With no sign of the numbers reducing in Delhi, doctors also say the urgent need is for a triage (prioritising) system with extensive home monitoring and home care facilities as hospitals cannot take any more cases. “Many hospitals have closed their casualty because they are beyond overloaded. The least the government can do in the absence of a triage system is to organise movement of patients; take patients already stabilised and triaged by doctors in these hospitals to facilities where the kind of bed they require — ICU or oxygen bed — is available,” said a senior doctor at a Covid hospital. “In the middle of treating extremely sick patients and handling double the usual load, how can doctors be expected to call helplines and find out where beds are free?” Although right now there are hardly any bed in Delhi, especially ICU ones, what the doctors are demanding could prove crucial in the longer run. An emergency medicine specialist working in a corporate hospital said there was an urgent need for a working helpline for transfer of patients. “Where will patients’ families take them? On the government app or dashboard, you can see bed availability, but it is never accurate. So people cry and beg when asked to take their patients away. They die waiting outside the hospital they have reached,” said a doctor. He, like many others, added that Delhi might need to move patients into surrounding districts to take the load off. “If 15 patients get admitted today in a hospital, at least 10 of those beds are occupied for an average of 7-10 days. With the number of patients who require admissions that I am seeing, we under no circumstances can generate the kind of bed capacity — with oxygen and ICU — to cater to the patient inflow given we are completely unprepared logistically in terms of oxygen, infrastructure etc,” tweeted a medicine specialist, adding that immediate triaging was required. “In the next 15 days, the death count will pile up and there is nothing that we can do about it. Even if we triage, death count will pile up but we might save younger lives.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shift-younger-patients-to-places-with-beds-to-save-lives-doctors/articleshow/82281828.cms||---

Despite consistent efforts by the district and hospital administrations, the situation reached the stage of no-beds at the hospitals here on Tuesday with a large queue of patients awaiting a single bed. As per information, four patients died on the stretchers while awaiting admission in the hospitals. Many were also left with no alternative than to wait in ambulances or their own vehicles in absence of beds in the hospitals. Out of 1,056 beds in three hospitals under medical college, no bed is available at any of these hospitals even for the patients with fatally low Oxygen level. According to S S Rahore, principal, SN Medical College, all these beds are occupied with 960 patients on Oxygen. When the Superintendent of MDM Hospital, M K Aseri was asked about admission of a patient with Oxygen at critical level, he asked to wait until any bed is left vacant. Condition of the Covid-19 has reached a vicious stage, wherein 37 persons have succumbed to deadly virus in past two days, highest in the state and the efforts of the administration, both district and medical, turning out to be damp squib due to alarming spike in positive cases and terminally inadequate resources. The administration has constantly been working on enhancing the bed capacity in the hospitals but unabated positive cases leaving these efforts falling short. In the first two days of this week, 3,635 have tested positive in Jodhpur while just 1,736 recovered. While many patients and their relatives have been citing mismanagement and lack of care at the hospitals, lack of coordination among the administration, medical and health department and medical college administration as well as some doctors has also emerged as a crucial factor in adding to worsening situations. Interestingly most of the numbers, provided by the administration as Covid 19 in-charge and assistant in-charge, are either not responding or switched off, while some are hung on with a remark “I have no idea”. When in-charge of AIIMS, Naveen Dutt was contacted by TOI, he said that he was isolated and did not know who put his contact numbers on the list. After maintaining silence for such a long time, BJP MLA Surykanta Vyas also spoke to the chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday terming the situation to be very grim. Citing negligence of the patients in the hospitals and pathetic lack of resources like oxygen, beds and Remdesivir, Vyas has demanded attention of Gehlot for Jodhpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/patients-line-up-outside-hosps-for-beds-in-jodhpur/articleshow/82281770.cms||---

The man, Ravi Singhal, 47, could not be saved despite his wife’s desperate last ditch attempts to revive his breathing through mouth-to-mouth cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The woman, Renu Singhal, can be seen sprinkling water on Ravi and trying to give him CPR inside the auto which was parked right in front of a government hospital. Shared widely on social media platforms, the visuals invited shock and angst at the same time. Renu took Ravi to at least four private hospitals before arriving at Sarojini Naidu Medical College (SNMC) and Hospital, where too she was denied admission. The incident took place on Friday. The couple lived in the city's Awas Vikas area. The situation at hospitals across Agra remained grim on Tuesday as well. Caretakers of patients kept making rounds of markets throughout the day in search of oxygen cylinders. While several Covid hospitals were forced to discharge patients due to unavailability of oxygen. Lifesaving medicines also remained unavailable in the market. According to the health department officials, the oxygen supplied is “very less as compared to the requirement.” At least 70 metric tonne per day oxygen supply is needed at 48 designated Covid hospitals in the district. Senior member of IMA Agra unit Dr Ravi Mohan Pachori said, “Majority of the hospitals involved in treatment of Covid-19 patients are suffering from oxygen supply. It will be difficult to save patients in critical condition without oxygen. Machines like BiPAP, HFNC and ventilators have stopped working in several hospitals. Situation is getting worse by the day.” District chief medical officer of Agra district Dr RC Pandey said, “We are putting our best efforts to ensure hospitals do not suffer oxygen shortages. Supply has not stopped, but is much less as compared to the high demand. Over 10 teams are working to close the gap between the demand and supply.” Meanwhile, 494 fresh cases were reported in Agra district on Tuesday. The number of active cases increased to 4,334-- the highest ever. The health department reported deaths of 11 Covid-19 patients in the last 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/woman-gives-cpr-to-dying-husband-image-breaks-internets-heart/articleshow/82280897.cms||Deepak Lavania

While our law enforcing agencies need to maintain strict vigilance, expanding the curfew time and broadening the micro containment zones based on infectivity. These measures are the need of the hour so as to break the chain, said party president Dr Jorson Fernandes. “Besides a short lockdown, there is need to employ temporary staff like nurses, technicians, doctors to ease the stressed out frontline workers in the hospitals and Covid centres, rather than increasing their work load without any break,” Fernandes said. “The chief minister would do well to remember that saving livelihoods at the cost of lives at this critical junction and at the behest of the captains of industry will be totally counter-productive in the final analysis,” he said, adding that such an alarming scenario calls for a planned and strategic lockdown. With the situation going from bad to worse, it is the health workers who are being stretched beyond their capacity, he said. It is this special protection for livelihoods that is costing precious lives, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/impose-strict-restrictions-on-tourists/articleshow/82282678.cms||---

Relatives of Covid patients at hospitals kept making rounds throughout the day on Tuesday with some of the medical facilities even asking them to take away the patients as "oxygen was available for only a few hours". Doctors and medical staff are also working round the clock.Hospitals remained packed, with two persons even sharing one bed at government facilities, sources said. Besides, there was a shortage of life-saving medicines in the market. Black-marketing of oxygen cylinders, life-saving drugs was also a concern among the patients' "helpless" relatives.Khandari resident Punit Vashistha who was standing in a long queue outside an oxygen cylinder refilling plant in Sikandra said, “My brother is admitted in a private hospital. He is critical. The hospital management asked us to take away the patient as oxygen will last for barely an hour. They asked us to arrange an oxygen cylinder so that the treatment can be continued. I have been standing in a queue for five hours. My brother will die if he doesn't get the oxygen supply. Authorities are not answering calls. I feel helpless." According to the health department officials, the oxygen supplied is "very less as compared to the requirement". At least 70 metric tonne per day oxygen supply is needed at 48 designated Covid hospitals in the district. Senior member of IMA Agra unit Dr Ravi Mohan Pachori said, “Majority of the hospitals involved in treatment of Covid-19 patients are suffering from oxygen supply.

Philanthropist Prithviraj Singh, a resident of Barmer, will construct a 25-bedded ICU at the district hospital for the treatment of serious Covid patients. He has announced to give Rs 1 crore for the purpose. Similarly, after two young entrepreneurs of Barmer donated 500 oxygen cylinders, two more businessmen have donated 100 oxygen cylinders to the district administration. Rani Bhatiyani temple trust in Balotara will be donating 15 oxygen concentrators (imported). These machines will be reaching India by the end of this week. Oxygen is proving to be a life saver in treating Covid patients. Barmer MLA Mewaram Jain said that at this hour of crisis, efforts are being made to provide oxygen and other medical equipment to the government hospital. Prithviraj Singh giving Rs 1 crore for constructing a new ICU unit at the government hospital in Barmer is a great act. On Monday, district collector Lokbandhu Yadav and medical college principal R K Aaseri agreed to build an ICU and Prithviraj’s representative Swaroop Singh and Preetam Singh gave Rs 1 crore. It is to be mentioned that Prithviraj has always come forward for assistance in times of need, be it flood in Kawas or last year's coronavirus outbreak. He had donated x-ray machine last year to the government hospital. Philanthropists Mahendra Singh Aagor and Girdhar Singh Girab have donated 100 oxygen cylinders. MLA Mewaram had made an appeal to people to offer assistance to the government. Similarly, Shri Rani Bhatiyani Mandir Sansthan Jasol Dham has pitched in to improve situation at Nahata Hospital in Balotata. Sansthan president Rawal Kishan Singh Jasol said that 15 oxygen concentrators (imported) will be given to the hospital and these machines will reach India by this weekend after which they will be handed over to the hospital. Patients coming to hospital will not have to go anywhere else due to oxygen shortage. This machine can make 10 litres of oxygen in a minute and there will be no need of cylinder. The approximate cost of these machines will be Rs 11 lakh. Probably, for the first time such machines will be installed in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/philanthropists-come-forward-to-help-govt-in-combating-pandemic/articleshow/82281792.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||My lockdown learning: Help others survive||By RVG Kulkarni As bankers, we kept our offices open during Covid, as banking was one of the essential services. We followed every precautionary measure to ensure safety of our customers and staff. Work from home was allowed for our staff on a rotation basis. As a zonal head, I was also responsible for ensuring compliance to safety measures apart from assisting the frontend staff. So, I visited key branches and boosted the morale of our staff. The plight of migrant laborers was very bad. So, we also collected funds, prepared grocery packets consisting of rice, dal, cooking oil, spices -- enough to last for 10 days -- and distributed among stranded migrants. Here we took assistance from the local police who helped with manning the queues and social distancing, while distributing the packets. I also realised that being fit is not an option – it’s a necessity. I used to do light yoga and pranayama every day. During the lockdown, I increased the time allocated to yoga to improve my flexibility and started practicing close to 14 types of pranayamas to boost the lung capacity. We are a country of spices and homemade remedies. So, at home, we prepared a concoction of crushed garlic, ginger, cinnamon and turmeric powder with a tinge of organic jaggery powder and honey. This helped with improving overall immunity. Above all, a positive attitude and proper frame of mind is very important to stay mentally fit as most of the physical ailments are cured and controlled if one has a strong positive attitude. I started spending more time meditating -- extra 15 minutes in the morning on deep meditation and 15 minutes before going to bed. It helped me calm down during several crisis situations. The Covid crisis has taught important lessons of life. Less is more. Life is fragile. We need to accommodate every creature and allow them to survive. Nature can reclaim its space anytime.

This happened after the hospital’s SOS to the health minister, chief minister’s office, and district administration, that its oxygen stock was running out. When the attendants came to know, they came out on the streets and staged a symbolic protest. Superintendent of police Jashandeep Randawa, the area DSP, and the district magistrates had to come over. Within an hour, the hospital had a fresh stock of oxygen. The protesting families claimed their patients had died for want of oxygen.  The Sonipat SP claimed that these patients had been critical all along and their deaths were not linked at all to oxygen shortage. He said the hospital had oxygen but wanted to ensure sufficient stock, which was routine. Reports from Sonipat also says that subdivisional Shashi Vasundhra told the media that someone from the hospital staff had triggered the false alarm and an inquiry report will now go to the deputy commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/4-one-with-covid-die-during-sonipat-o2-false-alarm/articleshow/82282664.cms||---

The full bench of the commission, comprising panel chairman Justice S K Mittal and members Justice K C Puri and Deep Bhatia, passed these orders while taking suo motu cognizance of some media reports regarding deaths of some Covid-19 patients in Gurgaon, Hisar and Rewari districts of Haryana. “Prima facie, from the news items, it appears that deaths of the patients suffering from Covid-19 are taking place due to shortage of medical oxygen supply. If there is no shortage of medical oxygen in the state of Haryana, then how the deaths of the patients suffering from Covid-19 are taking place. If the patients are dying due to shortage of supply of medical oxygen, then it is a serious violation of human rights of the general public at large and the commission cannot shut its eyes over this matter as a silent spectator,” observed the commission. The matter has now been fixed for May 17 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/o2-human-rights-panel-seeks-report-on-deaths/articleshow/82282691.cms||---

After endless wait for RT-PCR testing, oxygen cylinders, CT-scan 108 ambulances, hospital admission and to cremate their near and dear ones, the kin of those killed by Covid-19 are now standing in long queues to get the death certificates. For the past several days in Surat, Athwa and Varachha-A zone offices of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) have been witnessing long queues as citizens have to go through the bureaucratic process in the scorching heat to get the death certificates. On Tuesday, at Athwa zone office in Adarsh Society the rush to get the death certificates was so much that the civic body had to start two more counters to handle the crowd. Although the procedure for getting the document was mentioned outside the centre, citizens were still clueless as they received multiple instructions. By noon, social distancing norms too went for a toss, as the applicants became impatient while waiting under the scorching sun and gathered around the counter. Often security guards had to intervene to make them wait in a queue at a distance from each other. According to SMC’s rules, death certificates can be procured only from the zone where the death took place. Since the NCH and SMIMER Hospital fall under Athwa and Varachha A-zones, these two zone offices are witnessing rush. Many big private hospitals treating Covid patients also fall under Athwa zone. Vicky Lapsiwala, a resident of Delhi Gate area said, he was told at the crematorium to collect death certificates at Athwa zone. “It was because I asked, I was told otherwise there would be so many people who go to their zone office and are sent to zone office under which the hospital falls,” Lapsiwala added. “The entire process can be done online, yet we are forced to wait here in a queue at the risk of contracting the virus,” said Shwetang Shah, who lives in Adajan. “The residents just have to bring a certificate issued by the hospital, form filled at the hospital and the receipt of crematorium. Since there was a rush on Tuesday, we increased two more counters,” said assistant municipal commissioner Jayesh Gandhi. Health officials of both, Athwa and Varachha A zones refused to share the number of death certificates issued from their respective zone offices. Similar scenes are being witnessed in Rajkot with massive rush for death certificates at three zone offices of Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC). RMC officials said that while in March they registered 1,400 deaths, in April even before the month ends 2,600 deaths have been registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/misery-continues-in-mourning/articleshow/82279290.cms||Jay Pachchigar

For more than 14 hours, his body lay in his Palm Valley society flat in Greater Noida (West). None of his family members – his wife and their two children -- were in a position to cremate it as all of them had tested positive too.Akash Rai, a family friend, said Naveen’s son Bittu (26) was the first to get Covid in the family. “Bittu is in a bad shape and needs immediate hospitalisation. His father expired around 6pm on Monday, but given Bittu’s deteriorating condition and the fact that Naveen’s wife and his daughter Nupur had tested positive as well, there was nobody to take the body for cremation,” he told TOI. Death of a Covid patient has been a double blow for families where all members have tested positive. With no one to perform the last rites of their loved ones, family members placed in isolation have dialled up Noida police, helplines of the administration and the state government seeking help for cremations. For many patients, it’s their family friends making these calls.In Naveen’s case, it was Akash. After Nupur, the daughter of the deceased, informed his sister and sought help for cremating the body, they called up the state government helpline. “It directed us to the district helpline. We also called Dial 112 and some cops from the local police chowki arrived, but to no avail. They said the health department would have to do something about it,” he said.It was finally social media that came to their rescue. Akash posted a message on Twitter, which was widely shared. A good Samaritan spotted their appeal for help and sent an ambulance from Delhi to the flat around 6am on Tuesday. An ailing Bittu had to travel in it with the body. However, his ordeal did not end there. The ambulance driver demanded Rs 8,000 instead of Rs 4,000 and threatened to drop off Bittu near Hindon if the amount was not paid. Bittu managed to reach the Sector 94 crematorium after shelling out the money. In another case, the family of Lalita Kohli, a middle-aged woman who died of Covid at their Sector 50 home, faced a similar plight. Her son and daughter-in-law too have Covid. Their neighbours sought help from the district administration and Noida police on Twitter. In the end, said Lalita’s daughter-in-law, her husband Manish drove and brought the body to the cremation ground in Sector 94 himself. When TOI spoke to her around 5.30pm, she said: “We have been sitting here since 11.30am. We have received no help so far. We have only been getting calls from the media.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/families-with-covid-struggle-to-get-loved-ones-cremated/articleshow/82282668.cms||Shikha Salaria

The HC referred to a “political figure” (BJP MP Sujay Patil from Ahmednagar) procuring 10,000 vials from Delhi. “How is it possible? It was airlifted by chartered plane. Will it not amount to private supply?” The bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni also took note that Remdesivir was procured from Delhi, which is facing a shortage. “Delhi is in crisis. Delhi is in need. How can they get it?’’ asked Justice Kulkarni. The judges said while the HC’s Aurangabad bench is seized of the matter, authorities “must increase surveillance.” They said the State and Union ought to check the veracity of media reports. “There is an interview of a person who got it,’’ Justice Kulkarni pointed out. He said, “We want the drug to reach everybody. It should not be in the hands of few. Every needy person should get it, not a few.” The judges also pulled up BMC, the State and Centre for not complying with its April 22 directions to set up helplines, grant permissions for more laboratories to conduct tests, and appoint a nodal agent for allotting beds. Asked about Mumbai’s progress, senior advocate Anil Sakhare, representing BMC, said 3800 new cases were reported on Monday, that there is adequate supply of oxygen and instructions are issued that no prescriptions should be asked for Covid tests. “The situation is much in control. On priority basis everything is managed,’’ he said, adding that BMC has not come across news of oxygen shortage in Mumbai. But advocate Simil Purohit contended that less cases were due to fewer tests being carried out. The judges got the advocates to dial BMC’s Covid helpline number to assess the situation regarding availability of beds. Advocate Arshil Shah informed that a Covid Care Centre at Worli on April 26 issued a certificate for shifting a patient to a `higher hospital.’ “I don’t know if subsequently she got a bed but it’s happening day in and day out,’’ Shah added. Advocate Rajesh Inamdar said the situation is similar in Pune. The court will take an update on the compliance of its April 22 order on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-sees-red-over-private-supply-of-critical-drugs/articleshow/82282666.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Noida||I’puram cremation ground brings down rush at Hindon||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation has kickstarted operations at the Indirapuram crematorium to ease the rush at Hindon.“This Indirapuram cremation ground, which has 34 platforms, is receiving about 30 bodies daily on average. However, they are only non-Covid bodies. The ground was taken over by the GMC a week ago,” said Mahendra, the ground manager.He added, “The cremation ground was functional earlier, but very few bodies were brought as everyone prefers the Hindon ground. But, due to the surge in cases in the last fifteen days, the GMC has taken over this ground.”While the rush at the Hindon crematorium has calmed down, the used PPE kits that are strewn all over post a heightened risk of infection. The ground is witnessing over 50 bodies (both Covid and non-Covid) daily.“A couple of days ago, the rush was so high that we had to put a notice saying that the cremation ground is full and people should take the bodies elsewhere,” said Pandit Manish, in charge of Hindon cremation ground. “They were directed to Sanjay Nagar and other places, but given the surge in deaths, we expect that the situation will worsen in the days to come,” added Manish.The cremation of Covid bodies is being done at a different spot where nearly 15 to 20 cremations are carried out daily. “The bodies are cremated with Covid protocol in place. People have to wear PPE kits. But there is a new problem now. The kits are disposed of all over in an unscientific manner,” said an official. “This has raised the risk of infection and the GMC have been asked to ensure proper disposal of used PPE kits” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/ipuram-cremation-ground-brings-down-rush-at-hindon/articleshow/82282698.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Goa||Aam Aadmi Party tells Goa to take assistance to handle Covid surge||PANAJI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) appealed to the state government to focus on handling the surge of coronavirus cases and deaths in Goa and has suggested to take assistance from corporates, organisations, other political parties, NGOs and citizens.  As both the chief minister and the health minister appear to be contradicting each other creating confusion among the public and demotivating the administration, the party has called for a joint press conference by both the chief minister and health minister “with clear decisions communicated in one voice”. The party has also appealed for all large congregations– weddings, festivals, casinos, nightclubs, and large meetings of any kind including that of the government, to be stopped. “It is no secret that the recently announced restrictions are simply on paper. These restrictions need to be enforced with police machinery if required,” AAP stated. To the government’s excuse that people are dying because “they are coming to the hospital too late”, the party said, “This is a very strange assumption that people are not interested in saving their own lives. Covid-positive patients in home isolation are being given telephone consultation by doctors. If these patients are coming too late to the hospital, has the Govt reviewed and updated the supervision protocols with these doctors based on the new information?.” “Additionally, if people are not respecting restrictions, or testing early enough, then the government needs to launch a comprehensive media campaign at the village-level for the next one week, to remind the citizen of covid-safe behaviour, how to recognise symptoms, where to get tested, and how to take the next step of treatment,” it said. The party also highlighted the need for clarity on bed availability and the next step the patient who is positive or requires hospitalisation should take. “There needs to be a war room or app dashboard that can maintain a real-time status of available covid beds, oxygen beds and ICU beds. This needs to also reflect availability of medicines such as Remdesevir, and supplies such as oxygen,” the party stated. As both the chief minister and the health minister appear to be contradicting each other, the party has called for a joint press conference “with clear decisions communicated in one voice”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-tells-govt-to-take-assistance-to-handle-covid-surge/articleshow/82282749.cms||---

With this, the state’s daily case fatality rate (CFR) was 1.3%, up from 0.7% last week. Of the total deaths reported by the state, 162 or 18% were from Aurangabad district alone. Of the district’s 162 deaths, 143 were from the corporation area and 19 from the district. Officials said this was due to reconciliation of data. The state also reported a significant surge in cases compared to Monday as 66,358 new cases were added, taking the total caseload to 44.1 lakh; the total death toll stood at 66,179. While the state continues to add worrying numbers, there was some good news from Mumbai. Compared to a week ago, there has been a 40% drop in the daily Covid-19 count in Mumbai. While 7,192 cases were registered on April 20, the daily caseload on Tuesday was 3,999. The city’s daily caseload was less than 4,000 for the second consecutive day as 3,840 cases had been added on Monday. On Tuesday, the rest of MMR reported 6,032 cases, much higher than Mumbai and deaths equal to Mumbai’s daily toll of 59. However, cases in the rest of MMR have also dipped as the region reported 10,031 on Tuesday as against 16,202 on April 20. Deaths have remained more or less constant, with 118 deaths on Tuesday and 115 on April 21. Mumbai had seen 34 deaths on April 20 and 75 on April 22. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force, said the numbers looked “encouraging,” but former chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis blamed the downward trend on lower number of tests. Fadnavis said fewer RT-PCR tests were being conducted even though 20% of the total deaths in the state were in Mumbai. In a letter written to CM Uddhav Thackeray, Fadnavis highlighted Mumbai’s test numbers in the last eight days: 36,556 on April 19, 45,350 on April 20, 47,270 on April 21, 46,874 on April 22, 41,826 on April 23, 39,584 on April 24, 40,298 on 25 April and 28,338 on April 26. “With a 40 lakh population, Nagpur is conducting over 26,000 tests every day. Pune is also doing higher tests with their 68 lakh population. But Mumbai, which has a four times higher population than these two cities, can’t even reach an average of 40,000 tests every day,” Fadnavis said in the letter. However, a senior BMC official said that instead of looking at the test numbers, one should concentrate on the positivity rate, which is between 12% and 13% in these two days. Dr Pandit said there is a need to increase testing and aggressively trace contacts of those positive. “We have to work to bring down positivity rate to less than 5%,” he said. Of the total deaths in the state, 392 were recorded in the last 48 hours, 179 were reported last week and the remaining 324 were from a period before that. At the state level, Nashik region has reported 17,064 cases, highest in the state, while Aurangabad circle reported 185 deaths, highest in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-daily-toll-hits-895-a-new-peak-fresh-mumbai-cases-drop-40-in-a-week/articleshow/82283646.cms||Bhavika Jain

An FIR relating to cheating was registered with the Lonikand police station. This is the eighth case relating to black-marketing of remdesivir vials in the city. Sub-inspector Amol Gawli from the anti-narcotics cell-2 and his team member received information that a person was selling a remdesivir vial. The crime branch stated, “We verified the information by sending a decoy customer and arrested suspects Rajesh Dengle (21) and Shubham Mukhekar (23) from Wagholi, Nanasaheb Sawale (32) from Wadebolai, and Yogesh Rathod (22) from Thergaon at Kesnand Phata, all working in different hospitals. We have recovered one remdesivir vial from them.” Meanwhile, PMC has decided to monitor the use of remdesivir. It has directed private and civic hospitals to keep a record of used injections and share the same with the civic administration. The initiative aims to reduce the misuse of injections. “The civic administration has given medical establishments directives after cases relating to misuse have come to light. The management of hospitals will have to maintain details of used vials. The hospitals should also have information about patients, who have used the medicine. If required, the civic administration may ask to produce the empty vials or wrappers, in case of any suspicious activity. So, while disposing the vials these instructions must be followed,” said a senior PMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-hosp-staffers-try-to-sell-vial-illegally/articleshow/82281837.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Kin asked to get medicine banned for OTC sale||KOLKATA: Despite the state government’s ban on sale of Remdesivir — an anti-viral drug being used to treat critical Covid patients — several nursing homes and healthcare units in the city and adjoining districts are still asking patients to arrange the medicines by themselves. Shankar Banerjee of Shakuntala Park in Behala was asked by a nursing home near Thakurpukur to get three vials of Remdesivir for his 82-year-old mother admitted with severe Covid infections. For the next 48 hours, he went crazy hunting for the vial at scores of pharmacies and even wholesalers at Bagree Market and Mehta Building in Burrabazar, only to be told time and again that companies were not sending stocks to them but directly to hospitals. Finally, the nursing home said it would procure it and billed him Rs 8,500 for each, nearly three times the MRP. Banerjee was lucky to finally get the vial. But there are hundreds of such instances of patients being sent on a wild goose chase by nursing homes and even hospitals with some even falling prey to black marketeers who are selling the odd vial of the anti-viral drug at Rs 16,000 or more when the MRP is under Rs 3,000. Two persons were arrested from the Esplanade-Park Street area on Monday for selling the durg at exorbitant rates. The state government had, on March 24, made it clear through an official notification that the responsibility of sourcing Remdesivir is that of the hospital. Yet, healthcare facilities continue to ask patient parties to fetch Remdesivir citing shortage of supply. The shortage of Remdesivir was highlighted by CM Mamata Banerjee in a letter to PM Narendra Modi a week ago (on April 20) where she had pointed out that against a requirement of 6,000 vials, only 1,00 vials were available. Following this, the Union health ministry allocated 27,400 vials and then revised it to 34,000 vials. But with many more patients streaming in everyday, the shortage continues. Several local nursing homes said they had stopped using Remdesivir due to its non-availability. Another drug that has become difficult to source is Tocilizumab, an anti-inflamatory drug that is also being prescribed to serious Covid patients. This has been out of the market for quite some time. It was also highlighted by the CM in her letter to the PM. The state has a requirement of 1,000 vials of Tocoilisumab a day. Ivermectin, an essential medicine being prescribed to many symtomatic Covid patients, is also in short supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kin-asked-to-get-med-banned-for-otc-sale/articleshow/82280230.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Dehradun||Government portal shows bed availability in hospitals that have been full for days||DEHRADUN: After the oxygen level of Nitin Pal, a Covid-19 patient from Ladpur, dropped to 72%, his family logged on the state government’s Covid information portal to check availability of beds. “The portal showed beds were available at a private hospital near Mussoorie Road and another at Saharanpur Road. However, when we reached these facilities, we were told that no beds were available and patients had even been waiting for the last two days for a bed to open up,” said Sachin Pal, Nitin’s son. The family finally found a normal bed at a third hospital. This is not an isolated case. Families checking the government’s Covid information portal told TOI they are often misled. Abhishek Tripathi of the Covid-19 control room said that this may be because the data is updated on a real-time basis and by the time a patient travels to a hospital, the beds are taken. “We are working on real-time management of the portal. However, we are getting complaints of people seeking oxygen supply even when their O2 level is stable. We are trying to monitor this as there is an acute scarcity of oxygen beds in the city and patients are waiting in line for it,” Tripathi said. Speaking to TOI, a staffer of Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) said, “You can see long queues of patients outside Doon Hospital almost all the time. They all say they had seen beds available at this hospital at the government portal, when not a single bed has opened up in the last three days.” Meanwhile, the Dehradun district administration on Tuesday issued a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for patients to get due healthcare. The order, issued by district magistrate Ashish Srivastava, says all asymptomatic persons with body temperatures of 37.5°C (9.5°F) and Sp02 level 295%, shall be shifted directly to a Covid Care Centre (CCC). “This may exclude people with co-morbid conditions, pregnant women, lactating mothers, children below 10 years of age or people having any other serious medical or psychological condition. Patients who do not have adequate availability of space for home isolation can also be shifted to a Covid Care center,” said the SOP. All symptomatic patients with body temperature over 37.5°C (99.5°F) or Sp02 level less than 90%, people with co-morbid conditions like hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, kidney diseases, dialysis etc., pregnant women, lactating mothers and children below 10 years of age can be moved to a dedicated Covid health centre (DCHC). Patients whose Sp02 level drops below 90%, who suffer organ failure, need assisted ventilation, or those who are over 60 years of age and have suffered a stroke or have co-morbid conditions like active cancer, thyroid, kidney disease (like those undergoing dialysis), those living with HIV or those who are immune-compromised, on steroids and immune-suppressants, etc. should be shifted directly to a dedicated Covid-19 Hospital, government or private. “Any facility found acting against the SOP shall be liable to strict action,” said the DM. With 2,218 new Covid-19 cases, Dehradun accounted for a fourth of the state’s daily spike, which was a record 5,703 on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-portal-shows-bed-availability-in-hospitals-that-have-been-full-for-days/articleshow/82280228.cms||Ishita Mishra

All three accused have been arrested. Police said a collision took place between the truck and a Bolero near Ghukna mod late Sunday night. The driver of the Bolero called some of his friends and took the truck to the railway line in Vasundhara near Hindon river, they added. Investigation officer Brijkishore Gautam said the driver of the truck, Amod, alleged that the men beat him up “very badly” and recorded a video too, which they then sent to the owner’s WhatsApp number. “He was asked to pay Rs 1 lakh against the truck or driver. The truck driver told them that he was taking the oxygen cylinders to a hospital in Amroha and that patients were waiting for them, but the men didn’t let him go,” Gautam added. “After four hours, the accused dumped the driver on Meerut road and asked him to contact them when he has the money,” he said. The three accused were identified as Tinku, a resident of Aligarh; Jitendra Kumar Singh, who is from Raj Nagar Extension; and Vinay Chauhan, from Nandgram area.

---||Delhi||Panic buying and lack of supply causing shortage of key drugs||New Delhi: Sonali Jain’s husband has tested positive for Covid-19 and she has been having a difficult time finding medicines like Fabiflu, Dolo and even azithromycin. After chemists in her neighbourhood in south Delhi refused to deliver, she recently went some distance from her home in search of the medicines, but to no avail. Jain was left with no option but to pick up different medicines but with similar composition. “Instead of Fabiflu, which is an antiviral, I got Starflu. For Dolo, they gave us paracetamol. To get azithromycin, I had to go to two different shops. It is very difficult to get these medicines,” said Jain. Like Jain, many have been struggling to get the medicines required for the disease management, even after seeking help on social media. The staff in chemist shops across the city claimed that the medicines were in short supply. “Our store sold out Fabiflu stock within a few hours. We are hoping to get some stock at around 4pm on Friday,” said a worker at Pawan Medical Agency in east Delhi. Fatibur Rehman, who works at Family Care Chemist in Jangpura, said this shortage had occurred because of diminished supplies from the distributors. “Since the current wave of Covid started, getting some specific medicines has become difficult. Remdevisir is not at all available now,” said Rehman. A representative of RK Pharma, a wholesaler in north Delhi, however, insisted, “There is no point in holding back medicines if we have them. We are also not getting the entire stock as per our demand.” Amid increasing requirements, some customers have started calling the wholesalers directly, he explained. The representative further said that the number of retailers requesting medicines had reduced considerably. “Many chemist shops are closed because their workers are sick. There is also a delay in collection and distribution,” he said. Satbir Singh of Sai Medicos in Vasant Kunj also told of home deliveries being affected. “As our workers are unwell, we have stopped home delivery of medicines,” said Singh. “We are aware entire families have tested positive and their members cannot come out to buy medicines, but we are helpless at this juncture.” Ali Raza of UA Medicos in south Delhi has only been delivering medicines to regular customers. Some e-commerce sites offer these medicines, but take two to three days to deliver them, and people, being panicky, demand them immediately. An employee of Jan Sewa Medicos in Okhla said, “We have now started demanding doctor’s prescription and the Aadhaar card before giving buyers medicines such as Fabiflu and Tocilizumab.” Representatives of United Enterprises in Paschim Vihar similarly said they were selling in-demand medicines only on prescription.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/panic-buying-and-lack-of-supply-causing-shortage-of-key-drugs/articleshow/82281888.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Bhopal||Vaccine for 18-plus: MP prepares for ‘Herculean’ task||BHOPAL: With the vaccination process for persons aged above 18 years beginning from May 1 onwards, the government has placed an order for 45 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine for the first month, which is estimated to be worth around Rs180 crores. Sources said that this will be delivered in a staggered way in the month of May. Vaccine for those above 45 years and frontline/healthcare workers is being provided by the Union government. Sources added that the next phase would be a herculean task as close to 3.5 crore population is estimated to be in the age bracket of 18 and 44 years. While modalities of the vaccination is being drawn out, registration process for the next phase will open from April 28 onwards. Sources said that districts have been given the right to decide the number of vaccination centres. Number of people who would be vaccinated in a day at a particular centre will be pre-decided, and date of vaccination will be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis, said sources. “Most importantly it has surfaced in our internal assessments that people are refraining from visiting the hospitals for vaccination due to fear of Corona infection. Thus it has also been instructed to the districts to find out and establish vaccination centres at places such as colleges, schools, community halls etc, so that people can easily come without any apprehensions,” an official said. Overall, the number of people who are vaccinated in the first month will depend entirely on the interest shown by the people, the official added. There will be no on the spot vaccination for those aged between 18 and 44, but for people aged above 45 years it will available, said sources. Districts have also been instructed that there should be two teams at each vaccination centre, one for the 18 to 44 age group, and other for the 45 and above age group, added sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/vax-for-18-state-prepares-jabs-for-3-5-cr-popn/articleshow/82280237.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Two private hospital majors add 382 Covid beds||KOLKATA: After a number of private healthcare facilities scaled up their Covid care beds, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, the city’s biggest private hospital, has finally stepped in to bear a bit more of the Covid load. In a major augmentation, the hospital is adding 300 more beds. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) added 82 more beds on Tuesday. These two hospitals have the biggest bed strength in the private sector. Meanwhile, the government has also decided to acquire more beds in private facilities to offer some relief in a vexed situation where the demand for beds has outstripped supply. The work on converting non-Covid ward to Covid ward at Apollo was under way on a war footing on Tuesday as all 100 Covid beds as well as those in the emergency triaging area remained completely chock-a-block. The 300 additional beds will be in the main block of the hospital. “We are working hard on the infection control logistics as we cannot compromise on this. A part of the 300 beds should be ready to take in patients by Wednesday evening. We are first working on the critical care beds. By the weekend, all the 300 beds should be ready. Our Covid bed strength will then be 400-plus,” said Joy Basu, vice-president of the hospital. The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission had last week asked all private hospitals to convert 60% of their sactioned beds into Covid care while reserving the rest for non-Covid patients. “At RTIICS, we have added 82 more beds from Tuesday to take the count of Covid beds from 161 to 243 with 110 critical care beds,” said Narayana Health zonal director (east) R Venkatesh. In addition to bigger private hospitals, the government has acquired beds from smaller ones like Daffodil Nursing Home and ILS Hospital, Dum Dum in north Kolkata. “We are also adding more beds to our government facilities. But given the kind of surge in Covid numbers, we need to be ready for more beds. We are looking for more set-ups where government beds can be expanded as and when required,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/two-pvt-hospital-majors-add-382-cov-beds/articleshow/82280234.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Bhopal||43% Covid-19 positive cases in MP reported in April 2021||BHOPAL: More than 43% of the 5.25 lakh Covid-19 positive cases reported in the state till date, were reported in ongoing month of April itself, suggesting the unprecedented surge of cases in the state. Overall 2.29 lakh new cases have been reported in the month of April, so far. A quick glance at the Covid numbers in the state presents the magnitude of the crisis. While it took more than six months for the first one lakh Covid-19 positive cases to be reported in the state, the latest one lakh cases have been reported only in the past 8 days. The second last, i.e., cases reported between tally of 3 and 4 lakh cases, were reported in 16 days. Even the third one lakh cases, i.e. the cases reported between the 2 and 3 lakh took more than 4 months. Last year, it was peak in the month of September, but even after the peak, it took another two months from September to November to report only lakh cases. Sources said that this is exponential, though the positivity rate is coming down slowly but it is yet far away from being comfortable and the infection has reached far flung and rural areas too, unlike the previous peak times when it was mostly restricted to the urban centres. The growth rate of infection could also be understood from the fact that in the first half of the month of April, it took 16 days to report one lakh cases, but in the second half, the growth rate of infection doubled and it took only 8 days to report another 1 lakh cases, said sources. And the cases are yet to come down, though there have been few days when less cases, compared to previous days were reported but on an average far more number of cases are being reported in the state compared to the previous peak in 2020, added sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/43-covid-19-positive-cases-in-mp-reported-in-april-2021/articleshow/82280231.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mth after blaze, HC says won’t allow hosp in mall to open now||Mumbai: Bombay high court on Tuesday refused to allow a hospital inside Bhandup’s Dreams Mall, where 11 patients had died after a fire last month, to reopen. “We will not allow the hospital to function. This (matter) has to wait,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni. The bench heard a petition by two healthcare companies to set aside the April 7 revocation of part occupation certificate (OC) and permit it to “manage and operate the hospital” on the third floor of the mall. On the night of March 25, a fire at the hospital left 11 patients dead and 67 more had to be evacuated by the fire brigade. The petition said no hearing was given before revocation of the part OC. Also, given the shortage of beds, the hospital—with more than 170 in-patient beds—can become operational in a short while as it has “state-of-the-art medical facilities and can provide oxygen and ventilator facilities to Covid-19 patients”. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC opposed grant of interim relief to restart the hospital, saying the fire no-objection certificate is withdrawn and the nursing licence has ended. “The electricity supply is cut and the building is sealed. Prosecution is launched against the directors of this company,’’ he added. Senior advocate Aabad Ponda for the petitioners, though, said the challenge is to the order revoking part OC. “Is it a fact that 11 people died in the fire?” the CJ asked. Ponda said the fire started on the first floor. “My hospital is on the third floor,” he added. The CJ repeated, “Did 11 patients die or not?” Ponda answered: “They died because of suffocation and not the fire.” The judges then said they will not allow the hospital to function and the matter can wait to be heard. They asked the petitioners to meanwhile file their rejoinder to the BMC’s reply and posted the hearing in June. The BMC’s reply said the building had no OC since 2011. There were some 1,000 shops on the first and second floors and a lot of illegalities, including additions and alterations. In April 2020, the petitioners requested that the hospital be allowed to treat Covid patients as well as other medical emergencies as a special case. The reply said part OC was granted provisionally as an exceptional case and considering the need for hospitals to treat Covid and non-Covid patients. It also said in such cases, for withdrawal of part OC, there is no need to give a personal hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mth-after-blaze-hc-says-wont-allow-hosp-in-mall-to-open-now/articleshow/82280238.cms||Rosy Sequeira

On Tuesday, rioting broke out between two groups in Moti Chirai village of Kutch’s Bhachau taluka with gun shots being fired in the air and vehicles vandalized. A fight and altercation over standing in the queue during re-filling of oxygen cylinders snowballed into riots in the premises of Agrawal & Company. A verbal duel broke out between Rajbha and Ramdevsinh who were standing in the queue. Police said that as the matter escalated Rajbha fired from his pistol on the ground. When the police constable present at the location tried to pacify both the groups, Rajbha fired two more rounds on the ground, triggering panic among people standing in the queue. The constable immediately called for additional force for backup as the situation was getting out of hand. Before anyone could realize what had happened, supporters of Rajbha and Ramdevsinh attacked each other and damaged several cars parked on the premises. Police said that Rajbha also threatened to kill Shivrajsinh by pointing the pistol at his forehead. However, members of both groups escaped from the scene before police force arrived. The complaint was lodged by the constable present there. Those booked include Rajbha Jadeja, Ramdevsinh Jadeja, Shvrajsinh Jadeja, Mayursinh Jadeja and one unidentified person. Rajbha and Ramdevsinh supply oxygen cylinders to hospitals in Bhachau and nearby villages. Police have booked them for attempt to murder, rioting and under Arms Act. They were also booked for under sections of Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/wait-for-o2-triggers-riot-in-kutch-gunshots-fired/articleshow/82279336.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Patient dies as oxygen supply ‘snapped’ by hospital staff||RAJKOT: Death of a Covid-19 patient from Morbi died, reportedly after the oxygen supply to patients was snapped, triggered severe uproar in Jamnagar’s state-run GG Hospital, on Tuesday. The 65-year-old deceased Chhagan Charola’s son and wife were fuming at the hospital staff, some of whom are even seen in the videos, admitting to have cut the supply following the order of superior. “I desperately pleaded with the doctors not to reduce the oxygen supply. I fell at their feet. But they said they had orders from higher ups,” the victim’s wife Lila Charola said in a series of videos which were circulated by her son on social media. They alleged that the hospital staff removed oxygen support of (65) around 10:30am on Tuesday in the presence of his wife. Talking to TOI, his son Karan, a ceramic trader in Morbi said “They removed the oxygen support and my father died after struggling to breath for a few minutes in front of my mother. My mother noticed that a person came and suddenly stopped the oxygen supply. Charola had tested positive on April 10 and was brought to GG hospital on April 14. When contacted, Jamnagar district collector Ravi Shankar, denied that the oxygen supply was snapped. “We have shortage of attendants, so some family members of the patients are giving voluntary service in the new wards. But they increase the oxygen supply to the patients during the night while the patients themselves increase the intake thinking that getting more oxygen, they will recover faster. If they do this, other patients suffer. Hence attendants regulate the oxygen as per requirement,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/patient-dies-as-oxygen-supply-snapped-by-hospital-staff/articleshow/82279350.cms||---

The police recovered two injections from the duo, Rahul Bohal (28) and Vijay Shirsath (29), both residents of Kalewadi. “The two men admitted that a nurse working at a private hospital in Pimpri had provided them the vials. We have not arrested the nurse yet because she is undergoing treatment for Covid-19,” said Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash. The commissioner said that he received information about a woman selling remdesivir injections at a high price. “Assistant commissioner of police Prashant Amrutkar and his team contacted the woman through a decoy customer. The suspects Bohal and Shirsath then contacted the decoy and asked him to come to Kalewadi with Rs 80,000 for two vials,” Krishna Prakash said. He said that the suspects were arrested after they reached Kalewadi. “We have recovered two injections, cash worth Rs 8,500 and a motorcycle from them,” the senior police officer added. He said, “Since April 9, the Pimpri Chinchwad police have recovered eight remdesivir injections that were being sold in the black market.” Meanwhile, a suspect, arrested on April 25 while selling remdesivir injections in Bhosari, tested positive for Covid-19. “We have conducted tests of all our men, who had come in contact with him while arresting him,” said Sudhir Hiremath, deputy commissioner of police, Pimpri Chinchwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-men-sell-remdesivir-vials-for-rs-40k-each-held/articleshow/82281890.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal set to turn Nicco Park into hospital, hikes oxygen capacity to fight rising caseload||KOLKATA: Nicco Park, Kolkata’s prime entertainment destination, is set to be converted into a makeshift Covid hospital with a dedicated oxygen tank for piped oxygen supply to patients' beds. Kishore Bharati Stadium in Santoshpur, which is also being converted into a Covid hospital, will also get an oxygen plant for piped supply. While these facilities will be run by private hospitals, the government has taken up a drive to boost oxygen manufacturing capacity in hospitals across the state on a war footing to prevent the kind of crisis that has plagued hospitals in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. In all, 55 new oxygen plants are being installed across the state for supply to hospitals and reduce dependance on oxygen cylinders. In addition, liquid medical oxygen tanks are being installed at medical colleges and hospitals to reduce dependance on commercial oxygen. The state government has over the past several months augmented the infrastructure at 105 government hospitals and brought 12,500 beds under piped oxygen supply. By May 15, the facility will be made available at 41 more hospitals, adding 3,000 more beds with piped oxygen to the inventory. Currently, the state’s captive liquid oxygen production capacity is 497 tonne and the daily average demand is 223 tonne. Current daily allocation because of Covid situation is 318 tonne. In Kolkata, too, efforts are on to convert large public facilities into hospitals and ensure they are equipped with oxygen supply to every bed. At Nicco Park, the state is scouting for a private healthcare facility to operate the hospital. A similar facility at may be set up Gitanjali stadium in Kasba. Last year, a banquet facility at Nicco Park had been converted into a quarantine centre. The hospital at Kishor Bharati Stadium that will become the annexe Covid unit of Medica will have 100 HDU beds, where patients requiring emergency oxygen support will be treated. There will be another 100 more beds for treating mildly symptomatic but co-morbid patients, said Alok Roy, chairman, Medica Group of Hospitals. The unit is set to become operational on Friday. The Canning stadium in South 24 Parganas, which was converted into a Covid Hospital last year, is still treating Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-set-to-turn-nicco-park-into-hosp-hikes-oxygen-capacity-to-fight-rising-caseload/articleshow/82280241.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Delhi||MHA: Delhi govt failed to sort out O2 ‘logistic issues’||New Delhi: The Union home ministry has blamed the persisting oxygen crisis in the capital on Delhi government’s alleged failure to sort out “logistical issues” due to which, the Centre claims, it has not been able to fully utilise the enhanced allocation of 480 metric tonne. Citing the example of other states and Union territories that have converted nitrogen/argon tankers into oxygen tankers to ferry enhanced allocations, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote to Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev on Sunday that “efforts of Delhi government have not been up to the mark”. The home secretary said Delhi government had directed oxygen supplier INOX to supply 98MT to 17 of Delhi’s hospitals, when the firm was supplying 105MT to 45 hospitals for a long time. Furthermore, alternative arrangements for the remaining 28 hospitals were not properly tied up by the government, he claimed. Stating that these hospitals were complaining of severe oxygen shortage, with one blaming it for some deaths, Bhalla said a proper consultation with the stakeholders, including suppliers and recipient hospitals, would have averted this situation. Pointing to the fact that most Delhi hospitals have been converted into Covid facilities, the home secretary said such hospitals would not have adequate capacity to store oxygen as per present requirements. “A virtual meeting with all hospitals in Delhi, taking stock of their respective capacities and infrastructure, guiding them to suitably augment their storage/pressure facilities to the required level with the help of experts of the field, would have avoided tragic incidents,” he noted. Bhalla underlined that such logistical issues must be tackled on a war footing with Delhi government taking the initiative. It may consider setting up a control room and such other initiatives “to manage this unprecedented crisis in the most scientific, effective and professional manner”, he suggested. The home secretary signed off by saying that it was extremely important for the central and state/UT governments to work in tandem to tackle the current Covid crisis and minimise human suffering. “I will request you to take urgent, effective, innovative and result-oriented measures like the chief secretaries of other states/UTs have taken,” he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mha-delhi-govt-failed-to-sort-out-o2-logistic-issues/articleshow/82281891.cms||Bharti Jain

Despite repeated attempts, the AAP representatives did not respond. However, during a digital briefing on Tuesday, Kejriwal said his government would import 18 cryogenic tankers from Thailand and 21 ready-to-use oxygen plants from France.

IMA also demanded that the city should be provided oxygen from the nearby plants to avoid delay in transportation. IMA office bearers claimed that till Monday the city received 20 percent less of its total demand of 230MT oxygen, but from Tuesday the supply further decreased and the shortfall is nearly 30 percent. “City hospitals are facing severe shortage of oxygen and unable to admit new patients. If the situation continues, life of many patients is at risk,” said Dr Hiral Shah, president of IMA, Surat. The local chapter of IMA held a meeting with top city officials and politicians to find a solution for the issue. “We explained our concerns to the officials and elected leaders. They told us that the situation may continue for a few more days and in this condition hospitals will have to take decisions about admitting new patients,” added Shah. IMA demanded that an oxygen bank with 40 Dura-Cyl liquid oxygen cylinders should be set up in the city to tide over immediate requirement of oxygen in any hospital in case refilling of the hospital’s oxygen cylinders gets delayed. Meanwhile, Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) started an oxygen bank for patients who are home quarantined. “At present the bank is started with 100 cylinders and the number of cylinders will be increased to 300 if required. The oxygen cylinder will be made available free of cost to the patients,” said Dinesh Navadiya, president of SGCCI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/ima-surat-demands-setting-up-of-oxygen-bank-in-city/articleshow/82279363.cms||---

Micro-level management is required. Can’t we improve our management by exercising our skills? What’s the difficulty? The government seems to be in a hapless condition and we want results,” the bench said.Citing the Centre’s order on remdesivir distribution, the judges said it was specific and it ought to be followed in letter and spirit by all states, particularly Maharashtra. “It’s in this regard that we would like to have specific information from the government, which is not forthcoming.

---||Dehradun||Sumna avalanche: Experts suggest geological investigation and review of previous hazard history of an area to avoid loss of lives in future||DEHRADUN: After the death of 15 Border Roads Organisation (BRO) workers following an avalanche that hit two labour camps in Sumna in Chamoli district last week, experts have suggested that geologists’ advice should be sought and review of previous hazard history of a particular area should be carried out before setting up temporary settlements for labourers on roadsides in the hills. The two BRO labour camps were hit by an avalanche following heavy snowfall in Sumna area of Joshimath sector. Army relief teams safely rescued 384 personnel and seven injured persons were airlifted to AIIMS Rishikesh for treatment. Significantly, this is not the first incident wherein a camp established on the road side has been devastated by landslide or avalanche. In April 2003, a similar incident in the Sumna area had killed 11 ITBP personnel. "There are certain measures we must take like geologists' advice and review of previous hazard history of a particular area before setting up temporary settlements for labourers on the road side in the hills," said Piyoosh Rautela, executive director of Disaster Mitigation and Management Department (DMMC). He further said that geologists can investigate the area and warn the agency if the place is susceptible to landslide or avalanche and the site for settling up temporary camps can be relocated. "It is always advisable not to build on the concave side of the hill that is more prone to such incidences. Indications of previous avalanche or landslide activity can easily be observed in the form of chutes, buried exotic boulders and scars. Such areas are not ideal for setting up any type of human settlement,” Rautela said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sumna-avalanche-experts-suggest-geological-investigation-and-review-of-previous-hazard-history-of-an-area-to-avoid-loss-of-lives-in-future/articleshow/82279378.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Around 28 employees and officers have died due to Covid. Situation is such that BJP MLA Krishna Gour had written a letter to district administration to close down work at the public sector company following the deaths. Few employees have even applied leave to avoid attending work. On the other hand, officials said that any decision to close down work would be taken only after directives from higher authorities. “This is true that around 30 deaths have been reported. Out of this, 15 deaths are confirmed due to Covid. Others are yet to confirm,” said a senior official of BHEL who did not wish to be named. He added that the fear is there among employees. “Obviously, fear is there among employees. However, BHEL has tried to adopt several measures like social distancing and mask etiquettes to avoid any further infection on the campus,” said officials. BHEL has also changed the shift timings. Earlier, there were three shifts of eight hours each. Now, there are four shifts of six hours each. Strength of staff per shift has been also reduced, said the officials. Employees, however, exhibit little confidence in these measures. “My entire family is living in fear. Whenever I step out for work, they keep calling me and suggesting me different measures to avoid infection. I think BHEL should stop working for a few days,” said an employee who did not wish to be named. Another employee said that BHEL is located at the epicentre of Corona infection in Bhopal. “Govindpura has reported the second highest number of Covid cases ever since the second wave began. In such a situation, attending the factory inside BHEL campus is always a big risk,” said the employee who preferred to remain anonymous. Meanwhile, realising the need of the oxygen, BHEL Bhopal has allowed the 24x7 functioning of the plant situated inside the campus. Plant has started functioning at full capacity. Earlier, BHEL was providing 1800 cubic metre medical oxygen which has been increased to 5000 cubic metre. For smooth supply of oxygen, BHEL has completely stopped its use inside the campus for industrial purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-deaths-trigger-fear-among-bhel-staff/articleshow/82280263.cms||Ramendra Singh

It filed 262 IPs, including patents, trademarks and designs, compared to 156 in the previous year. Using the nationwide lockdown to their advantage, faculty and students at some premier IITs worked towards filing more patents or keeping numbers steady. Of 262 IP filed by IIT-B in 2020-21, 163 were patents – a 30% increase from the previous year. Around 15% patents filed were related to Covid-19. At IIT-Delhi, patents filed rose from 145 in 2019 to 154 in 2020. At IIT-Madras, which has been filing most patents for few years, the numbers stood steady at 184, compared to 190 in 2019. IIT-M and IIT-D compile data in the calendar year. Numbers at IIT-Kanpur, too, remained steady at 65-70. At IIT-Kharagpur, patents filed dropped to 26. Milind Atrey, dean (research & development) at IIT-B, said the lockdown may have given enough time to faculty to complete paperwork. “Many products were licensed last year so trademarks went up by four times to 88. A decent number of products were related to Covid management,” said Atrey. Data shared by IIT-B shows that patents granted in the last financial year went up by almost 80%, from 67 to 120. “Awareness increased, newer agencies are coming in. The process used to take 6-7 years. Now, it takes 3-4 years to get an Indian patent,” said Atrey. He, however, added that fundamental research by faculty requires industry attention, as much as interest in applied works. Anil Wali, managing director, Foundation for Innovation and Technology Transfer (FITT), IIT-D, said, “FITT worked hard to secure more invention disclosures from the institute’s faculty scientists. Also, quite a few innovations were Covid-related, and those required faster processing given the pandemic condition.” He added that few additional patents were an outcome of processing pending applications in this period. Of 184 patents filed at IIT-M, 65 were international. International patents tripled in four years, the institute stated. Nine patents related to Covid-19 were filed in the period. Director Subhasis Chaudhuri, from IIT-B said the reason could be opportunities due to Covid-19 and having more time at hand with the pandemic. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-records-68-hike-in-ip-filings-some-patents-are-covid-19-related/articleshow/82281919.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Aurangabad||No guidelines on vaccination of people aged 18 & above||Aurangabad: Although online registration for Covid-19 vaccination of everyone aged 18 and above is slated to begin from Wednesday with actual inoculation to start from May 1, the health authorities said that they have not yet received any official guidelines from the state government. The lack of clarity on expansion of the immunization drive is attributed to multiple factors, including pricing and availability of vaccine doses. “We will plan on increasing vaccination centres and chalk out other strategy for vaccinating people above 18 years of age once the state government issues a set of guidelines. For the time being, we are focussing on vaccination of those who are aged 45 and above, among other target groups,” health officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Dr. Neeta Padalkar said on Tuesday. The Maharashtra government on April 25 made a quick U-turn after announcing that it would provide free vaccine to everyone in the age group of 18 to 45 stating that the Cabinet is yet to make a decision in this regard. The civic authorities said that it was only clear at the moment that private hospitals would have to procure vaccines at their level in future. “So far, the supply of vaccine was routed through the local civic body, but the same will not be the norm during expanded vaccination programme covering citizens above 18 years of age. We have no clue about pricing of the vaccine, if any, for those aged 18 and above at state-run or private hospitals,” Padalkar said. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-guidelines-on-vaccination-of-people-aged-18-above/articleshow/82279365.cms||---
---||Nashik||Doctors, staff of 2 pvt hospitals attacked after Covid deaths||Nashik: The doctors and staff of two private hospitals here were attacked and manhandled in separate incidents after two Covid-19 patients, one of them the brother of a corporator, died during treatment on Monday. Police have registered cases against members of the two groups involved in the attacks and also arrested one person. The incidents triggered outrage among private medical practitioners who have been at the forefront of the battle against the second wave of the pandemic in the city. Social activist Roshan Ghate (37), brother of corporator Priyanka Ghate, succumbed to the infection at the Manavta Curie Hospital in the Mumbai Naka area on Monday night. Hospital director Raj Nagarkar said Ghate was admitted to the facility 10 days back in a critical condition and was on the ventilator for the past seven days. “Ghate’s parents and relatives were being updated about his deteriorating health. All necessary treatment was provided to him,” he said. Nagarkar said Ghate’s relatives were even told to shift him to another hospital in Mumbai, but they did not agree. “When the patient passed away on Monday night, a mob of around 300 people came to the hospital. Some of them entered the ICU ward and created a pandemonium, putting the lives of eight patients, who were on the ventilator, at risk. Some of them even beat up our staff,” said Nagarkar. “If this is the result of putting in efforts to provide treatment and save the lives of people, especially those from a political background, who would admit them for treatment in the future?” asked Nagarkar. Police commissioner Deepak Pandey said an offence has been registered against the suspects. “It has been decided that in case of a Covid death in any private or government facility, the hospital should immediately inform the police station in their jurisdiction.” Pandey said police stations have been directed to send a team soon after any complaint comes from a hospital. Corporator Ghate declined to comment on the issue. Earlier on Monday, two doctors of Sushila multi-speciality hospital in Satpur were allegedly manhandled by the relatives of a 42-year-old Covid patient, Hasan S Maniya, who was on ventilator support and died around noon. The doctors said the patient’s relatives were agitated as the hospital had asked for a deposit. “The victim’s relatives were also angry that Remdevisir was not administered. The drug is given to patients only when required,” said Rajendra Bhoee, a doctor at the hospital. The Satpur police said they have arrested one member of the group that manhandled the doctors. Sameer Chandratre, former president of IMA, Nashik, condemned the attacks. “Private hospitals are attending to 90% of Covid patients and doctors are doing their job despite a shortage of Remdesivir and oxygen. Such incidents will only demoralise doctors,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/doctors-staff-of-2-pvt-hospitals-attacked-after-covid-deaths/articleshow/82279374.cms||Santosh Sonawane

They sent out messages to parents asking them to cooperate and ensure that their children attend classes and appear for exams. Parents were also reminded to clear fees for the current academic year. “Dear Parents of class 4 to 7, The government has announced summer holidays from April 27 onwards. Since we have only 4 exams to write let us complete our online exams. Kindly attend the exams and upload the pictures. You need not come to school on May 1 to submit the answer sheets. Stay home stay safe. Thank you,” read a message from a principal of a school in Secunderabad. Similar messages were also shared by the principals of junior colleges in the city, informing parents that classes and exams will be conducted as per the schedule. Parents said that the messages for the schools once again showed they don’t care and follow instructions given by the state. “Both my sons were asked to continue appearing for the final examination. What’s the point in issuing orders if the state can’t ensure that they are implemented,” questioned Sowjanya K, a parent, whose children are in class 4 and class 7. Syed Omer Jaleel, commissioner, and secretary, Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education, who is also acting as director of school education, said that action will be initiated against schools violating norms. “I have received complaints on schools and colleges conducting exams, classes and directed the officers at district level to look into the allegations and initiate action if schools/colleges are found guilty,” said Jaleel, adding that schools and colleges can’t act as if they are above the government and go scot-free.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-schools-continue-with-exams-and-classes-despite-vacation-announcement/articleshow/82284948.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

In the morning, when the shahi snan ritual started, it was being estimated that the turnout would be around 3 lakh (the previous shahi snan of Mesh Sankranti on April 14 saw a crowd of around 14 lakh as per officials while the April 12 Somvati Amavasya snan had a turnout of around 35 lakh as per the mela administration). Officials announced by evening that around 25,000 people had participated in the shahi snan till 5 pm. Sanjay Gunjyal, IG (Kumbh), told TOI, “Seers of all the 13 akhadas reached Har-ki-Pauri in limited numbers. As per estimates, around 25,000 pilgrims and seers participated in the the last shahi snan. All Covid-19 protocols like wearing of mask, social distancing and other SOPs were strictly enforced during the snan.” The sanyasi akhadas -- Niranjani and Anand -- took the first dip, followed by Juna, Agni, Ahavan, Mahanirvani and Atal akhadas. The three Bairagi akhadas, for whom the last shahi snan is especially significant, went after the sanyasi akhadas. Mela officials said they had persuaded the Bairagi seers to be present only in limited numbers in view of the Covid threat. They were followed by the two Udasin akhadas and Nirmal akhada. While some of the seers took a holy dip wearing masks, many were not following social distancing protocols. Meanwhile, the Bairagi akhadas announced that they would form their own parishad, breaking away from the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP), the apex body of all 13 akhadas. The Bairagis alleged they were not happy with the sanyasi akhadas declaring conclusion of the Kumbh early, adding they also should not have taken part in the last shahi snan as the Kumbh had already ended for them. Mahant Rajendra Das, general secretary of the newly-formed Akhil Bharatiya Vaishnav Parishad (ABVP) told TOI, “Sanyasi akhadas are not taking us seriously and the akhada parishad was taking biased decisions. They announced to end the Kumbh mela without consulting with the Bairagis due to which we decided to break away from them. We respect all in the seer community including sanyasis but neither akhada parishad nor sanyasi akhadas can decide the fate of Bairagis.” Watch Maha Kumbh: 25,000 turn out for last shahi snan at Haridwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/last-shahi-snan-at-kumbh-symbolic-sees-crowd-turnout-of-25k-bairagi-seers-announce-separation-from-akhada-parishad-form-own-body/articleshow/82279388.cms||MS Nawaz

He is coordinating with the government and private hospitals for transportation of bodies of Covid-19 patients to the city’s 16 crematoria. Deputy municipal commissioner Milind Meshram, who is in-charge of property tax, market, advertisement, estate and slum rehabilitation departments, is busy trying to find space for setting up of Covid Care Centres (CCCs) or Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCHs) across the city. He is also tying up with NGOs for providing manpower to the CCCs and DCHs. Meshram visits places being converted into CCCs and DCHs. Throughout the day, he monitors their status and gives updates to municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and looks up new suitable places where more could be set up. Likewise, deputy municipal commissioner (solid waste management) Dr Pradip Dasarwar has been assigned the task of ensuring availability of liquid oxygen in NMC-run hospitals. Through Nuisance Detection Squad, he also monitors whether city’s shops, markets and citizens are following the Covid-19 protocols. NMC’s superintending engineer (sewerage) Manoj Talewar is busy in monitoring the work of setting up of oxygen plants in NMC-run hospitals. Chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake has been assigned with arranging logistics of oxygen cylinders in same hospitals. Uchake has also spared six vehicles from his department for this work. The anti-encroachment department too provided trucks and manpower to assist fire department shift oxygen cylinders to hospitals. Similarly, other NMC officials are shouldering additional responsibilities to strengthen health infrastructure amid spike in Covid-19 cases. NMC’s workshop and transport departments have provided nine hearse vans and 10 mini buses to transport bodies. The solid waste management department has spared 105 sanitation workers for lifting of bodies. They were doing two shifts each starting at 8am and 8pm. NMC’s information technology department has provided computer operators for data entry of patients. Hard-pressed staff from various NMC departments are rushing through containment measures in affected localities, carrying out vaccination drives, conducting RT-PCR tests at zone levels etc. “What’s making the task difficult is that a good proportion of the staff are needed for civic amenities-related duties at the same time,” admitted municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. “These are challenging times, which we consider as part of our constitutional mandate. The day starts with providing potable water, sweeping streets, lifting solid waste from citizens’ doorstep and making streetlights functional even during pandemic along with keeping the health infrastructure strengthening,” he added. NMC has pooled in manpower from across departments for Covid works, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-staff-crunch-bites-nmc-makes-all-officials-multi-task/articleshow/82280967.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Commission stated three that Covid-19 patients died due to lack of oxygen in the district hospital Morena on Monday. The incident took place in the thirteen-bed ICU ward. When the angry relatives of the deceased created ruckus after the incident the doctors and paramedical staff ran away from the ICU. The civil surgeon of the hospital maintained that the oxygen level of patients who died was too low and no one died from interruption in oxygen supply. Similarly, in Katni the incident occurred in the district hospital on Monday morning. The oxygen supply got over in the hospital that led to tension in the hospital. In the chaos two corona patients died. In this case too, a dispute broke out between the relatives and doctors. The supply could restore when the oxygen cylinders reached the hospital after some time, the commission stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/hrc-seeks-reports-on-deaths-due-to-lack-of-o2/articleshow/82280318.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||N95 masks with ISI mark are tested for 14 key parameters||Q. Wearing a mask has become compulsory in the advent of Covid-19. But the question is, which mask do we wear? Some doctors say N95 masks may not translate into effective protection. Please advise. -- B T Srinivasan A. The type of mask to be worn depends on the quantum of exposure and risk involved. For this purpose, the advice of medical professionals is to be followed. Q. There are a lot of vendors selling fake N95 masks with fake ISI marks. How can we verify the genuineness? Can you recommend any authentic place where we can source these masks from? -- Dr Pravakar Adhikaree A. Authenticity of BIS license on a product can be verified by using BIS CARE App. Every ISI marked article that has a license number and issued to the manufacturer, is marked to it. When the license number is fed into BIS CARE App, it will display complete details of the license, if the product is genuine. If not, it will say “No such license exists”. The complete contact details of BIS licenses granted for a particular product can be obtained from: www.manakonline.in→ConformityAssessment→Search→ IS Number. Q. Why is it essential for consumers to buy ISI-certified masks only? Shouldn’t a basic cloth mask be enough? Also, how’s an ISI-marked N95 more efficient? -- Krishna Prasad A. For N95 masks, as per IS 9473, the use of the ISI mark on the product is voluntary. The masks are tested for 14 important requirements such as practical performance test, leakage, penetration of filter material, compatibility with skin, flammability, CO2 content of inhaled air, head harness, field of vision, breathing resistance, clogging resistance etc. Q. Majority of FMCG these days do not have ISI certification. High risk home appliances like gas stoves, induction stoves and other electrical items are sold by the roadside without any certification. What action can BIS take against such manufacturers? Why can’t BIS make ISI mark mandatory for some category of items that are risky in nature? -- P R Vittal Rao A. The product certification is basically voluntary in nature. However, considering the safety, health of human beings, environment and to curb the import of substandard products to India, 361 products are notified under BIS Act, 2016 under the compulsory certification scheme by Government of India. These products include electrical cables, switches, electrical appliances, LPG cylinders, cement, steel products etc. Anybody violating the BIS Act with respect to use of the BIS standard mark is liable for punishment up to two years imprisonment and fine up to Rs 5 lakh. Q. During this summer season, products like ceiling fans and air coolers are available in the market without the ISI mark. Can we file a complaint if we notice them and who should we be complaining to? -- Mubbesher Mehdi A. Ceiling fans (IS 374) and desert coolers (IS 3315:2019) are presently under voluntary certification schemes of BIS. Various licenses have already been granted for these products. In case of any quality issues with ISI marked products, consumers may file a complaint either through BIS CARE App, through online complaint registration on www.bis.gov.in or through email to the BIS. Q. Apart from masks, should other medical equipment that we use – especially when someone contracts the virus –also be ISI-marked? Can you share some details on this? -- Sujatha Kishore A. In addition to N95 masks, BIS has also certified the following products used in health care: Coveralls for Covid-19 as per IS 17423; surgical rubber gloves as per IS 4148; surgical gloves as per IS 13422:1992; tests of thermometers as per IS 3055 (Part 1 & 2); testing of eye protector as per IS 5983; face cover shield as per IS 8521-1; test of sphygmomanometer as per IS 3390 & IS 7652 Q. As consumers, what are our rights? What happens if the products we buy, despite having an ISI mark, are not durable? What are the laws that are in place for this offence? -- Parimala G Tadas A. The presence of standard ISI mark on a product provides third-party guarantee to the common consumers about its quality. To protect the right of the consumers, to seek redressal against unfair products or unscrupulous exploitation of consumers, BIS has a full-fledged complaint redressal mechanism. Consumers can lodge complaints on any ISI-marked product, if the product is not meeting the requirement of the relevant Indian Standards either through BIS CARE App, through online complaint registration on www.bis.gov.in or through email to BIS. BIS takes complaints for speedy redressal to the satisfaction of the complainant. It is also treated as a feedback information about the quality of products reaching the hands of the consumer and takes immediate steps to identify sources/reasons of substandard production and corrective measures adopted. Once the complaint is established the license may be suspended or cancelled depending on the severity of the complaint. Q. Are products with ISI mark, including masks, more expensive? Are they affordable to poor, middle and lower middle-class people? -- Balamukund T N A. A manufacturer holding a BIS license for use of ISI mark pays BIS what is called ‘Marking Fee’ based on the quantum of production covered, to cover surveillance costs incurred by BIS. The fee charged by BIS is very nominal, for example, 15 paise per 50 kg bag of cement costing about Rs 400 and Rs 1.3 per electric iron costing about Rs 600. This means that for a manufacturer who is already producing a quality product conforming to the national standard, adding the third-party certification in the form of ISI mark, does not increase the cost of the product. Q. What is the system in place to ensure a product is worthy of an ISI mark? What are the various processes, checks and balances? -- Sucharita G A. BIS grants license to a manufacturer to use the ISI mark, only when it satisfies itself to the effect that the manufacturer has the required infrastructure for manufacturing the product, testing facilities in accordance with the relevant Indian Standards, qualified quality control and testing personnel and sample tested conforms to the relevant Indian Standards. Q. Is there a continuous process to monitor the quality of products that have been granted an ISI mark? What is that process? -- Ketan R K A. Yes, there is a well-established mechanism in place to monitor the quality of the product, after the grant of license. BIS carries out: Surprise inspection of licensed units to verify satisfactory operation of the scheme of testing and inspection. Testing of samples of certified products in the factory for their conformity to the relevant Indian Standards. Drawing factory samples for testing in independent laboratories; Purchasing market samples of BIS marked products for independent testing and Proper assessment of complaints, if any. Q. Why is it important to buy ISI-marked packaged drinking water? What are the benefits? And given the misuse of the mark, is there any way we can establish which one is genuine and which is not? -- Premila Rao A. Any ISI marked product is manufactured and tested through well-established manufacturing and quality control systems. The Indian Standard for Packaged Drinking Water IS 14543: 2016 specifies six organoleptic and physical parameters, 25 substances undesirable in excess amounts, 12 toxic substances, 17 pesticide residues, two radioactive residues and 13 microbiological requirements for the product and another 18 tests for packaging bottles/jars. Thus ISI- marked packaged drinking water complies with the above mentioned requirements of the Indian Standard. Q What are the most common violations that BIS comes across, with regard to the misuse of the certification? Any particular products that we should specifically watch out for? -- Kasturi Shah A. Most of the violations that BIS comes across is the imitation of the standard mark. Wherever, safety of the consumers is involved, there should be a double check in the authenticity of the ISI mark on the product by using BIS CARE App. In case of any doubt in the quality of the product, the same may be brought to the notice of BIS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/n95-masks-with-isi-mark-are-tested-for-14-key-parameters/articleshow/82281950.cms||---

When will this ruthless government and the responsible persons wake up from their slumber? When will the government take notice of the aggrieved families?” he asked. The former chief minister said the state government must order a high-level investigation into all the deaths allegedly because of shortage of oxygen. “When will the government order a high-level inquiry into the incidents caused by the shortage of oxygen? When will the chief minister accept responsibility for these incidents due to the government’s incompetence and negligence and apologise to the people?” Nath asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/when-will-deaths-due-to-dearth-of-o2-stop-nath-asks-cm/articleshow/82280323.cms||---
---||Bhopal||I’m trying my best to help people tide over Covid crisis: Pragya||BHOPAL: Breaking silence over her missing posters put up by Congress at the BJP state headquarters here last week, Bhopal Lok Sabha MP Pragya Thakur said Congress leaders were showing inhuman behaviour since the party was trounced in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Thakur said that she is unwell and undergoing treatment in Delhi, but still, she is helping people day and night and making efforts to start a Covid care centre in Bairagarh. “Congress leaders have become inhumane ever since they lost the Lok Sabha polls. We cannot expect sympathy from them. It seems politics is their ancestral property. But we cannot be inhumane. People know everything,” Pragya told TOI over phone from AIIMS, New Delhi, where she is undergoing treatment. Posters declaring Pragya ‘missing’ amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic came up last week at many places in the state capital, including the BJP state headquarters. The posters which went viral on social media, were claimed to be put up by NSUI’s medical wing. Similar posters had also surfaced in the state capital in May last year during the first wave of Covid. On Tuesday, Congress spokesperson also announced a reward of Rs10,000 for tracing the BJP MP. “I have announced a reward of Rs10,000 to find our missing Lok Sabha member during the Covid pandemic. It’s unfortunate that people in Bhopal are dying due to shortage of oxygen, Remdesivir injections and beds. They are forced to run for medical help but the public representative is missing. Even last year, she was missing from the scene by pleading illness,” said Congress spokesperson Ravi Saxena. Making a scathing attack on Congress, Pragya said opposition party leaders are missing from the scene and their relatives are being arrested for black marketing Remdesivir injections. “Congress MLA Arif Aqueel is unwell for a long time. He has not come out in the public for the last one year. His nephew was caught by cops for black marketing corona injections. At least none from BJP is indulging in such crimes,” Pragya said. “I am working for the public day and night. My phone is working and never switched off like Congress leaders. I am trying to make arrangements for oxygen and injections on the requests raised by the people and senior leaders. The crisis is severe. This is a sensitive matter as people are losing their loved ones,” added Pragya. The BJP leader said that she was undergoing treatment under AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria and has been advised to stay in Delhi. She said doctors have also cautioned her to maintain strict Covid protocol as her immune system has become very weak after prolonged ailments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/im-trying-my-best-to-help-people-tide-over-covid-crisis-pragya/articleshow/82280334.cms||Rajendra Sharma
---||Shimla||For migrant workers in Himachal Pradesh, multiple Covid tests, but no jobs||MANALI: Thousands of migrant labourers from Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Nepal and other states are heading to Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh in the search of employment.  Many of them are not getting work while a large number of labourers have been tested positive for Covid-19. Now residents are hesitating in giving them work. The surplus labourers, at many places, have become a problem as they don’t have money to buy the meal and hire accommodation. Besides, they are being asked to undergo multiple RT-PCR tests during their travel from home to the destination. Hundreds of migrant labourers have been tested positive for Covid in both Himachal and Ladakh. A majority of them are heading to Ladakh, Lahaul-Spiti, Kinnaur and Manali after starting their long journey with a Covid test. As Manali-Leh highway is closed and Srinagar-Leh road is not open to general traffic movement, a large number of labourers are still stuck in Himachal and the Ladakh government has clearly asked them to bring RT-PCR test report to gain entry. “Our contractor got our Covid tests done in Delhi last week. As both Manali-Leh and Srinagar-Leh roads were blocked, we spent four days in Punjab. When were reached here, our tests were done again as officials said it was mandatory if we wanted to go to Lahaul valley and Ladakh. Now that the road is blocked again, we have been told to get another RT-PCR test to enter Ladakh as our previous test is older than 96 hours now and thereby not valid any more,” said migrant labourer Umesh Paswan.Another labourer from Jharkhand, Ram Saran said there was nothing to eat at home so he moved out in search of work. “We were told that Ladakh needed thousands of labourers. As labourers get good wages given the harsh weather conditions, Ladakh was our choice. But now we are stuck in Himachal as the road to Leh is blocked. More bad news came yesterday, that labourers from other states are not being allowed in Leh. We are depressed and upset.” Leh administration has informed Lahaul-Spiti police to ask all labourers to bring RT-PCR test report, failing to which they will not be allowed to enter. The administration took this decision to contain the spread of Covid. A large number of workers are going to Lahaul-Spitifor agricultural works every day and most want to go to Ladakh, where they get comparatively higher wages. The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is the main employer of seasonal daily-wagers and deploys them in its projects in Ladakh, Lahaul-Spit, Manali and Kinnaurthrough contractors. The Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, Leh, chairman-cum chief executive councillor Tashi Gyalson, in a recent meeting with officials of various departments to review the Covid situation had raised the issue surge in cases, especially among migrant labourers inducted by BRO. He had directed the BRO officials to restrict induction of non-local labourers for the time being and also directed provision of proper testing and other basic facilities to labourers already employed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/for-migrant-workers-in-hp-multiple-covid-tests-but-no-jobs/articleshow/82282888.cms||---

R Venugopal, deputy chief controller of explosives, Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) and nodal officer for oxygen supply in the state, said the demand for medical oxygen is shooting up at unanticipated levels in the state. He said as per the latest figures there is a demand of additional two tonnes of medical oxygen per day in the state following drastic increase in Covid patients. Health minister K K Shailaja and the PESO deputy chief controller convened a meeting of district collectors on Tuesday. In the meeting it was decided that all cylinders available in the state, including those used for the transport of industrial oxygen, nitrogen and argon, will now be used for the transport of medical oxygen. The total oxygen stock in the state is 468.91 tonne as on Tuesday and this includes 365 tonnes available with Inox Air Products Pvt Ltd located at Kanjikode in Palakkad, 4.5 tonne available with Kerala Metals and Minerals Ltd, Kollam, and 22 tonne with Praxair India Pvt Ltd, Eloor, Ernakulam. The stock also includes 77.41 tonne available in the filling plants. The health minister said that a stock of 220 tonne medical oxygen was available with government hospitals in the state. Currently, only 100 tonne of oxygen was required for the treatment of Covid and non-Covid patients. She said proposals to augment the reserve stock to 1,000 tonne are also being discussed.

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S R Bhat also asked the Centre to explain the rationale behind the differential pricing of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines for the Centre, states and open market. It will hear the Centre’s plan of action on Friday. With the spiralling surge in Covid-19 cases exerting immense pressure on the inadequate health infrastructure in almost all states, especially populous ones, the bench asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to detail the steps taken by the government for equitable distribution of oxygen to states, enhancement of critical medical infrastructure, projected requirement of medical personnel in view of the anticipated spike in Covid-19 cases and availability of essential drugs such as Remdesivir and Favipiravir. Mehta said oxygen distribution was being monitored by a high-level committee with direct intervention of the PM and the home minister. The bench suggested that there should be coordination committees till the district level for smooth availability of oxygen and essential medicines to patients and for projecting the estimated requirements for the next week. The bench also asked the Centre to detail steps taken to increase the production of vaccines to meet the surge in demand that would be witnessed once the eligibility age drops to 18 from May 1. The SC also suggested to the Centre to examine the usefulness of creating a nation-wide panel of medical professionals who could on a daily basis answer queries of mildly affected patients and the general public about dos and don'ts during home quarantine and general precautions to be observed while staying at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-give-details-on-o2-vaccines-remdesivir-by-tomorrow/articleshow/82283605.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The father, based in Lanka, cited an October 2017 order of the high court there restraining his wife’s travel to India with the children, and an August 2018 order of a Sri Lankan court which had granted him physical custody of both children and divorce on grounds of desertion. Three days after the interim stay in 2017, the mother, claiming to be unaware of the order, had travelled to India with the children. They have since been residing in Thane. Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale who pronounced the judgment saidthe children’s best interest is of paramount importance and “merely because there are some orders passed by a foreign court against their mother, according to us, that would not dis-entitle her from continued custody of the minor children”. The children, aged 6 and 7, are in India since the last three years and “appeared to be comfortable with their mother”. Also, their progress report appears to be satisfactory, observed the HC bench. The family has lived around the globe. Both parents, highly educated, had shifted to the US in 2013, three years after their marriage. The daughter was born in the US and is an American citizen. The younger child is born in India but holds Sri Lankan citizenship. The HC also took note of a report prepared by the American Consulate in Mumbai for the daughter which said she was being well looked after here. Both children had “developed roots” in India and speak the local language and are well adjusted in school, said the HC after the judges interacted with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lankan-man-loses-kids-custody-hc-says-roots-here/articleshow/82282033.cms||---

However, no injury or damage to the adjoining structure was reported, while the crematorium administrators are trying to divert smoke to the adjoining chimney to continue use of the gas furnace. “The gas furnace has been in use continuously for the past many days which led to the heating up of the chimney and finally becoming bent. It will be repaired soon and brought in use again,” said Kamlesh Sailor, president of the crematorium.Sailor, who is, however, currently under quarantine himself due to Covid-19 infection further said that the bending did not create any disturbance in the cremation process which went on with existing facilities. At present KC has five gas furnaces and eight wooden pyre stands. On an average 60 bodies are being cremated at the crematorium which is located in the city’s outskirts in Jahangirpura. KC is the farthest of the three biggest crematoriums in the city, but due to the high number of deaths since the second wave of Covid-19 started it too has been burning literally round the clock. Four new wooden pyre stands have been installed which were commissioned into service from Tuesday. “Process to install six other wooden pyre stands is continuing and will be brought in use by next week,” said Sailor adding that thereafter two separate sections will be created for Covid bodies and non-Covid bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-crematorium-chimney-bends-from-overheating/articleshow/82279439.cms||---

Central Railway chief public relations officer (CPRO) Shivaji Sutar said, “The 11 modified coaches will accommodate 16 patients in each coach. The coaches have been placed at ICD and will be ready in two days.” Railway minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday tweeted about the MoU between the Central Railway and NMC. Sutar said, “In the united fight against Covid, the railway ministry has modified nearly 4,000 coaches with 64,000 beds across the country. Of these, 169 coaches have been handed over to various states for use as CCC.” “We are providing all facilities in the coaches which will be jointly supervised. We are providing coolers, power, water, signages, communication, and two oxygen cylinders per coach (to be refilled by the NMC later). All infrastructure maintenance will be with the railways,” said SrDCM Krishnath Patil. The decision to use railway coaches was taken by the NMC on April 22. Prior to that, a joint inspection was done on April 20 by additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and railway officials. Considering its proximity to two government medical colleges, earlier it was thought these coaches would be stationed either on platform number 8 at Nagpur or at Ajni yard, but both the options have been ruled out. Finally, the isolated inland depot was selected. Patil informed the coaches CCC will be manned by NMC doctors and paramedical staff with the support of NGOs and will have an ambulance. The catering facility will also be provided by the NMC. For better coordination, ADRM Jay Singh has been appointed the nodal officer and from NMC Dr Narendra Bahirwar and Sunil Gajbhiye will work for better coordination. This is the first CCC by Central Railway. Last week, similar facility was started at Nandurbar station with 322 beds. 57 patients are using that facility now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rlys-get-11-coaches-ready-for-covid-patients-at-ajni-icd/articleshow/82280989.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

A nurse came and asked him to issue a death certificate. What happened next left the onlookers shell-shocked. The two had a heated argument and suddenly, the nurse slapped the doctor and he hit her back. The brawl was caught on camera and the purported video went viral. The incident took place on Monday, when the family of a Covid patient who had died approached the hospital administration for a death certificate. The nurse went to the doctor for it and he allegedly asked her to get a formal request in writing for the death certificate. Their ensuing argument turned ugly. While Rampur police said no complaint has been received, district magistrate Ravindra Kumar has ordered a probe into the incident. A red-faced administration sought to explain the clash as a result of the tremendous pressure under which doctors and other healthcare staff are working due to the second Covid-19 wave that has brought an unprecedented number of patients to the hospital.

It was airlifted by chartered plane. Will it not amount to private supply?” asked Justice Kulkarni.The judges also took note that Remdesivir was procured from Delhi, which is facing a shortage. “Delhi is in crisis. Delhi is in need. How can they get it?’’ asked Justice Kulkarni. The judges said while the HC’s Aurangabad bench is seized of the matter, authorities “must increase surveillance.”They said the State and Union ought to check the veracity of media reports. “There is an interview of a person who got it,’’ Justice Kulkarni pointed out. He said, “We want the drug to reach everybody. It should not be in the hands of few. Every needy person should get it, not a few.”The judges also pulled up BMC, the State and Centre for not complying with its April 22 directions to set up helplines, grant permissions for more laboratories to conduct tests, and appoint a nodal agent for allotting beds.Asked about Mumbai’s progress, senior advocate Anil Sakhare, representing BMC, said 3800 new cases were reported on Monday, that there is adequate supply of oxygen and instructions are issued that no prescriptions should be asked for Covid tests. “The situation is much in control. On priority basis everything is managed,’’ he said, adding that BMC has not come across news of oxygen shortage in Mumbai.But advocate Simil Purohit contended that less cases were due to fewer tests being carried out.The judges got the advocates to dial BMC’s Covid helpline number to assess the situation regarding availability of beds. Advocate Arshil Shah informed that a Covid Care Centre at Worli on April 26 issued a certificate for shifting a patient to a `higher hospital.’ “I don’t know if subsequently she got a bed but it’s happening day in and day out,’’ Shah added. Advocate Rajesh Inamdar said the situation is similar in Pune. The court will take an update on the compliance of its April 22 order on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-warns-pharma-cos-against-supplying-drugs-for-pvt-distribution/articleshow/82281012.cms||Rosy Sequeira

With the state’s medical infrastructure struggling to cope with the Corona avalanche, finding qualified medical staff to run the mega Covid-care facility will be tough. “Doctors, paramedical staff and class-four employees will come from outside to run the hospital, so arrangements should be made for their stay,” CM Chouhan told mediapersons. “A 100-bed hospital should start soon for a test run,” he said, adding that there will be a lab next to the hospital. The hospital is about 100km from Sagar district headquarters and 160km from Bhopal. The CM said that a team from Ahmedabad has arrived and it will start work on laying an oxygen pipeline from the tank to the hospital. Continuous oxygen supply will be ensured from the nearby refinery. “There is nothing certain about Covid, and it is going to be around longer so the hospital structure should be stronger. This will take around 15 days’ time,” he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/1000-bed-covid-hosp-in-bina-to-be-ready-in-15-days-cm/articleshow/82280402.cms||---

Don’t worry about me,” asserted the 102-year-old, tossing aside all apprehension by her worried family about her well-being. And she has reasons to beam — Kusum Soni combated the deadly virus and beat it in just a matter of 20 days. While her family members got a a scare of their lives, the centurion not only showed the virus who rules her body, but is also back to her daily duties as easily as it never happened. “We are so relieved that she has recovered from the virus. I got her tested for Covid-19 on April 2 after she developed some mild symptoms. Her reports were positive following which I immediately contacted our family doctor,” said Soni’s son, Uday, who too tested Covid positive during the same period. “Her RT-PCR tests showed that she had moderate viral load. Our doctor advised that admitting to hospital may increase her chances of any other infection and it won’t be advisable to give her heavy doses of medicine. So, we both got quarantined at home,” Uday, a resident of Adajan, told TOI. Soni was given mild medicine for fever apart from fruits and sprout juice every day. “We were in touch with our doctor daily and kept him updated about her health. We were worried as she refused to eat initially. But after about 10 days, my mother started showing remarkable recovery and her diet began improving,” said her diamond trader son. Allaying her family’s fears, the centurion would keep reassuring everyone about her capability to deal with the virus. “It’s a miracle that she recovered so quickly and is now completely healthy. She not has a strong will power, but her zest for life too helped her beat the deadly virus. I have experienced her positive approach when she stayed with me,” said Kusum’s grandson, Nital Zaveri, who runs a consultancy firm in Vadodara. While Uday tested negative for Covid in his second test, Kusum underwent a rapid antigen test on April 24. “Her report was negative. She had gone through 14 days of quarantine and responded well to the treatment,” said Reshma Dave of Krishna Milind Laboratory. “My grandma never suffered from any disease in her life. She neither has diabetes nor hypertension. It’s her healthy lifestyle that has helped her stay strong,” Zaveri added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/102-year-old-slays-covid-in-20-days/articleshow/82279483.cms||Tushar Tere

---||Pune||District gets 10,000 vials of remdesivir in 24 hours||Pune: The district received 10,000 vials of remdesivir in the past 24 hours — additional 2,400 vials late on Monday evening and 7,600 vials on Tuesday — the highest ever allocation of the intravenous drug so far. The allocation still stands quite low as the daily requirement has gone up to 18,000 vials in the district, prompting health activists seek stringent measures to plug holes to arrest black-marketing of the drug. They also questioned the transparency in the centralised allocation system of remdesivir. Health activist Sanjiv Dabhade said, “Many hospitals on the district administration’s dashboard are not getting the drug. Besides, how can patients’ relatives still manage to get the drug in black-market when officials claim that the entire supply of the drug in the district’s market is centrally procured and distributed as per the hospitals’ requirement?” Officials contested that the malpractices were happening at a handful of private hospitals’ end. They claimed that the distributors were receiving the vials only through the centralised allocation system overseen by the district collectorate and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) officials. “Private hospitals should stop harassing patients’ relatives by asking them to get the vials from outside as the supply has almost streamlined in Pune district. Complete transparency is maintained in the allocation of vials,” said Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner (drug), FDA, Pune. So far, black-marketing was detected in five instances in Pune district, Pratapwar said. “Barring a lone case where the vial was found sourced by the state government especially for the state-run Covid hospitals (bearing the stamp of ‘government supply’ on the vial), the vials of remdesivir in the remaining four instances were distributed to private hospitals through the Pune district’s centralised allocation system based on the number of active oxygen beds at each of these hospitals on the dashboard. That clearly shows the role of some of the unscrupulous elements working at a handful of such private hospitals in the district,” Pratapwar said. About 600 hospitals are currently treating Covid patients in Pune district. “The number was 300 in March. Similarly, the number of operational beds under Covid care has gone up to almost 12,000 beds from 7,000 in March. The surge in Covid cases is definitely fuelling the demand for remdesivir,” Pratapwar said. Health activist Abhijit More said, “It is true that the officials declare allocation of vials to hospitals every day but why don’t they reveal the exact number of allocation they get for disbursal? There are chances that the daily allocation is slightly more than what is declared, distributed, and shown on paper.” More also urged the officials to carry out random checks on private hospitals to cross-verify whether the vials allocated to them daily were used for the hospitals’ admitted patients. “Besides, the black-marketing will automatically resolve if the state government and the district administration ensure adequate supply to the district. The current allocation is way below what is required every day,” More said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-gets-10000-vials-of-remdesivir-in-24-hours/articleshow/82282039.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Bhopal||Lifeline chugs into Bhopal on Oxygen Express today||BHOPAL: The Oxygen Express will bring nearly 63.8 tonnes of liquid oxygen from Bokaro to Bhopal on Wednesday morning, giving a much-needed shot in the arm in the battle against Covid-19. The train, carrying six oxygen tankers, left Bokaro around 5.30am on Tuesday and is scheduled to reach Mandideep on Wednesday morning. It will deliver a tanker at Bhedaghat (Jabalpur), three at Makronia (Sagar) and two at Mandideep (Bhopal). Bhopal DRM Uday Borwanker said a green corridor has been created for the Oxygen Express via Kotshila, Jharsuguda, Bilaspur, New Katni and Jabalpur. “The six tankers will be taken off at different stations in Madhya Pradesh, including Mandideep. After providing oxygen at the required places, they will be taken back to Bokaro to bring oxygen again,” said an official. Officials said Mandideep was selected to unload the tankers as the staff here as experience of such tasks — it recently loaded several tractors on a train to Bangladesh. According to the SOP, five hours will be allowed to load and unload the liquid oxygen tankers. The train cannot exceed a particular speed for safety reasons. Like the rest of the country, MP is also battling for oxygen as the Covid avalanche overwhelms medical infrastructure. After not being able to arrange empty oxygen tankers in Bhopal, the state government had requested railways to bring six loaded liquid medical oxygen (LMO) tankers from Bokaro. The 32 empty wagons already brought to Mandideep will be used for some other work, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/lifeline-chugs-into-bhopal-on-oxy-express-today/articleshow/82280421.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Corporations rush to set up centres at neighbourhood polyclinics for vax||NEW DELHI: With just three days to go before Covid vaccination is opened to all people above 18 years, Delhi’s civic bodies have started preparation to increase the number of vaccination centres, deputing staff and making other arrangements. East Delhi Municipal Corporation aims to set up 30 new vaccination centres and the north corporation 22 more by May 1. The east and north corporations currently have 20 and 55 centres, respectively. Times ViewThe best way to defeat the deadly outbreak is rapid large-scale vaccination of the populace. However, due to the massive surge in recent weeks, the process has suffered a setback. Apprehension of getting infected while getting the jab is a key reason for this. Using neighbourhood polyclinics for vaccination is a good idea which could allay such fears to some degree.North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that more vaccination centres would be created in neighbourhood polyclinics as people were apprehensive of visiting big hospitals that have been converted into Covid facilities. “Navratri, curfew and the rapid spike in Covid-19 cases have impacted the turnout for vaccination at hospitals. But we are expecting it to go up again in May. We had earlier sent a list of 77 dispensaries and mother and child welfare centres, which was approved by the Delhi government. Of them, we opened 55 sites. Now, we have initiated work to set up 22 more centres,” said the mayor. Footfall at vaccination centres has decreased considerably over the past two weeks. In comparison to 8,156 people turning up for inoculation on April 10, around 5,300 got vaccinated on April 26 in south corporation facilities. In east corporation areas, only 1,956 got the jab on April 26 in comparison to 3,867 beneficiaries visiting the centres on April 10. “We had called a joint meeting on Monday wherein directions were given to officials for starting work to establish 25-30 more centres. Staff will be there to check crowding. People can visit any polyclinic to get the jab,” said EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain. “We have deputed an in-charge at each centre and hired auxiliary nurse midwives on vacant positions on contractual basis. Even doctors from Ayush and homeopathic departments have been deputed for smooth functioning,” said Jain. South Delhi Municipal Corporation said there were 51 vaccine centres in its areas. “There is no direction from the government to increase their numbers,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-rush-to-set-up-centres-at-neighbourhood-polyclinics-for-vax/articleshow/82282044.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Rajkot||Dung cakes help save 30 tonnes of wood in Rajkot||Rajkot: A crematorium in Rajkot has helped save nearly 32,000 kg or roughly 32 tonnes of wood in the last five days by using cow dung cakes As Covid-19 cases spike and the number of deaths spiral every day, the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) requested a non-government organization (NGO) to cremate bodies using dung cakes and sticks instead of wood in a bid to protect the environment. About 400 kg wood goes into cremation of one body but use of cow dung cakes and sticks reduced the requirement to just about 70-80 kg. “We have cremated nearly 100 bodies using dung cakes along with wood since April 21 after getting a request from RMC. Roughly, this has helped save nearly 30 tonnes of wood,” said Vijay Dobariya, head of Sadbhavna Vrudhashram, the NGO which is actively engaged in tree plantation in Rajkot city and villages too. RMC has provided a waste land and 15 furnaces to this private trust on Vagudad Road while several gau shalas (cow sheds) are donating dung to the trust. For now, the organization does not have time to make sticks out of the dung, so they use cakes directly. “However, we will soon procure a machine that converts cow dung cakes into sticks,” said Dobariya. Yogesh Patel, in-charge of the crematorium said, “In the first layer, we arranged wooden sticks and thereafter we set the dry cake of cow dung. Dung has less calorific value compared to wood as a result of which it takes nearly one hour more to complete the cremation of a dead.” RMC pays Rs 1,500 per body in addition to the yearly grants to the crematoriums looking at the unprecedented increase in number of deaths, expenses incurred on wood and maintenance of furnaces. According to sources, several crematoriums are also facing shortage of wood and they are forced to mix fresh wood in the pyres. The five crematoriums across the city are witnessing at least 40 cremations per day as compared to 10 to 15 in normal circumstances. Rajkot being the one of the biggest medical facilities in Saurashtra, the critically ill patients from Morbi, Junagadh, Gir-Somnath and Surendrangar districts are also referred here. As per Covid protocol, all dead bodies of Covid patients are required to be cremated in the city only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/dung-cakes-help-save-30-tonnes-of-wood-in-rajkot/articleshow/82279506.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Though the UK and South Africa variants of the virus are less, the presence of Maharashtra virus is more,” she said. “Even though we haven’t received details about it we have started taking precautions in the district against this variant,” she said. She also said that two types of enforcements are being carried out in the district to prevent the spread of the virus. There are areas in the district where the restrictions and enforcements announced by the government are prevailing. Apart from that, four panchayats and several wards where the TPR and number of cases are high have been put under complete restrictions. Speaking about the vaccination drive, she said that when the vaccines were available, four mass vaccination centres and 86 other centres were functioning in the district. “But we had to reduce the number of centres following the scarcity of vaccines. Currently seven centres are functioning in each taluk. Once we start getting more vaccines, the number of centres will be increased,” Anjana said. Meanwhile, 2,970 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the district on Tuesday. This include seven health workers. The test positivity rate was 30.81%. The highest number of cases was reported in Kottayam municipality 426.

---||Mumbai||Company hit by man-in-the-middle cyberattack, recovers Rs 44L diverted by scamster||Mumbai: A city-based company exporting medical consumables to countries tackling the Covid-19 pandemic was recently hit by a man-in-the-middle cyberattack. The company was to receive a payment of Rs 44 lakh, which the cyber scammer diverted to his own bank account. But the company owner acted swiftly and used all his resources to have a dialogue with the banks handling the transaction and within 72 hours, the fund transfer was reversed. A man-in-the-middle attack is when an attacker intercepts communications between two parties to modify information flowing between the two. The aim could be spying or redirecting efforts or funds. The Mumbai company had entered into a deal with a South American firm for medical consumables. Once the shipment had reached South America, an executive of the Mumbai company emailed an invoice to the client. The invoice—sent from the company’s official email ID—also contained banking details for receiving payment. “But when the payment did not arrive, the executive dialled the South American client to enquire. The client responded that they had already transferred the money to a bank in Europe as requested. The executive was aghast as his company only held bank accounts in India,” said a source close to the management. It turned out that after the executive had sent the email, another email was sent to the client from the official ID claiming that the company’s bank accounts in India were undergoing audits and the payment should be made to a virtual bank in Europe instead. A virtual bank has no physical structure. The company then hired a cybersecurity expert to review its systems and discovered that their official email account was compromised —it was being accessed by someone in Nigeria. For the next three days, the company owner used all resources to reach out to the officials managing the virtual bank in Europe. He convinced them that the Rs 44 lakh had reached their bank through fraud. Luckily, the scamster had not yet withdrawn the money and the bank was able to freeze his account. The Mumbai company owner then reached out to the South American bank where his client held an account and the funds transfer had been initiated. After a confirmation from the client, the bank managed to reverse the fund transfer from Europe. Cybersecurity experts have a word of advice, particularly for small and medium-sized export houses whose websites mention their email ID. “Most cyberattacks in India begin with a phishing attack and in all likelihood, that happened with the Mumbai company too. Do not fall prey to phishing emails. Always ensure that your email ID is protected with two-factor authentication and not just a strong password,” said cybersecurity consultant Ritesh Bhatia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-co-hit-by-e-fraud-recovers-diverted-rs-44l-in-72-hours/articleshow/82281032.cms||Nitasha Natu

Despite the approval, the RT-PCR based on RNA extraction, which reduces the reporting time to almost three to four hours, has not been procured by the GMCH-32. Even 14 ventilators under the PM Care Fund have yet to be provided at the GMSH-16, which has only six ventilators for Covid-19 patients. There are not more than around 200 ventilators in the Tricity hospitals. “While this new mutant strain has been rapidly deteriorating the lungs, absence of such medical devices in surplus quantity can affect the mortality rate,” said a public health expert. GMCH-32 has been approved for the new modular laboratory for ramping up the RT-PCR testing. “The UT administrator had immediately given approval. Tenders have been floated. The testing has to start,” said an official at the GMCH-32. The approval was given three weeks ago. “At a time when we need to enhance testing and have funds, the same is not happening due to shortage of manpower. The healthcare workers have some or the other infected in the family and have been quarantined,” said a faculty at the GMCH-32. He said, “There is only one RT-PCR machine, which does 400 tests a day. This goes for four to five rounds in a day, which the machine can’t bear at times.” Even for the functioning of the ventilator beds at the GMSH-16, the health department is waiting for the government to provide them permission to buy branded ventilators of their choice. “We do not want to get any substandard device. The PGI has also mentioned the brand and we also did the same, though it is not allowed,” said an official in the UT health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/despite-rs-29cr-with-ut-gmch-sans-rt-pcr-rna-extraction/articleshow/82282042.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The groom, bride, priest and five members from both families were clad head-to-toe in PPE during the wedding rituals, watched over by government officials. The marriage had plunged into uncertainty as the groom tested positive a week ago. “The groom had given his sample on April 14 and his report came positive on April 19. He is asymptomatic and was in home isolation in Parshuram Nagar,” tehsildar Naveen Garg told TOI. Since the family had already applied for permission, he knew about the wedding. “The marriage was scheduled for Monday and the family had booked a wedding hall,” Garg said. Officials went to the groom’s house, which was marked as a containment zone, to cancel the marriage, only to learn that the groom’s grandmother was in critical condition though not due to Covid. “she is around 80 years old and counting her days,” said the tehsildar. When the bride’s family came to know that the groom was Covid-positive and the administration intended to stop the wedding, her father fainted. “One one side, the groom’s grandmother is dying. On the other, the bride’s father is a heart patient. Their family members feared both of them would get a massive shock if the wedding were cancelled, and pleaded with us to allow it,” Garg said. On humanitarian grounds, purely as an exception, senior administrative officials allowed the marriage but tightened the restrictions. Twenty people are allowed at weddings, but only eight were allowed here. “We brought eight PPE kits for the groom, bride, priest and five family members,” the tehsildar said. The marriage was performed within an hour. A district administration team accompanied the bride to the groom’s house for post-marriage rituals and then escorted her back to her parents’ house in Mahesh Nagar. “We have put both families in seven days’ home-isolation and are keeping a close watch on their health” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/ppe-wedding-in-ratlam-after-groom-tests-positive/articleshow/82283755.cms||---

---||Bhopal||PPE wedding in Ratlam after groom tests positive||INDORE: PPE and a sympathetic administration salvaged a wedding in MP’s Ratlam town after the groom tested positive for Covid-19. The groom, bride, priest and five members from both families were clad head-to-toe in PPE during the wedding rituals, watched over by government officials. The marriage had plunged into uncertainty as the groom tested positive a week ago. “The groom had given his sample on April 14 and his report came positive on April 19. He is asymptomatic and was in home isolation in Parshuram Nagar,” tehsildar Naveen Garg told TOI. Since the family had already applied for permission, he knew about the wedding. “The marriage was scheduled for Monday and the family had booked a wedding hall,” Garg said. Officials went to the groom’s house, which was marked as a containment zone, to cancel the marriage, only to learn that the groom’s grandmother was in critical condition though not due to Covid. “she is around 80 years old and counting her days,” said the tehsildar. When the bride’s family came to know that the groom was Covid-positive and the administration intended to stop the wedding, her father fainted. “One one side, the groom’s grandmother is dying. On the other, the bride’s father is a heart patient. Their family members feared both of them would get a massive shock if the wedding were cancelled, and pleaded with us to allow it,” Garg said. On humanitarian grounds, purely as an exception, senior administrative officials allowed the marriage but tightened the restrictions. Twenty people are allowed at weddings, but only eight were allowed here. “We brought eight PPE kits for the groom, bride, priest and five family members,” the tehsildar said. The marriage was performed within an hour. A district administration team accompanied the bride to the groom’s house for post-marriage rituals and then escorted her back to her parents’ house in Mahesh Nagar. “We have put both families in seven days’ home-isolation and are keeping a close watch on their health” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ppe-wedding-in-ratlam-after-groom-tests-positive/articleshow/82280429.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana students will be passed after paying dues: Budget schools||HYDERABAD: Adamant private budget schools said students will be promoted to the next class only after clearing fee dues, a day after the state announced the elevation of class 1 to class 9 students without holding exams. They claimed that hardly 10% of the students paid the fees in budget schools for the academic year 2020-21 to date and requested that the state directs parents to clear fees dues. “We have conducted online classes, gave worksheets to students, and conducted physical classes for two months, but still the majority of the parents have not paid the fee yet. So, unless a parent clears fees, a student will not be promoted to the next class or issued a transfer certificate, in case he/she wants to seek admission elsewhere,” said Shekar Rao Y, president, Telangana Recognised School Managements Association (TRSMA). They said that when the state is collecting all taxes and bills even during the pandemic from the managements, schools should not be asked to forgo the fee. The managements said that parents should get in touch with them if they have trouble paying the fee so that they can come up with a solution. “If a parent is not in a position to pay 100% of the fee, they can request and management of a particular school will decide if they can provide any discount. The budget school managements will not be able to survive if parents fail to pay the fee,” he added and said that except for class 10 students, not many have paid the fees. In the state, there are about 10,000 budget schools. According to the managements, they have fees dues even from the academic year 2019-20 as students were passed without exams last year as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-will-be-passed-after-paying-dues-budget-schools/articleshow/82281255.cms||---

In the 24 hours ended on Tuesday, 9,866 tests were conducted in the city and district and 767 samples tested positive. On the previous day, 754 positive cases were found from 7,136 tests conducted in the city and district. From a positivity rate of 10.5 per cent on Monday, the rate dropped to 7.77 per cent on Tuesday.While this may come as a surprise, sources said that this happened as a larger number of samples were tested in the city. Existing laboratories have increased their capacity even as new ones have also become operational. The data being released by the VMC, however, has been under a scanner since quite some time now. The number of deaths confirmed in a day also peaked with VMC confirming nine people succumbing to Covid-19, taking the toll to 350 so far excluding those suffering from other co-morbidities and ailments. With 386 persons being discharged on Tuesday, the total number of persons who were cured in hospitals or home isolation reached 34,282. This left 6,961 active cases in the city including 313 persons on BIPAP machines or ventilators and 474 needing oxygen support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/with-767-ve-in-9866-samples-positivity-drops-significantly-in-a-day/articleshow/82279535.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pregnant woman fakes abduction to visit sister||Mumbai: A pregnant woman from Kandivli staged her own abduction as she wanted to visit her sister in North India against her family’s warnings. The woman roped in her 16-year-old sister-in-law to aid her by lying to the family. Samta Nagar police tracked her location to Rajasthan and got her back. Arpita (name changed), 24, is a Bihar native who worked as a background dancer in Bhojpuri films. During the 2020 lockdown, she began chatting on social media with a Mumbai man who worked in the film industry. The two married and Arpita moved in with her husband’s family at Kandivli (E). “Arpita and her husband fought frequently. On April 4, after a quarrel, her husband left for a shooting assignment at Benaras. Arpita was furious as he had not taken her along,” said a police officer. As she was six months pregnant, her husband and in-laws had forbidden her from leaving the house but Arpita was keen to visit her sister in Ludhiana despite Covid-19 travel curbs. On April 23, Arpita left with her teenaged sister-in-law under the pretext of withdrawing cash from an ATM. When the sister-in-law returned home alone, she told the family that Arpita had been caught for not wearing a mask and was bundled into a vehicle by two women near Lokhandwala Circle. Arpita’s in-laws rushed to the police station, which was something Arpita had not planned for. But scrutiny of CCTV footage drew a blank. After being questioned by police officers, the sister-in-law changed her statements. She finally admitted that Arpita had forced her to be a part of the plan if she wanted to see the baby that Arpita was carrying. She told police that Arpita had hailed an auto and was planning to board a train to go to Ludhiana. When police tracked down her phone location, Arpita had reached Vadodara in Gujarat. Her phone location kept changing. Roping in RPF, police found her on a train at Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan, on her way to Ludhiana. She was brought back to Mumbai and counselled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pregnant-woman-fakes-abduction-to-visit-sister/articleshow/82282060.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Ranchi||Congress wants to extend lockdown by 7 days||RANCHI: Congress, a constituent of the ruling Mahagathbandhan faction in the state, on Tuesday appealed chief minister Hemant Soren to extend the weeklong lockdown by seven days to curb the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the state. With two days left for the ‘health safety week’ to come to an end, sources in the state government hinted the duration might be extended but a final call will be taken by Soren. Congress spokespersons Alok Dubey and Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo in a statement said, “Going by the current spate of Covid cases, extension of the current lockdown is the need of the hour.” Soren’s party — Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) — had in fact called for a complete lockdown during the all-party meeting convened by the CM before imposition of the current lockdown (April 22-29). The same may be considered once again to break the chain of the virus. Meanwhile, BJP too batted for a strict lockdown for at least one week, unlike the present mode of lockdown, to arrest the uptick of cases in this state. Notably, in his address to the nation a few days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appealed to the states to refrain from complete lockdown but the state unit of BJP said that the situation in Jharkhand is out of control due to administrative apathy and incompetence. “PM had said don’t go for complete lockdown unless important and in Jharkhand the government seems to be not in control of the situation,” said a senior leader of the saffron party unwilling to be named. BJP spokesperson Pradeep Sinha on the other hand said they will support state government in whatever decision it takes to control the situation. “The current format of the lockdown in this state seems to have failed going by the number of cases we are still receiving. Since April 22, some 20,000 new cases and close to 400 deaths have been reported. Hence, it is important to take urgent steps to break the chain,” he Sinha. President of Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) Praveen Kumar Jain (Chabaria) said that they are ready for an extension of the lockdown. “We demand the lockdown to be extended for a week. During this time, the government must sort out issues like oxygen supply, availability of medicines and beds. Despite government’s efforts, we don’t think, it has been able to address issues completely, leading to panic among people,” he said. He added, “The lockdown should also be extended to get a clear cut picture of the emerging situation. The cases we are getting now are at least four to five days old due to delayed testing. The actual impact of the ongoing weeklong lockdown will only be known in next few days. Hence, the lockdown should be extended like in other states.” Despite relaxations in several sectors like agriculture, mining and construction, fear has grounded activities by more than 50%, he said. Sources in the state disaster management department said a decision will be taken soon. “The government is evaluating the situation and a formal announcement will be notified soon,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-wants-to-extend-lockdown-by-7-days/articleshow/82279740.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Cops seek court nod to release seized cylinders||RANCHI: In view of a shortage of oxygen cylinders in the state, police are now planning to handover seized oxygen cylinders to the district administration after permission from the courts. Additional director general (ADG) and chief spokesman of state police R K Mallick said SPs and the SSPs have been asked to move courts for release of the seized oxygen cylinders lying at police stations. He said, “The cylinders, seized during various operations, would be handed over to the deputy commissioners who in turn will decide how to distribute them among patients.” Sources said over 200 oxygen cylinders are stocked in police stations across the state. Mallick added, “Police are trying to make contribution in alleviating the pains of patients in various ways. An instruction has been issued asking policemen posted on law and order duty at hospitals to guide patients in getting treatment from doctors. In many cases, patients and relatives do not know whom to contact and where to go in the hospitals.” Notably, a police sub-inspector posted in Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Marut Nandan, has won praises from the people and officials for his role in facilitating treatment of patients. Police personnel in general have been asked to take all precautions to avoid getting infected. Officials are of the view that if policemen get infected in large numbers, it will not only affect the implementation of various anti-Covid measures but also add to the load in the hospitals. In addition, the police headquarters is also in touch with the health department to renovate its hospital in the campus of Jharkhand Armed Police 10 headquarters in Hotwar for treatment of infected police personnel and their relatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cops-seek-court-nod-to-release-seized-cylinders/articleshow/82279683.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Dead Covid patients’ kin heckle docs, nurses in PSU hospital||RANCHI: On-duty doctors and nurses at the Central Coalfields Limited’s (CCL) Gandhinagar Hospital in Kanke were allegedly heckled by the relatives of two suspected Covid-19 patients after they died within an hour of being admitted to the hospital’s emergency on Tuesday morning. Seema Devi (55), a resident of Barka Syal area in Ramgarh, and Arun Kumar (55), an employee of the Ranchi-based Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI), were brought to the hospital by their relatives in between 8:30am and 9am on Tuesday. Both of them collapsed and died in the emergency around 9:30am even as doctors tried to revive them by putting them on oxygen support. The relatives and attendants of the deceased then accused the on-duty doctors of being negligent. “They hurled abuses at us, broke an oxygen concentrator machine, broke other stuff in the emergency and heckled me and the on-duty sisters,” Dr Sanchita Mundle, the on-duty doctor at the time of the incident, told TOI. Besides Mundle, four on-duty nurses received minor injuries in the incident. Dr DKL Chouhan, the chief medical officer at the hospital, claimed both the patients were brought in an extremely critical condition. “Their oxygen saturation levels were hovering between 30-40%. Plus, they were not tested for Covid-19 before coming to the hospital,” he said. After their deaths, both Seema Devi and Arun Kumar tested positive for Covid-19. Doctors at the hospital have demanded Jharkhand government’s intervention in the whole incident. They have also sought deployment of CISF personnel from the CCL’s headquarters for their safety. “We understand that the pain of losing a near and dear one is unbearable. But that does not mean the relatives will assault the doctors and break hospital property. The government must intervene,” an official involved with the hospital’s management said. Gonda Police Station said it is yet to receive a formal complaint from the hospital management. One of the assailants has been identified as Mohit Kumar Rana, a CCL employee at the Ramgarh-based Birsa Coal Project. Since Seema and Arun tested positive, their corpses were not handed over to the relatives. “We will inform the district administration now. Besides, the relatives of both the deceased disappeared after the incident,” a doctor said. In another incident, the staff of Medanta Hospital in Irba went on strike on Tuesday morning. They alleged that the hospital management did not admit a Covid-19 patient who was brought in critical condition late on Monday night. The patient was a family member of a hospital staff. When contacted, the hospital’s medical director, Dr Mukhtar did not respond to calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dead-cov-patients-kin-heckle-docs-nurses-in-psu-hospital/articleshow/82279708.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The letter, a copy of which is with the TOI and signed by association president Ritu Kumar, secretary Navin Kumar and treasurer Dheeraj Kumar is also addressed to the advocate general Rajeev Ranjan. According to the letter, the association is flooded with requests from its members to provide beds, oxygen-supported beds and medicines to treat the infection. The association sought the intervention of the judges, saying it has been trying to help the advocates and their families with its meagre resources but without much results. The letter also said the premises of the high court or the campus of the new high court complex at Jaganathpur can be utilised to make a Covid-19 treatment centre. Highlighting that the advocates are not demanding any special measures from the HC or its judges, the association's secretary, Kumar, said, "We are only trying to ensure that some beds with oxygen and medicines be provided at a centre which can be set up at our proposed sites." He added, "People are suffering everywhere. With a little prodding, the government may be able to establish a proper treatment centre. The high court already has an infrastructure and not much effort will be required to set up the centre. Our association will also chip in to provide its resources for the well-being of all.” Earlier, a division of the Chief Justice and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad heard a petition filed by the association early this month and directed the health department secretary to explore the possibilities of setting up a 30-bed treatment centre on the high court premises. However, the government is yet to set up the centre, prompting the association to write letters to the judges and the advocate general.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lawyers-assn-seeks-hc-judges-help-to-set-up-cov-care-centre/articleshow/82279661.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Nearly 500 Covid cremations from April 20-26 in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: In the seven days from April 20-26, the city’s four crematoriums saw nearly 500 funerals in which Covid protocols were followed. The official death toll from Covid in the city was 53 in the same period. Most of these were Covid patients who passed away while in home isolation. Officials said some were from outside Gurugram but were being treated in hospitals here. Ashish Singla, chief medical officer of the MCG, said that for a week, 70 bodies had been cremated with Covid protocols on an average daily. “In the first three weeks of April, we did not have these many cremations. Only in the last week has the number of cremations increased. We have a dedicated team to perform the last rites with Covid protocols. We are working round the clock to cremate the bodies,” he told TOI. Jitender Setia, who owns a shop right outside the Madanpuri cremation ground, said he had never seen such sights in the last 35 years. On Monday, funeral pyres were lit in the parking lot as the cremation ground ran out of space and bodies piled up. “I have been here since 1987 but I haven't seen so many bodies coming for cremation in a single day. I have lost count of the bodies being brought here for the past one week or so. Cremations are taking place through the day,” he said. Deepak Sharma, a priest of Madanpuri cremation ground said, “We have written to the district administration to divert the bodies to other cremation grounds or make temporary arrangements elsewhere as we are not able to handle this load.” There are four Covid-designated crematoriums in the city – at Sector 32 near Medanta, Madanpuri, Atul Kataria Chowk and Carterpuri. The biggest of these is Madanpuri, where cremations are being carried out in the traditional way using wood as well as LPG. Non-Covid funerals are also taking place at these crematoriums. For Deepak Kumar, a Sector 7 resident who waited at Madanpuri to perform the last rites of his mother, one nightmare had made way for another. He had been unable to find a hospital bed for his mother. The sight at Madanpuri made him apprehensive if he could bid her a dignified farewell. “It is disturbing to see that due to the sheer number of cremations taking place here, there is not enough time to wait for the ashes to cool down and wait for family members to collect them. The ashes are being swept aside in order to make room for more pyres,” he said. Narender Kumar, who too waited at the crematorium on Tuesday, had similar apprehensions. “My mother died waiting for the treatment and now we are waiting for her last rites. We wandered from hospital to hospital for treatment but did not get a ventilator. When we finally got a ventilator, my mother's condition had worsened and before treatment could start, she passed away on Monday. When we reached the crematorium on Tuesday morning, a dozen ambulances were in the queue. We finally cremated her at 3pm,” said Kumar. Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Jacobpura, said families were going from one cremation ground to the other but were having to wait six hours on an average. “I came here to cremate my uncle after going to all other crematoriums. The wait is the same everywhere,” he said. The Shamshan Bhoomi Sudhar Samiti has decided to increase the number of LPG crematoriums at Madanpuri. “We have made plans for two new LPG crematoriums. At present, we have two such furnaces that are working round the clock. Since an LPG furnace takes four hours for a cremation, we are also performing the last rites the traditional way due to the large number of bodies coming from different parts of Gurugram and nearby places,” said Paramjit Singh Oberoi, president of the samiti, adding there was no room to store the ashes at the crematoriums.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/nearly-500-covid-cremations-from-april-20-26-in-gurgaon/articleshow/82283126.cms||Ipsita Pati

A decision in this regard will soon be taken in the cabinet meeting, he said during his visit to Chandrapur on Tuesday. Deshmukh and minister for relief and rehabilitation and guardian minister of Chandrapur Vijay Wadettiwar took stock of preparedness to handle the pandemic situation during the visit. He directed officials to raise the number of beds, both oxygen and ventilator, and stress upon contact tracing of positive patients. He informed that the administration has activated two oxygen plants of 20KL capacity per day and have plans to build a jumbo hospital in Chandrapur to deal with exponential rise in number of patients. He visited the women’s hospital in GMCH premises and also under construction building of Chandrapur GMCH. He claimed that the construction work of GMCH building was hindered by Covid lockdown since a year, and hence the contract has been extended, and asked the building be completed within a year. He also claimed to have directed government officials to ensure proper supply of Remdesivir injection to Chandrapur. Guardian minister Wadettiwar informed that presently 100 ventilator beds are operational in government Covid facilities in Chandrapur. He agreed that there is a need to increase oxygen beds across the district and claimed they have plans to install 400 oxygen beds in rural areas within next two weeks. “We are going to build 50 oxygen beds at eight tehsil headquarters in next two weeks. Apart from this, 120 oxygen beds are going to be installed in Forest Academy. Then, 90 more beds will be added to current capacity of 132 beds at women’s hospital within a fortnight,” he said. Wadettiwar claimed that Chandrapur will have additional 600 beds in service of citizens in next two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cong-keen-on-free-vaccination-in-maha-amit-deshmukh/articleshow/82281245.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Nagpur||All Covid forecasts failed, ‘experts’ now cautious||NAGPUR: It all began with ‘the worst is over and there will be no second wave’ prediction in October 2020. In December, when a surge in new cases came, experts said ‘such small surges will continue to come for more than a year now’.  In February 2021, when cases suddenly started increasing in some districts of Vidarbha, experts termed it as ‘area specific surge’. By the end of February, the forecast of second wave, ‘a bit more infectious but of very short term’ was made. By mid-March, experts had dubbed the second wave ‘highly infectious and a long term affair’. Now, in April, most of them have admitted that the virus is unpredictable and there is no point in forecasting it’s progress. While the above predictions came from experts in medical science and epidemiology; experts in many other sectors like mathematics, statistics, and astrology had their own models of projections about Covid-19 till early April. Today, most of them prefer to keep quiet. TOI re-visited these experts and asked what went wrong? Also, what their next predictions are. “Epidemic forecasting has a dubious track record, and its failures became more prominent with Covid-19,” said epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte. “Predictions have failed across the world, that is why we have seen so many deaths and longer lockdowns even in progressed countries. As for India, we can blame the more infectious mutations along with irresponsible public behaviour after the first wave,” he added. Statistician Hemant Sharma said that second wave of every infectious disease is always intense. “All statisticians across the world had predicted that the second wave, if it comes, will be more intense. In India, what we missed was its timing. My early prediction was that the new wave will come along with New Year 2021. But, it became late. Nationwide, the wave has started in mid-April,” he said. According to him in case the third wave comes, it could be even more intense. “But we have mass vaccinations and lessons learned from second wave. So, we can definitely control the third one,” he added. Earlier this month, the mathematical modelling approach of IIT Kanpur predicted that active infections in the country would peak by April 15 but this didn’t come true. According to their clarification, parameters in their model for current phase are continuously shifting. So it is hard to get their value right. Astrologer Sumedh Pandey had predicted that the cases will go down from April 8, but the predictions was overturned. “I followed the models used by many leading astrologers across the country. Let’s understand it in another way. We have a better idea of the virus since April 8. Cases are still surging, but doctors now know the virus better, which could be taken as an indication that we are moving towards ending this wave,” he said. His next prediction is that the fear of Covid-19 will end by Diwali. Most important predictions are of doctors. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said that mutations and public behaviour led to the virus spread. “As cases went down, doctors across the world had predicted that second wave will come and last longer. In India, the second wave came late, so it’s expected it will stay longer,” he said. According to Dr Prashant Jagtap, who is leading a major Covid-19 hospital in city, the present wave will continue for next two weeks. “Next two weeks are crucial. After that, cases will start coming down,” he said. SOME MORE PREDICTIONS Research report by State Bank of India (SBI) suggests second wave peak may happen in third week of May Michigan University predicted India will see 8-10 lakh fresh cases per day, and peak in deaths will come at the end of May, at 4,500 deaths per day IIT Kanpur and Hyderabad’s mathematical model states second wave may peak between May 11-15 with 33-35 lakh total ‘active’ cases and decline steeply by end of May Credit Suisse study predicted meteoric rise in cases would decline rapidly||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/all-covid-forecasts-failed-experts-now-cautious/articleshow/82280671.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

These plush vehicles are usually used by Bollywood stars for make-up and rest during shoots. With the Covid restrictions putting a stop to film and television shoots, the vanity vans meant for actors to get ready for shots are now being used to help the cops, especially women. They are able to take much-needed breathers and refresh themselves in the scorching sun during the enforcement drive to implement Covid curbs. Three state-of-the-art vanity vans rolled into the city from Mumbai on Tuesday for cops deployed at nakabandi points. This is the first time that such innovative measures were adopted, as a humane gesture to the cops in action at ground zero. Bringing comfort and relief, these vans would not put any pressure on the police budget as they are being fully sponsored through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds. With fully furnished washrooms, beds, tea tables, wash basins and also microwave for heating food, the vanity vans have brought a sense of respect and empowerment among the women cops. Earlier these cops had to compromise on their health and hygiene while on duty, with no bathroom and changing facilities available. Their menstrual periods too would be a testing time for them. City police chief Amitesh Kumar, who was instrumental in bringing the vans, said he had asked for five but managed to get three for the time being. “Our basic aim was to ensure some respite to cops at the nakabandi points on the roads, especially the women. In the soaring temperatures, we need to pay equal attention to enforcement staff,” he said. “We have distributed the vans to three zonal divisions of the city, and would see how they function for the next fortnight before taking a further decision,” he said. Yadav, who experienced the comfort of the vanity van at New Katol Naka, said she had been in the department for a decade but had never seen such a facility, for which she thanked the CP. “Earlier, women cops had to search for a hospital or a nursing home or a mall to use the bathroom. Forget rest and changing rooms, women cops struggled to find a place to relieve themselves,” said Yadav. Zonal DCP Vinita S said she too was amazed by the state-of-the-art vanity vans. “These vans would certainly be a symbol of women empowerment. The women cops too expressed their happiness when their feedback was collected,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/police-women-take-a-breather-in-vanity-vans-at-nakabandis/articleshow/82280680.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Politicians using Remdesivir to keep ‘vote bank’ alive||NAGPUR: Political leaders seem to have now stretched their concept of vote bank politics to Remdesivir availability. They are pressurizing doctors and hospitals to administer the anti-viral injections to Covid patients recommended by them, irrespective of clinical status or requirement. Sources said senior politicians also have a list of patients ready, who will be administered the high-priced life-saving Tocilizumab injection once it reaches the city. The doctors are fearful of getting sandwiched between political camps once the drug in short supply reaches the city. Such political intervention in Covid treatment protocols is leading to patients that actually require the drugs are not getting them without political connections or influence. Every reputed hospital has clinical committees to decide Remdesivir applications, and it is ensured every deserving patients gets at least the minimum required dose. But the cycle gets disturbed whenever there is external interference. A senior physician said normal dosage is two doses of Remdesivir on the first day (200mg), followed by 100mg every day for next five days. “Currently, we try to at least give two doses to every deserving patient, as the drug is in short supply. We get calls to ensure these doses are increased for someone close to politicians,” he said. On Tuesday, hospitals got only 54% of their daily requirement of Remdesivir. “The doses are already irregular due to short-supply, but if there is a further pressure to give the injection to a patient with milder symptoms then the recovery of serious patients is delayed, and their hospital stay is prolonged, leading to fewer beds becoming available,” said the senior physician. It’s learnt the district administration and also the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) too are facing undue political interference regarding Remdesivir and oxygen quotas to different Covid hospitals. Though officials remained tight-lipped about political pressure, it’s learnt they are struggling to balance the demands. “The way oxygen allotment is altered in favour of some hospitals, it’s clear there is pressure on the system,” said an insider. Apart from Remdesivir, it’s learnt politicians are also flexing muscles to ensure their patients gets beds and ICUs too. A senior doctor at a prominent hospital said political interference to administer patients Remdesivir is rising to the extent that their cycle of treatment with patients of different grades is getting disturbed. “We are already getting fluctuating quota from the district administration, as availability is completely unpredictable. Hospitals try to adjust doses among moderate and severe patients but frequently get calls to administer the injection to someone who does not require it at that point of time,” said the physician. “The problem gets aggravated when we get calls for giving Remdesivir to the same patient repeatedly while someone waiting would be deprived,” said the doctor. Another doctor said hospitals and medical fraternity are apprehensive of earning the politicians’ wrath if their demands are not fulfilled. “There would be a ransacking at the hospital premises or allegations by supporters of these politicians if we do not give in to the demands. The politicians are exercising their influence in the name of ‘jan sewa’ to browbeat us,” said the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/politicians-using-rem-to-keep-vote-bank-alive/articleshow/82280706.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||India||HC notice to UP SEC on ‘deaths of 135 poll officials’||PRAYAGRAJ: Taking note of the reported deaths of 135 teachers, shiksha mitras and investigators assigned panchayat election duty, the Allahabad HC on Tuesday issued notices to the Uttar Pradesh State Election Commission (UPSEC) and asked why it failed to check non-compliance of Covid guidelines during multiple phases of panchayat elections. The court further asked why action should not be taken against it and its officials. A division bench of Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar further directed UPSEC to “take immediately measures in the remaining phases of panchayat elections to ensure Covid guidelines are complied with, else action would be taken against officials involved in the election process”. “At least 200 teachers have lost their lives to Covid-19 within a week of returning from panchayat election duties and over 2,000 others are infected,” prominent unions representing teachers in Uttar Pradesh have said. In separate letters written to CM Yogi Adityanath, the associations have appealed that the counting of votes slated for May 2 be shelved. The unions also said over 400 family members of the teachers who came in contact have also died. Virendra Mishra, UP spokesperson of Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, told TOI that teachers will boycott the counting if the government doesn’t postpone it. TOI had reported earlier that many teachers who died were already ill when the call for poll duty came. Their appeals for leniency were rejected. Skipping election duty invites legal action. UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri district witnessed arguably the maximum casualties at 28. Among them was Poonam Jaiswal (55), a mother of two children. Her younger sister told TOI, “She had mild symptoms a day after election duty. She tested positive on April 25. Poonam’s health deteriorated on April 26. She died as we were trying to arrange for an oxygen cylinder.” (Inputs from Sandeep Rai, Deepak Lavania, Kanwardeep Singh & Rajesh Kumar Pandey)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-notice-to-up-sec-on-deaths-of-135-poll-officials/articleshow/82283609.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Last year’s learnings help battle second wave||Visakhapatnam: Andhra Pradesh was the second state in the country after Maharashtra to cross the five-lakh cumulative Covid-19 case mark during the first wave in September last year. The healthcare system of the state was close to its breaking point when case numbers started dwindling in September. However, Andhra Pradesh continued to remain in the second spot in terms of absolute case numbers, even when the state had breached the eight-lakh case mark in November 2020. The expansive testing, then topping the country in terms of number of people screened for every one million population, had helped Andhra Pradesh check the infection numbers in the ensuing weeks. By the time the state touched the one-million case mark four days ago, its position had fallen to seventh place. The states, which were largely unaffected during the first wave, such as West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat are now topping the daily case charts even as states long battered by Covid-19, such as Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh continue to post record numbers. However, officials in Andhra Pradesh anticipate that infection numbers may increase in the coming weeks and have lined up nearly 400 hospitals apart from Covid care centres to treat patients. After the sustained downward spiral of the daily case count for almost four months in Andhra Pradesh, from November 2020 to February 2021, the number of fresh infections started climbing upward from the first week of March, hinting at an impending second wave. The trajectory during this second wave has been such that it took only two months for the state to surpass its previous highest-ever spike in the first wave of Covid-19. This can be better explained from the case positivity rate—a key metric to gauge the virus spread at a certain point in time. The positivity rate had remained under 0.4% on any given day in February, while the average for the month stood at 0.25%. But the average case positivity rate in the last one week has been a critical 22%. Only some 2% of the total beds at around 50 Covid-19 hospitals had been occupied by patients just two months ago. The bed occupancy rate has now shot up to about 50% at the nearly 400 hospitals that are serving the infected individuals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/last-years-learnings-help-battle-second-wave/articleshow/82279861.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Nagpur||CP: Hospitals pilferage pushing up Remdesivir black marketing||NAGPUR: City police chief Amitesh Kumar, who has cracked down on Remdesivir black marketing, said pilferage of the anti-viral drug from Covid hospitals seems to have aggravated the malpractices revolving around it’s scarcity. Starting from April 16, city police have so far registered nine cases against 33 persons, which included 15 paramedical staffers. Some 37 Remdesivir injections have been recovered from them. Out of the persons arrested so far, the maximum number of accused were ward boys. One doctor and two nurses too have been apprehended. City police have also arrested 17 civilians, including 20-year-old Raunak Lonarkar, who was nabbed by Tehsil cops on Tuesday. They were mostly found to be in nexus with hospital staffers. A small number of the civilians, like Lonarkar, were caught trying to sell the injection themselves, after they were left over following the treatment. District collector Ravindra Thakare said hospital managements were alerted during online meetings that they are required to be vigilant regarding stock being allocated to them on a daily basis. “The district administration had alerted hospitals to safeguard Remdesivir stocks,” he said. “The hospitals have also been asked to keep the empty vials for inspections and scrutiny, whenever required,” he said. CP Amitesh Kumar said the investigations and interrogation have revealed the involvement of hospital insiders, like ward boys, as the common factor. “Earlier, we found the ward boys were stealing Remdesivir from dead patients and also pilfering from the stocks. Now, we have learnt they have Remdesivir which was partially administered or vials half-filled with water too,” he said. Kumar said he had earlier suggested to NMC and collector to issue advisory to hospitals to remain alert regarding theft of the scarce drugs. “Better management of empty vials and also filming the process of administering injections are the two most viable means to check pilferage and keep an account of doses given and drug in stock,” he said. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of Vidarbha Hospital Association, said hospitals must collect empty Remdesivir vials and hand them over to their pharmacies for safekeeping. “The hospitals must make efforts to make their chain of prescribing the drug, administering it, and then keep back empty vials to safeguard themselves from allegations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cp-hosp-pilferage-pushing-up-remdesivir-black-marketing/articleshow/82280711.cms||Soumitra Bose

Srikakulam district has witnessed a steep rise in Covid-19 cases, recording 900–1,200 positives every day for the last few days. The district administration has decided to impose a half-day lockdown in a bid to contain spread of the virus. District collector J Nivas said that nearly 30 per cent of all cases reported in Srikakulam district are from Srikakulam town. “Considering the increase in Covid-19 cases, we have asked traders and businessmen to operate commercial establishments till 2pm for two weeks from Tuesday,” Nivas said. The district administration has issued a mask mandate for farmers, traders and consumers and called upon the Muslim community to observe social distancing in mosques during Ramzan prayers. On Tuesday, commercial establishments shut down by 2pm.

---||Nagpur||A true visionary who stuck to his roots||NAGPUR: “In his death, we have lost a teacher, a father and a great mentor,” said students of Chintamani Mande after the celebrated professor said goodbye to the world of physics on Tuesday. An eminent scientist and a landmark researcher of physics, 96-year-old Mande succumbed to Covid-related complications at his residence in New Delhi. Born in Nagpur, he was educated in Uttar Pradesh and then went on to do his Master of Science (MSc) in physics from Banaras Hindu University. He further completed his DPhil from Allahabad university and Doctor of Science (DSc) from Paris. It was in 1967 when Mande came back to his hometown and joined the physics department of Nagpur University. Before this, he served in the Atomic Energy Commission of India for three years and also taught in Pune University. A true visionary, he carried out several educational reforms as the head of department. “Among various prestigious projects, one was special programme which aimed at training undergraduate teachers. He also initiated the Harvard Project Physics to inculcate the curriculum taught in Harvard University in India. This was way back in 1973,” recalled VB Sapre, retired professor and head of post-graduate physics department of Nagpur University, who did his PhD under Mande. Mande did pioneering work in X-ray spectroscopy which had always been his area of interest. “He was the country’s best scientist in this field. But he never forgot his roots. It was his efforts that brought immense glory to the physics department of Nagpur University in those years,” said Kamal Singh, retired professor and head of the department. Mande, who has received various prestigious awards including state government’s best teacher award, was the man behind the Indian Science Congress that was held in Nagpur in 1974. “The Raman Science Centre and Planetarium was an outcome of this meet,” said Sapre. The late teacher had brought alive the gurukul system which “existed as long as he worked.” “He would try to bring every facility here so that students didn’t feel the need to go out. A very-down-to-earth man, he always motivated others to succeed,” said Singh. Sapre remembers him as very friendly yet very strict at the same time. “His students were his extended family. He never held a grudge against any of us,” he said. After his retirement here, Mande got an offer to set up the physics department at Goa University where he worked for three years. In his last years, he was staying in New Delhi with his son Shekhar Mande, who is the present director general of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). “Since last few days, I was planning to write him an email. He would not talk on phone but would respond on mail. I wish I did. His demise is a big loss to our community,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/a-true-visionary-who-stuck-to-his-roots/articleshow/82280721.cms||Manka Behl

Yavatmal chief conservator of forest (CCF) SV Ramarao said, “As of now, there are no clues. On Wednesday, the superintendent of police Dilip Patil Bhujbal will himself visit the spot to know about the crime scene. We will soon zero in on the culprits.” Ramarao said there are three villages of the Kolam tribe and people are tight-lipped. “We will soon track the culprits,” he added. Pandharkawda DFO (wildlife) Subhash Puranik too didn’t have any answers on the progress of investigations. The four-year-old pregnant tigress was brutally choked to death and her two foreleg paws chopped using an axe. Though the incident came to light on Sunday morning, the killing took place 3-4 days before the incident was noticed. “Hence, there is no point in deploying dog squad. It is too late now. Forest officials are investigating. We are just helping them in gathering intelligence. As the crime is old, it will take time,” said Mukutban police inspector DS Sonune. The killing of the tigress has raised sharp criticism and hot debate over social media. On the second consecutive day, several reactions poured in from intellectuals, nature lovers, and conservationists. “The tigress’s suppressed screams are heard by ‘Mother Nature’ and will be addressed through the pandemics like Covid-19,” said Priya Patil. “They choked a pregnant tigress and people ask God why humans are choking to death,” said Anoopama Lohana, crusader for wild earth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tigress-killing-forest-officials-police-still-groping-in-the-dark/articleshow/82280730.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The parents of the child alleged that inordinate delay in hospital admission led to the death. According to the child’s father, I Veera Babu, a native of Chodipalli village in Atchutapuram mandal, the child developed a fever and cold four days ago. She was taken to a private hospital in Anakapalle where she tested negative for Covid-19 on a rapid antigen test. However, when the fever did not subside even after three days of treatment, doctors prescribed an RT-PCR test. Veera Babu took his daughter to another private hospital in Gajuwaka, where a CT scan confirmed Covid-19. But the hospital refused to treat the child. Then, Veera Babu approached KGH on Tuesday evening. “We waited at least an hour in the ambulance,” alleged a tearful Veera Babu. KGH authorities claimed that the baby reached the hospital in a critical condition in an ambulance at 3.40 pm. “The baby was shifted to triaging at around 4 pm and a general physician and paediatrician attended the baby. But the baby expired after resuscitation at about 5:10 pm due to viral pneumonia, i.e. Covid-19,” said a KGH official. The KGH superintendent issued a press release in the evening denying allegations of negligence.

Alert residents, who acted swiftly, ensured there were no casualties. NMC’s fire and emergency services department has estimated the loss at Rs1.45 crore. The reason for the fire was not yet known. On Monday, at around 11.25pm, NMC’s fire and emergency department received a call about the fire at the sawmill at Mahalgaon Kapsi behind Suruchi Masale, Bhandara Road, outside city limits. By the time NMC’s fire brigade reached the spot, the fire had already taken a devastating turn. Wooden logs stored in open and in a tin shed were engulfed in the fire, said chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake. Eight firefighting tenders from Lakadganj, Kalamna, Ganjipeth, Sakkardara, Cotton Market, Civil Lines and Trimurti Nagar fire stations reached the spot. A huge crowd gathered at the spot, which hindered the firefighting operations. Things normalized only after city police arrived and took control of the mob. The fire was brought under control within two hours under the supervision of station officers Mohan Guddhe and Tushar Barahate. Extinguishing the fire proved difficult for the firemen due to the combustible material, and narrow and ill-maintained roads in the area. Though the cause of the fire was not known, fire personnel suspect it was a short circuit. It is learnt that both sawmills, owned by Popatlal Nathuji Patel and Pradip Patel, were set up without permission on a private industrial layout under the jurisdiction of Nagpur Metro Region Development Authority. Two machines on Popatlal’s premises were gutted, while wooden logs stocked at both mills were reduced to ashes in the fire. Fire department officials told TOI that both sawmills had no fire fighting arrangement. Even the highly vulnerable sawmill industrial estate had no water reservoir for emergency use. It further exposed the casual approach of NMRDA towards fire fighting arrangements in industrial areas under its jurisdiction. NMRDA chairman Manojkumar Suryavanshi assured to look into the claims made by the fire department and said a team would visit the industrial area to verify the facts, whether they had obtained permission to set up sawmills or not. “Necessary action will be initiated if NMRDA finds any irregularities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rs1-45cr-worth-goods-reduced-to-ashes-in-fire-at-2-sawmills/articleshow/82287008.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Even though tens of private hospitals have been roped in for Covid-19 services in the last two–three days in the district, patient rush has not subsided at the hospitals. Some patients had to haplessly wait in the ambulances on oxygen support for admission. The rush was particularly evident at King George Hospital and Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS), which have a higher number of ICU and oxygen beds. Even the top private hospitals, which have been empanelled under Aarogyasri scheme for Covid-19 treatment, are filled to capacity. According to the official statistics, only four ICU and six oxygen beds were available at the VIMS as of 6pm Tuesday. The condition was much worse at the CSR Block at KGH as only one oxygen bed was available out of the 100 ICU and 340 oxygen beds. Meanwhile, a large number of people are flocking to the Covid-19 testing centres in the district in the last several days. A top private diagnostic centre located in Arilova of the city had to stop testing by afternoon, and put up a display board asking the patients to come for testing only tomorrow. The rush at testing centres is partly attributed to some individuals requiring Covid-19 negative status certificates to travel to other states in view of restrictions in other parts of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/patients-struggle-to-find-hospital-beds-in-vizag/articleshow/82279911.cms||---

This is the third straight election in which Mondal has been put under surveillance by the local magistrate. Similar action was taken in the 2016 assembly polls in West Bengal as well as the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The EC said based on serious complaints by various people and the report of the Birbhum district magistrate and SP, it was directing that Mondal should be kept under strict surveillance of executive magistrate and the Central armed police forces (CAPF) round the clock from 5 pm of April 27 to 7 pm April 30 “for ensuring free and fair elections”. It also ordered videography to be arranged with date/ time stamping. “The team constituted for this purpose should be comprised of CAPF personnel under a local magistrate,” EC said while asking the West Bengal chief electoral officer to ensure compliance and confirm the actions taken. The Trinamool leader reached the Bolpur party office on Tuesday afternoon, soon after the Election Commission order, and stayed put till 5pm holding meetings with party workers. “The people of Birbhum will give a befitting reply to this EC order, which is meant to harass me. This will not help the BJP. They cannot defeat Trinamool Congress by keeping me under vigil,” Mondal said, adding that he would supervise the polling process on Thursday even while under surveillance. Trinamool spokesman Kunal Ghosh said their party would win regardless of whether Mondal was kept under surveillance. “The EC has lost credibility and is functioning like a BJP tool,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ec-puts-tmc-neta-under-24-hr-watch/articleshow/82283649.cms||---

Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, Australia trade tourism and investment minister Dan Tehan and Japanese minister for economy Kajiyama Hiroshi have decided to initiate policy measures to remove the vulnerabilities in the supply chain by matching each other’s requirements through suppliers in their countries in addition to exploring possibilities of diversification, a joint statement said. “Possible policy measures may include: (i) supporting the enhanced utilization of digital technology; and (ii) supporting trade and investment diversification,” the joint statement said. The SCRI was started in September as several major powers across the world sought to reduce their reliance on China, where Covid-19 was first spotted. “Based on the information that will be shared, our officials should map the existing supply chains, identify the gaps and discuss possible options to make them more resilient,” Goyal said at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/eye-on-china-india-oz-and-japan-to-boost-supply-chain-resilience/articleshow/82283653.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: As cases soar, footfalls at vaccination centres double||PANAJI: Vaccination centres are seeing an improved response with around 8,000 people getting the shot daily. The shortage of vaccines in other states, and more recently the second wave hitting hard, is bringing in seniors who delayed taking the jab. “Two weeks ago we would wait for beneficiaries to show up. They would trickle in. The numbers started rising slowly after the shortage of vaccines in other states and has more than doubled now after the second wave,” a vaccinator told TOI. The urban health centre Margao has put up a pandal to accommodate the crowds coming in for vaccination. “It was a chaotic scene outside. We waited for around half-an-hour outside and once we got in it was more orderly. It was very slow inside and we had to wait for another half hour before getting the shot,” a senior citizen told TOI. The numbers began to rise when Goa started to see 600 new daily Covid infections and people began to feel that they wouldn’t get beds, a nodal officer for vaccination told TOI. “Although we are supposed to be vaccinating 45-plus now, most of the beneficiaries are old people. We ask them where they were all this time and they say they were frightened to take it earlier or had diabetes and thought they couldn’t take it,” the officer said. Others have delayed or are shying away from the vaccine for some reason or the other. State immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said there is a steady flow of beneficiaries at all centres. He said the government, which has 37 government vaccination centres and 25 private vaccination centres, is trying to increase the number of centres to cater to the 18-plus-year-olds. “We want to turn some schools and panchayats into vaccination sites. There are around 6.8 lakh people between 18 and 45 of whom more than 30,000 have been vaccinated as healthcare workers and frontline workers,” he said. People with Covid symptoms must not get vaccinated, Borkar said. “Vaccination is the only thing that can save us now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-cases-soar-footfalls-at-vax-centres-double/articleshow/82281720.cms||---

The minister said that he had been calling for restrictions on people’s movements in these areas. Rane said that stringent measures “are necessary without disrupting regular activities because the health system has been overloaded and as a result, we need to move fast”. On Monday, when the state recorded the highest-single day rise in Covid deaths, Rane had tweeted that Goa needs to have a lockdown on the lines of Maharashtra and Karnataka to reduce mortalities and infections. As soon as his tweet went viral, rumours were rife that the state was going into a lockdown, despite chief minister Pramod Sawant clarifying that no decision in that regard was taken. “I did not mean lockdown the whole state. I don’t want industries to close. We see 20 to 25 deaths a day and it is a matter of concern. Strict restrictions have to be imposed in super-spreader areas,” Rane told reporters. “I have been interacting with doctors. They told me it is sad to see people as young as 25 and 30 on High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) support,” the health minister said. He also retracted from his Monday statement that the state might lose 200-300 lives per day in the next 10 days, given the grim situation. He said his tweet was misconstrued. “I did not say that so many people will die every day, but over the next 15 to 20 days we will lose about 200 or more people if sick patients are not hospitalised in time. It is our responsibility that the situation is brought under control,” Rane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rane-backtracks-says-did-not-mean-statewide-lockdown-only-curbs-in-areas-with-soaring-cases/articleshow/82281718.cms||---

The 77 deaths pushed the cumulative toll to 14,043, while the case tally touched 11.13 lakh. Over the past 10 days, 1.26 lakh people were added to the state registry. However, a tweak in the state protocol has now allowed health officials to discharge patients even before 10 days of them testing positive. The new protocol now allows them to discharge people after 10 days of showing symptoms, if they have no symptoms for three continuous days. On Tuesday, 14,043 were discharged. “Last time, we said it has to be 10 days after the date of testing. But many people go for testing only on the third or fourth day of symptoms and by the time results arrive many are healthy,” said a senior official in the Covid control room. “In addition, many hospitals now discharge patients who don’t require oxygen or (don’t have) any other complaints that require intense monitoring. Though many of these patients are sent for home isolation, their names inadvertently get added into the discharged list.” Chennai, the worst affected district, reported 4,640 new cases and 27 deaths. Its neighbour Chengalpet reported 1,181 new cases. With 717 cases in Tiruvallur and 301 cases in Kancheepuram, the Chennai region reported 6,839 cases and 48 deaths. There were 47,961 active cases in the region. The other districts in the north together reported 1,617 cases and six deaths.

The state’s uptick in new infections, as well as mortalities, has been unstoppable so far, and the government has been slow in imposing restrictions even for the towns that are overflowing with cases, such as Margao, Porvorim, and Calangute, he said.

States like UP, Maharashtra, Bihar, Gujarat and Jharkhand have the largest balance availability of doses at present. The Centre has so far provided nearly 15.7 crore vaccine doses to states and UTs free of cost. Of this, the total consumption including wastages is 14.6 crore doses. Recent reports quoting some government officials from Maharashtra have pointed out that the state has exhausted vaccine doses, thereby adversely impacting the vaccination drive. “It is clarified that the total Covid vaccine doses received by Maharashtra as on April 27 (at 8am) are 1,58,62,470. Of this, the total consumption, including wastage (0.22%), was 1,49,39,410,” health ministry said. “Balance of 9,23,060 doses is still available with the state for administration of vaccine doses to the eligible population groups. Furthermore, 3,00,000 doses of Covid vaccines are in the pipeline for delivery in the next three days,” the ministry stated. Till Tuesday (8pm), a total of nearly 2.5 crore people were fully vaccinated with two doses of Covid shots. Over 10 crore people above 45 years of age have received the first dose of the vaccines, of these over 1.2 crore have received their second doses too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/over-1-crore-vaccine-doses-available-with-states-uts-says-centre/articleshow/82283679.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Government advertisement for doctor posts at GMC gets zero response||PANAJI: Goa Medical College (GMC) desperately needs added hands, especially doctors, but recent attempts of the government at hiring MBBS doctors have yielded zero results. No applications were received for the posts advertised by the directorate of health services (DHS) “Not one MBBS doctor responded to posts of medical officers advertised by the directorate of the health services recently. To throw open a super specialty block involves a lot of logistics. We need manpower and equipment,” said Rane at a press conference on Tuesday. Rane said it is tough to appoint doctors overnight. “You get nursing staff and others, but not doctors, still we are managing. The Ayush doctors will be reporting under the MBBS doctors,” the health minister said. The GMC is working on a war footing to open the 250 beds in the super-specialty block for Covid patients by the first week of May, to accommodate rising moderate and severe cases of the infection. GMC dean and in-charge of Covid hospitals in the state, Dr S M Bandekar said that they will divert the college’s teaching faculty to the new hospital if they are unable to post doctors from its existing pool. Half of GMC’s staff has been posted at the South Goa district hospital, which has nearly 400 beds. The government hasn’t received concrete help from IMA doctors as they expressed their inability to work full time, though about 100 doctors will be available for two to three hours a day to visit a Covid hospital in their respective jurisdiction or a taluka. The health minister, however, said that about 250 beds in private hospitals have been made available for Covid patients. The directorate of health services has rolled out a time-table for IMA Vasco to appoint some doctors from Vasco to serve at the MPT-Covid hospital for two to three hours a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-advt-for-doc-posts-at-gmc-gets-zero-response/articleshow/82281774.cms||---

Health minister Vishwajit Rane said that government-appointed officers are strictly monitoring the oxygen supply to hospitals, and that they have been trying to get the required supply from various sources. Out of the 393 Covid patients undergoing treatment in GMC, Bandekar said 232 were on oxygen beds, on Tuesday. He said there was no incidence of a patient dying in GMC due to lack of oxygen. The South Goa district hospital requires 20 trolleys per day whereas ESI and the sub-district hospital’s requirement is two trolleys per day.

---||Goa||No change in Goa University’s academic schedule for now||PANAJI: The Goa University on Monday held a meeting with principals of all general stream colleges in the state, where it was decided to not change the planned academic schedule for now in view of the dynamic Covid-19 situation in the state. “The directorate of higher education (DHE) has already issued a circular allowing all teaching and non-teaching staff of colleges to work from home. The DHE has also come up with an online system where all lectures and work carried out by a teacher are logged and recorded, so the required online teaching will continue. There will be no change in the academic schedule for now. A review will be carried out later,” GU registrar Radhika Nayak said. At the meeting, GU officials considered the possibility of an early vacation for general stream BA, BSc, BCom, BBA, BCA students, but as the DHE has already allowed colleges to be shut entirely with all staffers working from home, the proposal of an early vacation in the month of May became redundant. As of now, the exams for final year general stream students are scheduled to start in the first half of June. This exam will be followed by a vacation period, after which the new academic year 2021-22 will start from August 10. This schedule stands at present. GU officials had called for the meeting with college principals after an unprecedented spike of Covid-19 cases began in Goa and on April 22 the state government ordered that no students should be allowed inside educational institutions. The state government decision came based on advice of the state disaster management authority. However, the temporary closure of colleges has affected the practical exams scheduled to be held for final year general stream students in April and May. Similarly, the internal semester assessments (ISA) for final year students were to be conducted in physical format and some institutes had not held them yet. Decisions on these aspects will be taken now by Goa University after a review shortly. GU officials as well as college principals are keen that final year students should answer at least one of their four ISAs, practical examination, viva voce and final year examination in the physical format. This, the academics feel, will help ensure a fair assessment of the quality of graduating students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-change-in-gus-academic-schedule-for-now/articleshow/82281823.cms||---

Unlike last year, all except one of the gates will not be kept locked. “The market committee pointed out that there would be too many people crowding at the entrance if the gates are locked,” Panaji mayor, Rohit Monseratte said. For now, there will be no limit on the number of people allowed inside the premises at a time. “The inspectors will however gauge the situation and if the crowd is too much, the inspectors will regulate it,” he said. He added that the CCP staff will also be reduced by 50% to curtail the spread of the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/entry-to-panaji-market-complex-to-be-restricted/articleshow/82281834.cms||---

She was released on bail. “Noori Khan was spreading misinformation and preventing government employees from doing their duty at the oxygen plant,” CSP Vandana Chouhan said, adding that her protest delayed oxygen supply. Khan refuted the allegations and alleged that the action was ‘politically motivated’. “BJP is acting with a vengeance. I have been exposing flaws in the Covid fighting set-up that is leading to many deaths in the district... I wasn’t blocking movement of vehicles.

A senior official from the directorate of public health (DPH) told TOI that the stop corona portal run by the health department will reflect real-time bed availability data. “Initially, the data will be updated once every two to three hours. Later, it will reflect every admission and discharge. Data on bed availability in government hospitals will also be provided,” the official said. This comes at a time when Chennai alone is reporting more than 4,000 cases every day, leaving those with a severe infection scrambling for beds with no real-time information on availability. Social activist and convenor of Arappor Iyakkam Jayaram Venkatesan said patients should be able to get such data easily, adding that this is no rocket science. “At present, it is not a dashboard but just an excel file that is uploaded,” he said. Narayanan Hariharan, who has been helping patients with crowd-sourced information on Twitter, said the government seems to be short of manpower to update this data. “If they were to seek help from the public, many would volunteer. I’m aware of people who have reached out as well. Chennai saw similar efforts during the 2015 floods,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-covid-portal-to-soon-have-real-time-bed-availability-info/articleshow/82283717.cms||---

A bench of Justices U U Lalit and Hrishikesh Roy decided to examine the issue on a petition filed by an 81-year old man who lost his son, daughter-in-law and grandson in a railway accident 22 years ago. The petitioner approached the apex court challenging the Punjab and Haryana HC order which said he could claim compensation only for the death of his son and not for the loss of lives of his daughter-in-law and grandson. Advocate Rishi Malhotra, appearing for the petitioner, contended that the parents of the deceased child had also died in the accident and in their absence, it was the grandparents who took the place of the parents, and that the HC had erred in declining compensation. He said the tribunal’s order, granting compensation of Rs 4 lakh for the death of each family member, be restored. Malhotra said the HC passed the order without considering the crucial fact that the paternal grandparents of the deceased kid were implied dependants. He said the word ‘dependant’ used in the Railways Act be interpreted liberally to include grandparents also. Holding that the grandparents could not be said to be wholly dependent on the deceased grandson, the HC had said grandparents were not entitled to compensation. The HC had also said they could not claim compensation for death of their daughter-in-law on the ground that she was not an earning member of the family and there was no pecuniary loss. The bench stayed the HC order and issued notice to the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-to-study-couples-claim-for-damages-for-grandkids-death/articleshow/82283726.cms||---

Enough is enough. If you can’t, we will ask the central government officers to take over. We can’t let people die like this,” said the court. It directed the Delhi gover nment to infor m it about the number of deaths in city hospitals owing to shortage of oxygen. “The particulars of all such deaths, i.e. the name of the patient, the ward/ room in which they were admitted, the time of death and the reason of death should be indicated in a tabular form. The affidavit in this regard will be filed within four days. We have to also compensate all these persons who have died due to shortage of oxygen,” the court said. HC Fumes At Hoarding Of O2 , Asks Govt To Take Over Operation Of Private PlantThe bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli noted that in the prevailing crisis, all of us were required to show the “best human quality” and not “become vultures”. A city hospital had earlier stated that Delhi government had issued a circular on April 25 asking hospitals to attend to emergency patients within 10 minutes. This, it claimed, was posing a huge problem as the oxygen in emergency wasn’t accounted for and the hospital was overflowing with patients. Pictures with patients sharing a single bed were put up before the court. Taking note, the bench said that there seemed to be some disconnect. “You are just passing orders, instructions as if you are living in a completely different world. You don’t know what the ground reality is,” the court stated. It said circulars “that are meaningless and can lead to other legal complications for hospitals and nursing homes” should not be issued. “If there is a specific instance of any hospital or nursing home not performing its duties in these times, action may be called for, but issuance of such like general circulars, which in present times are not only difficult but practically impossible to comply with, and only create anxiety in the minds of those serving in hospitals, nursing homes, should be avoided,” it noted. On the issue of oxygen distribution among smaller hospitals and nursing homes, the court didn’t seem happy with the existing mechanism. “It is clear to us that GNCTD has to pull up its socks to address the distribution of not only liquid oxygen to larger hospitals but also the oxygen cylinders used by various smaller hospitals and nursing homes apart from individuals,” the bench said. It was observed that currently, after supplying tonnes and tonnes of liquid medical oxygen to these refillers and converters, there was no account of the quantity being subsequently supplied to hospitals and nursing homes. “They appear to be holding large stocks of liquid oxygen but not supplying the same to the hospitals, nursing homes and individuals. This is what is leading to, if we may say, an artificial shortage on the one hand, and black marketing on the other hand,” said the court. “The (reason for the) reluctance of the gas refillers in complying with the directives in providing the required information appears to be that they don’t want to maintain transparency.” It also directed that in case any re-filler didn’t provide the requisite data on Delhi government’s website cfwcst.delhi.gov.in, strict action would be taken against them “not only by GNCDT but this court” too. “The GNCTD should inform the court about the stocks of liquid and gaseous oxygen held by the refillers as at 10am tomorrow,” it added. When an oxygen distributor, Tarun Seth (owner of Seth Air), appeared before the court, it was learned that he alone was holding 20 MT of oxygen. The court expressed shock that this supplier wasn’t a part of Delhi government order that had the name of all oxygen distributors. The same supplier was stated to have been supplying oxygen to Maharaja Agrasen Hospital for seven years but hadn’t supplied the required quantity of 2 MT/day since April 22. When the court asked the supplier why it had stopped the supply, the distributor claimed he was asked by the hospital to give it to others. The court found this claim “completely and blatantly false”, noting that another hospital shared a similar story. "Without any accountability, they are having a field day. That is what is appearing to us," it said. When it was brought to the court’s attention that another hospital was facing an acute shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir, the court told the Delhi government: "This has fallen entirely on you. This is a mess which you are not being able to resolve… You have ample powers… We are going to come up with a workable order. Cylinders, it seems, are not being supplied, and sold in black market. You are running the government. You are in the chair." The court, therefore, directed the Delhi government to take over the supplying unit and run it with the employees present there. Keeping in mind the urgency of the matter, the court asked for immediate distribution of oxygen among the needy hospitals and issued a warning that it would "hang the distributor if even one life was lost". On the issue of hoarding of essential medicines , the court noted the suggestion of the creation of an online portal that would indicate the current position of medicines from manufacturers to retailers and from retailer to distributors. The Delhi government was, therefore, told: "The position should be updated on a realtime basis so that the aspect of availability is known to all, and transparency is maintained. This will, to a great extent, curb black marketing of essential drugs required for treatment of Covid-19. We also direct the GNCTD to call for records from all the pharmacies in the hospitals with regard to the supplies of Remdesivir and other essential drugs and the sales they have made and to conduct random audits and checks of the stocks of the pharmacies to catch black marketers." Appearing for Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra had earlier told the court that for the first time, Delhi had crossed the 400MT barrier. "We received 407.96MT yesterday. There was 58 MT was from Jamshedpur and then three to four tankers came from JSPL — this really gave impetus to the previous 300MT. We are expecting intervention and proactive approach of the Centre. The situation will not deteriorate," he said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, meanwhile, told the court: "The Delhi government has tried to procure tankers from Bangkok and requested the Centre for Indian Air Force planes. I had a word with the home minister and home secretary. We will provide. These aircraft used to bring empty tankers. Right now, these aircraft are being used continuously in the current situation. It would be subject to that priority and Delhi government should give us the bill of lading."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/set-your-house-in-order-we-cant-let-people-die-hc-tells-delhi-govt/articleshow/82283730.cms||Aamir Khan

The move came after several complaints against her. “She has been replaced by district tuberculosis officer Dr N P Singh as an additional charge,” said civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak. In the removal order, Singh said Bharti can be deputed or posted somewhere else on Covid duty by the civil surgeon as per his wish. This action has been taken on the basis of the investigation report of Chas SDM Shashi Prakash Singh. It is mentioned that Bharti was show-caused by Singh on Saturday and was asked to justify her stand within 24 hours. The show cause also asked her why an FIR should not be lodged against her and action not taken to cancel her medical license. Singh said, “Bharti was found ignorant towards Covid-19 patients. She was not coming to duty on time. In a joint inspection of civil surgeon-cum-chief medical officer A K Pathak and SDO it comes to light that Bharti was not seriously operating 30-bed Covid ward at the sadar hospital. Covid patients and their families are always complaining about negligence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bokaro-sadar-hosp-dy-superintendent-removed-over-negligence/articleshow/82280063.cms||---
---||Kolkata||AEFI or Covid? Several Kolkatans jabbed and confused||KOLKATA: Since vaccinations opened up for the above-45 age group, several Kolkatans have reported symptoms of something that can aptly be called ‘jab confusion’. And it’s happened because some of the outward signs of AEFI (adverse events following vaccination) are very similar to Covid-19’s. In a vast majority of cases, it’s AEFI, which mostly manifests itself through minor Covid-like symptoms. But there have been instances of patients getting infected post-vaccination. Either scenario could be problematic, say doctors. But most damaging could be mistaking actual Covid for AEFI, since that could mean a delay in starting Covid treatment, they say. Take the case of a 45-year-old who reported feeling feverish and experiencing body ache just hours after taking the first dose of a vaccine. She initially thought it was AEFI, but when the symptoms had not abated after three days, and an unvaccinated family member developed Covid symptoms, she was alarmed. “We consulted a doctor, who asked us to get tested,” she told TOI. “Both reports were Covid-positive. Luckily, none needed hospital admission.” In another instance, a 72-year-old resident of a high-rise off the Bypass developed fever three days after taking the second dose of the vaccine. He, too, tested positive later but luckily had only mild symptoms. Senior clinical trial specialist Santanu Tripathi, former head of clinical and experimental pharmacology at School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata, said it is quite possible that some of these people caught the virus from the vaccination booth itself. And he agreed that some AEFI and Covid symptoms overlap, “but there are ways of distinguishing between the two.” The key distinction is the timing of the symptoms. Health experts said most of the commonest AEFIs — such as fever, malaise and bodyache — should develop within 48 hours of taking the shot. If one starts feeling any AEFI bey-ond this time-frame, it should ring an alarm bell. “It could be the case that the person was already harbouring the virus at the time of taking the shot, but the symptoms were yet to show up, as it takes about five days for a person to manifest Covid symptoms. Therefore, it is extremely important to adhere to all Covid-19 protocol while at the vaccination centre and post -vaccination,” said Subhrojyoti Bhowmick, director, clinical research & academics, Peerless Hospitals. According to Tripathi, the common symptoms for Covid-19 infections are malaise (extreme weakness), bodyache, headache, loss of smell and taste, cough, tightness in the chest, shortness of breath, palpitations, fever (usually >100 °F), diarrhoea and abdominal pain. These symptoms persist usually for five days or more. “On the other hand, the common AEFIs are localised injection-site pain and tenderness. In the 24 hours after getting a shot, malaise, bodyache and headache may occur in some. A few may experience fatigue and drowsiness. Fever with chills may occur in a few,” said Tripathi. Doctors also said that it could take two to three weeks for the body to develop an immune response to the vaccine, during which they are equally susceptible to the infection. “Some may contract the disease while queuing up for the shot. Hence, if anyone feel any overlapping symptoms that linger after the vaccination, s/he should get tested,” said immunologist Dipyaman Ganguly, a scientist at the Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata. “We must remember that a vaccine shot does not offer instant protection,” Tripathi said. “Nor does a vaccine have an antiviral or anti-inflammatory effect. Therefore, if you contract an infection a day or two prior to after the vaccine shot, it is likely that you have Covid-19. This does not necessarily mean inefficacy of the vaccine. It also doesn’t indicate that the vaccine has caused or accelerated the infection or the disease. In fact, none of the currently available Covid vaccines carries a live virus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/aefi-or-cov-several-kolkatans-jabbed-and-confused/articleshow/82282038.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Election Commission bans victory rallies; Calcutta HC says ‘strictly enforce’||KOLKATA: The Election Commission on Tuesday told the Calcutta High Court that it was banning all rallies and gatherings across India on vote-counting and result declaration day. A maximum of two persons would be allowed to accompany winning candidates when they go to collect MLA certificates, the EC added. The Calcutta HC heard the EC submission and said mere “banning” was not enough; the EC directives should be treated like a high court order and “strictly enforced”. A division bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee will hear the case again on May 3. Poll results are slated to be declared after counting of votes on Sunday, May 2. Tuesday’s EC submission followed seven petitions in the Calcutta HC seeking directives to the poll panel and the central and state governments to enforce Covid safety protocols during electioneering. The Madras HC on Monday told the EC that it “should be put upon murder charges... for being the most irresponsible institution”. An EC directive to chief electoral officers of all poll-bound states, including Bengal, conveyed the “more stringent provisions” prompted by the Covid surge. They included “no victory procession after counting on May 2”. “Not more than two persons shall be allowed to accompany winning candidates or their authorised representatives to receive the (MLA) certificate,” it added. Medical experts have repeatedly expressed their concerns about the lack of Covid safety protocols during electioneering. A large section has said the protracted, eight-phase poll in Bengal may have been one of the contributors to the virus’s surge in Bengal. The EC, taking note of the concerns, took several steps on April 22. It banned all rallies and directed parties to have public meetings with not more than 500 participants and following all safety protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-bans-victory-rallies-hc-says-strictly-enforce/articleshow/82282050.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||Anubrata Mondal under ‘strict watch’ till 7am Friday, may move Calcutta HC||BOLPUR/KOLKATA: The Election Commission has put Trinamool Congress’ Birbhum district president Anubrata Mondal under the “strict surveillance” of an executive magistrate and the central forces for 62 hours from 5pm on Tuesday. Eleven assembly seats in Birbhum go to polls on April 29. The EC, in its directive, stated that the vigil on Mondal will continue till 7am on April 30. Chief electoral officer of Bengal Aariz Aftab has been told that there have been “serious complaints” against Mondal and the steps were based on the reports of the Birbhum DM and SP Nagendranath Tripathi. The latter was posted in the district on April 20 following his role in Nandigram. The order categorically said that Mondal be kept under “strict surveillance round the clock”. Unlike in 2019, his cellphone has not been taken away from him. Mondal called the EC order ‘routine’. “I knew this. The poll panel did it twice before,” he said, but chose not to reply directly on whether he would move court against the order. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on Saturday, during a meeting in Bolpur, expressed her apprehensions about such a move by the EC and urged Mondal to move Calcutta High Court, saying “house arrest” orders were illegal. Mondal said he was in “talks with the party” on the EC order. Party sources suggested he may move court on Wednesday. Earlier, the BJP had lodged a complaint against Mondal with the EC over his alleged comments against the central forces. Mondal’s reported remarks about “a dangerous game” also kicked up controversy. The Trinamool leader reached the Bolpur party office on Tuesday afternoon, soon after the EC order, and stayed put till 5pm holding meetings with party workers. “The people of Birbhum will give a fitting reply to this EC order, which is meant to harass me. This will not help the BJP. They cannot defeat Trinamool Congress by keeping me under vigil,” Mondal said, adding that he would supervise the polling process on Thursday even while under surveillance. Tuesday’s development came hours after the Trinamool leader did not respond to CBI summons in connection with a cattle smuggling case. Mondal cited ill health and the Covid situation to urge the CBI to reschedule his appearance at the agency’s Nizam Palace office. The CBI summons is the second notice served on him. The income tax department too has asked him to submit his documents at the earliest after claims that he had properties in his name in Purulia and Bankura. Mondal has already denied the claims and called it “a gimmick and witch-hunt”. State BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya was sarcastic over Mondal “skipping a CBI interrogation” on health grounds. It is good that the EC is keeping strict vigil on him; it will keep him safe in this pandemic, Bhattacharya said. Trinamool spokesman Kunal Ghosh said their party would win regardless of whether Mondal was kept under surveillance. “The EC has lost credibility and is functioning like a BJP tool with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah issuing orders,” Ghosh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/anubrata-under-strict-watch-till-7am-friday-may-move-hc/articleshow/82281410.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Devendra (38), a teacher by profession and a resident of Sector 4 in this industrial township, set out for Noida in his car about 1.30pm on Sunday after found out that his friend Ranjan Aggarwal, who works at with an IT firm in Delhi, was struggling with low oxygen levels. Doctors in Noida had told his family that they would have to arrange for oxygen themselves as they were facing an acute shortage. When Rajendra’s parents reached out to Devendra for help, he went to several oxygen plants and suppliers seeking in Bokaro, but they refused to give him oxygen unless he came with an empty cylinder. Devendra took help from one of his friend and approached the operator of Jharkhand Steel Oxygen Plant at Balidih Industrial Area, where the technician agreed to give him a full cylinder if he paid for the security deposit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bokaro-man-drives-to-noida-with-oxygen-for-friend/articleshow/82280074.cms||Divy Khare

The bench refused to believe the death figures being furnished by the state and sought to know the number of electric crematoriums in Hyderabad and in the state. It said that it was hearing a disturbing trend of dead bodies piling up in hospitals and burial grounds. Perturbed over distressing accounts emanating from hospitals and burial grounds along with the high positivity rate in Telangana’s districts, the court reviewed the supply situation of essentials like oxygen and drugs. It also directed the state to conduct an oxygen audit. Addressing advocate general BS Prasad, the bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said, “If the state’s intention in hiding death figures is to see that people do not panic, then it may no longer work. Tell them the grim reality. Then they will start taking precautions and adhere to the norms and this help flatten the curve.” The bench also noted the scant regard being shown to the mortal remains of those who succumb to the virus. It directed the state to keep a sufficient stock of body bags in all hospitals and use them while carrying the dead to crematoriums and burial grounds. “Family members are finding it difficult to get vehicles to carry the dead to the burial grounds because the uncovered bodies are an unwelcome phenomenon. Instead, cover them with body bags and accord the dignity the dead should get,” the bench said. Upset over reports of government drivers at the Gandhi mortuary fleecing devastated families by taking Rs 20,000 for shifting the body from the hospital to their home, the judges directed the state to curb the menace. Also, arrange a sufficient number of hearse vehicles at every hospital, the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-fudge-covid-death-numbers-hc-tells-telangana/articleshow/82283731.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Nagpur||After ordering inquiry against it, BJP netas start KT Nagar Covid hospital with fanfare||NAGPUR: Lying unused for 11 months following protests by citizens and largely BJP corporators, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) started a 120-bed Covid hospital at KT Nagar on Tuesday. All the 25 beds were occupied within two hours. The hospital will be run by the Shree Ramesh Fuke (Patil) Charitable Trust. BJP netas Nitin Gadkari (city MP and Union minister), Devendra Fadnavis (leader of opposition) and Dayashankar Tiwari (mayor) inaugurated the hospital. BJP MLC Parinay Fuke is the secretary of the trust while it is headed by Pravin Jain and Narendra Jichkar. Fuke told TOI that 75 more beds with oxygen supply will be set up in the next 10-15 days. “We are also planning to start ICU with 20 beds soon,” he said. The trust needs 100 more oxygen cylinders to admit patients on all beds. “The trust procured 60 jumbo oxygen cylinders and has appointed doctors and staff. Gadkari helped by providing 50 cylinders and NMC another 25,” said Fuke. In a press release, the NMC said mild patients with CT score below 8 and oxygen saturation level not less than 92 will be admitted for treatment at the hospital. On April 7, TOI had reported that NMC was not bringing the Covid hospital at KT Nagar and Pachpaoli women’s hospital to use even though there was a scramble for beds. After KT Nagar, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B is set sign the deal for a 110-bed Covid hospital with the help of NGO Asra Foundation at Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital next week. The construction of an oxygen tank is underway there. Using money from the state disaster management fund, the NMC in April last had proposed to start five Covid hospitals with 470 beds including in 50 ICU. Former municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, ex-chief medical officer Dr Yogendra Savai and additional chief medical officer Dr Praveen Gantawar had even set up all five in May and June. The hospital at KT Nagar got put off following protests by local residents. Then, few BJP corporators and one from Congress alleged that the hospital was constructed in an unauthorized manner as the hall was reserved for a market. The NMC general body ordered an inquiry on officials under the then standing committee chairman Vijay Zalke following demands from corporators including Tiwari. The inquiry committee in its report said officials had violated norms and action should be taken against them. The hospital plan then got abandoned. In another press release, the NMC said the administration has increased the number of beds from 1,514 in September last year to 7,144 now. “As on September 28, 2020, there were 1,144 beds with oxygen supply, 316 in ICU and 236 beds with ventilators. Beds were increased to 3,913 by December last year, 4,682 by March 31, 5,553 by April 12 and 6,387 by April 18,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-ordering-inquiry-against-it-bjp-netas-start-kt-nagar-covid-hosp-with-fanfare/articleshow/82281049.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Private hospitals say Remdesivir distribution using government machinery creating chaos||JAIPUR: Amid the growing demand and shortage of Remdesivir injection, doctors at Rajasthan University of Health Sciences (RUHS) have started using the vials judiciously. However, doctors at private hospitals alleged that distribution of the life-saving injection through bureaucrats was actually creating a mess. Many doctors are not recommending the injection to those having HRCT score below 8 and in cases where no further progression of the virus is seen. TOI on Tuesday spoke to various doctors at the government and private hospitals to know how they were prescribing the injection. “We are giving remdesivir to only those who HRCT score is above 8 and where the virus is progressing. For those having HRCT below 8 or around 5 to 7 are not been given because they don’t need it,” said Rajendra Kasana, a physician treating Covid patients at RUHS. Similarly, Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent of the RUHS, said suddenly there is a spurt of demand for the injection as patient’s attendants are actually behaving like doctors. “We know which patient needs it and who don’t. So, let us decide. We have to overcome this panic situation. Those whose HRCT score is above 10 urgently require it and are being given.” Meanwhile, private hospitals are angry since the state government took over the distribution of remdesivir and had given powers to bureaucrats to release it to private hospitals. “Let doctors treating Covid patients decide who need Remdesivir injection. In this distribution, those who actually need it are been deprived. I think it is high time when state government and health authorities should think and plan the distribution accordingly. Come and sit at our hospitals to see how patients and their attendants are suffering,” Dr Sanjeev Gupta, a senior physician who owns a private hospital in Jawahar Nagar, said. Covid treating doctors at CK Birla, Naryana, EHCS and Fortis said every morning they have to struggle to get remdesivir. “I know people using their influence are getting the injection for patients having HRCT score of 6 or below. And mind you this injection is not a magic. Only thing we need to check is the progression of virus in the body of the patient,” said a doctor of private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-private-hospitals-say-remdesivir-distribution-using-government-machinery-creating-chaos/articleshow/82283734.cms||Ashish Mehta

Nabin Chandra Dash, convener of SLBC, West Bengal, to all the regional heads of the banks, said that following a directive from the Indian Banks Association (IBA), branches will now perform minimum activities like cash deposit and withdrawals, clearing of cheques, government transactions, remittances etc. The branches will operate with 50% workforce. When contacted, Dash told TOI that SLBC has stipulated banking operations to some limited activities which are essential for the branches. In addition, if any branch can offer any other service, it is free to do that depending on staff strength. “We have not asked to stop any activity but listed some activities, which have to be performed, and the rest is on branches,” he added. SLBC had earlier appealed to the state government to restrict banking hours for the next two weeks following the surge of Covid 19. SLBC had written that the country is in midst of the second wave of Covid 19 pandemic and the spread of its infection is faster than the first wave. According to SLBC, many of the member banks have already been advised by their corporate office to take stock of situation regarding Covid 19 spread in their respective working zones. It pointed out that ensuring 50% workforce availability itself is a challenging task in the present situation given the large number of infected staff and family members. However, Dash added that SLBC is yet to get any nod in this regard. “We need notification from the state to reduce banking hours for some limited period,” he added. The former deputy chief secretary of SBI Staff Association, Ashok Mukherjee, complained that employees belonging to almost all branches of banks are becoming Covid-positive. “Expecting full-fledged services for full banking hours will be too daunting a task,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-to-offer-select-services-with-50-staff/articleshow/82281055.cms||---

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S R Bhat said, “We are inclined to allow Vedanta to operate the oxygen producing unit at its Tuticorin plant on a standalone basis. It will not create any equity in favour of Vedanta to run the copper smelting plant in future. This permission is given only for the purpose of ramping up oxygen production capacity in the country”. For the limited purpose of producing oxygen, the SC set up a big committee headed by the Tuticorin collector, which will include two environmentalists chosen by organisations representing victims of noxious discharge by the copper smelting plant, to monitor the operation. Appearing for Vedanta, senior advocate Harish Salve said the conditions imposed by the SC were acceptable and that the unit would be operational within 10 days and start producing around 200 tonnes of oxygen. The plant would buy electricity and give the gas free of cost to the Union government for distribution among states, he said. In due course, it would aim to produce 1,000 tonnes of oxygen, Salve said. Tamil Nadu had last week expressed its reservations on allowing Vedanta to reopen the plant, apprehending a repeat of the violence in the locality which witnessed violent protests in 2018 leading to police firing and death of 13 people. Senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan said keeping in view the national crisis, the state government called an all-party meeting and consulted the local population before agreeing to open th unit with the caveat that it would be monitored by the state apparatus with local representation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vedanta-gets-sc-nod-to-start-running-oxygen-plant-in-10-days/articleshow/82283738.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

On the other hand, the average occupancy in selffinancing colleges and deemed universities across the state is 50%. While some hospitals are reporting more than 90% occupancy, others said just 3% of their isolation beds are filled. Of the 4,534 beds in 22 private medical colleges listed on https://stopcorona.tn.gov.in, 2,356 were occupied as on Tuesday. Even in hotspots like Chennai and Coimbatore, patients flow wasn’t uniform in all hospitals. Some institutions like Bhaarath Medical College and Hospital in Chennai and Kovai Medical College and Hospital in Coimbatore reported more than 90% occupancy, at least five other hospitals report less than 40% occupancy. “These hospitals have beds, oxygen pipelines, doctor and nurses. While the state must create additional beds in trade centres and stadiums for future, these beds must be used immediately,” said former director of public health Dr K Kolandaisamy. “Some hospitals have state-ofthe-art infrastructure and teams to function as tertiary care centres, while many others should be used for secondary-level care. Most of these colleges don’t have patients in non-Covid wards. When the government has closed outpatient services and non emergency surgeries, these college should also do so.” In 2020, the Odisha government paid private institutions about ₹3,000 per bed and the model proved successful, he said. Senior government doctors believe the TN government should take over hostels in private medical college campuses for use as Covid Care Centres instead of using hostels in law or engineering colleges and training institutes. “The hostels in these colleges are on campus. Patients feel comfortable when doctors and a team of specialists are available on call,” said a senior postgraduate student posted at a Covid care centre. “At care centres in housing boards and college hostels, patients see how we rush some in an ambulance to higher centres of care for high flow oxygen or ventilators. If the care centre is in a medical college, patients can be moved to the hospital on campus quickly. Most students’ hostels are empty now,” he said. Director of medical education Dr R Narayanababu said the state was working with private medical colleges to help increase beds and oxygen capacity. “Two colleges have already agreed. We will be talking to others as well,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/finding-a-bed-turns-a-herculean-task-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/82283748.cms||---
---||Chennai||Finding a bed turns a herculean task in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: Government medical colleges are stretching themselves thin by converting most of their beds into Covid ones while cancelling all nonemergency consultations and surgeries. On the other hand, the average occupancy in selffinancing colleges and deemed universities across the state is 50%. While some hospitals are reporting more than 90% occupancy, others said just 3% of their isolation beds are filled. Of the 4,534 beds in 22 private medical colleges listed on https://stopcorona.tn.gov.in, 2,356 were occupied as on Tuesday. Even in hotspots like Chennai and Coimbatore, patients flow wasn’t uniform in all hospitals.

Day and night, he would watch as the karigars stitched designer gowns destined for the Hollywood red carpet, or ornate samples for runway shows in Milan and Paris. But when the coronavirus pandemic took hold, their work slammed to a halt, the backbone of the Indian garment supply chain quickly crumbling as millions of migrant labourers scattered across the country. More than a year later, many of those employed by the Indian fashion industry are struggling to adjust to a harsh new reality. “The factory is currently shut because there is no work — it’s a big zero now,” Sekh said, adding that some of the artisans were working instead as day labourers for Rs 200 to Rs 300 per day. One ended up in a biscuit factory, another in plastics and another in farming. Some were calling from their villages, pleading for loans, but the managers and supervisors themselves are in dire financial straits. For now, the factory gates remain locked. Mumbai, where labour is cheap and the quality of intricate handiwork high, has long been a linchpin in the global luxury supply chain. But in the pandemic, orders vanished overnight. Although some of Mumbai’s workshops have reopened, the volume of requests from high-end fashion brands is far from what it was. Prospects for many karigars remain bleak. “For months, all production and commerce flatlined across the spectrum of the Indian fashion sector, including at couture-level ateliers,” said Sunil Sethi, chairman of the Fashion Design Council of India. “It was a total catastrophe for our industry. With many Western markets still in lockdown, events such as big weddings, black-tie parties and fashion shows have dropped off the calendars of wealthy clients, many of whom are not in the mood to spend on pricey fashion and accessories. “Red-carpet dresses and cocktail outfit orders have largely disappeared, which has meant that financial pressure on specialist workshops has continued here,” said Max Modesti, founder of Les Ateliers 2M, a Mumbai embroidery firm that works with Chanel and Hermès. Those two luxury houses and Louis Vuitton were the only three that increased their Mumbai orders in the last year, Modesti said. Orders from other Western fashion houses were either reduced by around 50% to 70% or cancelled, he said. “In more than 35 years of business, and several recessions, I have never seen anything like it,” Modesti said. For years, part of the problem in Mumbai was that high demand for specialised handiwork led suppliers, which struggled to keep up, to sometimes sideline labour standards and recruit unregulated subcontractors. Some Western luxury groups, including LVMH and Kering, had begun to address those challenges before the pandemic with a safety compliance agreement known as the Utthan pact. But it was falling short on upholding basic labour rights like fair wages even before the lockdown occurred. Now, many karigars don’t have jobs at all. (An estimated 140 million people have lost their jobs since March last year, the Mumbai-based Center for Monitoring Indian Economy said.) With little work and no place to live or guarantee of a regular salary, many karigars have remained in their home villages rather than return to the city. According to Modesti, the costs of virus-related safety measures for many of the export houses and suppliers that had tried to reopen last year heightened risks of bankruptcy. The situation was potentially even worse for the Utthan suppliers, many of which had spent heavily in recent years on compliance requirements like sleep dormitories for workers and posted fire exits. “Before, there was growing talk about bettering worker rights,” Modesti said. “Now, for many, it is going to be more about survival.” He said he did not expect things to improve until 2022 and that “many of these businesses and their employees will not be able to hold out for that long.” (Kritika Sony contributed to reporting)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/karigars-behind-gowns-destined-for-hollywood-milan-or-paris-in-dire-distress/articleshow/82283746.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Civic bodies prepare for 1,000 cremations each day||NEW DELHI: With novel coronavirus deaths continuing to rise, the public health departments of the municipal corporations have been directed to increase Covid cremation capacity to tackle an inflow of 1,000 bodies a day. With many of the existing Covid-designated sites already having exhausted their capacity, a 70-pyre-capacity crematorium is being constructed on open ground next to Sarai Kale Khan electric crematorium barely a kilometre away from the Yamuna. A senior official said that they are witnessing a15% rise in funerals every day and capacities at the existing sites have already been expanded. Extra funerals at Loha Pul, Sarai Kale KhanWe will extend the funeral platforms along the Yamuna bank near Sarai Kale Khan if the trend continues. For the time being, 50 platforms area being created which will be increased later," official added. Meanwhile, the number of Covid-protocol funerals continues to remain higher than the number of deaths recorded in the daily health department bulletins. TOI had earlier reported how daily counts have a difference of 150-200 deaths on a daily basis. In the past one week of lockdown, 3,472 Covid-protocol funerals have taken place, with municipal records stating that 666 funerals took place on Monday, 585 on Saturday, 539 on Friday, 483 on Thursday, 432 on Wednesday, 410 on Tuesday and 357 the Monday before that. The number of deaths in the state bulletin during this period were 2,127. Covid-protocol funerals include both confirmed and suspected cases. While cremations continued till late night on Tuesday, the 28 Covid-designated funeral centres were about to approach around 700 funerals on Tuesday. A senior official said that 696 such funerals had already been recorded by 6pm. North corporation, which has 14 such centres, had received 307 bodies, SDMC received 318 bodies while EDMC centres received 71. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said new sites are continuously being added to the list and additional funerals will be carried out along the Yamuna near Loha Pul. The three municipal corporations have already been forced to make funeral pyre platforms in parks and parking lots along the main cremation centres. The main Covid-protocol burial centre at ITO Feroz Shah Kotla is also running out of space. A senior civic official said that the current Covid-reserved maximum cremation capacity stands at 882 bodies per day with 29 centres currently on the designated list. "At times we have faced situation in which pyres had to be created in the footpath way area between two pyres. More expansion of the list will be need in coming days," a funeral manager in EDMC said.

Beijing intensified its outreach to the region in the form of a meeting which foreign minister Wang Yi held with his counterparts from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The meeting saw China offering more vaccines to these countries. The Chinese embassy here said China would “encourage and guide Chinese companies to actively participate in facilitating various medical supplies for India.” “Suspension of certain commercial cargo flights is a normal business decision. Air and sea freight channels are unimpeded,” the embassy spokesperson said while mentioning media reports that a Chinese company had received an order for 18,000 oxygen concentrators.

Appearing for Kerala Union of Working Journalists, advocate Wills Mathew said Kappan was admitted to Mathura’s KM Hospital after testing positive for Covid and alleged that he was tied to the bed with chains. He requested a bench of CJI N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and A S Bopanna to immediately remove the chains to enable him to eat freely. Appearing for the UP government, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional advocate general Garima Prasad strongly refuted the charge of Kappan being chained to the bed and agreed to file medical reports of the journalist by Tuesday evening. The bench posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday. Mehta told the court that UP police had filed a chargesheet against eight accused, including Kappan, for their links with banned organisation PFI and visiting Hathras to spread unrest among the population. Mathew requested the court to allow Kappan to have a video call with his wife in Kerala.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Patients complain of hospitals turning them away citing no beds||CHENNAI: An 81-year-old man waited a whole day outside a private hospital in Chennai as paramedics administered oxygen and closely monitored his vital parameters in an ambulance that ferried him all the way from Vellore. The patient first reported to the emergency ward of a private hospital in Vellore with complaints of discomfort and uneasiness. The doctors asked the family to shift him after he tested Covid-positive on Sunday night. “They said they had no more isolation beds and that he cannot be taken to a normal ward. We were asked to vacate immediately. Every private hospital I called said they were full. We reached Chennai by 9.30am on Monday. My father spent the whole day in the ambulance. He was wheeled in at 6pm,” the patient’s son told TOI. Patients say the state website only has details on private hospital beds and even that is not updated periodically. Across TN, patients complained that getting admitted was increasingly difficult, particularly in the private sector as hospitals either don’t have adequate beds or ventilators for critically ill patients. In Chennai, nearly 84% of beds in the five government Covid hospitals were full, several private hospitals reported an occupancy rate of 100% or more. “We can’t add more beds because they don’t treat patients. We need doctors and nurses to care for patients. Most are already overworked,” said Dr S Suresh, who head VHS Hospitals in Chennai. Almost all 70 beds, 24 ICU beds and 11ventilators in the hospital were full. Several other hospitals reported more than 90% occupancy rate. On an average, a nurse takes care of 15 patients in a ward, about 8 patients who are on oxygen beds and four who are in the ICU at government hospitals. In addition, most of these wards have duty doctors and PG medical students. “We have closed OP wards, asked doctors to attend only emergency cases. Still our ward is among the busiest,” said director of medical education Dr R Narayanababu. “Yet, we don’t turn away patients who require hospitalisation.” When ESI Hospital in Coimbatore said all 680 beds were occupied, CMCH expanded its isolation ward from 865 beds to 1,045 beds. On Tuesday, 523 were occupied. Across the state, bed occupancy has increased in almost all private hospitals. In Trichy, a 70-year-old man was turned away by a private hospital. “He had an oxygen saturation level of 70. We took him to Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital, but it was too late,” said a family member. Hospital dean Dr K Vanitha said 530 of the 684 beds were occupied on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-patients-complain-of-hospitals-turning-them-away-citing-no-beds/articleshow/82283758.cms||---

In the morning, when the shahi snan ritual started, it was being estimated that the turnout would be around 3 lakh. Officials announced by evening that around 25,000 people had participated in the shahi snan till 5 pm. Times ViewEven 3 lakh or even 25,000 is too large a number of people congregating at the height of a deadly epidemic. With mounting deaths all around, especially in the past fortnight, the state government should have ensured that the last shahi snan was a symbolic event. Now one can only hope that this doesn’t turn out to be a superspreader event.Sanjay Gunjyal, IG (Kumbh), told TOI, “Seers of all the 13 akhadas reached Harki-Pauri in limited numbers. Around 25,000 pilgrims and seers participated in the last shahi snan. All Covid-19 protocols and other SOPs were strictly enforced.” The sanyasi akhadas—Niranjani and Anand — took the first dip, followed by Juna, Agni, Ahavan, Mahanirvani and Atal akhadas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/25000-turn-out-for-last-kumbh-shahi-snan/articleshow/82283769.cms||MS Nawaz
