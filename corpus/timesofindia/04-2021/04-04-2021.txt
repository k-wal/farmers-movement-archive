The ACB, in its statement, said tenders of housekeeping of J&K Bank were awarded to Mumbai-based SILA Solutions Pvt Ltd without adhering to the company’s tendering norms. The firm did not qualify to be awarded the tender. Investigations later revealed that he had allegedly caused a loss of over Rs 6 crore to the company “with his act”. A case in connection with the allegation was registered against Parvez and four others in October last year. On Saturday, an ACB team arrested Nengroo from his residence in Srinagar. Besides this case, the ACB said that chargesheets in connection with another case registered a year earlier have already been filed before the anti-corruption court against Nengroo. The case pertains to illegal appointments in J&K Bank which suffered a loss of more than Rs 250 crore on account of salary paid to these illegal employees over the period. Nengroo was removed from his post in 2019 for alleged large-scale irregularities in the bank when the Mehbooba Mufti government was in power in J&K.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/acb-arrests-former-jk-bank-chairman-in-tender-fraud-case/articleshow/81890766.cms||M Saleem Pandit

His family has alleged foul play and sought a probe into his death. The undertrial, Sunny Singh (30), a resident of Deoli village, was facing charges in three cases, including a murder case, registered against him at Bishnah police station between 2008 and 2010. “The undertrial died at Kot Bhalwal Central Jail on Friday night and later his body was shifted to a government medical college (GMC) for autopsy in the early hours of Saturday. He was found unconscious in his barrack and was attended to by the jail hospital staff,” a jail official said. According to hospital sources, the body of a male prisoner was brought to GMC from Kot Bhalwal by a jail pharmacist, and later shifted to the hospital mortuary for postmortem and other legal formalities. The deceased’s father, Prabu Singh, said he was informed about the death of his son by the local police station around 5 am. Seeking a probe into his son’s death, he said, “I met him in the prison a week ago and he was fine, but this morning we got a call from the police informing us about his death. It seems he was assaulted inside the prison as the body had bruises.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/undertrial-dies-in-jammu-jail-family-seeks-probe/articleshow/81890812.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Without naming Indian Secular Front’s Abbas Siddiqui, a firebrand cleric, she said at a rally in Hooghly’s Tarakeswar, “I appeal to my minority brothers and sisters with folded hands. That shaitan who is fighting with the BJP’s money... do not listen to him. He speaks a lot of communal stuff. He will try to create fissures between Hindus and Muslims. He is a BJP aide, a BJP comrade. He has taken money from the BJP to divide Muslim votes. Please do not let this happen. You will face the biggest danger if BJP comes to office”. “I appeal to my Hindu brothers and sisters: do not heed the BJP and do Hindu-Mussalman. The BJP is trying to divide Bengal. The days of the Bengal Partition are here again. They want to loot Bengal. They want to destroy Bengal, its language and culture. They will take your votes and flee and leave you among the ruins,” she said, asking them not to fall into the BJP trap “of dividing people on the basis of religion”. She then spoke about the “BJP’s religion”. “Their religion is different from ours. They are anti-women. They will keep misspelling Bengal as Bangal. Why? They will resist renaming Bengal as Bangla. They kept shouting slogans for Narendra Modi even during Netaji’s birth centenary celebrations. This is not what we have been taught since childhood, in schools. We were always taught to respect people,” she added. Banerjee compared the 2021 poll battle to Rabindranath Tagore’s struggle against the 1905 Bengal Partition. “Eta amader sanskriti noy, eta amader sabhyata noy (This is not Bengal’s culture),” she said. “Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had gone to a Muslim home to have tobacco. Nazrul in his songs and writings spoke against this (the Hindu-Muslim divide). There is a dargah inside the Ramakrishna Math. Tagore used rakhis to resist Bengal’s partition,” she added. “Did Amphan differentiate between Hindus and Muslims when it hit Bengal? Do you ask whether it is Hindu blood or Muslim blood when you are in an emergency?” Banerjee asked. Banerjee then focused on her experience in Nandigram: “Nandigram fought many battles together. They blew conch shells, gave aazan to build up resistance as mass murders took place. Hindu and Muslim suffered together, fought together. But, after this election, a young boy told me that he and his family, including his mom and sister, were evicted. They stayed in a Hindu village. Now, a Muslim family has given them refuge. Their fault: they are TMC supporters.” “How can you divide a village,” she asked voters at the Raidighi rally. “It is our culture to celebrate our festivals together. We go to each other’s home for tea. How can you divide a village,” Banerjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/dont-let-minority-votes-be-split-mamata-banerjee/articleshow/81891373.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Kolkata||City confectioners and home bakers whisk up delights for low-key Easter||It’s Easter today and city bakeries have stocked up on the usual delights like Easter eggs, hot cross buns, pastries or cakes. True, demand is a bit low because of the pandemic and the second wave, but that’s not dampening the Easter mood. Sales low, but bakeries hopefulGood Friday and Easter is a time when bakeries experiment with savouries and come up with several colourful and innovative goodies. But this time around, due to more reasons than one, business has been slow. Jagdish Chandra Haldar, the manager of Nahoum and Sons, one of the iconic bakeries in New Market, said, “Compared to last year, we are hoping to have better footfall this Easter, but business is not very impressive. I think several factors, like the second wave of the pandemic, the elections and also the scorching heat are stopping customers from stepping out. So we haven’t made anything special for Easter, apart from hot cross buns and some cakes.” On the other hand, Kookie Jar has stocked up on goodies like Easter ice cookies, pastries, Easter eggs, buns and pies keeping in mind the demand from their regular customers. “After the lockdown, things slowly started looking up since Christmas. So, we are expecting Easter sales to be better. Moreover, we have good footfall on weekends. We have also been getting several online orders for Easter goodies,” said Criag, a salesman at the Hindustan Park outlet. But Satyendra Kumar Mishra, co-owner of Cakes, revealed that their Easter business is down by 40%. “We were expecting sales to be low, but not by a margin like this. We haven’t seen such a situation in the past 30 years,” he said. Customer safety a priority nowThe lockdown had forced Saldanha Bakery, an 80-year-old family-run business in Taltala, to start a delivery service. Even on Easter, they are prepared to deliver their signature items like pure marzipan eggs, nougat easter eggs, Easter bunny and customised Easter baskets to their customers. “For many of our regular customers, Easter is incomplete without our stuff. So, we’ve been seeing steady footfall in the past few days. Every business was badly impacted last year but we bounced back by starting our own delivery service to ensure maximum hygiene. Sanitisers are placed at several spots inside our shop, we and the workers in our bakery wear masks while working and no customer is allowed to buy anything without a mask. We’ve also put up posters about the importance of wearing a mask to eradicate Covid-19,” said Alisha Alexander, a fourth-generation baker. Arindam Dutta, a salesperson from Krazy For Chocolates, said, “People are looking to buy quality products now. And cleanliness and hygiene are of utmost importance now. While last year, business was completely shut due to the nationwide lockdown during Easter, this year the situation is a bit better. We have been seeing a decent number of customers coming in and buying our chocolate Easter eggs, which are available in different sizes.” Home bakers take the cakeApart from customising birthday cakes or for any other special occasions like an anniversary, baby shower or bachelorette party, several home bakers have been getting orders for Easter goodies. Payel Bhattacharya, a home baker from Baguihati, said people are more confident in ordering cakes from home bakers since the pandemic started because they know the hygiene standards will be better taken care of. “I’ve been a home baker for three years now, but my business picked up massively since the lockdown. I had a few friends ordering Easter goodies till last year, but this time, the number of orders has doubled. From Easter eggs made with chocolate or candies, I’ve also got orders for cakes and decorated Easter eggs of various sizes.” While eggs are an integral part of this festival, some traditional Easter treats include brownies, cakes, rolls and breads. Nancy Shaw, another home baker from Barrackpore, said, “I’ve got a few orders for Easter this time and am preparing special items like brownies and cakes. Business has picked up in the past few months and I’m also receiving a lot of orders for birthday and anniversary cakes. Another reason for the growing popularity of home bakers is because we can customise orders for our clients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-confectioners-and-home-bakers-whisk-up-delights-for-low-key-easter/articleshow/81891437.cms||Srishti Dasgupta
---||India||India tests Chinese sensitivities on Taiwan||NEW DELHI: India tested China’s sensitivities on Taiwan on Saturday, when in a rare move the government expressed sympathy after a serious railway accident killed over 50 people on the island on Friday. In a tweet that was significant for its geopolitical signalling, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, “We are deeply saddened by the loss of so many lives in the railway accident in Taiwan. Our deepest condolences to the families. And our prayers for the early recovery of the injured.” We are deeply saddened by the loss of so many lives in the railway accident in Taiwan. Our deepest condolences to t… https://t.co/aNWIHGEFXx— Arindam Bagchi (@MEAIndia) 1617434941000In response, the Taiwanese foreign ministry and minister Joseph Wu tweeted back in gratitude: “Thank you @MEAIndia for the sincere message of concern & condolences. The government is working to ensure rescue & recovery efforts continue apace while making certain those affected receive all requisite support.” Thank you @MEAIndia for the expression of sentiment & support. This genuinely friendly gesture will touch the peopl… https://t.co/Gfk9TqFIBg— 外交部 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ROC (Taiwan) 🇹🇼 (@MOFA_Taiwan) 1617439519000The Indian tweet and the Taiwanese response is unlikely to go unnoticed on the mainland as the expression of sadness is another instance of India making it clear that resetting India-China ties is not possible if the borders remain unsettled. Wu tweeted, “This genuinely friendly gesture will touch the people, & bring Taiwan & India closer in a real & lasting manner. JW” A passenger train carrying almost 500 people crashed with a truck in a tunnel in Hualien in eastern Taiwan on Friday, killing 50 people and injuring many more. The MEA tweet is an innocuous expression of condolence, but its significance lies in the fact that India is, for probably the first time, pushing the envelope on Taiwan. Although India has said for some time that it expects China to respect a “one-India” policy if it wants reciprocity on “one-China” policy, India has refrained from testing the boundaries of this. The eastern Ladakh conflict between India and China starting in April 2020 changed all that. India’s extension of a diplomatic hand to Taiwan comes days after a sitting US ambassador visited Taiwan earlier this week for the first time in 40 years (since 1979). John Hennesey-Niland, US ambassador to Palau, became the first sitting envoy to travel to Taiwan in an official capacity since Washington cut formal ties with Taipei in favour of Beijing in 1979. He travelled with the president of Palau, Surangel Whipps Jr., to open a travel “bubble” between Palau and Taiwan. In his official remarks there, the US envoy reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening ties with Taiwan under the most recent US legislation. On Saturday too, Chinese anti-submarine aircraft entered Taiwan’s airspace and left only when Taiwan scrambled its jets. China has increased its intrusions on Taiwan’s airspace and ADIZ since 2020, mostly to signal dominance of the region. However, officials and analysts have also noted that China’s recent aggressive behaviour with regard to Taiwan has grown more belligerent and is almost pushing a confrontation. India too has stepped up its own diplomatic pressure on China, especially as the disengagement has stalled in eastern Ladakh after the first actions at Pangong Tso, where India disengaged from the Kailash range that it had dominated. But since then, there has been no further movement with China. On Friday, MEA spokesperson cautioned, “We hope that the Chinese side will work with us to ensure that disengagement in the remaining areas is completed at the earliest. This would allow both sides to consider de-escalation of forces in eastern Ladakh as that alone will lead to the restoration of peace and tranquility and provide conditions for progress of our bilateral relationship.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-tests-chinese-sensitivities-on-taiwan/articleshow/81891525.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||Goa||Fading sounds of musical diversity||As electronic instruments change the dynamics, traditional ones are paying a heavy priceGoa’s secular percussion instrument, the ghumot, has received a huge boost after the government declared it the state heritage instrument. While religious and cultural traditions of both communities, Hindu and Catholic, have ensured its survival amidst threats of a fade out, several other folk instruments have either become extinct or face the threat of disappearing from the cultural landscape due to various reasons.  Indigenous heritage instruments that were an integral part of the cultural kaleidoscope are being seen less as social change keeps chipping negatively at community traditions. State patronage to the ghumot — an earthen pot mounted with animal skin — promises to halt the decline due to the erosion of social commitment towards protecting ancestral legacy.  In this background, a few unique and once popular musical instruments used by Goa’s folk communities face the prospect of becoming part of history. Researchers say the ‘mhadallem’, ‘korno’, ‘banko’, ‘surpavo’ and ‘nakxer’ are among once prestigious and indigenous instruments that are in various stages of disappearance from the state’s religious and cultural scene. “All these instruments require effort and appropriate skill to be played. Nowadays, their use in cultural and religious functions is not a must. If there was some kind of compulsion, everybody would have practiced and their use would not have become optional,” says Pandurang Phaldesai, enthnomusicologist and former member secretary, Kala Academy, Panaji.  ‘Maddhalem’, a percussion instrument, is one of the few being used increasingly infrequently in local traditions. An earthen pot like the ‘ghumot’, but cylindrical like the ‘pakhawaz’, both its open ends are covered with animal skin, earlier monitor lizard, now goat skin. The instrument was used by the Christian Gawda community during ‘zagor’ and other singing and dancing events. A package (bond) of cooked and burnt rice is fixed to the centre of the instrument’s playing side to raise the requisite pitch and enhance sound quality. Sadly, traditions are fading among Christian Gawdas, though a slight resurgence in recent years spells some hope.  ‘Surpavo’ is a wind-blown instrument exclusively used by the dhangars. The community still uses it at gatherings and during festivals, but as change keeps knocking at traditions, uncertainty stares it in the face.  ‘Nakxer’, the type of instrument used by snake charmers, is also used only by the dhangar community. Similarly, and luckily, it is still being used by the shepherds during their annual Dussehra, Shigmo and Gajandra performances.  As the name suggests, ‘korno’ is about a metre-long, funnel-shaped wooden or metallic trumpet. It is also called an aerophone, being a wind-blown instrument, and was used during religious processions, ‘palki’, ‘romot’, ‘mell’ and ‘roth’. The blaring of the ‘korno’ conveyed messages of joy and sadness or alerted people in the neighbourhood like a bell.  Another wind-blown instrument, the ‘banko’ is used as an accompaniment to the ‘ghumot’ and ‘xamell’. The slightly curved instrument produces a lower decibel sound than the ‘korno’.  The passing away of a generation of musicians, who had contributed greatly towards sustaining musical traditions and lack of interest among millennials to take up the baton are among major factors for the present malaise. Most of the instruments that face oblivion are wind-driven ones as their sophisticated electronic counterparts have changed the entire dynamics of sounds. “It requires force to blow into these traditional instruments and the younger generation does not seem to have the deep chests to pump wind into them,” Phaldesai says.  Similar is the fate of some Western instruments — clarinet, trombone and saxophone. These were used by the local Catholic community, but the keyboard has rendered them superfluous.  “The local maestri at the church level would teach solfeggio to the boys and girls. Solfeggio helped them to play the violin and, in turn, they could pick up any other instrument as well. But now playing organ or such instruments is easier and we don’t see maestris teaching the rudiments to youngsters,” says Andrew Pereira, who is the Goa police band section in-charge.  Lovers of musical heritage say finding an activity to promote the use of these instruments can serve their conservation cause. During Phaldesai’s tenure, Kala Academy mooted a scheme to start ghumot aarti competitions, which was taken up at the Rajiv Gandhi Kala Mandir, Ponda, triggering a musical revolution. The number of aarti mandal groups has risen to 150, and young artistes to more than 1,200. Most of them can play the ghumot expertly.  “In this way, a model linked with an activity to promote use of the instrument can work wonders for its revival,” Phaldesai says.  Agreeing with him, Marius Fernandes, a cultural events organiser, says the instruments have to be brought into the mainstream by organising theme-based events. “We cannot wait for the government to do it, but people have to bring communities for events or festivals,” he says.  A ghumot with a goat’s skin was introduced at a world ghumot festival at Siridao by Fernandes on February 26, 2017. “Voluntary organisations can provide a new direction to traditional folk forms and contribute to music traditions, if they hold such events,” a heritage lover says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fading-sounds-of-musical-diversity/articleshow/81891626.cms||Paul Fernandes

At nearly 89,000, India’s daily cases on Friday were the highest in the world, ahead of the US (70,024) and Brazil (69,662). This was the first day since October last year when India’s cases were the highest in the world, as per the worldometers.info website. Even in terms of the seven-day rolling average of daily cases, a more reliable indicator of trends, India’s tally of nearly 69,000 was behind only Brazil’s count of 72,238 on Friday. With the tally rising to 73,201 on Saturday, India is expected to go past Brazil, especially since the south American country's graph has been declining over the past few days. The last time India’s seven-day average of daily cases was the highest in the world was on October 19 last year, before a massive surge in cases made the US the world's leading coronavirus hotspot. On Saturday, India recorded 93,077 fresh cases, as per TOI’s data collated from state governments. This was the highest single-day tally of cases since September 19, even as the second wave moved ever closer to the highest daily count ever recorded in the country — 98,795 on September 17 last year. Read AlsoDelhi: Over 80,000 get Covid-19 shots on SaturdayDelhi reported the highest single-day turnout for Covid vaccination on Saturday with 80797 people turning up at various vaccination centres at private and government facilities. The turnout further increased because 80797 people turned up only till 6 pm while the vaccination continued till 9 pm. TheDaily deaths too crossed 500 for the first time since December 4, with 514 fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours. The explosive rise of the pandemic continued in Maharashtra, which reported 49,447 fresh cases, its third new all-time peak in as many days. The state also recorded 277 fatalities, the highest since October 16 when the toll was 308. Mumbai, too, continued to break records with its highest-ever single-day surge of 9,108 cases. There were 27 deaths from the virus in the city, the highest since November 4. While Maharashtra was leading the national surge by a long distance, cases in the rest of the country were rising rapidly as well. The rest of India reported 43,630 new cases on Saturday, up from 41,161 on the previous day, when the tally had crossed 40,000 for the first time since November. Read AlsoConsistent causal link to vaccine in 6 of 13 serious Adverse event following immunization: GovtThe health ministry has said “consistent causal association” to vaccination has been found in six out of 13 serious adverse events following anti-Covid-19 shots though there is not enough evidence to show that the vaccine itself caused these events or even death in 10 of these cases.

---||Mumbai||Sachin Waze had a joint account with an accomplice: National Investigation Agency||MUMBAI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) told the special court on Saturday that suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Waze had a joint account and a locker with an accomplice at the Development Credit Bank (DCB), Versova. The NIA has alleged that Rs 26.5 lakh was in the account on March 8. However, incriminating material was removed from the locker on March 18—five days after Waze’s arrest on March 13, said additional solicitor general Anil Singh while seeking extension of Waze’s custody on Saturday. Special judge Prashant R Sitre sent Waze to NIA custody till April 7. Singh said Waze’s custody was required to ascertain at whose instance and why the account was operated after his arrest. He also said the investigating agency wanted to find out why articles were removed from the locker and where they were kept. Singh added several of his accounts and lockers were under the scanner, adding it needed to be ascertained what transactions had taken place and who was among the conspirators who had been paid. Waze, who has been in the NIA custody for 22 days, denied holding such an account. His advocate, senior counsel Aabad Ponda, urged the court to make available the document NIA was relying on to make submissions. “Is there a bank account opening form with my photo and signature?” Ponda asked. When the NIA told court the relevant document could not be shown as there were other details of investigations mentioned in it, Ponda responded, “He has no such joint account. If they have any letter to say he has a joint account, then it is only secondary, hearsay evidence.” He also questioned how Waze could be held responsible for someone operating the account while he was in NIA’s custody. Among other submissions made seeking Waze’s six-day custody, Singh said a diary was made available to the NIA on April 1 by a South Mumbai club, which has an amount mentioned in it. “A huge amount was received by him (Waze) and this was noted in the diary. Why would such a huge amount be given by a club owner or person running the club,” Singh submitted. The prosecution also submitted NIA had recovered a passport of an unknown person from Waze’s house. It said the probe agency needs to find the identity of the person, why their passport was in Waze’s house and if they were connected to the crimes.  The NIA also said that through the IPDR (Internet Protocol Detail Record) data, on March 4, Waze was seen moving suspiciously towards the place of offence. The prosecution said it had 120 TB data of CCTV footage recovered from various spots connected to Waze. Singh told the court that downloading all the data itself would take about 5-6 days, following which it would be analysed. “The footage will show where he had gone, how things were arranged...whom he met,” he added. Citing additional grounds, NIA said that through Waze’s disclosure statement, they had recovered several incriminating materials such as a laptop, DVR, CPU, printer and number plates from Mithi river. It said the articles were in a “destructive state” and it needed to ascertain their contents, the purpose they served and why they were destroyed. Ponda denied Waze had made a disclosure statement on March 28 and claimed this recovery was planted. “The recovery is based on their skill and volition and nothing to do with me, for the simple reason that the Mithi river is 17.84 km in length having a catchment area of 7,295 hectares and it is deep in the upper stretches and in the centre of 70 metres. There is no question of one finding these articles easily in the river. This is completely foisted on me,” Ponda submitted. The NIA also submitted incriminating documents were recovered from the house search of co-accused Vinayak Shinde. Shinde is a constable convicted for the fake encounter of Chhota Rajan aide Ram Lakhan Bhaiya in 2007. The prosecution said Waze needed to be confronted with these. The NIA further said that on April 2, they had seized a Mercedes. So far, seven vehicles have been seized and statements of 50 witnesses recorded. Ponda said the NIA had not cited any grounds justifying its custody for offences under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). He said after the period of 15 days, the NIA could only seek the remaining 15 days of custody under the Act.  Unlike other provisions of law, under UAPA, an investigating agency can seek a total of 30 days’ custody.  He also said the investigation at best seemed like one of a disproportionate assets case and not under terror-related offences under the UAPA. However, the NIA said both recovery of explosives from an SUV found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence on February 25 and Mansukh Hiran’s murder are connected. NIA suspects cop scaled police HQ wall, went to stationThe NIA suspects that Sachin Waze didn’t use the main gate of the Mumbai police headquarters but scaled a compound wall before heading to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus on March 4. It suspects Waze took a train to Thane, asked Mansukh Hiran to step out of his flat and then handed him over to killers, reports Ahmed Ali. The wall is near the social service branch, which is under renovation. To mislead investigators, Waze had also left behind his phone in his office at police headquarters. Sources said no images of Waze leaving the headquarters were captured on the CCTV at the headquarters.After reaching Thane, he called up Hiran and asked him to meet him at Ghodbunder Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nia-waze-had-a-joint-account-with-an-accomplice/articleshow/81891853.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||World||UK arrests over 100 in protests against policing bill||LONDON: British police said on Sunday that 107 people were arrested in London during demonstrations against government plans to increase police powers. Thousands marched in towns and cities across the country on Saturday to protest the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, defying coronavirus restrictions. Police said the ``Kill the Bill'' protests were mostly peaceful and most of those taking part observed social distancing. They said a small number of people were intent on causing disruptions, and that those arrested committed alleged offenses including violent disorder, assaulting police officers and breaches of coronavirus legislation. The force said 10 officers had been injured, though none of the injuries was believed to be serious. The proposed legislation would give police in England and Wales more powers to impose conditions on non-violent protests, including those deemed too noisy or a nuisance, with those convicted liable to fines or jail terms. A recent protest against the new police legislation in Bristol, southwest England, descended into widespread violence that saw police officers injured, a police station damaged and police vehicles torched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-arrests-over-100-in-protests-against-policing-bill/articleshow/81891887.cms||---
---||India||Consistent causal link to vaccine in 6 of 13 serious Adverse event following immunization: Govt||NEW DELHI: The health ministry has said “consistent causal association” to vaccination has been found in six out of 13 serious adverse events following anti-Covid-19 shots though there is not enough evidence to show that the vaccine itself caused these events or even death in 10 of these cases. The health ministry report follows detailed deliberation and assessment of the adverse events following Covid vaccination at multiple levels. In earlier statements, government experts had said there is no causal link but also pointed out that the number of adverse events, including deaths, were within the anticipated range. They also said deaths and other adverse events had to be considered in the light of 60 plus and 45-60 with co-morbidities age brackets having health conditions. While around 79 deaths were reported till mid March of individuals who received the Covid vaccine, 13 serious adverse events have been assessed by different committees at district, state and national levels. A special committee on adverse events following immunisation has also deliberated and assessed the reports. The other cases are at different levels of the three-stage evaluation process. According to two separate assessment reports (one with eight cases of adverse events and another with five) — released by the immunisation department of the health ministry — in six cases “consistent causal association” to vaccination has been found, whereas in another six cases “inconsistent causal association to vaccination (coincidental)” were found. One case was found “unclassifiable”. “None have been found to be due to the vaccine,” says the latest causality assessment results released by the immunisation division. The “consistent causal association” to vaccination indicates a possibility of a causal link as the adverse event happened soon after receiving the jab in three cases. Officials reiterated that the Covid vaccines are safe and concerns about adverse events following immunisation are unfounded and negligible. “India has a robust system for surveillance and management of adverse events. Even anxiety or hysteria after vaccination are recorded as AEFI and still if you look at the number of AEFIs, they are insignificant,” a senior official said. Of the total vaccinations, only 0.027% of AEFIs have been reported so far. Of the eight deaths analysed recently, two each were reported from Maharashtra and Karnataka, and one each from UP, Bihar, Telangana, and MP. The age group of the deceased was between 36 and 61 years; three of them were women. Of the total 10 deaths assessed by the committee, three deaths were placed in B1 category, which indicates “temporal relationship is consistent but there is insufficient definitive evidence for vaccine causing event”, while six are in coincidental category described as “underlying or emerging condition(s), or conditions caused by exposure to something other than the vaccine”. While in one of the three B1 cases where a 61-year old patient died of a cardiac arrest 11 days after vaccination, it was found that he was a known case of hypertension on medication. However, a 38-year old patient without any cardiac risk factors died. He was infected two months back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/consistent-causal-link-to-vaccine-in-6-of-13-serious-adverse-event-following-immunization-govt/articleshow/81891889.cms||Sushmi Dey

Property market sources said the bungalow, Madhu Kunj, is located on prime 1.5-acre land with a built-up area of more than 60,000 square feet in tony Malabar Hill. “The ground-plus-one storey bungalow is built in the Art Deco style and could be at least 90 years old. It has heritage features,” said a local resident. It has an open terrace and a large compound. Damani paid stamp duty of Rs 30 crore for the property, which was purchased last month, according to real estate market sources. It is not known if the new owner plans to redevelop the property and build a tower like many plot buyers have done in the past in this area. TOI has learnt the property belonged to the Premchand Roychand family of Mumbai. “It is one of the old established mercantile families of the city, whose ancestors built the Venetian Gothic Rajabai Clock Tower at Fort in the mid-19thcentury,” said a person who knows the family. The bungalow is situated at the corner of Narayan Dabholkar Road, one of the most exclusive and expensive residential enclaves in south Mumbai, where apartments command a price of Rs 70,000 to Rs 80,000 and more per square foot depending on the building. The VIP neighbourhood also has several bungalows such as Shivgiri, Ramtek and Meghdoot. A property market source, not wishing to be identified, said of Damani: “He is one of India’s smartest investor minds and has been investing big time into real estate. Just recently, he purchased an eight-acre plot in Thane for Rs 250 crore.’’ The source said why Damani might have paid such a jaw-dropping price, especially when land rates in Malabar Hill are around Rs 400 crore per acre: “There is some element of capital gains planning since he has made a lot of gain in equity, which can be reinvested tax-free into one residential house. He is bullish on land appreciation in future years.” Gulam Zia, ED, Knight Frank India, said, “The trend of picking up prized properties for an exclusive residential address in South Mumbai by the Indian ultra-high net worth individuals is prevailing for a long time. The Ambani’s, the Piramal’s, the Singhania’s have all in recent times added to the skyline of Mumbai. This seems to be one more such addition.” In 2015, the Poonawallas, Cyrus and son Adar of Serum Institute of India, bid Rs 750 crore for Lincoln House, the former US consulate property at Breach Candy in south Mumbai. They were unable to take possession of the property, though, after the defence estates department stalled the deal. In 2014, the Godrej family bought Homi Bhabha’s iconic bungalow, Meherangir, at Malabar Hill for Rs 372 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/damanis-of-dmart-snap-up-mumbai-bungalow-for-record-1001-crore/articleshow/81892169.cms||---

Narrating the sequence of events on November 2020, inspector, STF, Satyaprakash, who nabbed Irfan, said: “On the fateful day, Irfan and Osama reached a mosque in Rabodi area of Thane. As soon as Jameel stepped out of the mosque and started his motorcycle, Osama and Irfan followed him. After coming close to Jameel’s vehicle, Irfan, who was riding the pillion, shot him.” “With the help of CCTV footage, Thane police identified the motorcycle used in the crime and arrested its owner Shahid. After committing the murder, Irfan stayed in Gorakhpur, other parts of UP and also in Nepal.

To prevent the situation from worsening, the CM’s helicopter landed at an alternative location. There were injured people on both sides, including an elderly farmer and a police officer. Police were yet to register an FIR in connection with the violence. Before the clash, farmers — who have been protesting against BJP-JJP coalition politicians in the state over the Centre’s three farm laws — had gathered outside the campus of Baba Mastnath University on learning that Khattar was coming to the town to attend a prayer meeting in the memory of the deceased father of Rohtak MP Arvind Sharma. His helicopter was scheduled to land at the university. Police had set up a three-layer security cordon around the university campus to thwart any law and order problem, but farmers tried to break the barricades and a clash followed in which the farmers pelted stones and the police retaliated with a lathicharge. Earlier, Rohtak SP Rahul Kumar and ADGP Sandeep Khirwar attempted to pacify the protesters. SP Sharma claimed that police did not use any force. He accused some among the protesters of pelting stones and injuring police officers and protesters both. Congress politician and former MLA Krishan Moorti Hooda condemned the incident, describing it as an outcome of government and police action on farmers. “The government itself is provoking farmers,” said Hooda.

They were slapped with sedition charges along with the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The chargesheet has been accepted and the court has fixed May 1 as the next date of hearing. Five of the eight members charged by the STF were presented before the Mathura court. They included journalist Siddique Kappan, Masood Ahmad, Atiq-ur-Rahman, Mohammad Alam and Rauf Sharif, while two of them — Anshad Badruddin and Firoz Khan — attended the court proceedings via video link from Lucknow jail. The eighth accused, Danish, is yet to be arrested. In the 5,000-page chargesheet, the PFI members have been accused of receiving funds to the tune of Rs 80 lakh from financial institutions in Muscat and Doha for the purpose. Defence lawyer Madhuvan Datt Chaturvedi told TOI that after completing their investigation within 180 days, the STF filed its charge sheet with the list of more than 50 witnesses in the court of additional district and sessions judge (first) Anil Kumar Pandey on Saturday. “Danish has been issued summons for the next hearing,” the lawyer said. “The accused have dismissed the charges as vague, groundless and initiated for promoting ideological agenda of state government,” the lawyer said, adding that the accused had verbally complained to the court that the authorities were “misbehaving with them inside the jail and had not provided them food for the past 24 hours”. They also alleged that they were being treated shabbily by other prisoners. The lawyer said that, according to them, they had their last meal around 5 pm on Friday and since then they had not eaten anything despite their medical condition which is said to be “critical”. One of them, Kappan, is a diabetic while Atiq-ur-Rehman is suffering from aortic regurgitation. Meanwhile, an STF officer said, “All the above named PFI members have been booked under the charges of sedition, wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot, injuring or defiling place of worship to insult the religion of any group and under the Information Technology Act, along with charges of punishment for raising funds for terrorist act and the UAPA.” The chargesheet stated that materials collected from cellphones and laptops of the accused corroborate that they were trying to spread disharmony in the state by raking up crime incidents such as the one in Hathras. Documents were collected during searches at the office of PFI in Delhi and evidence was found, the STF said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/5000-page-chargesheet-filed-in-hathras-case-against-8-pfi-men/articleshow/81892220.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

State officials have filed a complaint, mentioning these instances of abuse of power and authority, to the chief electoral officer (CEO) and demanded immediate action against the election observer for Devikulam and Udumbanchola constituencies. A copy of the complaint letter to the chief electoral officerThe complaint filed against IRS Naresh Kumar Bansal, accessed by TOI, states that they are facing extreme mental torture from the expenditure observer and cannot work him. In the complaint, the officials stated, “The expenditure observer often treats the election officials like his orderlies. There are several incidents where he ordered officials to get his shoes polished, buy him personal gifts, etc. He even ordered a high-ranking official in Devikulam RDO office to buy him a gel pen in the middle of a meeting.” “Since taking charge, the expenditure observer has been very arrogant and is getting favours done for him and his family at our expense. We were forced to buy him things, from costly spices to tender coconut, out of our pockets. We feel ashamed to say that the expenditure observer hasn’t paid, even once, for his and his family’s food expenses,” the complaint stated. “Last Saturday, the expenditure observer forcefully took the video surveillance team’s vehicle for a trip to Madurai with his family. The video surveillance team covered their duty on foot. The observer remained indifferent to their plight,” the complaint added. “The observer’s lodging was arranged at the government guest house in Munnar. But he demanded luxury accommodation at Tea County, a four-star hotel in Munnar. There was delay at the administrative level in meeting this demand and so he harassed all officials deployed under him,” it said. Bansal resorts to threats and abuse to get his demands met, the complaint stated. “‘Incompetent’, ‘senseless’, ‘useless’ are the terms used by the observer to address election officials. He threatens officials saying that he would write to the DEO and get them suspended. Once a high-ranking official leading a surveillance team was almost manhandled by the observer,” the complaint said. Bansal badmouths the ruling and opposition parties and favours a particular political party, the complaint said. “This has caused serious discomfort among the officers to do their job in an impartial manner. The most unbearable part is that the observer keeps insulting the language and culture of the state,” it said. A senior revenue official said that the observer is not supposed to interfere in unrelated issues. “Revenue officials are receiving threats to get the complaint withdrawn, but we won’t do so,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/get-my-shoes-shined-observer-tells-poll-officials/articleshow/81894285.cms||Sandeep Thomas

---||---||LDF, BJP share ideology of hatred: Rahul||KOZHIKODE: Rahul Gandhi on Saturday painted BJP and LDF with the same brush, saying PM Narendra Modi does not have any problem with the Left as their ideologies were both founded on "hatred and anger". Campaigning at Purameri in Kerala's Kozhikode with UDF-backed candidate K K Rema, the wife of slain RMP functionary T P Chandrasekharan, by his side, Congress's Wayanad MP said it was about time people realised why Modi "always says Congress-mukt Bharat and never Left Front-mukt Kerala". He accused the Left of not even sparing someone within the family. "I want to ask the Left Front why they took away her (Rema's) husband. What did they get by giving her pain? What did they get by taking a father away from his son? She was, after all, from their family. Imagine what they do to their own family." At a rally in Koyilandy in the same district earlier in the day, Rahul attacked the LDF government on the deep-sea fishing deal. He said the Pinarayi Vijayan government tried to stab fisherfolk in the back by secretly entering into a deal with a US firm. "There is a difference between someone who stabs you from the front and someone who stabs you from behind. While you were going out to sea, the LDF government entered into a deal with those who are trying to destroy your livelihood," he said. On CPM and BJP being allegedly two sides of the same coin, Rahul said RSS understood that the real threat to the saffron camp was from those whose objective was to unite everybody. "They understand very well that just like them, the Left Front is also a divider of society. It is also an ideology of anger and violence," he said. Rahul said UDF’s election promise of NYAY would solve the problems of unemployment and economic distress. He said in time, Kerala could give direction to the rest of India. "Your spirit of brotherhood, your history, your tradition, your respect towards women, these are things that can give direction to India," he said. Rahul also addressed campaign meetings at Peravoor, Alakode and Kannur harbour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/ldf-bjp-share-ideology-of-hatred-rahul/articleshow/81892377.cms||---

Industry insiders say that it’s the first time ever that helicopters have been in high demand for assembly poll campaign in states like West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Assam. In states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat, political parties use helicopters like cars, even duirng assembly election campaigns, said an aircraft charter industry veteran. But the scene was different in other states. “Traditionally, politicians in the south stuck to roadshows and used the media for canvassing. But in the current elections, almost 10-12 helicopters are being used, which is somewhat of a record. West Bengal and Assam being the larger states and also experiencing intense competition, with an estimated 20-plus helicopters being used in these two states,’’ said Capt Uday Gelli, western region president, Rotary Wing Society of India. He added that this time around, even small-time politicians have hired helicopters for canvassing votes. “Unlike in the past wherein parliamentary elections attracted the maximum usage of helicopters in these states, now even assembly elections are witnessing largescale usage of helicopters here,” Capt Gelli said. Mandar Bharde, managing director of charter company MAB Aviation Pvt Ltd said: “About 90% of the two dozen-odd on-shore twin-engine helicopters in India are currently engaged in election campaigning. Political parties are now trying to pull a couple of helicopters engaged in off-shore flying to oil rigs as well to fill the 25% shortage in supply.” However, single-engine helicopters are in moderate demand because an aviation circular issued a few years ago made twin engines mandatory even for state cabinet ministers, he added. Capt Gelli said: ``Earlier, other than Jayalalitha, no one hired a chopper in Tamil Nadu. Now everyone— from Stalin, Kamal Hasan and local parties like TMC, DMK, AIADMK, AIUDF etc — have hired helicopters to move their leaders within the state.” While Jayalalithaa had hired a Bell 412 for her last election — she preferred it as the state too owned one and she was familiar with it, the current favourite among the top brass apparently is the AugustaWestland 139 for its quiet cabin, leg room, speed. “It’s priced at Rs 4-5 lakh an hour as compared to Rs 2.5 lakh/hour for an entry-level twin engine,’’ said Bharde. Apart from cutting travel time, another reason to hire helicopters is because they are crowd pullers in mofussil areas of Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam. “Helicopters never fly to many of these remote places other than during elections. People flock to see them, many crowd around to touch the helicopter and even meet the pilots,” said Capt Gelli. But Kerala has continued to play its role of the traditional outlier with zero demand for helicopters. “A former Kerala chief minister once told me that the surest way to lose an election is to land in a helicopter in Kerala to seek votes,” said Bharde. “People don’t take kindly to candidates flying around in helicopters. Only the Delhi top brass like the prime minister, home minister and the Gandhis are allowed to get away with charter aircraft. Kerala chief ministers too have stayed off helicopters and it continues to be so,” he said. Then there are states like Assam that pose logistics challenges with its terrain and early sunrise/sunset, and so have a high demand for helicopters. Ajay Vir Singh, managing director, AirKing Charters Pvt Ltd, said: “About 12-15 helicopters are parked in Assam for election campaigning as against 8-10 last time. In 2005, when I had ventured into this field, the demand for helicopters during elections wasn’t that extensive. But now, helicopters have become an essential weapon to fight an election.” Capt Gelli said: “Considering that 2020 was a very bad year for aviation, these elections have come as a lifeline for some helicopters companies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/polls-help-chopper-charters-fly-out-of-covid-mire/articleshow/81892401.cms||Manju V

He mentioned the party’s ideology and the work done by their leader and CM Nitish Kumar for the welfare of all the sections of people. He said efforts should be made to ensure that the benefits of the schemes reached the targeted beneficiaries. Singh was addressing the JD(U)’s block presidents on the first day of the two-day training session at the party’s state headquarters here. He also asked the block presidents to constitute committees comprising dedicated workers, who will be engaged in the expansion and strengthening of the party’s support among people. Singh said only positive thinking will help and assist those who hold posts in the party in making the organization strong. He asked the office-bearers to share their power with others by delegating work. He said it certainly makes one proud to know that not a single office-bearer or the party worker goes to a government office to get any wrong work done. In the same vein, he said the identity and personality that they build themselves will also become the identity of the party. Earlier, the speakers enlightened the block presidents with various aspects of organizational work and thinking. The themes they discussed included behavioural socialism, motivational guidelines, working style, leadership development, social media, culture and socialism, time management and effective working style, leadership success and non-violent communication. The speakers included MLCs Ramvachan Rai, Lalan Sarraf and Sanjay Gandhi, party functionaries Amardeep, Navin Kumar Arya, Manish Bariyar, R R Kalyan and Gandhian Atul Priyadarshi.

---||Patna||Bihar: Asymptomatic people should go for home isolation, say experts||PATNA: Home isolations are back. With a fresh surge in Covid-19 cases in the state, hospitals are witnessing a spike in the number of patients. But Covid positive patients who are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms are being advised to stay in home isolation. Ever since the onset of the pandemic in March last year, several guidelines have been issued to be followed for home isolation. For instance, the district administration is authorised to permit people to opt for home isolation with the condition that there is enough space and facilities for self-isolation. Covid positive people opting for home isolation are required to complete 14 days from the day of collection of swabs. According to the Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician Dr Arun Shah, home isolation is the best way to recover from Covid-19, if the person is asymptomatic or has mild symptoms. "The patient must inform about his daily status to the doctor or health authorities to avoid severe consequences and hospitalization. For better immunity, infected people must take vitamin and zinc supplements and should check their oxygen level very often," Dr Shah said. He added, "Hospitalization could be traumatising for Covid patients and might affect their mental health." A few Covid survivors shared their home isolation experience. Homemaker Tripti Prakash (48) from Gardanibagh told this newspaper, "I got infected with the virus this year and my doctor suggested home quarantine as I had mild to moderate symptoms. I used to receive calls from the health department. I used to take vitamin supplements to boost my immunity. However, it's mentally exhausting to separate oneself for 14 days from the rest of the family." Prem Shankar, (55), a government official, said, "I had no symptoms but I was tested positive for Covid. As I was in touch with my doctor and followed all prescribed guidelines for home quarantine, I recovered in two weeks." Several Covid survivors also shared the experience of being boycotted in their neighbourhood. "I faced a social boycott in my colony as I tested positive for Covid, which affected my mental peace and I used to feel left out. But after 14 days of home quarantine and self-care, I tested negative and met my family members," said Himanshu, (32), a school teacher from Boring Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/asymptomatic-people-should-go-for-home-isolation-say-experts/articleshow/81890385.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Do not demolish Khuda Bakhsh library, INTACH appeals to Nitish Kumar||PATNA: Members of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) appealed to chief minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday to intervene and protect a portion of the heritage Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library from demolition to make way for a flyover. The front garden and a portion of the Curzon library will have to be demolished to construct an elevated road from Kargil Chowk to NIT Patna proposed by the Bihar Pul Nirman Nigam Limited. “We have to protect this library and if need be we will knock at the door of the court,” INTACH, Patna chapter convenor JK Lal said, adding, they will be writing a letter to the CM requesting him to protect the library and will also go for a public campaign. The state chapter of INTACH held a meeting at the library on Saturday with director Shaista Bedar. State convenor Prem Sharan and member BC Shrivastava were also at the meeting. “The Khuda Bakhsh Library, a 'Dharohar of Bhartiya Sanskriti' has been visited by eminent people such as Mahatma Gandhi, Lord Curzon, scientist CV Raman, Jawahar Lal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, APJ Abdul Kalam and over dozens of Presidents of India, chief justices, foreign heads of states, ambassadors, scholars and litterateurs,” read a statement shared by the INTACH, adding because of such visits, adequate security arrangements are required and constraining the library will hamper. Talking to TOI over the phone, Bedar said they had written to the DM last month requesting him to look for an alternative rather than interfering with a heritage building. “We are not against any development, but development at the cost of such an important library is not justified. We have provided several other options to the district administration for easing traffic in this area. For instance, a road from Kargil Chowk, passing through Bankipore Club and back of Anta Ghat can be developed, along the bank of river Ganga.” Bedar said the huge collection of this library attracts scholars from across the world and this library plays an important role in the field of education. This library has over 21000 manuscripts in Persian, Pashto, Urdu, Turkish and Arabic. Some of the important collections here include Sahnama by Firdausi and Mughal miniatures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/do-not-demolish-khuda-bakhsh-library-intach-appeals-to-nitish/articleshow/81890405.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Despite Covid-19, VPT stood third among major ports in India for the second consecutive year with 69.84 million tonnes, after Paradip Port and Goa. This is the second highest annual cargo throughput in the history of VPT. Fighting against supply chain disruptions and economic downturn due to the pandemic, VPT stood just short of last year’s performance of 72.72 million tonnes. The VPT’s decline in cargo handling is only 4% whereas the decline recorded in other major ports is about 7%. A major decline in cargo was imports of coking coal (27% decline) and steam coal (45%) but it was offset by an increase in iron ore and pellets handling (31%) and other cargo (22%). VPT chairman K Rama Mohana Rao said there was an increase in exports of iron ore and finished steel to China and an increase in iron pellets movement to Gujarat. “We improved the average wait time of a ship to 1.15 hours as against 1.22 hours. A total of 2,040 ships were handled this fiscal as against 2,099 in 2019-20,” he said. The port has recorded an operating surplus of Rs 698 crore. “Installation of electronic route relay interlocking system to do away with manual intervention in railway signalling operation would be completed. Extension of existing container terminal with an additional capacity to handle 5.4 lakh TEU would be completed by the end of December this year,” Rama Mohana Rao said. The chairman also pointed out that ambient air quality levels are under control. “The port alone is not causing pollution in the city. Even during the lockdown, VPT handled cargo and there was no pollution. Pollution levels dropped during the lockdown as all industries were shut at that time. I request the public to be aware that the port is not causing pollution in the city,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vpt-targets-80-million-tonnes-cargo-handling-in-fy-2021-22/articleshow/81890283.cms||Siva G

The officials also arrested the driver of an earthmover and seized the vehicle. Along with the earthmover, one tractor and a drilling machine were also seized from the area. Speaking to TOI, Kumar said, “The raid started at about 8am but when the workers and the driver of the tractor saw us approaching, they fled. Police, however, managed to arrest the driver of the earthmover who identified himself as Naval Kumar Mandal.” He added, “Naval informed us that the mine is run by two persons identified as Vyas Yadav and Sanjay Ray. An FIR has been lodged against them at the Taljhari police station and the cops will take further action in the case.” Rajmahal SDPO Arvind Kumar Singh said, “We keep conducting such raids in coordination with the mining department. During interrogation, Naval gave us names of those who run the illegal mine and action will be taken against them soon. A case under the Mining Act has been filed and further investigation is on.” Notably, the raid comes a day after tribal residents of Gadwa Hills area in the same block had blocked the main road leading to their hamlets in protest against the mining activities. The residents demanded sprinkling of water on the road which they said is often dusty and posing health hazards by causing diseases like tuberculosis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/illegal-stone-mine-shut-in-sahebganj-1-held/articleshow/81887760.cms||Utsav Basu

The four were brought to Bhuj from Nainital after securing their transit arrest. Ramani, who lives in Rajkot district, and Arya, a resident of Bhuj, were arrested for helping Donga flee from Bhuj on Monday. Sources in police department informed that Ramani had arranged the car in which Donga escaped after managing to flee from the prison ward of the hospital. Ramani was waiting outside the hospital in the car, which was being driven by Arya, sources added. Police said that Kayada has been booked in the past in connection with cases related to cheating, forgery and prohibition while Shyamal was booked in a rioting case and Malviya was booked for criminal conspiracy.

---||Vadodara||Not just finding bed, cashless treatment also a big challenge||Vadodara: At a time when hospitalizations have doubled during the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 across major cities of Gujarat, finding a bed is not the only difficulty that patients are facing. A majority of private hospitals in the state are declining cashless treatment facility for Covid-19 to mediclaim policyholders. The hospitals on their part say that third party administrators (TPAs) are delaying authorization letters as well as final settlements which even if approved are done with haphazard cuts in the final bills. As many as 20 approvals were put on hold by TPAs in the last three days in Vadodara citing admission protocol notification that was issued by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). VMC had issued the admission protocol notification on March 31 to reduce the bed occupancy in the city and the district (which is at all time high) and to reduce the out-of-pocket expenditure of citizens. The notification listed out criteria of age, clinical, lab and radiology for hospital admission and criteria for home isolation. “The TPAs used the same notification to cancel or put on hold 15 to 20 approvals in ten hospitals in the city. Some of them were already approved. So many crucial human hours were simply wasted in explaining to them the notification at a time when doctors, medical staff and health officials have to attend to the war-like situation. It was only after clarification from all the stakeholders that the approvals were sanctioned,” said Dr Krutesh Shah, president of SETU, the Association of Private Hospitals and Private Practitioners. Dr Inderjeet Singh, CEO of Tricolour Hospitals said there are three major issues that hospitals across the board are facing. “There are delays in approvals during the initial time. And there are delays in approval during the final stage. At times, the payment comes as late as 4 to 6 months and when the payment comes there are haphazard cuts even if the amount has been approved,” he said. “There are times when TPAs continue sending queries related to the insured and the patient every two hours instead of sending all the queries in one go. This process itself takes 24 to 48 hours — affecting both parties,” said Sonali Zaveri, CEO of Bankers Superspeciality Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/not-just-finding-bed-cashless-treatment-also-a-big-challenge/articleshow/81890369.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Patna||Poisonous hooch prima facie cause of Nawada deaths: IG||PATNA: IG (prohibition) Amrit Raj on Saturday admitted that the deaths in Nawada district since Holi prima facie seem to be the result of poisonous hooch consumption. Nawada DM Yash Pal Meena and SP Dhurat Saayli Savlaram had so far been been denying hooch deaths in the district. Altogether 16 persons have died of suspected hooch poisoning in the district since Holi till Friday night. However, the official toll was 14 with almost half of them being termed as deaths due to different reasons, including illness. The deceased belonged to Gondapur, Kharidi Bigha, Siswan and New area under Town police station of Nawada. Raj, who is heading the special team constituted on the order of CM Nitish Kumar on Friday to probe into the causes of recent deaths in Nawada, told TOI over the phone that out of the 14 deaths, seven prima facie seemed to be the result of poisonous hooch consumption. “In rest of the cases, their family members have not said anything about liquor consumption. But we will investigated. Seven separate FIRs have been lodged till now with the Town police station in connection with the deaths,” he said. When asked about fixing responsibilities, Raj said a detailed report would be submitted to senior authorities after which a decision would be taken regarding action against erring police officers. The IG said some viscera in case of suspected deaths preserved after postmortem have already been sent for forensic analysis while some more would be sent soon after the court order. “Samples of liquor from the villages have also been collected after raids and they would be also sent for forensic analysis to know if they were poisonous,” he said. He said on his directions, a separate special investigation team has been formed by the DM and SP to probe the cases registered in connection with the deaths. “Another SIT is already looking into the overall matter,” he added. Meanwhile, Nawada civil surgeon Dr Ashok Kumar Mohan said altogether seven persons were admitted at the district sadar hospital after suspected poisonous hooch consumption. “Of the seven, one died, three were referred to higher centres, including PMCH, DMCH and VIMS Pawapuri and three were discharged after treatment,” he said, adding they had complaints of blurred vision, chest and abdomen pain with breathlessness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/poisonous-hooch-prima-facie-cause-of-nawada-deaths-ig/articleshow/81890641.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Full of ideas, kids buckle up to solve real life problems||PATNA: City students have hailed the announcement of the ‘Innovation Award for School Children’ as part of which they can win 15 prizes for conceptualising novel scientific and technological ideas. The top three prizes carry a cash award of Rs 1,00,000, Rs 50,000 and Rs 30,000 respectively. Instituted by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in 2002 on World Intellectual Property Day on April 26, the annual national competition requires students to submit a written proposal authorised by their school heads by April 30. According to Rishika Singh, who studies in Loyola High School, competitions with lucrative prizes motivate and support students. A diehard fan of popular science channels on TV, Ansh Alok, a Class IX student of DAV Public School, claims that he is full of ideas which “I will discuss with my teachers”. “The innovation award has given us an opportunity to generate new ideas and work creatively,” he says. Shashwat Singh, a Class VI pupil of Delhi Public School, however, feels that it is unfair to judge all the students on the same parameter. “Our seniors are likely to come up with something more innovative as they have a better understanding of everything,” he rues. Apart from certificates and prizes, the winners and their science teachers will be trained in intellectual property rights by the CSIR. Meanwhile, teachers are leaving no stone unturned to encourage their students to participate in the competition. “This is a great platform for students to showcase their talent and enhance their knowledge,” says Amit Raj, a science teacher. Smita Raj, who teaches chemistry, points out that the shift from theories to practical-based approaches is the need of the hour. She adds, “A competition like this will provide students with real life possibilities that they can solve with the help of science and technology.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/full-of-ideas-kids-buckle-up-to-solve-real-life-problems/articleshow/81890363.cms||---

Addressing a press conference, Guntur Urban SP RN Ammi Reddy explained that the prime accused Nagaraju had a decade-old rivalry with another history sheeter Naddi Vamsi Krishna (34). “Both have history sheets and murder cases against them in the past,” Ammi Reddy said. Recently, Nagaraju received a tip-off that Vamsi Krishna was planning to kill him and in turn, Nagaraju decided to kill Vamsi Krishna. He informed his intention to kill Vamsi Krishna to PM Kranthi and Sheik Kiran Babu and told them to mobilise men. Kranthi called in Dharavat Sai Ganesh and Peram Santhosh Reddy and Kiran roped in Ongole Venkatesh and Sheikh Vali. After which, Nagaraju called in his aide Kancherla Venkateswarlu. Around 10 days ago, they travelled to Cherukupalli to purchase hunting sickles and held a meeting on April 2 at Bhagya Nagar before dividing themselves into two teams and laying watch at two spots.

---||Patna||Bihar hospitals fall short of beds with rise in number of Covid patients||PATNA: The Covid wards in city hospitals are falling short of beds following a spike in positive cases in the state in the past few days. While some of the hospitals are simply refusing admission to the positive cases, others are planning to increase number of beds and other medical facilities required for the treatment of Covid patients. However, what concerns the medical experts is the larger number of people in the 20 to 40 years age group testing positive and seeking admission in hospitals. “The 80-bed Covid ward at the AIIMS-Patna is having 90 patients at present,” its Covid nodal officer Dr Sanjeev Kumar said on Saturday. He said the number of patients had dropped to 17 about a fortnight back, but it has been increasing in the last three days and the hospital has to refuse new admissions. The line of treatment is the same followed during the first wave like use of antibiotics, antiviral and oxygen in different modes. “The difference this time is the larger number of people in the age group of 20 to 40 turning up for admissions,” he said. As the number of patients has gone up to 10, the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) has planned to increase the beds. PMCH superintendent Dr IS Thakur said the number of beds in its Covid ward would soon be increased from the existing 36 to 100.  “Being the largest government hospital of the state, PMCH has been the first option for treatment and we are planning to increase facilities in the Covid ward,” he said. The Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), however, has many of its 100 beds in the Covid ward lying unoccupied. NMCH superintendent Dr Binod kumar Singh said while the number of Covid patients was zero a week ago, it was 7 on Friday and 11 on Saturday. “ Of the 11 patients, six are in 20 to 40 age group,” he said, adding that people returning from the affected states and flouting of the Covid guidelines were the reasons behind the second wave in the state. All the 30 beds, including nine in ICU in the Covid ward at Paras HMRI hospital, are full. Its regional director Dr Talat Halim said the return of the pandemic necessitated placing additional health workers in the Covid ward. “We have to refuse admission to many due to shortage of beds as the Covid treatment under the Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines required many precautions to check spread of the virus in adjacent wards,” he said, adding that the hospital followed cost of treatment as decided by the state government last year. Talat also admitted that larger number of new Covid patients were in the 30-35 age group. Ruban Hospital also has almost similar pressure. Its managing director Dr Satyajit Singh said the number of Covid patients rose to 56 on Saturday, leaving no room for further admission. Five to ten cases are refused admission every day due to shortage of beds, he said. “We have a separate ward for the suspected patients and only after confirmation and health conditions they are shifted to the Covid ward having 18 ICUs,” he said. No shortage of beds in Patna hosps, says DM: Patna DM Chandrasekhar Singh said 716 beds were available in government and private hospitals in the district for treatment of the Covid patients. Of these, only 136 were occupied till Saturday evening. He said some private hospitals have been asked to increase the number of beds in the next two days. He said 26 of the 165 beds at Patliputra Ashoka Covid care facility were being equipped with oxygen and other ICU-type facilities. The ESI hospital at Bihta has been directed to provide 50-bed Covid ward. “Both the health department and the district administration are regularly monitoring the surge in Covid cases and, if the situation demanded, adequate number of beds would be made ready in both government and private hospitals within no time, the DM said. As most of the patients opt for selected hospitals, there could be shortage of beds at a few places, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hospitals-fall-short-of-beds-with-rise-in-number-of-covid-patients/articleshow/81890446.cms||---

The duo was awarded three years under Section 376, one year under Section 506/34 of IPC and three years each under Sections 4 and 6 of the POCSO Act, 2012. All punishments to run concurrently. The adult accused in the crime, which took place at a village under Hilsa police station in May 2020, is facing trial at a sessions court. As the minors were arrested and sent to a reformatory days after the crime, the JJB court said the time they spent at the reformatory home should be deducted from the punishment awarded to them. According to additional public prosecutor Rajesh Pathak, the grandfather of the survivor said three boys abducted her at knife's edge and took turns to rape her at a nearby cornfield, when she had gone to relieve herself on May 21, 2020. The FIR with Biharsharif women's police station was lodged on May 22. He said the sessions court transferred the case of minors to JJB on June 3, 2020, while the charge sheets against them were filed on September 3. The judge also directed the Nalanda reformatory to ensure that one of the convicts, who passed the intermediate (science) examination with 70% marks, is admitted to B.Sc part one at Nalanda College and all study materials provided to him before he is shifted to a Patna home for boys. JJB member Dharmendra Kumar said the JJB court always takes a sympathetic view with minors involved in petty crimes but it is tough with those who commit a heinous crime like this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jjb-awards-two-accused-3-years-for-gang-rape/articleshow/81890647.cms||---

As soon as the woman’s family members came to know about it, they created ruckus and demanded strict action against the ANM. Senior health officials immediately swung into action and after pacifying the agitating family members of the woman, apprised senior officials including the district magistrate and chief medical officer about the alleged negligence. The woman’s family members told reporters that Kamlesh Kumari (50), wife of Vipin, a native of Madauli village, had gone to a PHC under Akbarpur block on Thursday to get her first vaccine shot where ANM Archana, who was busy on a phone call instead administered her two doses of Covid vaccine. It was when Kamlesh tried to question ANM about two back-to-back jabs being given to her, Archana misbehaved with her and even threatened her, they alleged. The family members further told reporters that due to the double shots of the vaccine, Kamlesh’s hand developed swelling but there was no serious side-effect. Kamlesh was then stopped for surveillance for nearly one-and-a-half hours by PHC’s senior medical officer Dr Rakesh Kumar. “She was only allowed to go after proper monitoring. Fortunately, she had developed no other serious symptoms,” said Dr Kumar. District magistrate Kanpur Dehat Jitendra Pratap Singh on Saturday said, “I have taken serious note and asked the chief medical officer to inquire into the incident and submit a fact-finding report soon,” the DM added. Kanpur Dehat CMO Dr Rajesh Katiyar said, “From now onwards, every vaccinator has been asked to deposit his/her mobile phone prior to giving Covid vaccine shot to people.” “A team of three doctors is conducting a probe with regard to the Madauli primary health centre incident. The inquiry report would be sent to the DM who will take further action,” Dr Katiyar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/probe-ordered-as-anm-gives-2-covid-shots-to-woman/articleshow/81890944.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The startup, which digitized the insurance broking business, clocked a premium collection of Rs 6 crore as of March 31, 2021. "Within seven months of receiving an insurance broking license, we clocked a handsome premium collection of Rs 6 crore and have at least 2,000 points of sale persons (POSPs) who are all trained insurance advisors," said Prabhat Vijh, founder-director of the startup. The company provides a B2B digital platform to connect insurance companies with trained insurance advisors to help pitch and sell their products and reach out to a wider audience. The startup is also in the process of launching its mobile application in the first quarter of 2021-22. "The idea of developing this B2B platform was to tap on the unorganized market in the insurance sector. A huge number of tele-callers operate in the sector currently, who are untrained. The companies, however, require trained insurance advisors, who are well informed about the market, trends, and customer requirements in the insurance sector," Vijh explained. Currently, iAND is associated with some 55 insurance companies offering a variety of different insurance products for individual and business requirements. It has a presence across some 900+ pin codes from where POSPs operate and reach out to clients. The startup differentiates itself from other platforms not just through its 100% digital interface but also through a team of well-trained insurance advisors. "We have people joining from some 302 cities in India spread across some 22 states. When we started out, we operated in Ahmedabad alone and eventually began onboarding more POSPs so that insurance companies get a wider network of well-informed advisors," said Vijh. Some of the key markets where iAND has a presence include Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Jammu, New Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Odisha. Going forward, the company plans to expand its presence and is looking at a 10-fold increase in its premium collection. "By the end of 2021-22, we’re looking at a premium collection of Rs 60 crore. In line with our plans, we aim at having some 10,000 insurance advisors," Vijh further added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/insure-tech-co-blazes-ahead-in-collections/articleshow/81891047.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Patna||BJP minister blames police for Madhubani killings||PATNA: The murder of five persons, including four brothers, in Madhubani on Holi has brought the state police under attack from both the opposition as well as BJP, the alliance partner of state government. The killings took place over a dispute over fishing from a pond between Muhammadpur and Gebipur villages under Benipatti police station area on March 29. The pond is owned by one Sanjay Singh from Muhammadpur, but another group from Gebipur wanted to capture it. State environment, forest and climate change department minister and BJP MLA Neeraj Kumar Singh alias Bablu visited Muhammadpur on Saturday and termed the killings as a massacre. “This is not a routine incident and no action has been taken against the police yet,” he said. “Kahi na kahi police ke nakammapan ki wajah se ye ghatna ghati hai (the incident took place because of police inaction),” Neeraj told the media. While Rana Pratap Singh and his nephew Ranvijay Singh were shot dead on the spot, Ranvijay’s two brothers Birendra Singh and Amrendra Singh and their cousin Rudra Narayan Singh died during treatment. Ranvijay’s another cousin Manoj Singh is still undergoing treatment in a critical condition. They hailed from Muhammadpur. Rana was an assistant sub-inspector in BSF posted on Rajasthan border and had come home on leave. The opposition also targeted the Nitish Kumar government over the Madhubani killings. Leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav tweeted: “Massacre of five persons in Madhubani. Same day, 22 deaths from poisonous hooch. Failed CM has no knowledge about these deaths. Everyone is silent up to Delhi. These are some trailers of ‘mangalraj’ in Bihar.” In another tweet he said, “Accused should be arrested without delay and stern action should be taken against them.” Tejashwi also lashed out at the CM over the alleged custodial death of a minor irrigation department employee in Bhagalpur. “Bihar police can pick up anyone except criminals and murder them for extortion. Police have started extortion with the notification of Bihar Special Armed Police Act. CM must be unknown of the incident. He lied in the assembly about the bill. Now he should handle his police,” he wrote. Meanwhile, Madhubani SP Satya Prakash said ten named accused out of 35 persons booked in the Muhammadpur incident had been arrested. “Two of the ten arrested persons are the prime accused in the case,” he said. “Police on Saturday procured proclamation notices against rest of the accused and executed them,” he said. Prakash said police would move the court for property attachment of all the accused within two days if they evaded arrest. The SP said earlier in November last year, both groups had clashed on the issue of fishing from the pond. “Some of the people, including Sanjay Singh, who own the pond, are still behind bars,” he said. Prakash said a special investigation team under Benipatti SDPO Arun Kumar Singh is trying to arrest all the accused. “We are also in touch with SPs of Dhanusha, Sattari and Sihra districts of Nepal to nab the accused who might have fled there. Police would soon file chargesheet in the case for speedy trial,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-minister-blames-police-for-madhubani-killings/articleshow/81890328.cms||Debashish Karmakar

While 70% of it has been completed, the remaining 30% is likely to be ready by March next year. “The academic-cum-administrative building of the stadium, which is being built on 90 acres of land, is almost ready. Finishing touches are also being given to the five-storey hostels, each of which can accommodate 400 trainees,” Nalanda district magistrate Yogendra Kumar Singh told this reporter on Saturday. He added, “While the transit hostel, dining room, coach suites, staff quarters, and sports halls will be ready in the next three to six months, work on the pavilions will be completed by March next year.” The stadium, which is being constructed at Thera village under Pilkhi panchayat of Rajgir, will have a seating capacity of 45,000 people along with an indoor and outdoor sports complex. The academy will have facilities like playground, sports equipment, library as well as research, fitness and motivation centres. Chief minister Nitish Kumar had laid the foundation for the international cricket stadium-cum-sports academy in 2018. The implementing agency, Shapoorji Pallonji Group, was supposed to complete the construction work in 2020, which did not happen due to the Covid-19 pandemic and some technical reasons. According to sources, the project cost is likely to go up. The government has already paid Rs 48 crore to the farmers from whom land for the stadium was acquired. Officials hope that the stadium will tremendously increase tourist footfalls once it is thrown open to the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rajgir-international-stadium-likely-to-be-ready-by-march-22/articleshow/81890625.cms||Farrukh Nadim

I cannot book my tickets before the test results,” says Goswami, whose work warrants travelling at a short notice. As the third Covid-19 surge swells across Gujarat, hundreds of people can be queuing up outside pathological laboratories in major cities including Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot to get their test results for Covid-19. On the other side of the counter, the path lab technicians are working round the clock to meet the surge. While experts declined to put a number to an approximate RT-PCR tests conducted in Ahmedabad, they concede the surge is unprecedented and work load has increased three to four-fold compared to January-February. In Vadodara, test capacity of several labs is exhausted. Sources confessed that some labs are going slow on sample collection to reduce the rollover effect. Pranav Desai, senior VP of Surat-based Desai Metropolis Lab, said, “There is a heavy rush for testing of RT-PCR and related blood tests. In the current situation, we have to stop taking samples once we reach our maximum testing capacity.” Rajkot labs are also reeling under demand for average 1,500-2,000 tests daily. “We are delivering results of the tests after 24 to 48 hours nowadays. Per day testing has doubled, and also the need for quicker result due to travel requirements has spiked the number,” said Dr Darshita Shah, owner of a path lab in Rajkot.

He has also directed them to carry out a mask-checking drive at public places like shops and malls and penalise the violators.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Ambedkar open varsity enrols record 25 transgender students||AHMEDABAD: Meenaxi (name changed), 33, had to drop out from a private engineering college where she was pursuing her BE in chemical engineering after uncomfortable questions regarding her gender identity were raised. Born as a man, the realization that she was a woman inside sank in when was in class 12, she says. It was a very painful affair in pursuit of her gender identity, she was first distanced from her family and then her friends and other members of the society who turned their backs on her. After dropping out of engineering college, she tried to run a small business but here too being seen as an ‘outcast’, she had to finally shut it down. Financially broke, Meenaxi got a fresh lease of life when she learnt about a new initiative launched by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Open University (BAOU) to enrol transgender persons. She returned to college, pursuing an undergraduate programme in commerce studies. “I am once again able to lead a normal college life. Here, I am no longer treated like a third gender or an outcast. I plan to further study and pursue a masters’ degree in social welfare. I want to do good work for the society at large,” she said. There are more than 25 students like Meenaxi from the 25 LGBTQIA (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual) who have enroled in various courses for the academic year 2020-2021 at its college campus at Charodi on the outskirts of Ahmedabad. The university provides free education to these students. Moreover, it also offers scholarship programmes for them. What’s more? The varsity has also set up a separate cell to address any issue faced by these students. Before enrolling the trans-persons, as part of its awareness drive, the vice-chancellor of the varsity reached out to the community members at various places including the famous Bahucharaji temple in Bechraji. The temple’s deity Bahuchara Mata enjoys patronage of the transgender community. “Education is free of cost for these students. I visited Bahucharaji temple, met people from the transgender community and explained them the importance of education and how it can uplift their lives. Apart from the regular graduation and post-graduation courses, we offer more than a dozen certificate courses including food nutrition and child welfare,” says Ami Upadhyay, vice-chancellor of the university. Also, there is a bridge course of one year for those who could not complete their basic schooling and had to leave midway. “People used to often ask me earlier that why should I study if I or any other member of my community would not be able to find a job. But things are changing rapidly and there is wider acceptance of people from LGBTQI+,” says 29-year-old Madhvi (name changed). She is pursuing her masters in English literature at the university.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/baou-enrols-record-25-lgbtqia-students/articleshow/81890999.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The deceased were identified as Kishun Devi (65), her daughter-in-law Sangeeta Devi (35) and her daughter Ganga Kumari (2). A villager, Sadhu Sharan Rai, told TOI over the phone that Kishun’s husband Sonelal Rai (70) and Sangeeta’s husband Amlesh Yadav (40) somehow managed to escape as they were sleeping outside their house. Rai said it was yet not clear how the fire broke out. “Everyone was fast asleep at the time of the incident. All the houses were made of mud with roof made of straw, tin or plastic sheet. The fire which erupted from Sonelal’s house immediately engulfed the other adjacent houses,” he said. Kalyanpur police station SHO Braj Kishore Singh suspected either LPG leakage or burning of mosquito repellant coil in the house as the reason behind the fire. “The flames quickly spread out due to dry straws giving no chance to the three females to run out of the house. They were charred to death inside,” he said. Singh said a small fire tender stationed at the Kalyanpur police station and a large fire tender at the district headquarters were pressed into action with help of which the fire was extinguished. “Altogether 22 houses were gutted in the fire. The occupants are yet to submit a detailed written complaint about the loss of properties caused by the fire leading to the death of three persons,” he said. SHO Singh said the bodies were handed over to the family for cremation after postmortem. Kalyanpur circle officer (incharge) Santosh Kumar Srivastava said a cheque for Rs4 lakh as ex-gratia payment had been handed over to the next of kin of the deceased. “Besides, a financial aid of Rs9800 to each of the 22 families affected by fire is also being provided. Rs20000 against each of the deceased is additionally provided to their kin under Mukhya Mantri Parivarik Labh Yojana,” Srivastava added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-of-a-family-charred-to-death-in-samastipur-village/articleshow/81890619.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Patna accounts for 82% of active Covid-19 cases in district||PATNA: The number of new Covid-19 cases is increasing more in urban than the rural areas in the state with each passing day. More than 80% of the total active cases in Patna district are reported from the state capital, followed by other blocks which are urban in nature. Experts cited travelling as one of the major reasons for more Covid-19 cases in urban areas compared to the villages. Since airports, railway stations and bus stops are located in the cities, people coming from outside the state reach here first before moving to other places. Congestion is another reason for easy spread of the virus in urban areas. “Patna is a major commercial hub. Also, secretariat is located here and many people come for official work,” an official said. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Singh said, “Social distance is not being maintained and some people are still violating the norms without understanding the consequences.” The health department’s data till Friday showed the state had total 2,362 active cases, out of which 958 were in the Patna district. Further bifurcation of this data revealed that in Patna district, out of total 958 active cases, 789 were in the state capital alone. Hence, these active cases in the capital account for 82.35% of the total active cases in Patna district. After the city, the next highest number of active cases in Patna district were in Phulwarisharif block (48), Danapur (39), Barh (19), Sampatchak (14), Punpun (8), Paliganj (7) and Dhanarua (7). These are the data till Friday evening. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said localities under Patrakar Nagar, SK Puri, Shastrinagar and Rupaspur have more active cases. He further said there were 52 containment zones in Patna till Saturday afternoon and this number was expected to increase by the evening. Singh said on Saturday they had also flagged off 14 vehicles, which have a mike system with flying quad for creating awareness regarding the Covid-19 protocols. These squads will also charge fine from those found violating the norms. “Any shop or commercial place found violating the norms will be seized,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-accounts-for-82-of-active-covid-19-cases-in-district/articleshow/81890607.cms||---

A proposal to make necessary changes in the existing statutes and regulations will be placed before the academic council soon. According to PU’s development officer Parimal Kumar Khan, the University Grants Commission (Credit Framework for Online Learning Courses through Swayam) Regulations, 2021 has notified institutions to amend their rules and regulations within four weeks for seamless integration through Swayam-based online courses. Swayam is India’s Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform. As the national coordinator for non-technology postgraduate (PG) courses, the UGC has developed 145 MOOCs and offered 208 MOOCs on the Swayam platform. Khan told this newspaper, “Some PG departments of PU had introduced their students to the virtual courses offered by Swayam during the last academic session. Many of them opted for the courses and took online examinations. The credit they earned will now be added to their final-year marksheets.” Geology teacher Bhavuk Sharma also said, “At least 12 MSc students of the final semester chose an online course offered by Swayam last year and secured good marks in the examination.” Meanwhile, PU has brought some changes in its existing regulations so that they match with those of the UGC. Under the existing regulations, students have to get at least 45% marks to pass the university examination, but the commission declares them successful in the online courses if they secure only 40% marks. Recently, vice-chancellor G K Chaudhary had constituted a five-member committee, headed by the pro-VC, to discuss the issue and take a decision. They decided to make an amendment in line with the UGC regulations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-students-likely-to-cover-40-of-syllabi-every-semester-through-swayam/articleshow/81890285.cms||B K Mishra

The deceased Rakesh Chaurasia, son of Manik Chand, of Makrandpur village in Badhalganj police station area of Gorakhpur district was preparing for Army and police jobs and was about to get married soon. The uncle of the deceased filed a complaint alleging some unidentified assailants immolated Rakesh by throwing oil on him while he was asleep on Thursday night and putting him on fire, following which police registered an FIR on Saturday. As per reports, Rakesh was sleeping in verandah while his uncle and his son were asleep on another bed. At around 1am on Thursday night, some unidentified assailants came and poured oil on Rakesh when he was asleep and lit a match stick. Rakesh was preparing for recruitment in Indian Army or police service and his marriage was scheduled on April 21 while the Tilak ceremony was on April 16. Rakesh’s elder brother Nitesh is in BSF. ASP South Arun Kumar Singh said, “A case has been registered against unidentified people. We have started a probe and are awaiting the postmortem and forensic reports. The case would be solved but, prima facie, statements of family members seem suspicious.” “They claim Rakesh was asleep when assailants poured oil on him and lit fire, but the burns on body are on all sides which is not possible if he was asleep,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/man-dies-of-burns-kin-allege-immolation-cops-lodge-fir/articleshow/81890252.cms||---

The agency has so far issued provisional attachment order, with a market value of Rs 600 crore. Trinamool MP Satabdi reacted sharply. “I returned the amount nearly a year ago. They had wanted to show it as an attachment then, but I had refused. I had questioned its need when I voluntarily returned the amount. The way it is being splashed at this moment is unfortunate,” she said. “I am hearing about the attachment after the media learnt about it. I am yet to get any intimation from them. It is also surprising the attachment order floated in the media during the polls.” Ghosh said, “I volunteered to return the money I got from Saradha as salary and advertisement. I started returning from 2013. The amount I have returned has been legally accepted by them.” He said he had no idea of a fresh attachment order from ED.  Ghosh and Roy questioned why a provisional attachment order was not issued to actor and BJP member Mithun Chakraborty. He had also returned the money he received from the Saradha group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ed-attaches-rs-3cr-from-kunal-satabdi-debjani/articleshow/81890678.cms||Rohit Khanna

---||Delhi||Delhi: Two men arrested for 12 ATM thefts worth Rs 2.1 crore||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Special Cell has arrested two key members of a Mewat-based gang, which is estimated to have looted Rs 2.1 crore in 12 cases of ATM break-ins in Delhi and Haryana in the past few months. The arrested men have been identified as Sohrab and Shakeel, residents of Nuh in Haryana. “The suspects were arrested by a team comprising inspector Shiv Kumar, SI Rajesh and others,” DCP Pramod Kushwaha said. Police said, they had received specific information that Sohrab was hiding in the area of Kaama in Rajasthan and would pass through Silkho Toll Plaza in Nuh around 4am on Friday. “We had information that Sohrab would go to Mewat to meet his contact. A police team was accordingly deployed near the toll plaza and when Sohrab was spotted at 4.30 am in a taxi, he was intercepted and caught,” Pramod Kushwah, DCP, Special Cell said. Sohrab disclosed that he was an active member of two Mewat-based interstate gangs of ATM robbers. “He said that he and seven other gang members, including kingpin Shahid Advani, uprooted eight ATMs in Delhi and Haryana in the year 2019. Sohrab was absconding for two years and he was not attending the courts in all these above cases. Process to declare him proclaimed offender in these cases is going on,” the officer said. The main role of Sohrab was to examine the ATM installations and decide whether the ATMs were to be cut open with the help of a gas cutter, or to be uprooted, police said. Shakeel was trapped near Malviya Nagar. After being cornered, the suspect whipped out his pistol and tried to fire but he was overpowered and disarmed by the members of a police team. A semi-automatic pistol of .315 bore and five live cartridges were recovered from the accused. Members of the gang used to spray black paint on CCTV cameras after entering ATM booths. They would then open the ATMs with the help of a gas cutter and remove the cash cabins. After removing cash, they used to throw away parts of ATMs. At times, they would use an SUV to uproot an entire ATM by tying ropes around it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-men-arrested-for-12-atm-thefts-worth-rs-2-1-crore/articleshow/81891584.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Girgaum film director’s celluloid dreams earn him national award||Mumbai: He loves to dream and Bhimrao Kashinath Mude’s film, which recently fetched him the national award, is all about dreams — one of human mind’s abiding pre-occupations. “My film tries to de-mystify dreams. A no man’s land, every dream weaves a tapestry of thoughts and moods — coalescing facts and fantasy, the mundane and the sublime into a creative experience,” said Mude. “Dreams are like short sleep before yet another awakening,” he said, attributing the film’s concept to the Buddhist philosophy. The title of the film ‘Bardo’ is the Tibetan word for a brief interval between the old and the new, he added. However, the maverick film maker never in his dreams thought of joining the world of grease paint and glamour. A product of the city’s textile hub, Mude, as a child, soaked in Girangao’s robust, multi-hued culture — Ganesh festivals, gully cricket and ‘gan-gavlan’, theatre of the proletariat. His father lost his weaver’s job in the now defunct India United Mill No. 1 following the historic textile strike in 1982. “I was in Std IV and knew nothing of the upheavals in my family. Girangao was losing its moorings,” he recalled. Mude’s mother set up a ‘khanaval’ to keep the home fires burning. As a student of Maharshi Dayanand College, Mude discovered the joy and beauty of theatre. From theatre to television serials and then to cinema was a hop in quick succession. He made his debut with ‘Daavpech’ (Strategy). ‘Kaul Manaachaa’ (Heart’s Verdict) was next. Both did well at the box office. Last week, ‘Bardo’ fetched him the prestigious golden lotus. His next destination, after a quick de tour of Hindi filmdom is Hollywood. “I want to go there and do a film,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-girgaum-film-directors-celluloid-dreams-earn-him-national-award/articleshow/81891066.cms||Ambarish Mishra

---||Kochi||Police to reinvestigate Class X student’s death||Kozhikode: The Kozhikode rural police have initiated proceedings to reinvestigate the death of a minor boy last year, following the emergence of a video footage suggesting foul play in his death. Police had earlier closed the case terming the death as suicide. Raising suspicion about his death, the video clip showing a person strangling the child and pushing him surfaced on social media. Abdul Azeez, a Class X student, was found hanging from a fan inside his house at Narikkatteri near Nadapuram on May 5, 2020. Local residents had expressed suspicion over his death. But the investigators had concluded it as a case of suicide. Police are learnt to have started the procedure to seek the court’s permission to reinvestigate the case. However, a senior officer with the Nadapuram police said that similar allegations were made during the initial investigation as well. “We have opened a reinvestigation. We will be questioning those who are connected to the case again. The autopsy report had not suggested any such foul play, which is why it was closed as a case of suicide. There was information about such fights happening in that house in the past itself. However, only a thorough investigation can confirm whether the attack shown in the visuals resulted in his death,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-to-reinvestigate-class-x-students-death/articleshow/81890236.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala assembly polls: They hardly spent from own pockets to win!||THIRVANANTHAPURAM: Candidates in assembly polls have fuelled their election campaigns mostly with funds that they source as gifts, donations and loans rather than their own fund and monetary support from political parties. In the 2016 assembly polls, there were a few winners who hardly spent from own fund or did not move a penny at all from their pocket. K M Mani who went into elections with Rs 40,000 in cash, assets worth over Rs 1 crore and a bevy of graft allegations in 2016, received a lump sum of Rs 21.6 lakh as loan/gift/donation and his total expense stood at Rs 29.5 lakh as per the statement of expenditure filed with the Election Commission. His own fund expenditure was zero. His opponent Mani C Kappan received only Rs 10,000 as contribution in terms of loan and gift and his party spent Rs 25 lakh for what turned out to be a lost cause. At Puthupally, Oommen Chandy walked over his opponents shelling out just Rs 30,000 from own fund. He also got Rs 3.95 lakh as loan, gift and donation and Rs 10 lakh from his party. Jaick C Thomas, the CPM candidate at Puthupally, spent nothing from his pocket and neither had party’s funding. His total expense of Rs 12 lakh was sourced as loan, gift and donation. Pinarayi Vijayan had spent Rs 16 lakh for his election campaign at Dharmadom. Ramesh Chennithala did not take a chance by being miserly in his sure seat at Haripad. He spent Rs 6.57 lakh from his own fund and received Rs 10 lakh from the party and sourced Rs 11.3 lakh as gift, donation and loan, making it Rs 27.87 lakh. K Babu, who lost to M Swaraj in Thripunithara, was an exception in case of spending own funds. He spent Rs 6.25 lakh from own fund and received Rs 11 lakh from his party. Swaraj on the other hand was reliant almost entirely on loan, gift and donation. His total expense was Rs 19.65 lakh, of which he spent only Rs 15,000 from his pocket and received nothing from his party. U Prathibha, who won from Kayamkulam, spent only Rs 1,950 from her wallet and took Rs 27 lakh as loan. Later, she had to explain as her account of election expenditure was at variance with EC’s shadow register, showing a difference of Rs 10.85 lakh. Prathibha said that she used low-quality substances for campaigning and some of the labourers were party sympathizers who worked at meagre wages. V S Sivakumar, who won from Thiruvananthapuram, sourced Rs 18 lakh as loan from six individuals and he didn’t spend from his own fund. Ministers K K Shailaja and J Mercykutty Amma also saved their own funds in 2016. While Mercykutty Amma banked entirely on Rs 19 lakh received as gift/donation, Shailaja was given Rs 20 lakh by the party. T N Seema was one candidate who did not take any gift/donation. She spent Rs 3.8 lakh from own fund and got additional cushion of Rs 20.43 lakh from her party, in Vattiyoorkavu. K Muraleedharan, the victor, spent Rs 9.63 lakh from own fund and took Rs 5 lakh as loan/donation/gift.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/they-hardly-spent-from-own-pockets-to-win/articleshow/81891068.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur-Kale stretch to get all-weather rd||Kolhapur: The 17km stretch from Kolhapur to Kale, a part of National Highway 166G of Kolhapur-Gaganbawda-Talere, is set to get all-weather concrete road. Moreover, the 125-year-old bridge across the Bhogavati river along the national highway will be replaced with a new bridge. The route passes through plain, rolling and steep terrain. Currently, works along the plain terrain are proposed under the plan. Nitin Gadkari, the Union highways minister, had announced Rs 167 crore for the work, the proposal for which had been pending for the past few years. The highway is one of three major routes connecting Konkan with Kolhapur. The other routes are Kolhapur-Amboli-Sawantwadi, the southern-most route, and the Kolhapur-Ratnagiri-via-Panhala route that is the northern-most along the borders of the district flanked by the Konkan region. Both these routes are under state government’s public works department. The Gaganbawda route was declared a national highway two years ago and falls under the central government. Tourists from Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Solapur prefer the Kolhapur-Talere route mainly to witness the scenic beauty of the Gaganbawda ghat section. Over the past few years, owing to heavy traffic, the route has become potehole riddled. Sachin Sagavkar, the executive engineer of national highways department of PWD, said: “The all-weather concrete road will make the commute smoother and avoid traffic clogging, thereby reducing time to reach the destination. Also, we are going to build a new bridge across the Bhogavati river. Since the funds have been approved, we are expecting to start the actual work as early as possible.” The total length of the highway is around 84 km. The highway joins NH 66, which is the Mumbai-Goa expressway, which is expected to complete by December this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-kale-stretch-to-get-all-weather-rd/articleshow/81889800.cms||---

---||Mumbai||No final exam for classes 1-8 of Maharashtra schools: Minister||MUMBAI: In view of the surge in Covid cases in the state, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced that students from class I to VIII in state board schools will be directly promoted to the next class. While the Right to Education (RTE) Act anyway does not allow the failing of students till class VIII, this year there will be no exam for these classes. The decision on exams from classes IX and XI, however, is pending. In the academic year 2020-21, physical classes for class I to IV were not allowed on account of the pandemic. The same was made possible for a short period in some regions for classes V to VIII, Gaikwad said in a public message, adding that there have been demands from parents’ and teachers’ organisations to decide on exams. While the state has decided to promote all students from class I to VIII, without conducting the annual exams, detailed guidelines regarding continuous comprehensive assessment will soon be issued by the State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT). She said a decision will soon be taken for classes IX and XI. Teachers organisations have, however, demanded a decision for classes IX and XI soon. They even claimed that the decision on classes I to VIII has come at a point when many schools in cities have already conducted their exams. The Brihanmumbai Secondary and Higher Secondary School Headmasters’ Association said the decision to not conduct exams was a welcome move. “Students were imparted education online, but they faced difficulty in learning due to internet connectivity and lack of adequate tools for online learning. The decision will help students in rural areas as many aided schools in the urban areas have already conducted exams,” said a statement from the association. Rajesh Pandya from the Teachers Democratic Front said that the minister should decide on higher classes first. “Students from lower classes are anyway promoted to the next class every year. This decision has been taken very late. Usually, annual exams end by April 15. The state is yet to specify when the session will end in schools and when summer vacation will begin. Details of evaluation methods for higher classes and results should be taken soon,” said Pandya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-final-exam-for-classes-1-8-of-state-schools-min/articleshow/81905898.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala Congress rivalry hits a Covid hurdle||IDUKKI: Thodupuzha was anyway going to be an interesting battle in the assembly election as it is one of the four constituencies in the state where Kerala Congress Jose and Joseph factions are involved in a direct contest. Adding a twist to the scenario, Covid-19 arrives. PJ Joseph was the first candidate in Thodupuzha to contract the virus. The sitting MLA had to be quarantined for a week before he filed his nomination papers. Joseph's return -- after recovering -- to campaigning has been subtle. He has not conducted an open poll campaign and has concentrated on family meetings. Meantime, his opponent, KI Antony of the Kerala Congress Jose faction was heavily involved, until he tested positive for coronavirus on March 29. Antony is now in quarantine. The Joseph faction has claimed that their rival is facing the "punishment" for allegedly spreading misinformation on PJ Joseph's health when he was in quarantine. "Anyone can get infected anytime and it is a punishment for him (Antony) and his party for spreading messages against PJ Joseph in his bad time," said MJ Jacob, Idukki district president of the Joseph faction. The veteran's party has claimed that their leader skipping a full-time campaign won't hurt their chances. "P J Joseph is a state leader and a popular face and there is no need for him to conduct a full-time campaign," said Jacob, adding that their opponents had told the voters that a by-election might be necessary if Joseph won as he was in ill-health. Jose faction has, however, played down any disadvantage. Jose Palathinal, Idukki district president of the Jose faction told TOI that Antony had almost completed his campaigning before contracting Covid-19. "Now he conducts his poll campaign through virtual meetings and phone calls," said Palathinal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-cong-rivalry-hits-a-covid-hurdle/articleshow/81891074.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The road, which was damaged in the 2018 floods, is yet to be repaired. The incident occurred on Friday. The deceased was identified as Vellayan (46). He leaves behind his wife Vijayalakshmi and sons Manikyan, Solan and daughter Reshmi. This is the third death occurred in the last one year because of delay in reaching the hospital due to poor road connectivity. “Thekkady-Chemmanampathy Road is the main road that connects Parambikulam and Sethumada in Tamil Nadu.

---||Delhi||IIT Delhi works on making EVs part of life||NEW DELHI: From retrofitting cars into electric vehicles (EV) to researching batteries and setting up charging stations on the campus, IIT Delhi is putting its best foot forward in promoting the technology. The institute’s Centre for Automotive Research and Tribology (CART) has also been researching driverless cars for major automobile companies to “make India become totally electric”. IIT Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao said, “Electric will be the future. India has always skipped generations when it comes to technology. A transformation will come from the automobile industry. Apart from the high price of EVs, the unavailability of charging stations is also an issue. These will be solved when NHAI and other agencies set up charging stations along highways. The cost of such cars will go down with the increase in volume. People will eventually see the price advantage of an electric vehicle.” Rao added, “IIT Delhi has taken an active role in academics and research in this regard. We have signed MoUs with many automobile companies and are in the process of connecting with more. At the same time, we are recruiting faculty members. The goal is to research how to reduce charging time. Once that happens, we will research automated vehicles.” BK Panigrahi, the head of CART, said the Centre had a mandate towards promoting research and academic activities related to EVs. “We will be starting an MTech course on electric transportation in July along with a few certificate courses. Our researchers are working on chargers and new battery packs that can substitute the ones present in e-vehicles currently. We are collaborating with auto companies for developing battery technology and research on automated cars,” he added. Recently, IIT set up a 20kW charging station with inbuilt solar photovoltaic interface capability developed by Smart Grid Lab of the department of electrical engineering funded by the Centre’s department of science and technology. Incubated start-ups like “Geliose Mobility” to launch “Hope”, a cost-effective electric scooter with a running cost of around 20 paisa per km, are also being promoted. Hemant Kaushal, project coordinator at IIT Delhi’s Centre of Excellence for Research on Clean Air, said, “We are designing kits for retrofitting cars, but the plan is to develop driverless vehicles. We are working on the reverse logistics of electric batteries. India doesn’t have the infrastructure to dispose of these batteries, which can prove to be a huge challenge. Our researchers are creating models for the disposal of batteries. At the same time, we are looking at a battery-swapping technology so that people need not stand in queues to charge their cars.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iit-delhi-works-on-making-evs-part-of-life/articleshow/81913412.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

Superintendent of police (Dhule) Chinmay Pandit said, “Our teams are working around-the-clock to track down the locations of the suspects involved in the attack on police in Dondaicha town of Shinkheda taluka on Wednesday night and the murder of a man in a group clast an hour later.” “Four teams of Dhule police, who are investigating the case, belong to the local crime branch (LCB). They are getting all technical help to trace the criminals. We are confident they will soon be arrested,” he said. A mob of over 100 people attacked the Dondaicha police station demanding the release of two suspects who were arrested for allegedly molesting a girl. Sensing trouble, police had to fire two rounds, in which two from the mob were injured. Taking advantage of the commotion, the two suspects escaped from the police van in which they were being taken for medical examination. A fresh clash broke out on the rural hospital premises between the mob backing the two suspects and a group demanding their arrest. In that clash, a man lost his life. Apart from the two suspects, the police have identified 17 other suspects, who were involved in the attack on the police station. A murder case is also being investigated, in which three people are wanted, said the Dondaicha police. Pandit said the situation is normal in Dondaicha as they have appealed to citizens to maintain peace and not believe in rumours. “The Dhule police are maintaining vigil on all social media platforms and have warned of strict action if anybody tries to spread rumours concerning the incident,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dhule-police-attack-suspects-still-at-large/articleshow/81889807.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Easing the worries of students amid the upsurge in Covid-19 cases, CBSE issued a circular, signed by controller of examination Sanyam Bharadwaj, stating students who have either themselves tested positive for the virus, or someone in their family is infected need not worry and their practical exams will be held later. “If any candidate is absent in practical because of being Covid positive or any family member i.e., mother, father, brother and sister is reported Covid positive, school will conduct the practical of such candidates at an appropriate time in consultation with the concerned Regional Office, but latest by June 11, 2021,” it said. Regional officer (RO), CBSE, Prayagraj, Shweta Arora said, “The board has informed that while uploading the marks of such candidates ‘C’ may be posted against the name on the link for uploading marks.” The announcement comes at a time when all the CBSE-affiliated schools, including nine Kendriya Vidyalayas, in the district have started the process of holding practical exams even as the number of coronavirus positive cases in the city is rising. Recently, the CBSE had allowed class X and XII students to change their centres for practical and theory exams considering the Covid-19 pandemic and fresh surge in cases. “If any candidate has shifted to some other city/country because of Covid and has requested CBSE to change the practical centre, while uploading the marks of the batch of the candidate, against the name of such candidates ‘T’ may be uploaded/posted on the link for uploading of marks,” the RO added. “The announcement clears the doubts and ambiguity among students and school authorities since Prayagraj has witnessed an upsurge in coronavirus cases,” said principal of KV AFS, Manauri, Shalini Dikshit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cbse-to-reconduct-practical-examsof-covid-hit-class-x-xii-students/articleshow/81890260.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Civil enclave drainage system to be revamped||Prayagraj: The problem of reoccurrence of waterlogging at the civil terminal of Prayagraj at Bamrauli during the rainy season is set to be a thing of the past. To equip the Bamrauli Civil air terminal with a modern drainage system, the state government has sanctioned over Rs 1.48 crore which would be used to get rid of the problem that plagues the area every year during the monsoons. The drainage system once in place would rid the airport of the annual problem of waterlogging during monsoons that often results in pools of water accumulating even in the apron area where the flights are parked, unloaded and reloaded causing trouble in their smooth operation during the rainy season. Deputy secretary Satya Prakash Tiwari in his missive dated March 31 to the director, Civil Aviation, UP has conveyed administrative and financial sanction of Rs 1,42,42,000 for the construction of the drainage system for the Prayagraj airport for which a proposal was duly moved by the airport officials and the district administration. A copy of the missive has also been sent to the divisional commissioner and district magistrate of Prayagraj. Regional Director, Airport Authority of India (AAI), Anchal Prakash expressed his happiness over the sanction of the funds. “The stormwater drainage was causing us problems for the past quite sometime now. The catchment area is higher as compared to the stormwater drain outlet of the airport and as a result, we often faced backflow of the water, especially during heavy rains. This led to waterlogging in the airport apron area, powerhouse and other vital parts causing great inconvenience and hurdles in smooth operations of the flights,” he explained. We had been pursuing the issue with the district administration and the PWD for a reliable solution to the problem, he added. The director said that he now hoped the work to soon begin for the construction of an effective drainage system by PWD on priority. In operation since December 2019, the civil airport terminal enclave, which functions in close coordination of Indian Air Force (IAF) set-up in Bamrauli provides direct air connectivity to several cities from Prayagraj including New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Indore, Kolkata, Pune, Gorakhpur, Bhopal, Bilaspur and Bhubaneshwar. The civil airport enclave is currently built on an area of 6,500 square meters in which all facilities are available for passengers. There are four terminals at the enclave and two aerobridges too. The airport currently can handle 300 passengers at a time and presently on average caters up to 1,200 passengers per day. Plans are also afoot to further expand the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/civil-enclave-drainage-system-to-be-revamped/articleshow/81890282.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||In pollution nightmare, Telangana sits on lakhs of old vehicles||HYDERABAD: At a time when the Centre has announced a new policy for scrapping old and unfit automobiles, it turned out that Telangana is sitting on a huge pile of old vehicles that are unfit to use. As per the data available with the transport department, there are as many as 13 lakh non-transport vehicles that are 20 years old and 2.58 lakh transport vehicles that have crossed 15 years. Apart from adding to the existing vehicle population, environmentalists say that allowing old vehicles, that are over 15 years old, to ply on city roads is a cause for great concern as it will lead to massive rise in pollution levels. “It is true that old vehicles release more pollution when compared to new vehicles. Worldwide, there are a few standards to regulate the output of air pollutants and similarly in India, we have Bharat stage (BS) emission standards. All new vehicles that are compliant with these standards will have the latest technologies and increased fuel efficiency which will automatically reduce the carbon emissions and pollute less,” said professor K Purushotham Reddy, environmentalist and former OU professor. Experts say that old vehicles — be it transport or non-transport — account for only 5 per cent of the total number of vehicles, but contribute 65-70 per cent to pollution. “Black soot, carbon monoxide, benzene, lead and other toxins emitted by vehicles are especially troubling because they are released at the ground level where we breathe the polluted air directly into our lungs. This ground level auto emission pollution can be a grave health concern than toxins emitted high into the sky by industrial chimneys,” said Arun Krishnamurthy, founder, Environmental Foundation of India. The policy, which was recently proposed by the Union government, seeks to phase out unfit vehicles to reduce vehicular pollution, meet climate commitments and improve road safety and fuel efficiency. In Telangana, to dissuade the use of old vehicles, the transport department is currently taking measures by restricting renewal of vehicle registrations and imposing a green tax. “Registration of all educational institutions’ vehicles and transport vehicles above 15 years old are not allowed in the entire state. Apart from this, green tax is collected for all 15-year-old non-transport vehicles and seven-year-old transport vehicles in the state,” said C Ramesh, joint transport commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-pollution-nightmare-state-sits-on-lakhs-of-old-vehicles/articleshow/81891634.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Kochi||Kerala assembly elections 2021: I want tough opponents and strong issues to fight for, says Jacob Thomas||Anti-corruption crusader Jacob Thomas is one of the most familiar faces in Kerala. Having been the vigilance director under both UDF and LDF govts and courted many a controversy, he chose the BJP to launch his second innings in public life. He speaks to TOI on his plans to continue his war against corruption and his aspiring role as a people’s representative. You had launched a survey when your candidature was announced. How did you go about it?It was a socio-economic survey through 4-5 campaign raths going around with MSW students carrying questionnaires. They went around and took the feedback from residents and based on it, we planned our manifesto as well as what Irinjalakuda needs. Why Irinjalakuda?I was given options for a few constituencies, including Chalakudy and Thrissur. But I chose this because I wanted tough opponents and strong issues to fight for. I work best when there is a challenge and competition is tough. This has been a constituency that has given a ruling MLA almost every time, more so in the last 10 years. What is your major charge against the two Fronts here?Unlike in many other places, the MLA here is often from the ruling party. So, when they have their own government in power, why is the constituency like this? It shows a complete lack of will on part of the local representatives to look after their constituency after they have been elected to rule. Your campaign is ‘Change for Irinjalakuda’? What is the change that you are looking to bring in?Drinking water is a major issue. I went to a Harijan colony in Aloor panchayat. For the past eight years, a water tank is ready, pipes have been put but no water supply. There are about 93 Harijan colonies here. In those houses, you will not find any facilities. This is not a question of fund shortage. There are a lot of allocations and funds for SC/ST communities. Even central funds are there, but no proper utilization. Agriculture sector needs a lot of attention. I’m worried about the state of coconut trees and paddy cultivation. To reach Irinjalakuda town or to move out of it, there is only one major junction. It’s a bottleneck all day long. The traffic signal has not been working for ages. This is a small junction, but nothing has been done for ages. People here are very peace-loving and tolerant and they don’t indulge in vandalism. Otherwise, that would have been destroyed by protesters long ago. You mention the cultural heritage of Irinjalakuda in your campaign?The problem is not just that there is no change all these years. But because of no change, what should have been preserved had also vanished. This is a place where there is a lot of cultural heritage and several artists reside here. They are in dire straits now. Their language is their art and with them, goes the knowledge and heritage. We have to give them life security. In Koodalmanikyam temple, there is a building which Shakthan Thampuran used to stay when he came to pray there. Now, it is in a state of utter neglect. I also visited a place which is said to be the home of ancient Indian mathematician Madhavacharya who is said to have discovered the ‘pi’. I want to link all these places as tourist interest points. You have been using social media to reach out to people. How has the experience been, physical campaigning and social media campaigning?Covid restrictions have forced us to look for alternative ways to reach out. But I have had real ly good ground support from RSS and BJP workers. I have been able to reach out to many old families because of them. Also, a lot of NRIs and Malayalis who have worked elsewhere in India, are settled here. This is a highly literate community and hence reaching out through social media has also been comparatively easy. Do you think technology will aid in speedy governance?A lot depends on the will of the government and hence I would say no. Till date, the law, revenue and local self-government departments have not been fully computerized. When we, officials, try to bring in such technology, either we are transferred or the apps that we propose are shelved or shut down. Remember the app that we introduced in the vigilance department for the public to alert us. You have been identified as an ‘anti-corruption’ crusader and both governments and the present CM candidates have punished you with transfers for not falling in line with their requirements? Why is that ace campaigner silent now?I have written three books till now. The first one ‘Sravukalkoppam Neethumbol’ was in 2017. I followed it up as a ‘whistleblower’ book called ‘Avasanathe Sakshi’ and my third book was ‘Enikkuvenda Keralam’. Now, I am not a whistleblower because I am out of government service. But the last book says what each section of the society can wish for Kerala. In my second career, this will be my role the war against corruption will continue and so will the fight for ‘change’. Metroman E Sreedharan and Jacob Thomas are being projected as the professional faces who have joined the BJP. Do you think this will help the party?Of course, it will help the BJP ,which is making political inroads in the state. There is a need for change and I think we will bring it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/i-want-tough-opponents-and-strong-issues-to-fight-for/articleshow/81891093.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The worst hit were parts of Pilerne and Saligao. Some areas had planned shutdowns for pre-monsoon maintenance while others were relieved to have their power supply normalised after 36 hours of intermittent power supply. The electricity department staff attributed the delay to the contractor not informing the department after puncturing the underground cables. “We could have restored supply in the shortest possible time if the contractor had informed us where the cables were punctured. They just put mud on top of the cables,” a department engineer said. “There’s no control over the operators on site and no responsible person present. We can’t be chasing each and every operator on the site. The place is like a war zone,” another electricity department engineer said. The electricity department on Friday learnt that the contractor had in fact damaged both the 33 KV cables at 11 places and not two places, as initially seen on Thursday. The two high-tension cables supply power from Tivim substation to Porvorim, Mapusa, Saligao, Candolim and Anjuna. TOI had reported that the department tried to charge the line on Thursday night they found that the cable was not holding the charge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/punctured-cables-repaired-power-restored-to-bardez/articleshow/81891641.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Online bridge option deals back a much-loved ritual for the elderly||Every afternoon, Manju Agerwala wears her pearls, puts on her favourite lipstick, and sits at her felt-lined bridge table. The three other chairs are empty but her card coterie is present —online—all similarly tiptop in front of computers in their respective homes. Three hours and many tricks later, the 80-year-old is ready to call it a day. The miracle of online bridge has transformed the lives of thousands of players across India—bringing succour to senior citizens who have been endlessly incarcerated at home; enabling competitions to continue as before; and even giving employment to some who lost their jobs but reinvented themselves as online teachers with students across the globe. Before the pandemic turned life into a blurry calendar of socially barren days, especially for the elderly, bridge used to be that regular, happy ritual to look forward to—not just the game, but the accompanying side dishes of tea and friendship. Although the players cannot see one another online, many continue to dress up as if they were going to the club. As Agerwala’s daughter Anisha says, “Just that ritual gives them a sense of normalcy and security. It helps our mother cope better.” A generation of folks who could barely type out a text message suddenly became fluent with their digital devices. They sought help from grandchildren, friends, or neighbours and invited each other on to the free and user-friendly platform, Bridge Base. The result went far beyond the game. Many got over their technophobia and gradually acquired other digital skills—like Sonal Sheth (75) who says she now scrolls the internet for recipes and watches shows on YouTube, or Gulshan Jasdanwala (83) who has figured out online banking to pay her staff. “Bridge is like a big family for us,” says Jasdanwala. “We play every single day and it keeps me so happy because I can spend three hours of my time gainfully using my brain. How much can you read? And I’m not very fond of television.” S Sundareshan, president of the Delhi-based Bridge Federation of India, says chess and bridge are two games that people have been able to pursue despite the lockdown. The federation has successfully conducted all major tournaments, including the summer and winter nationals with over 1,000 participants from across the country, enabled by cameras and other security devices. In fact, some players who were too old or infirm to travel for the competitions have now been able to play. Many are silent kibitzers—the term for those who watch in on someone else’s game. “The camaraderie and accompanying coffee/drinks that go with the game may have been lost, but it’s certainly better than the situation with other games which have completely stopped,” says Sundareshan, adding even after the pandemic, he believes there will be a combination of online with real playing. Poker, rummy, chess, even ludo, are all actively being played online through the pandemic, but bridge players view themselves as the sacred elite who play with clockwork regularity and are willing to dish out handsome sums to learn. Last year, some players started teaching the game online across the world where almost everyone has been locked in. Chennai-based businessman and competitive player Nirmal Jain says his charges per group range from Rs 84,000 (for 16 classes) to Rs 2 lakh for personalised attention. After his travel agency shut last year, Mumbai’s Anal Shah reinvented himself as a full-time online bridge teacher and now regularly teaches up to 20 students at a time. “My approach to teaching bridge is to make you think differently, to be a problem solver...because bridge is all about minimising your mistakes,” says Shah. On any given day, Rajeev and Himani Khandelwal, partners in bridge and in life, can be found in separate rooms of their Mumbai home, looking out at the same frangipani tree, while playing a tournament on the Real Bridge online platform. “Many who didn’t know how to pass their time have got a life thanks to online bridge,” says Khandelwal, whose team won India a bronze in the 2018 Asian Games. “In a city like Mumbai, given worsening traffic, even after things are back to normal, online bridge is here to stay.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/online-bridge-option-deals-back-a-much-loved-ritual-for-the-elderly/articleshow/81890693.cms||Namita Devidayal

Vijay Dhamal, the senior PI of the Mumbai Naka police station, said five of the eight injured people have suffered severe burns — five of them were critical. All the victims have been admitted to the Nashik civil hospital. The incident took place at 11.15 am in the Igatpuri chawl of the Wadala Naka. Dhamal said the incident took place due to gas leakage. A member of Sayyad Liyakat Rahim’s family was replacing an empty LPG cylinder with a full one when the leakage took place and started the blaze. Neighbours immediately rushed to help and took the injured people to the Nashik civil hospital. Dhamal said the house in which the incident took place was on the ground floor of a building. The Shingada Talav fire brigade centre got a call at 11.15 pm. In a matter of a few minutes, fire tenders reached the incident spot to quell the fire. It took about an hour to douse the fire, said the officials of the fire brigade department. Though the area is densely populated, the fire was limited to only one house.Various household items were damaged in the fire. The injured have been identified as Sayyad Liyakat Rahim (32), Sayyad Nusrad Rahim (25), Ramjan Ansari (22), Sharif Attar (53), Nasrin Sayyad (25), Sayyad Sharfoddin Sayyad (49) and Muskan Ansari (21).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/8-suffer-severe-burns-in-gas-leak-fire/articleshow/81889826.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai Metro to go manual during signal issue||CHENNAI: In early March, a metro train which was to reach CMBT from the airport via Alandur took the wrong track and continued to proceed towards Guindy. This did not just cause undue delay, but also created panic among passengers in the train.  To ensure it doesn’t happen again, CMRL is rewriting its signalling software to remove certain automatic features that run in case of signal interruptions, and instead allow train operators to manually control trains while switching between corridors. A metro rail official said the incident where the train proceeded in the wrong route was due to a momentary communication interruption between automatic train scheduling system and interlocking system, which will allow the train to automatically shift between two corridors through a loop line. Interlocking systems prevent trains from conflicting movements in major junctions and crossovers where there are multiple tracks. Since there was a communication loss, an inbuilt safety feature in the signalling software called automatic route calling was activated which directed the train to take the same corridor instead of using the loop line to switch to another corridor. Normally, during an inter-corridor service, a train from airport metro will take the loop line as it nears Alandur station before taking a diversion to proceed towards Ekkattuthangal. Officials said this process happens automatically through the signalling system. “The automatic route calling is an inbuilt safety feature to direct the train on the same corridor and not take any diversion on loop lines during signal interruptions. Since people fear this to be unsafe, we have asked Siemens, who made our signalling software to rewrite our software and remove this feature, so our train operators will look at the signal and operate manually between corridors when needed,” a senior metro rail official said. “Removing this feature may cause delay in train operations when manually switching, but the decision was made to alleviate any fear among the public. This feature is there in most metros, but we don’t come across such issues because majority of metros do not operate inter-corridor services,” the official said. There were also delays in the arrival of trains at many stations a few days after train services were launched on the 9km phase-1 extension line from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar.  Engineers found that a portion of the ‘automatic train scheduling software’, which enables metro trains to automatically run according to daily schedule, was missing. Routes for the trains to operate were set manually causing glitches and delays. “There was also a mismatch in information in the software that led to the emergency brakes getting applied automatically in two or three spots along our routes. So we operated trains manually with basic signalling software. We updated the software and fixed the glitch,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/metro-to-go-manual-during-signal-issue/articleshow/81892054.cms||U Tejonmayam
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu polls 2021: MNM candidate crowdfunds ‘zero budget’ campaign||CHENNAI: In a novel method of electioneering, Makkal Needhi Maiam’s Siva Elango has appealed to voters to donate whatever they can for his ‘zero budget’ campaign. The seasoned RTI activist with Satta Panchayat Iyakkam (SPI), who is contesting from Tambaram – Elango’s long-time friend and SPI co-founder Senthil Arumugam is contesting from Pallavaram – on Saturday said contesting for public office with public money would make the candidate concerned more responsible. Elango said he was able to obtain from friends and well-wishers seed money of Rs 3 lakh that he used in the initial days and that he got another Rs 3 lakh after his appeal. On Friday, Elango put out a video on his social networking pages. “I appeal to members of the public to share how much they can to help us fight against those who spend in crores. Those who are not in a situation to donate can help us by providing their time and help us in our campaign. The greatest barrier stopping activists from venturing into politics is money power and people should consider helping,” he said. Expressing confidence that meeting election campaign expenses with public money is the first step towards rooting out corruption, the 44-year-old said he was gratified by the response in the places he campaigned and pointed out that he had covered more areas in Tambaram constituency than his rival candidates. Over the last three days, Elango said, he focused on reaching out digitally to the voters in his constituency and appealed for donations. He said he was the first among the candidates from Tambaram constituency to meet Residents’ Welfare Associations in Chitlapakkam when they organized a ‘know your candidate’ event and answered the various queries posed by the voters. “Candidates from Dravidian parties who end up spending in crores and become legislators only aim to recover the crores they spent. This is the first step towards them looting public money. Public too, who in several places receive cash for votes are not in a moral position to question their elected representatives,” said an MNM functionary who is part of Elango’s campaign. The party’s zero budget campaign is transparent and every rupee has been accounted for, he added. As per Elango’s nomination papers, he has Rs 50,000 in cash and bank deposits and movable assets worth Rs 50 lakh, including that of his wife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/mnm-candidate-crowdfunds-zero-budget-campaign/articleshow/81892032.cms||Srikkanth D

During the investigation, the Malegaon taluka police had arrested the three people identified as Khushal Mokal, Ritik Rajput and Avinash Mane, all residents of Dhule, on March 14. The police recovered Rs 8.49 lakh of the looted amount from them, said police inspector Devidas Dhumne. On December 5, Sunil Chaudhary, the trader, and his friend were going towards Chalisgaon in Jalgaon district from Malegaon on a bike, when three people on a bike intercepted them near Sayane village and started beating up Chaudhary and his friend. After pinning the trader to the ground and brandishing a firearm, the trio snatched the bag containing Rs 20 from the trader and escaped the scene. Chaudhary collected cotton produced from farmers in his village and surrounding areas, and sold it to traders in various parts of the state and country. On the day when he was robbed, Chaudhary had received the payment of the cotton he had sold. Superintendent of police Sachin Patil of the Nashik Rural police in his visit to Malegaon on Friday returned the money recovered to the trader after completing all the legal formalities and taking permission from the court. The trio is currently in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/police-return-rs-8-5l-to-trader-robbed-of-rs-20l/articleshow/81889831.cms||---

However, his colleague Ram Kumar, 35, a resident of Khagaria, is yet to be freed. Both Kumar and his senior colleague were kidnapped by ULFA-I from a drilling site at Changlang in Arunachal Pradesh on December 21. Kumar's wife Bina Kumari, who was hopeful after hearing the news of Gogoi's release in the morning, was left distraught after being informed by the Khagaria district administration that they have no information on her husband's release. "I was initially informed by the company that both of them have were released," Bina told TOI over the phone. But her hopes were dashed when the Khagaria administration couldn't confirm it. “I got to know that the man from Assam (Gogoi) has reached home but there was no update on my husband. So I contacted the company staff again, and they told me that it might take three to four days more for Kumar to be freed,” she added. The Changlang police brought back Gogoi (51) from Longvi village near the Indo-Myanmar border around 2 pm on Saturday. He has reached home safely. “Gogoi was found at Longvi village, about 120km from the district headquarters. After medical examination and completion of legal formalities, he was handed over to his family. However, there is no information on the other abducted employee,” Changlang police chief Mihin Gambo told TOI over the phone. As per Kumar’s wife, the militants had demanded Rs 20 crore as a ransom for their safe release. Khagaria DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh told this newspaper that there is no official communication to the district administration on Kumar’s release yet. “I also got to know that the one hailing from Assam has reached home. I contacted the Changlang DM today. He also said he had information only about Gogoi’s release. He had no information on Kumar,” Ghosh said. The DM said unless the authorities in Arunachal confirm Kumar’s release, no official statement could be released from here. On January 20, the insurgents had released a video of Kumar in which he could be seen reading a script and urging CM Nitish Kumar to talk with his Assam counterpart to get him freed from captivity. The Bihar government swung into action for his release. Later, insurgents also aired a message that Kumar might become the first casualty of the kidnapping if their demands were not met.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/khagaria-man-awaits-release-as-ulfa-i-frees-assam-colleague/articleshow/81890702.cms||Debashish Karmakar

He also submitted that he had cardiac issues. His lawyers told the court that following the stroke, he was taken to JJ Hospital, administered medicine and then sent back. The submissions came after Waze’s defence moved a plea before the court on Thursday seeking medical consultation for Waze, submitting that he had two 90 percent blockages in his heart. The prosecution, however, submitted that Waze has undergone blood tests, ECGs and 2D Echo while in custody and everything seemed normal. They also said Waze had submitted medical reports from 2019, in which the doctor had recommended a bypass surgery. The prosecution raised questions on why he had waited until now. The defence, in turn, asked, “Are you going to wait until he dies?” It said Waze should be seen by a cardiologist and an angiography done. The court has directed the NIA to ensure that his medical tests are conducted and find out if he needs to undergo any procedure. The plea will be heard on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-tells-court-he-suffered-a-stroke-while-in-nia-custody/articleshow/81891654.cms||---

Parulekar said the institute also proposes to train officials of the electricity department, an offer which the power minister agreed to actively consider. “We have to change a lot of things and I think we will have to send our officers here for personalised training, where their mindset can change including IAS officers, senior scale or junior scale officers. As minister, I am trying to change the system,” Cabral said. He said already under one officer trained at the GIM, the electricity department has set up an online system which helps analyse the power requirement and purchase additional power required for Goa within 15 minutes. “I hope in my tenure we can make Goa entirely a consumer of renewable sources of energy. We may not produce it here, but we can bring it from elsewhere and get power from renewable sources 24X7. There are a lot of things in the pipeline, but we will have to send our bureaucracy for training at GIM, so everyone falls in line,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gim-offers-to-analyse-states-power-data-train-officers/articleshow/81891662.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Worried residents already in ‘lockdown mode’, RWAs crafting their own set of rules for outsiders||DEHRADUN: The surge in Covid-19 cases has once again forced the resident welfare associations (RWAs) in Dehradun to take lockdown-like measures. The residential societies have prepared guidelines to limit the movement of outsiders and are contemplating banning the entry of house-helps again. HS Chadha, a resident of Silver Rock Residency in Dalanwala area, said, “We are insisting on everyone coming inside the apartment sanitising themselves while masks have been kept at the entry gate. If the situation turns for worse, we might limit the entry only for the residents.” Mahesh Bhandari, president of Doon residents' welfare front, said, “I have appealed to all the RWAs to take utmost care to contain the spread of the virus. The RWAs have imposed certain restrictions which include sanitisation of all the domestic helps, visitors etc.” On being asked about the rumours of a possible lockdown, Ashish Kumar Srivastava, DM Dehradun, said that no such orders have been issued and anyone found spreading fake news will be booked. Notably, the state, till Saturday, had nine containment zones. Meanwhile, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat has expressed concern over the rising cases of Covid-19.

---||Nashik||Manjarpada scheme to be completed by May: Bhujbal||Nashik: The ambitious Manjarpada water diversion scheme will be completed by May 2021 and will provide water to the Chandwad and Yeola taluka during this year’s monsoon, said district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal. Bhujbal, who visited Manjarpada (Devsane) –1 in the Dindori taluka along with MLA Narhari Zhirwal and water resources department officials said there would be better water supply to the two perennially parched talukas of Chandwad and Yeola this year. “About 87% of the work is complete and the rest will wrap up by May. Almost 75 metre of the Manjarpada dam’s 90-metre height has been achieved. The remaining construction will be completed in few days,” Bhujbal said. He added that inter-basin water diversion through river-linking holds potential to not only solve Nashik’s water problem, but also the problems of the Marathwada region. The Manjarpada water diversion scheme is about tapping the water flowing westwards from the Sahyadri hills in Peth and Surgana talukas of Nashik district towards the Arabian Sea through the Par river in Par basin by construction of dams and diverting the same to the eastern side of the hills — into the Godavari basin. The scheme includes construction of dams, tunnels, canals and diverting water by gravitational flow to the Punegaon dam in Kalwan taluka, which will provide water to the two parched talukas in Nashik district. According to Bhujbal, water supply to the parched talukas will provide better agriculture opportunities to the farmers there. This scheme was concieved by Bhujbal when he was the guardian minister during the UPA government tenure. However, the work got stuck when the BJP-led government took over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/manjarpada-scheme-to-be-completed-by-may-bhujbal/articleshow/81889840.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The incident took place late on Friday when the village pradhan and his son with others barged into the house of the shopkeeper in Turtipur Ehla village under Nakhasa police station and started misbehaving with the family. According to the complainant, he and his son had been reminding the accused to make payment of the dues for long, but the accused did not pay any heed and attacked, instead, on being asked to pay the due amount. Police said that the duo have been accused of not paying around Rs 40,000 for the articles they had purchased on pretext of paying it at a later date. The injured shopkeeper and his son have been admitted to the district hospital and a case is registered under various IPC sections. Nakhasa police station SHO, Sambhal, Dharam Pal said, “Based on the complaint, an FIR has been registered against village pradhan Rizwan, his son Hilaal and two others under sections 452 (house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the IPC.” “The injured have been admitted to the district hospital and are being administered treatment.

Seeking to put a solution in place for the decades-old traffic problem on the narrow stretch, GHMC is all set to inaugurate the new four-lane Road Under Bridge (RuB) parallel to the existing RuB, in addition to a box drain — a ‘smart’ water drain system — near the Hitec City MMTS station on April 5. The project, which was approved by the state government with a cost of Rs 59.09 crore, will facilitate the smooth flow of traffic at Hitec City station and reduce traffic congestion between Hitec City and Kukatpally areas. “With the existing bridge here being too narrow, there is a lot of congestion, especially during office hours. The new road will definitely help solve that problem,” said G Varun, an IT employee. While railways executed the RuB works, GHMC took up construction of approach road earthworks, retaining wall and RCC box drain works. During monsoon, rainwater floods the passage under the old bridge, causing serious threat to the commuters taking that route. GHMC authorities informed that in Serilingampally and Kukatpally zones, nearly 13 km road network has been recarpeted and lane marking has been completed covering over 16 km. “This project is on the corridor from Gachibowli to JNTU which has been earmarked as one of the top priorities under Comprehensive Traffic Study report. This RuB will ease the traffic movement by resolving one of the major bottlenecks in this corridor,” said V Mamatha, GHMC zonal commissioner, Kukatpally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-four-lane-rub-to-solve-traffic-congestion-at-hitec-city/articleshow/81891665.cms||Moulika.KV

A letter written to the joint secretary of ministry of defence by SA Murugesan, secretary, department of disaster management and rehabilitation, Uttarakhand, on Saturday, said, “The rainfall during the winter season of 2020-21 has been much less than normal and ensuing low humidity has resulted in forest fire incidences across the state...the fire incidences have started to affect human habitations and this is a cause of concern for the government. Based upon the current trend, as also prevailing and projected weather conditions, the situation is expected to worsen in the coming fortnight.” #Uttarakhand govt asks defence ministry for choppers to control forest fires in hills Read more:… https://t.co/3FL5N8V0v3— TOI Cities (@TOICitiesNews) 1617511138000The letter goes on to add, “In view of the prevailing situation, you are requested to immediately provide 2 helicopters with necessary equipment to douse the forest fire. Of these, one could operate from around Tehri reservoir on Bhagirathi river/GVK reservoir on Alaknanda river while the other could operate from Bhimtal/Naukuchiatal.” The forest fires are a result of 80% lesser rains the state received than usual, leaving the entire forest floor dry, and leading officials to anticipate a rerun of the 2016 situation when IAF helicopters had to be deployed as 4,538 hectares of forest area was turned into ashes in wildfires causing loss worth Rs 46.29 lakh. Meanwhile, head of forest force Rajeev Bhartari has cancelled leaves of all forest staff for the next two months. He has also designated 10 senior IFS officers for 10 hill districts to review the wildfire situation at least five times a week. Uttarakhand DGP Ashok Kumar on Saturday also said that action will be taken against those found involved in setting fire in and around forests under section 435 and 436 of the Indian Penal Code. Notably, in 983 fire incidents this year, over 1,291 hectare forests have been gutted and six human lives were lost, which resulted in loss of Rs 38.29 lakh. The state has lost 735.22 ha forest in Garhwal region followed by 531.01 ha in Kumaon and 24.9 ha of wildlife administration. Pauri district recorded loss of 338 ha (231 incidents) of forest cover followed by Almora 163.75 ha (92 incidents), Pithoragarh 153.5 ha (94 incidents), Bageshwar 128.92 ha (94 incidents) and Dehradun 92.95 ha. In Uttarakhand, 0.17% forest cover comes under extremely fire-prone area, 1.60% is under very highly fire-prone, 9.32% under very highly moderately fire-prone, 21.66% highly moderately fire-prone and 67.25% in less fire-prone categories.

The Punjab chief minister had recently issued a statement declaring that the state’s rate of tests per million was higher than the national average. Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said the Mohali district has the highest Covid-19 testing rate per million in the state as the testing is leading from the front and the same has been ramped up through concerted efforts of the district administration. He said, “According to the data, Mohali is conducting 1,700 tests per million, while Punjab is conducting 1,086 tests per million and the country is conducting 747 tests per million. At present, the district is tracing at least 19 contacts (highest in the state) per positive case.” Dayalan said apart from this, the district also carried another milestone and has the highest contact tracing of positive cases in the state. He stated that despite having the most number of active cases in the state, the district has been maintaining one of the lowest fatality rate i.e. 0.9% through dedicated efforts of the healthcare workers. He also reiterated that the district has seen 1.39% decline in the positivity rate from 21.42% last week to 20.02% this week. The district has increased its level II and level III bed capacities at the government and private hospitals for critical patients. At present, there are 379 beds, of which, 272 are already occupied and 107 are vacant. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, in a recent statement, said the state’s rate of tests per million was higher than the national average and claimed that the situation would have been better if the central government had not “delayed” the vaccination process. “Had the central government acceded to the state’s request for allowing vaccination of all above 50 years of age earlier, instead of delaying it by almost two months, the situation would have been better than the present,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohalis-testing-rate/mn-higher-than-national-average/articleshow/81890291.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The JERC order reads, “The commission has taken a serious view of the fact that the petitioner (UT electricity department) is yet to ensure full compliance. The petitioner is directed to ensure that faulty meters are replaced on time in accordance with the Supply Code Regulations, 2018.” Earlier, the UT electricity department in its reply had submitted, “The replacement of defective or non-functional meters is a continuous process. However, every effort is being made to ensure that faulty meters are replaced on priority. At present, very few electromechanical meters exist, and the same shall be replaced shortly. The UT electricity department submits quarterly report on the status of meters to the commission regularly.” A senior UT official said the UT electricity department has already started work on smart grid project. In the first phase, the department has allotted the work to a firm for replacing 30,000 existing power meters into smart meters at sectors 29, 31, 47, 48, Industrial Area Phases I and II, and Faida, Ram Darbar, Hallo Majra, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra and Daria villages. The work is likely to be completed soon. For the project, the power department will also setup a control room at Sector 18, from where they will keep a tab on all consumers, said the official. The JERC, in its latest order, had also reduced power tariff by 9.58% and ordered to stop recovery of fuel and power purchase cost adjustment (FPPCA) from April 1. The JERC order said, “The petitioner had a standalone revenue surplus in each year from 2016-17 to 2019-20. The projected standalone surplus for 2021-22 and cumulative revenue surplus till 2021-22 at existing tariff is expected to be Rs 98.21 crore and Rs 345.61 crore even after discontinuing the regulatory surcharge from May 2019 and the FPPCA from June 2020. The commission approves a reduction in the retail tariff for existing categories which works out to be 9.58%. Even after a reduction in average tariff, the projected standalone revenue surplus at the end of 2021-22 is expected to be Rs 8.12 crore.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ensure-faulty-power-meters-are-replaced-on-time-jerc/articleshow/81890289.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The Pune commissioner of police (CP) also assured that no action would be taken against the caregivers taking care of the elderly people, and bed-ridden and ailing patients if they were caught travelling after 6pm.

There will be no public gathering till April end, except for funerals and marriages with restrictions. Maximum 50 people in a funeral and 250 in a marriage will be allowed. The restrictions will come into effect from Monday. The decision was taken by the crisis management committee (CMC) following instructions from CM Nitish Kumar at a review meeting on Covid-19 on Saturday to explore the possibility of closure of schools and colleges in view of the surge in new cases of coronavirus in the state. In case of examinations scheduled, the schools and colleges will have to strictly follow the Covid protocols. The CM had also asked the CMC to put restrictions on public events for some time and create more awareness among the people. Nitish further instructed the officials to increase the number of tests, especially RT-PCR, and also increase the Covid-19 vaccination along with keeping hospitals ready with all facilities. After the CM’s meeting, the home department issued a letter to all the district magistrates and SPs, asking them to ensure that Covid-19 protocols are followed at religious places, shopping malls, hotels, restaurants and other public places. They have to ensure sufficient number of cops to check gatherings at vegetable markets, eateries, bus stands and railway stations. It had also asked the transport department to ensure that not more than 50% people travel in a public transport till April 15. Principal secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit told TOI that apart from closure of schools, colleges and coaching institutes till April 11, there will be staggered timing in government offices and restriction on visitors at such places.

The 254-km-long march, starting from Sunday, will be completed in 13 days, said the protestors. Charan Singh Negi, a protestor, told TOI, “The state government is not paying any heed to our demand. Instead of widening the 19-km-long road, the government has just issued an order to complete the patch work in a 5-km stretch. Therefore, we will now take out a foot march till Dehradun to draw the government’s attention towards our demand.” Another protestor Laxman Singh Rana said, “We will intensify the stir if the state government doesn’t accept our demand. The number of protestors has been kept low in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases.” A few months ago, the locals of 70 gram panchayats of Chamoli had formed a 19-km-long human chain demanding the widening of Nandprayag-Ghat road. Later, on January 26, the villagers had taken out a protest march holding the tricolour in their hands. Several women of the region carried out a march with black flags on the International Women's Day to push the demand for road-widening.

---||Delhi||Covid-19: Eight-fold rise in home isolation in a month in Delhi||NEW DELHI: In just a month, the number of people in home isolation in Delhi has risen dramatically due to the resurgence of Covid-19 infection. On March 2, there were only 777 infected people isolated in their homes, but on April 3, the number had gone up to 6,569. This represents more than 50% of the city’s total active Covid patients. A health department official said that the fourth Covid wave had so far proved less serious in the sense that fewer infected people have required hospitalisation and most are recovering efficiently in their homes. The death rate is also lower now than in the previous waves. “Home isolation management has been very effective in Delhi. Soon after the pandemic reached the city, the results of home isolation were not certain and people had doubts about its effectiveness,” the official added. “But after a few months, patients and their relatives were keen on treatment at home. During the third wave, recovery in home isolation was over 99%.” A Covid patient is asked to stay in home isolation after the local health authorities assess his or her eligibility through criteria such as presence of a separate room with washroom at home, an identified caregiver and the absence of comorbid medical conditions. Delhi government has hired a private agency to manage home patients, who get daily calls from a representative to note vitals like oxygen saturation levels. Those showing signs of deterioration in their condition are recommended to seek hospitalisation. Home patients are given medicines as prescribed by the doctors during the recovery period. They can end their home stay after 17 days of the onset of symptoms and if they have no fever. Meanwhile, as on March 26 when there were 5,446 active cases in Delhi, South district had the largest number of infected individuals at 902, followed by North-West at 844. South-East and South-West were in the third and fourth positions. In the last eight days, the active cases have jumped to 12,647. Health minister Satyendar Jain said on Saturday that Delhi would stem the surge like it did the previous waves if Covid-appropriate behaviour was strictly followed. He added, “We are prepared for a further rise in cases. We have already ramped up the bed capacity in city hospitals by 25%, which will be further increased by 40%, 50% and 60% if the need arises. The current occupancy of beds kept aside for Covid patients in hospitals is below 50%.” The minister said that the during the current resurgence, the trend showed more Covid cases in the upper-middle and middle-class localities.  “It is difficult to pinpoint the reason for this, but it is believed that the densely populated and economically lower-class areas, such as slum cluster, have already faced widespread infection in the previous Covid waves,” Jain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/8-fold-rise-in-home-isolation-in-a-month/articleshow/81890885.cms||AlokKNMishra

In the FIR, Pathan stated that accused Lala intercepted his bike while he was returning home at about 10:30pm on Friday and demanded his money. back. Pathan told him that he will repay soon, but Lala allegedly gave him Rs 100 asking him to buy petrol for Rs 90, bidi and a match box and to later meet him near a clinic on Bhavnagar road. In his statement to the police, Pathan alleged that when he reached the designated spot, Mahipat took the fuel from him and started sprinkling on his body before Lala set him afire. “My clothes started burning and I started running on the road asking for help. Somebody called 108 ambulance which took me to Palitana government hospital,” the victim stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/19-year-old-borrower-set-ablaze-by-two-loan-sharks-dies-of-burns/articleshow/81890054.cms||---

Among those averted are some of the national-level controversial issues such as Laldhang-Chillarkhal and removal of an official, Dipti Singh, from the post of secretary of the labour board who was deployed by former CM. The forest minister has appointed Madhu Chauhan to the post of secretary. He also revoked the suspension order of 38 contractual workers of the labour board. In addition, the forest minister has brazenly gone ahead with the construction of Laldhang-Chillarkhal road for which clearances were still awaited and got funds to the tune of Rs 1 crore released for its construction. He also got Rs 20 crore funds for a super speciality hospital in his constituency, Kotdwar, which had been turned down by Trivendra Rawat a few months ago. Justifying his actions, the forest minister said, “My decisions are focused on helping the people since they have elected us to deliver their work. All these decisions are meant to promote development in our state and giving employment to people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/forest-minister-also-reverses-trivendra-singh-rawats-decisions/articleshow/81890334.cms||Shivani Azad

The Pauri district authorities detected the anomaly in the distribution of MNREGA funds in Pokhari village. Besides, people who were not working were shown to have been provided money and in some instances, a man was also shown working at two places simultaneously. Two local residents had approached the district panchayati raj department with their complaints about wrongdoings in the distribution of funds under MNREGA. The department in its probe found that a person, who had died six years back, was shown working in the records and Rs 1,740 was being paid to him monthly. Another man was showing working at two places simultaneously whereas yet another was paid twice for a single day’s work. Similarly, a homeguard was also shown as working as prt of the project. District panchayati raj Officer M M Khan told TOI, “After wrongdoings were found by the departmental team, Pauri district magistrate has written to the former village pradhan of the area and given him 15 days’ time to reply.” Khan said that in such cases, the recoveries are made from the concerned village head, who was responsible for the payment at the time wrongdoings were reported. “Such instances of anomalies in fund distribution have been reported in the past too. We probed these cases and got the recovery done. In three such cases, we have recovered Rs 10 lakh in the last few months,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/man-dead-for-six-years-still-being-given-mnrega-funds/articleshow/81890338.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Standard I to VIII students to be promoted without exam||PUNE: Students of Std I to VIII of the state board will be promoted to the next class, said state education minister Varsha Gaikwad in a video message uploaded on social media on Saturday. However, the Maharashtra State Primary Teachers Association has sought clarification on how to grade students even if they are to be promoted. Gaikwad said, “While no offline classes were held for students in classes till Std IV, we had started offline classes from Std V onwards for a short period, barring in a few cities. As per Right to Education Act, 2009, continuous and comprehensive evaluation should be done to assess students, but this was not possible due to lack of enough offline classes. Looking at the Covid-19 situation, we have decided to promote all students till Std VIII to the next level. A decision on Std IX and XI will be taken soon.” Vivek Kombe, general secretary of Maharashtra State Primary Teachers Association said that guidelines should be issued on how the students are to be assessed. “The students till Std VIII are given grades based on their performance. The state should issue guidelines on how to go about it, as it may hamper the students’ chances to apply for various schemes and examinations.” While the state education minister has stated that the decision regarding holding examinations for students of Std IX and XI will be taken soon, Gaikwad did not share any updates about the upcoming board exams. The current decision has been taken considering the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases across Maharashtra. In late March, Gaikwad had announced a number of concessions for students during the upcoming Std X, XII written and practical board exams in April-May 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/std-i-to-viii-students-to-be-promoted-without-exam/articleshow/81890734.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Delhi||Food queues to online classes: Slum kids pen lockdown tales||NEW DELHI: Amid news of rising Covid-19 cases, Mohammad Gufran is busy studying for his Class X pre-board exams in a small room that he calls home in a resettlement colony in northeast Delhi’s Sunder Nagri. He dreads the very thought of a fresh lockdown as it brings back suffocating memories of being confined in a room with his entire family — parents and three older siblings. A 20-sq-metre dwelling is all that they have and when the door is closed at night some have to take refuge on a patch of the roof since there isn’t enough space for all in the room. Gufran vividly describes how social distancing in that room at the peak of the pandemic in March-April last year was an impossible task. When his sisters developed a cough, the family members had no space to spare for quarantining themselves and chose to sit in corners of the same room. His father, who makes a living by selling daily-need household items, would measure the distance between the members and assign corners to each. Gufran is one of the 42 children, from resettlement colonies and slums in areas like LNJP Colony, Dakshinpuri, Sunder Nagri, Khichripur and Sawda Ghevra in Delhi, whose experiences of the lockdown and the months thereafter are now part of a book called “Baalbiti” put together by voluntary organisation Ankur Society for Alternatives In Education. Prabhat Kumar Jha who is steering this programme at Ankur described the storytelling exercise by children in their own words as an attempt to record the lived experiences of children in different phases of the lockdown starting from the end of March last year. “Baalbiti” brings alive a range of issues from challenges faced in taking online classes in the absence of a smartphone or network to the emotional impact of waiting in long queues for food every day at the peak of lockdown. TOI spoke to Anup Haldar, a resident of Sawda Ghevra. His “Line Mein Lagey Log (People in the Queue)” is a hard-hitting narrative that while for most, queues of the hungry may be a reminder of the lockdown, it is a reminder of the daily struggles in slums for him. “Ever since this resettlement colony has come up, we have seen residents jostling in queues for one reason or the other. The pandemic yet again brought back the queues to our life. First it was for food during the lockdown, and now for the morning bus as social distancing means only a fixed number of people will be allowed in,” he added. The impact of school closure is most evident in an emotional letter by Kajal, also a resident of Sawda Ghevra. She weaves a conversation to express how deeply she missed life with her classmates in the pre-lockdown era. Fifteen-year-old Roshni Khatoon from Dakshinpuri gives a vivid description through her stories “Homework” and “Online Classes” of the difficulties they faced while struggling with tardy network connections. Many didn’t even have a smartphone. “With school resuming classes for classes X and XII, I started going to school from January, and it was a big relief. However, for my friend who could not attend online classes, it is a much bigger problem as her mother has now made her join tuition classes. I hope she is able to cope up,” Khatoon added. Children also narrate stories of hope with games like ludo becoming all important during lockdown. There is also a story about the wedding of dolls organised by children while restricted to their homes and a heartwarming story of how an illiterate father learnt the alphabet from his son while trying to bond with the family during lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/food-queues-to-online-classes-slum-kids-pen-lockdown-tales/articleshow/81890896.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Delhi||Delhi: All non-ventilator ICU beds taken in 24 private and 1 govt hospitals||NEW DELHI: There are no ICU beds (without a ventilator) available in at least 24 top private hospitals and one state-run hospital in Delhi. This includes Apollo, Fortis (Vasant Kunj, Shalimar Bagh and Okhla), Max (Shalimar Bagh), Sir Ganga Ram hospital and Manipal hospital. Across the capital, real-time data on availability of Covid beds shows there are a total 6,014 beds. Of them, 2,495 (41%) are occupied. The total number of ICU beds without a ventilator and with a ventilator is 1,293 and 791, respectively. Of them, at 8.30pm on Saturday, 519 (40%) ICU beds without a ventilator and 382 (48%) ICU beds with a ventilator were occupied. Hospitals say the crisis has unfolded in the last two weeks, as the city witnessed a massive spike in new cases on a daily basis. In February first week, Delhi was reporting barely 130-140 cases daily. It has gone up to over 3,000 now. On Saturday, the city recorded more than 3,500 new cases for the second consecutive day with 3,567 more persons testing positive for Covid-19. The total tally of cases has crossed 6.72 lakh. Ten fresh fatalities have taken the death toll to 11,060 — fourth highest in the country after Maharashtra (55,377), Tamil Nadu (12,764) and Karnataka (12,610). “In mid-March, we had only five to six Covid-19 patients in the whole hospital. Today, this number has increased ten-fold. We do not have a single Covid ICU bed available, with or without a ventilator,” Dr Y K Misra, the chief of clinical services at Manipal hospital, Dwarka said. Misra added that one of the reasons for the sudden surge in demand for ICU beds is delayed admission of patients. “When the first wave of Covid-19 struck, people were scared. They would rush to hospital even if someone had mild symptoms. But now, people aren’t so fearful and most of them wait at home until the symptoms turn severe or there is a complication. This has led to increased demand for ICU beds,” Dr Misra said. He added that their hospital was expanding the infrastructure to accommodate more patients in the coming days. Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonology, at Apollo hospital said they are increasing Covid beds daily in view of the increased rush. “People have become absolutely careless about following Covid-appropriate behavior, which has led to fast spread of the disease. Also, inquiry from patients reveal that nearly 50% to 60% of them have attended functions like birthday parties or marriages where they got infected,” he said. Another doctor at VIMHANS Nayati super-specialty said if the current trend of daily rise in cases holds for another few weeks, health infrastructure may get overwhelmed. The positivity rate of Covid-19 has gone up to 4.4%. It stood at around one percent in March second week. “Many people feel that the infection doesn’t cause severe symptoms in the young. I have got a 24-year-old who is in ICU due to severe symptoms caused by the disease,” a doctor at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital said. Dr Randeep Guleria, the director of AIIMS, told TOI recently that people have developed a fatigue to the continuing pandemic and currently, the young are more affected and the severity of symptoms among them is lesser. “However, we must realise that eventually the young may spread the infected to the elderly people who are at high risk to develop complications and die due to the disease,” Dr Guleria added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-non-ventilator-icu-beds-taken-in-24-private-and-1-govt-hospitals/articleshow/81890904.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Chandigarh||Obesity a lifestyle disease, not linked to military service: AFT||CHANDIGARH: The Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) has upheld the decision of Army authorities that obesity caused due to excessive intake of saturated fats and sedentary lifestyle is not attributable to or aggravated by military service. The division bench, comprising Justice Umesh Chandra Srivastava, judicial member and Vice Admiral Abhay Raghunath Karve, administrative member of AFT’s Lucknow bench, has passed these orders while dismissing the petition by a retired colonel for increased disability pension on the grounds of disabilities "Impaired Glucose Tolerance" and ‟Dyslipidemia". The officer was commissioned into the Army in December 1982 and superannuated in March 2016 in low medical category P2 (permanent). In its order the tribunal has held, "We also take note that applicant was obese since March 2003 and the other three disabilities are a result of first disability i.e. ‘obesity’, which has no relation to military service. In medical literature, it is a risk factor for metabolic disorders and leads to serious health hazards for individuals. Obesity is a lifestyle disability and it can be cured by regular exercise and restricting dietary habits. The release medical board (RMB) has opined that IGT, Dyslipidemia and obesity are neither attributable to nor aggravated by military service. We, therefore, go by the RMB and hold that these disabilities have no connection with military service." The retired colonel had stated in his plea was that he was commissioned in the Army in medically and physically fit condition. His counsel pleaded that applicant be held entitled to disability element for other disabilities too in terms of para 423 (c) of Pension Regulations for the Army, according to which disability arising during service should either be attributable to or aggravated by military service. It was further contended that since the disabilities in question have arisen during military service, therefore all disabilities should be aggravated by military service as they occurred at the fag-end of applicant's service. The military authorities, however, contended that "dyslipidemia" and "impaired glucose tolerance" are metabolic disorders which are caused due to excessive intake of saturated fats and sedentary lifestyle, and have no relation with military service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/obesity-a-lifestyle-disease-not-linked-to-military-service-aft/articleshow/81890732.cms||Ajay Sura

---||Delhi||Delhi: Got the jab? Your bill at eatery may be less||Just as restaurants were seeing a semblance of revival and build-up of consumer confidence to dine out, rising Covid cases and news impending lockdowns have started impacting business. But unlike last year, when they didn’t know what hit them, restaurateur Rohit Aggarwal of Lite Bite Foods says they are tougher and more resilient. He says the only way forward for the industry is to promote vaccination. Having taken the first shot of the vaccine himself, Aggarwal says, rather than be depressed and anxious, they need to encourage people to get vaccinated. His brands, Punjab Grill and You Mee, have introduced a 10% discount for those having taken their first shot and 20% discount to those with a second shot. Rather than offering discounts on food apps, Aggarwal feels this will attract more people to take the jab and to his restaurants as well. And, his friends and patrons who got vaccinated with him, actually showed up to avail the offer. From Amit Bagga (co-founder of Daryaganj) offering a complimentary kulfi to diners at any of his four outlets to Akshay Anand (co-founder of Ophelia) offering first drink for free at his lounge, restaurateurs are not only promoting vaccination but also using deals and discounts around Covid vaccination to attract consumers to their outlets. Priyank Sukhija, founder of First Fiddle Restaurants that owns brands like Diablo, Plum by Bent Chair, Lord of the Drinks and Dragonfly, says that vaccination is the first step towards protection from the virus. To celebrate the ‘immune feeling’, he is offering a 15% discount to all the people who have got vaccinated at all his properties. Manish Sharma of Molecule and Viet:nom too asserts that vaccination is really important to keep everyone and people around them safe. With the permission to vaccinate everyone above 45 seeing an encouraging response, Sharma is offering 10% discount at Molecule and complimentary welcome drink at Viet:nom for those who have been administered their first dose of vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/got-the-jab-your-bill-at-eatery-may-be-less/articleshow/81890913.cms||Amin Ali

Officials said that 11 streets have been announced as containment zones so far and the number is only set to increase. Earlier, a street was considered as a containment zone only when cases were reported from three different houses in the same street. Now, a containment zone is established if there are three confirmed cases, even if they are from the same house. However, houses are not being barricaded. Sixth street in Deputy Collector Colony in KK Nagar is the first containment zone in Madurai after the cases started to surge for the second time. Meenakshi Amman Nagar in Surya Nagar (eight cases), Harini Street in Duraisamy Nagar and Nylon Nagar in Pasumalai (seven each), VOC 1st Street in Tahsildar Nagar (five), Vairam Vasantham Apartment in Sampakulam (four), Sambandar Street, Misty Apartment in front of Velammal MedicalCollege, Ranganayaki Amma Street in Kamarajar Salai, Indira Salai in Thirupalai and Pallavi Nagar 3rd Street in Anaiyur (3 each) have been declared as containment zones. A corporation official said that barricading of the containment areas is yet to take place as officials are busy with the election work. However, other precautionary measures such as disinfection of public places, door-to-door enumeration of fever cases and distribution of kabasura decoction has started. But, movement of people has not been restricted so far. While less than 30 cases a day were reported in Madurai city in the last few weeks, cases started surging since April 1. A corporation health official blamed the people for gathering without taking preventive measures. “Most of the positive cases are now being reported after people started taking part in festivals, functions and election rallies,” he said. He assured the movement of people from containment areas will be restricted soon. However, there is a lack of clarity on allowing outsiders into those areas, especially with the election campaign still on. There is also no clarity on whether people from containment areas can be allowed to come out and cast their votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/containment-zones-back-in-madurai-11-streets-named/articleshow/81891166.cms||V Devanathan

Sanjay Shinde, additional commissioner of police (west region), told TOI, “The sensitisation drive was launched to make people aware of the new restrictions, such as 6pm to 6am bar on travel, no dine-in at restaurants, closure of bars, ban on weekly markets and assembly of more than four people even during day time for seven days in Pune.” Shinde said they have intensified patrolling throughout the day, started check posts, nakabandi and fixed points for enforcing the new restrictions from 6pm. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) [Zone V] Namrata Patil said, “All police stations have held series of meetings with business establishments and housing societies, apprising them of the new restrictions. We have appealed to the establishments to co-operate with the district administration to contain the spread of Covid19 virus for 15 days, even though they are opposed to the restrictions.” Patil said, “We are making good use of the public address system to inform people that they should not venture out after 6pm owing to the gravity of the situation. We are also taking assistance of special police officers in this regard.” “People who intentionally violate the restrictions will have to pay fine of Rs 1,000 or a case relating to disobedience under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code will be filed against them. Those not wearing face mask will have to pay fine of Rs500,” she added. DCP (zone II) Sagar Patil said, “We have briefed policemen on the restrictions on Saturday and instructed them not to harass or misbehave with people and take a humane approach while handling the situation on the road.” “We visited restaurants, hotels, shops, cinema halls and malls for the purpose of creating awareness. We have started three check posts per police stations for keeping an eye on motorists travelling after 6pm. We have ensured that essential services are not disrupted,” he said. Ramnath Pokale, additional commissioner, Pimpri Chinchwad police said, “There are information technology hubs at Hinjewadi and Talawade and several MIDC areas. Large number of people work here. We have exempted employees working in night shifts from travelling, but they will have to furnish identity cards whenever demanded by the police.” Pokale said, “We have important pilgrimage centres in places like Dehu and Alandi villages. We have written letters to the concerned authorities to close the temples and ensure that devotees perform religious ceremonies and rituals at their residence for the time being.” “We have intensified patrolling and appealed to people to follow Covid-19 norms. Permission has been given for essential services,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-launch-drive-to-sensitise-people-on-need-to-follow-norms-of-personal-safety-and-social-distancing/articleshow/81890742.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Pune||MPSC aspirants resent closure rule for mess||Pune: Those preparing for state and central governments’ competitive examinations are in the soup as their study rooms (abhyasikas) and mess services now close at 6pm. The students stay on ‘cot-basis’ accommodation and there is very little space to move around. Most students subscribe to study rooms, where they spend their entire day from 7am till 10pm studying. For their meals, they choose a mess service located close to the study rooms. However, with strict curbs being implemented in the city, they have no place to study after 6pm and they have to figure out a way to get their dinner from the mess to their rooms. Pune is a hub of competitive examination coaching institutes and students from across Maharashtra, especially rural Vidarbha and Marathwada, come to the city for coaching. The Maharashtra Public Service Commission Students Rights Group has written to the city mayor urging him to exempt study rooms and mess from the new restrictions as they have an examination on April 11. Mahesh Bade, member of the MPSC Students Rights Group, said, “We are in touch with the mayor requesting him to keep the mess exclusively for students as well as study rooms open at 50% capacity. The exams are upon us and students have spent years preparing for these exams. Hence, such situations put a lot of stress on them because their preparation gets affected by a lack of resources.” Hemant Dede, an MPSC aspirant from Ahmednagar stays at Parvati but travels to Shastri Road to study. “The study room operator has said he will close at 6pm. I have opted for a mess near the study room and now they have stopped sit-in service and we have no place to take the parcel and eat. Even if we take the parcel at 5.30 pm, the food will get cold. The entire process has become very stressful. Many students have started to leave. The government should make an exception for us. It is a question of our future,” said Dede. Mangesh Jadhav, who runs a study room, shared that he had faced huge losses during the lockdown, but the situation was slowly improving until the new restrictions were announced. “I had 102 students in March at the study room. Today, I am down to 20 students because they cannot study with so many restrictions. They are very stressed out by the government’s decision because their studies will be affected. It is sad to see students, especially poor students from rural areas, packing their bags and leave because they are stressed and not getting the right atmosphere to study,” said Jadhav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mpsc-aspirants-resent-closure-rule-for-mess/articleshow/81890738.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Unable to attend online classes, Class X girl hangs self in Akola||PUNE: A Standard X student committed suicide in Akola district on March 30 because she was allegedly unable to attend online classes in the absence of a cellphone. Belonging to an economically disadvantaged family, Payal Gawai hanged herself inside her home on the evening of March 30. Her family members were sitting outside then. Payal is survived by her parents, two elder sisters and a younger brother. Aditi Shirsath, one of the sisters of Payal, said the latter was under tremendous stress over lack of preparation for the upcoming examination because of her inability to attend the online classes.  “Payal was a good student. For a long time, she did not even have books because we could not afford them. She was aware of our financial condition and never said anything that would put further burden on my father. Probably that is why she never insisted on a cellphone.” Aditi said, “When the school had reopened, she was happy and going to school. But as examinations started approaching, she had no way to access any lectures or links given online. She had told the family members that she was not at all prepared for the examination and she did not know what to do. She always said she wantedto join the police when she grew up,” said Aditi. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad told TOI that a toll-free helpline number for students was in the pipeline and it could be announced in a day or two. “We shall be instructing all teachers in the state to reach out to each student and make them aware of these numbers,” said Gaikwad. “My first appeal to students is that they need to understand that no examination is more important than their life. I know this is an important year (for board exam students)) and everybody expects a lot from them, but nothing is more precious than life. Second, we have already provided numbers of trained counsellors appointed by the State Council of Education Research and Training from every district to the students.” The investigating officer from Dabki Road police station, Farhatullah Syed, said, “Aditi’s father works in a shop and earns about Rs6,000 per month. Preliminary investigation revealed that they had no cellphone at home with which she could study. Her board examinations were also coming up and she was unprepared for the exam as she had not attended the online classes. We are still investigating the matter.” Last year in September, a 15-year-old girl had committed suicide in Satara district because of lack of a smartphone to attend her school’s online classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/unable-to-attend-online-classes-class-x-girl-hangs-self-in-akola/articleshow/81890737.cms||Ardhra Nair

The letter adds that the trains can be stopped at Roorkee, Laksar and Jwalapur and the passengers can be asked to deboard there and then proceed towards ghats so that there is no congestion in the core mela area. The officials have also requested the state government to not let any train come to Motichur, Raiwala, Rishikesh and Dehradun between April 11 and April 15. Mela officer Deepak Rawat told TOI, “We have written a letter to the government to stop all the trains at Jwalapur railway station. This will help in crowd management during bathing festivals. Similarly, we have asked the Railways to ensure that all Haridwar-bound passengers have the negative RT-PCR test report.” When TOI approached railways officials, they denied receiving any formal intimation on these lines. However, they added that they would be meeting Mela officials on Monday to discuss this proposition. Rekha Sharma, senior divisional commercial manager (DCM) of Moradabad, told TOI, “We have made special preparations for the Kumbh Mela but rearranging everything now would be difficult.” (With inputs from MS Nawaz)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/halt-trains-before-haridwar-during-shahi-snans-say-mela-officials/articleshow/81890374.cms||Sukanta Mukherjee

The group members have alleged that the fruit-bearing trees were cut by Uttarakhand Forest Development Corporation (UAFDC) personnel even though they could not present proof of any permission for the same. Talking to TOI, Ram Kapoor from Citizens for Clean and Green Ambiance said, “We have filed a written complaint to the officers concerned on the cutting of trees. We have also filed an RTI seeking information on how many trees have been cut since 2020 with valid permission. It is unfortunate that in many other cases the trees were cut illegally and the forest department failed to take adequate steps to prevent the practice.” Meanwhile, Dehradun DFO Rajiv Dhiman told TOI, “The trees have been removed to facilitate the work of underpass which had valid approvals. The officials at IMA will shift 34 such trees inside their campus while the ones which couldn’t be moved had to be cut.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/environmental-activists-oppose-cutting-down-of-mango-trees-near-ima/articleshow/81890372.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Pune||Traffic cops to study black spots in Pune to reduce accidents||PUNE: The traffic police have again decided to study black spots in the city to avert accidents and road fatalities after 2019. The exercise was not carried out in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2019, the police had identified as many as 23 black spots in the Pune, where five or more accidents had taken place. Majority of the accidents took place on Katraj – Dehu Road bypass, followed by areas in Hadapsar, Sahakarnagar and others. As many as 209 persons had died in such accidents in 2019, while the number of fatalities came down to 143 in 2020. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame said, “We will analyse the data collected in 2020 and map the accidents. The stretches of roads, particular spots, junctions or any other place where repeated accidents have taken place will be identified.” He said, “Some non–government organisations have decided to study the accident spots along with the police and data will be shared with them.” Shrirame said, “The exercise of identifying the black spots is must. It provides an insight into required infrastructural work or road signage at accident-prone spots. Changes such as installation of speed breakers, blinkers or signals are usually considered. Various steps can be undertaken to reduce the speed of vehicles.” Shrirame said “In 2019 we had identified as many as 23 accident-prone spots, where more than five mishaps had taken place. Some spots like Vaiduwadi in Hadapsar had witnessed 16 accidents, while 12 took place at a point near New Katraj Tunnel. The busy Katraj chowk witnessed as many as 28 accidents,” he said. “Accidents that did not result in death but where people sustained serious injuries are also considered,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traffic-cops-to-study-black-spots-to-reduce-accidents/articleshow/81890743.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Reply to my posers on gold, dollar smuggling: Amit Shah to Kerala CM||KOZHIKODE: Union home minister Amit Shah said that the chief minister was getting angry when asked questions, and challenged him to answer his questions before the elections. He said that Rahul Gandhi came to Wayanad as a tourist and that people should not expect any development from him. Shah added that the state was trapped in corruption, political violence and appeasement politics. Shah was speaking at Sultan Bathery in Wayanad as part of his campaigning in the state. Later, he held a roadshow in Kozhikode in the evening. “When I ask questions to Vijayanji, he becomes angry…Vijayanji, you are the chief minister. If not you, then whom else should I ask questions. I am again asking him questions on dollar scam and gold scam. I keep asking these questions because he has not given the answers yet,” said Shah. Shah repeated the questions he had raised during his last visit. “I want to tell Vijayanji, If you have any shame left, then respond to these questions to the people of Kerala before the elections,” he said. Shah said that he has never seen a tourist politician like Gandhi. “Wayanad is also the constituency of ‘Rahul baba’. He represented Amethi for 15 years and it’s condition remained poor. Then, he came to Wayanad from Amethi. So, people of Wayanad, he has come here as a tourist and no development is going to happen in Wayanad,” Shah said. He said that the Prime Minister has envisaged a vision for Kerala which can be summed up in the acronym FAST. “F stands for fisheries and fertilisers, A for agriculture and ayurveda, S for skill development and social empowerment and T for tourism and technology. These things can become the foundation for the state’s development,” he said. LDF and UDF took turns in governance and starved the state of development, despite Kerala being the most literate state, Shah said. “Both the parties in Kerala should merge and start a new party, Comrade-Congress party. There is no difference between them other than the ‘U’ and ‘L’ in their corresponding names. In place of dollar scam, there would be Solar scam. In place of using lathis against god Ayyappa devotees, lathis would fall on the devotees of god Padmanabha. If CPM has SDPI, then Congress has Muslim league. Gold scam happened under the leadership of Pinarayi Vijayan and if Congress comes in their place, they will make the Solar scam person the chief minister,” Shah added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/reply-to-my-posers-on-gold-dollar-smuggling-shah-to-cm/articleshow/81890753.cms||---

In a press conference held in Almora on Saturday, Jagtar Singh Bajwa, spokesperson of the United Kisan Morcha, said, “The farmers of the country have been demonstrating against the three draconian farm laws for months now but the government is least bothered and is only trying to project our movement in a negative light. We are fighting for the cause of the farmers and they are working for the interests of corporate houses.” The farmers’ leader added, “The new laws allow big businesses to stock essential commodities. As a consequence, the private players will buy cheap from farmers and sell the produce at high prices. Thus, saving APMCs is crucial even from the consumers’ point of view. However, the government intends to abolish state-run mandis and bring in private ones.” He further said that the government should also assure the farmers of the MSP (minimum support price) provision in writing. The farmers’ body also released a leaflet on the day highlighting the “vices” of the three farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-intends-to-abolish-apmc-mandis-united-kisan-morcha/articleshow/81890380.cms||---

The farmers of the Terai region claim that their standing wheat crop, spread over about 30 acres of land, was gutted in forest fires in Bhudakisani and Daah Dhaki villages of Khatima town in Udham Singh Nagar on Thursday. They added that they suffered a loss of over Rs 12 lakh as a result. The affected farmers have demanded immediate compensation. In Bhudakisani village, villagers were able to douse the blaze before the firefighters reached the spot. Subsequently, officials from the local administration took stock of the situation. However, they have not yet been able to ascertain what triggered the wildfire. Meanwhile, in Almora, 22 incidents of wildfires were recorded in two days — Friday and Saturday. The total loss of forest cover due to the blazes on Saturday was not estimated till the time of filing this report but the district lost 21 hectares to wildfires on Friday. The incidents have also affected the standing paddy crop in the district, officials said. Priyanka Singh, chief agriculture officer, Almora, said, “The lack of rain spell is the major cause behind the spurt in these incidents. This has also led to a drought-like situation in the district. About 10-15% of paddy crops in the district has gone bad.” In a similar vein, Dr JK Bisht, Vivekananda Parvatiya Krishi Anusandhan Sansthan, Almora, said, “The crops have dried up due to lack of rain spells in February and March. There is no respite in sight in the coming days as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/farmers-facing-major-losses-due-to-wildfires-in-ukhand-ripe-wheat-crop-in-over-30-acres-gutted/articleshow/81890379.cms||Aakash Ahuja

Traffic congestion was mainly reported from Golibar Maidan chowk and Khanya Maruti chowk in Camp, Sarasbaugh, Swargate, Rajaram bridge, Dandekar bridge, Sinhagad Road, Ahmednagar Road and Peth areas. Few motorists were found plying on Laxmi Road, F C Road, J M Road, LBS Road, Kumthekar Road and Tilak Road, where most business establishments had downed shutters before the 6pm deadline. “There were no major complaints of traffic jams. The congestions reported at chowks and signal crossings were minor. The traffic police control room did not receive a single call relating to congestion,” said Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (traffic). Shrirame said, “Anticipating traffic congestion on the first day of the restriction, police officers and those in subordinate rank were out on the road in large numbers for manning important chowks and signals. A large number of people suddenly came out on the road to reach home. The situation created minor congestion and we decongested traffic by 7.30pm.” Banker Shekhar Jagtap said, “I rushed out of my office in Baner at 5.30pm in order to reach my home at Sahakarnagar. I thought that police would not allow me to travel on road. However, I got stuck in the traffic on Senpati Bapat Road. Finally, I reached home at 7pm but police did not stop or question me on the way.” Florist Shirish Vairage said, “I pulled down the shutter of my flower shop by 5.45 pm. The images of last year’s lockdown are still fresh in my memory and I wanted to avoid canning by policemen. Thus, I drove fast from Shivaji Road and reached Swargate. However, I got stuck in traffic jam for almost 20 minutes and reached my home on Sinhagad Road at 6.45 pm. Thank God, the police did not take any drastic action against me this time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/haste-to-reach-home-by-6pm-throws-traffic-out-of-gear/articleshow/81890752.cms||Gitesh Shelke

But it has led to a major rift in the politically influential Upadhyaya family in the district with the former cabinet minister, Ramveer Upadhyaya, accusing his younger brother of “betrayal” by deciding to field his wife against her “jethani’. BJP’s official nominee, Ritu Upadhyaya, from ward 14 will be facing a challenge from her sister-in-law and former MP from Fatehpur Sikri, Seema Upadhyaya. The latter is contesting as an independent candidate in the panchayat polls. While Seema is the wife of former cabinet minister Ramveer Upadhyaya, Ritu is wife of former MLC and MLA Mukul Upadhyaya. After filing nomination papers on Saturday, Seema Upadhyaya, said she is getting full support from the public and will certainly win the election. Seema had been the zila panchayat adhyaksh twice in 2000 and 2005 before successfully contesting the parliamentary elections from Fatehpur Sikri in 2009 on a BSP ticket against Congress’s Raj Babbar. Earlier in the day, Mukul Upadhyaya reached his brother’s house to meet him after learning that his sister-in-law is also contesting elections as an independent candidate. However, Ramveer Upadhyaya scolded him and called him “gaddar” (traitor). Mukul tried to convince him that he wasn’t aware about his sister-in-law contesting the election and said he had always been faithful to his older brother and is not a traitor. This is not the first time when a dispute has arisen between these two brothers due to poll contests. In 2018, when Mukul was expelled from BSP for anti-party activities, he had blamed his elder brother, Ramveer, for his exit. He had then accused his brother of being jealous of his political success.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/panchayat-polls-rift-in-family-as-bahus-face-each-other-in-hathras/articleshow/81890383.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Madurai||After ‘all pass’, confusion still reigns over group for Class XI||Madurai: As schools are yet to get guidelines from the school education department on awarding marks for Class X students who have been declared all pass, confusion prevails for both parents and teachers over allocating groups for Class XI. “Usually groups are allotted based on board exam scores. Now with no board exams or any other exams such as quarterly or half-yearly exams properly conducted, there is confusion over allotting groups. For example, slow learners may get into the science groups now, which are tougher, and they may struggle or fail later when they face Class XII board exams,” said a Class XII physics teacher. Parents and students are also facing a dilemma since they are unsure of what groups may be more suited. “Depending on how well students score in various subjects, parents and teachers can guide students to choose their groups keeping in mind their ambitions in life. But, this time, it is all muddled as only online classes are not enough to assess students. Choosing groups is more than just based on likes and dislikes of children,” said R Lakshmi, a parent. While at least private schools have held online exams, in case of government schools, Class X students have given only an assessment exam to test their knowledge gained through learning at home. Meanwhile, some private schools are also looking to hold entrance exams for allotting groups for students. However, school heads said that there needs to be guidelines if such exams are going to be held as well. “As of now, there are talks of considering the marks scored by the Class X students in Class IX in quarterly and half-yearly exams as basis for awarding marks. But, it is yet to be finalised. This would be fairer for students than holding entrance exams since there might be malpractices in giving seats, especially in private schools,” said M Arumugam, state president, Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/after-all-pass-confusion-still-reigns-over-group-for-class-xi/articleshow/81891179.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Range officer Neelam Barthwal said that the forest officials had rushed to the spot and tried to douse the fire. According to villagers, the fire started in the afternoon and soon it reached the village. While the fire brigade and a few forest officials rushed to the rescue, the steep slope and narrow road became a hindrance for the fire vehicle to reach the spot. “As the fire brigade could not reach the spot, villagers got together and tried to stop the fire from damaging the village further by creating a fire line ahead of the raging fire,” said Sandeep Khanna, a resident of Bhediyana village in Tehri Garhwal district. Villagers said that around four large farms, where wheat crop was almost ripe, were damaged while three cowsheds were also razed to the ground. “We are lucky that we were able to prevent the fire from reaching the village otherwise the damage would have been much more,” Khanna added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/fire-near-kempty-falls-reaches-village-fields-destroys-animal-shelters/articleshow/81890398.cms||Anmol Jain

I am sure that his politics has not changed. On one side, we have Mr Gandhi jumping into the ocean, looking for new political fish. On the other, we have the Left government with the deep-sea fishing scam,” said Irani. She said that the Left is with China and Rahul with America, and only BJP was with India and Kerala. “Only BJP stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the people during testing times. When the international border was getting sealed, BJP brought 11 lakh Keralites back from the Gulf. BJP gave free ration to the people for eight months during the times of trouble,” said Irani. She said that people should vote for BJP and against the politics of violence. “I congratulate Surendranji. It is not easy to fight in such a battlefield where our workers were getting murdered for years. Now the time has come. We are making the government in Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Now in Kerala too, we are going to come to power. So, the people should go to the polling booths and press the button next to the lotus symbol,” she added. Sitharaman lashes out at KadakampallyBJP leader and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday lashed out at the LDF government and said the minister Kadakampally Surendran will not be able to wash off even after seven births the sins he committed by unleashing violence on Sabarimala devotees. “There is no value in confessions of the minister now saying that it was wrong to have lathicharged Sabarimala devotees, because the CPM secretary has already made it clear that it was only Surendran’s position. LDF believes that it was right to have lathicharged the Sabarimala devotees. Surendran is supposed to be the minister in charge of protecting the temples, and the interests of the devotees. But he led the attack on the devotees,” Sitharaman said, while addressing the election meeting of NDA candidate in Kunnamkulam. She alleged that Kerala has become the state with the highest level of borrowing in the country. “The borrowed money was going into the pockets of party leaders and their dependents. The LDF rule has become synonymous with breach of promises and corruption,” Sitharaman alleged. She also made a scathing attack on Congress-led UDF government. “UDF and LDF are united for corruption, looting and appeasement. Between them, they had an understanding that they would rule the state alternatively with a five-year break. They are in alliance in Bengal and are engaged in match-fixing here. This must change,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/rahul-came-to-kerala-to-save-himself-smriti-irani/articleshow/81890759.cms||---

Besides this, he promised to ensure jobs for 10,000 youths by concucting job fairs every year in June. In all, 15,000 women in the constituency will get jobs by establishing industries. The minister also promised to launch a greening project for Viralimalai where every family will be given a sapling and those carefully raising it will be given a prize. He had already announced creation of jallikattu maintenance centre for training bull tamers and bulls on 10 acres of land. While voters have welcomed the minister’s announcements, they are also asking why the schemes were announced towards the end of the campaign.Minister Vijayabaskar has been facing a tough challenge from DMK’s M Palaniappan who he had trounced twice, but the latter has been seeking one last chance from the voters to help serve them. Palaniappan had become emotional on many occasions during his campaign and how he desperately wanted to win the election. Even on Friday, he was seen fighting tears in a video seeking a last chance from the people. Though Vijayabaskar has been countering this emotional outreach, there are apprehensions in his camp that the voters may fall for Palaniappan’s ‘tactics’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/3-days-before-poll-vijayabaskar-rolls-out-more-mega-promises/articleshow/81891693.cms||Sampath Kumar

The kingpin and his five accomplices have been arrested. Cops have seized over 2.8kg gold and other valuables and tools collectively, worth Rs1.07 crore. Unidentified thieves had sneaked into BoM Temurda on March 19 night. They used gas-cutter to remove the window before laying hands on cash of Rs 6.88 lakh and 93.100 gram gold, collectively worth Rs11.35 lakh, kept in the safe. The case was handed over to LCB in-charge Balasaheb Khade who sent two separate teams under the API Jitendra Bobade and PSI Sandeep Kapade after the thieves. SP Arvind Salve claimed that the investigators got some clues from CCTV footages though they were destroyed by the thieves. “The cyber cell played key role in investigations. Major breakthrough came after analyzing the modus operandi of the thieves,” he said. “Soon it came to fore that similar thefts had occurred at banks in Telangana as well as in neighbouring Bhandara and Gondia districts in a month’s time. A similar theft had taken place at a bank in Madheli in Warora tehsil in 2013. Some accused were arrested from different states. Investigations had then revealed the involvement of a gang from Kakar village in Badayu district of Uttar Pradesh and some local criminals,” said Salve. LCB teams first rounded up Devidas Kapgate and Raju Varbhe from Girola Heti village in Gondia and Sanket Uke from Padoli here. According to the SP, they confessed to their involvement in the bank theft with the help of Kakar gang, The car used in the theft belonged to Varbhe. A team of nine LCB cops led by API Bobade and PSI Kapde was sent to Badayu to catch kingpin Nawab-ul-Hasan, who as per an intelligence input was going to meet his accomplice Danveer alias Gastu in Hasanpur. Four teams were deployed on Hasanpur-Aalapur road. “When intercepted by cops, the duo got into a scuffle with them. Bobade and Kapde were injured but police team managed to arrest them. All the five accused in have been remanded in police custody up to April 8,” said SP Salve. According to Salve, the same gang had earlier tried to break into BoM Temurda branch in 2019. He claimed that they have so far discovered the involvement of the gang in five cases in Bhandara, three in Gondia, one in Telangana, apart from one failed attempt and another successful theft at Temurda bank. Cops have recovered 120 gold jewellery items worth Rs 1.01 crore along with tools, cutters, acetylene cylinder and the car used in the theft. Four accused from Badayu district in UP are at large.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lcb-busts-interstate-gang-involved-in-11-bank-thefts/articleshow/81889552.cms||Mazhar Ali

They have also announced to boycott the ensuing assembly election since Trichy Corporation has not relocated the STP.The STP was proposed as part of the underground drainage (UGD) project at a cost of Rs 53 crore sanctioned under the AMRUT scheme. The facility is touted to treat the sewage water collected through the UGD project being established in five peripheral wards falling under the Thiruverumbur assembly segment. “STP will harm our agriculture land situated nearby,” S Vijayakumar, a farmer said. The farmer said they are cultivating paddy, sugarcane and black gram crops close to the STP site. “So far, no political party has approached us. Any party or candidate that assures us to shift the STP away from our locality will get our support,” he added. The proposed STP has the capacity to process 37 million litres of wastewater per day (MLD). The retreated water shall be discharged into the Uyyakondan canal located 3km from the site. While the civic body claims that the STP is safe and will not harm the environment, locals continue to push for the relocation of the facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/black-flag-protest-against-sewage-plant/articleshow/81891697.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bandra & Goregaon worst hit, cases multiply in 7 days||MUMBAI: Civic wards which include parts of Bandra, Goregaon and Chembur have recorded the highest growth in Covid cases over the past seven days.  H-West Ward, which comprises Bandra, Khar and Santacruz, has been the worst hit. A message being circulated among the residents of the Pali Hill locality in Bandra, which has reported more than 100 cases in the recent surge, said last year, from the time the lockdown was imposed in March till October, it had just eight cases. Both H-West and P-South (Goregaon) wards have reported a 2% growth rate over the past seven days, and M-West (Chembur) 1.86%. The growth rate of these three wards is higher than the average rate of 1.46% in the city. In case of H-West Ward, civic corporators said they have been getting around 400-500 cases a day, the majority of which are from housing societies and only a fraction from the slum pockets. The BMC commissioner I S Chahal said on an average 95% cases are from buildings. Corporator Asif Zakeria said, “Daily cases are unmanageable and one cannot blame the civic machinery that has to deal with these. It is getting difficult to get beds for mildly symptomatic patients. But what if the person’s condition deteriorates further? While the BMC says beds would be allotted through ward war rooms, the war rooms take 2-3 days to contact patients at times and, in the meantime, hospitals deny patients beds if they approach them directly.” Meanwhile, in Pali Hill, a society recently outsourced its housekeeping after the staffers got infected. Madhu Poplai, secretary, Pali Hill Residents Association, confirmed the increase in cases in the locality. “It is high time some restrictions are put out by the government itself, which people will be forced to follow. We have made a set of protocols too, including a member of the society committee must be delegated responsibilities and duties to ensure that precautionary measures for Covid-19 are followed in the respective building. No outsiders should be allowed and essentials are to be allowed only till the gate and the respective flat owner should then pick them up. No one must be allowed in the building without masks and a penalty of Rs 1,000 imposed for not wearing one.” Meanwhile, the Goregaon ward is reporting 300-plus cases daily since the past five days, said officials. BJP corporator Srikala Pillai, whose ward largely comprises slums such as Bhagat Singh Nagar 1 and 2, Laxmi Nagar and Indira Nagar said these pockets have reported barely any cases and most have been from buildings. “Covid is infecting families as a whole and therefore this rise in numbers. People also need to be more conscious as earlier we had seen our ward report a maximum of 180-190 cases, which have now shot up,” she said. In M-West Ward of Chembur, officials said sometimes quarantined citizens do not cooperate with civic staff. “When civic staff call them up, at times they do not share the symptoms as they fear longer quarantine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bandra-goregaon-worst-hit-cases-multiply-in-7-days/articleshow/81890761.cms||Richa Pinto

The civic administration would intensify monitoring at the micro-containment zones with many patients opting for home isolation, a Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said. Around 115 buildings and 117 housing societies have been marked as micro-containment zones across the city. A civic official said the number of the microcontainment zones has been steadily increasing since March. The civic administration is deploying more staffers, who will seek feedback from the patients and also visit the containment zones. “People are flouting the Covid safety norms despite repeated appeals. We are contemplating the idea of admitting Covid-19 patients to institutional isolation facilities if they are found flouting the home isolation norms. The administration is ramping up the isolation facilities across all wards,” a senior official said. The PMC has planned to provide at least 5,000 beds at the Covid care centres. Four more centres were started last week. “Fifteen centres are expected to become functional in the next few days,” the official added. PMC’s assistant health chief, Sanjeev Wavre, said, “Guidelines for the Covid-19 patients in home quarantine are displayed on the PMC website. Our war rooms are activated at every ward office to guide the patients. The patients should not step out before completion of the quarantine period even if their symptoms reduce.” Another civic official said, “During the Covid-19 outbreak last year, a large number of micro-containment zones was marked in the densely populated areas and slums. This time, more cases have been detected in housing societies and buildings.” Sambhaji Khot, an officer from PMC’s Sinhagad Road ward office, said, “Citizens call us claiming that Covid-19 patients are stepping out of their homes before completing the quarantine period. We send our teams to check the situation in such cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/micro-containment-zones-in-pmc-limits-up-to-268-from-206-in-a-week/articleshow/81890757.cms||Sarang Dastane

The famous venues for street meetings and gatherings in the city witnessed a dull season for the first time with political parties and candidates preferring mobile and door-to-door campaigns over street meetings.‘Therumunai Koottam’ (street gathering) as it is called has been an effective way of canvassing the public. There are about five most prominent street meeting locations in Trichy that have witnessed leaders speak on current affairs. Panchavaranswami Koil street, Sarukkuparai and Koonibazaar that usually witness street meetings were not utilised in this campaign. “Apart from the short duration, restrictions from the election commission was another reason for the poor show of street campaigns. Now, the authorities have insisted that the application come from the candidate themselves,” said K Suresh, CPI functionary. Previously, alliance parties on their own were applying and holding street campaigns. The candidates in the fray are now making use of open vehicles.Throwing their weight behind face-to-face interactions, the candidates are visiting all the wards in the corporation to strike a chord with voters. This election is probably the first time that G Corner ground, that had seen even prime minister Narendra Modi campaign, went completely unutilized. Thennur Uzhavar Sandhai ground is another major ground that had seen former chief ministers’ campaigns went unutilized. “There was not much demand for street campaigns this time, we were getting applications mostly for mobile campaigns,” a police official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/a-poll-season-sans-street-meets/articleshow/81891695.cms||Deepak Karthik

The surge in infection has raised questions about decentralising the crowded markets similar to last year.Trichy Corporation sources said that 123 samples were collected from vendors in the uzhavar sandhai on Thursday of which seven were found positive. The vendors hail from Somarasanpettai, Kuzhumani, Kalnayakkan street in Woraiyur. “Many of the cases were asymptomatic. We have collected around 15 samples from the family members and neighbours,” a corporation official said. The civic body has temporarily closed five shops of the vendors who tested positive. Earlier this week, five vendors in the Gandhi market tested positive in a mass screening. As vegetable markets are becoming hotspots, the civic body has intensified testing in fish and meat markets too. Around 161 samples were lifted from the fish market in Kasivilangi.“The spread of Covid-19 is being overshadowed by the assembly election. Authorities should decentralise the vegetable markets to prevent overcrowding,” V Kathiresan, a resident of Woraiyur said. “We are working to prevent the formation of clusters, that is why commercial spaces such as markets are focussed. For now, we have not discussed shifting markets,” a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/testing-intensified-in-trichy-markets-as-7-test-covid-ve/articleshow/81891694.cms||Deepak Karthik

The veterinary doctor and wildlife expert confirmed that the Sambar sustained serious injuries due to a crocodile bite and not a crude bomb as alleged by green activists. Daulat Singh Shaktawat, former assistant conservator of forests (ACF) said, “The tongue of the Sambar is intact, which is not possible if the animal had eaten a crude bomb. I have clicked similar pictures where a Sambar was injured in same manner after a crocodile attack.” Experts further said the face would have been blown off in a zig-zag manner if the animal had eaten the crude bomb. An official said, “Currently, waterbodies in Bakola region is full with crocodiles. Unlike spotted deer, Sambar enter inside the shallow area to drink water. This is the time crocodile attack these animals. ”Forest officials claimed planting a country-made bomb deep inside the forest will not be a useful practice for villagers. Sources in the forest said the Sambar was released in Khilchipur region of the forest after treatment. However, possibilities of survival is difficult as jaw is completely broken and it will not be able to eat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sambar-hurt-in-crocodile-attack-not-by-crude-bomb-say-experts/articleshow/81890762.cms||---

The district magistrate has ordered a probe into the matter. A city-based private doctor and a junior doctor of SN Medical College also tested positive after taking the jab. Health department officials said that new strains of the virus may be the reason behind the infection. The farmer, identified as Phool Singh, belongs to Gari Ajeeta village under Khandoli block of Agra district. He received the first dose of Covid vaccine on March 1. According to the family members, his health started deteriorating after the vaccine jab. He developed high fever, lost speech and appetite. A woman health staff who had vaccinated him allegedly said that "these are normal symptoms after vaccination". Nephew of the deceased Rajkumar Singh alleged, “My uncle was fine and leading a normal life before vaccination. He was taken for vaccination by health staff and released after the jab without keeping him under observation. He was asked to go home and take rest." "Within three hours, he developed serious health complications. We took him to the Khandoli CHC on Friday. Here the staffers didn’t attend to him for an hour. Later, he was declared brought dead," the nephew added. Chief medical officer of Agra district Dr RC Pandey said, “Covid-19 vaccine is completely safe and has been administered to millions of people across the country. Vaccination cannot be the reason for death. Postmortem report of the senior citizen states that he died due to cardiac arrest. The entire matter will be investigated in detail.” Meanwhile, the two doctors who tested Covid-19 positive after vaccination included a 56-year-old private doctor who was administered the second dose of vaccine in the last week of February. The other case is of a 26-year-old junior doctor of SN Medical College who took the first dose of vaccine in March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/farmer-62-dies-a-day-after-covid-vaccination-in-agra-2-docs-test-ve-after-jab/articleshow/81890422.cms||Deepak Lavania

Officials said while smugglers used electronic items to smuggle the gold earlier, now they convert the metal into a part of the product as was seen in the seizure on Tuesday where the gold was cast in the form of a face massager making it difficult to detect. “On Tuesday and Wednesday, we apprehended three persons who were travelling from Saudi Arabia and Dubai. Out of the three, two were smuggling the gold in radio sets while the third carried the gold in an electronic massager. Previously, when such cases were found, as soon as we would open the electronic item, we would immediately see the gold perhaps in wire or ball form. But now, the metal is converted into part of the product and fitted in it because of which it is difficult to detect,” said a customs official. In the gold seizure couple of days back, two solid white metal rods covered with blue coloured adhesive tape were found placed in the body of a radio fixed with the help of a glue. On removing the blue tape, white metal rods of 2-inch length each having 1 cm diameter were found. When a solid rod was cut with the help of an electric cutter, gold was found reinforced inside a steel cylinder. This is the new modus operandi that the peddlers are taking. An officer said, “The gold is covered with a casing because of which it does not even get easily detected on the screening machines and there are chances that peddlers can get away with it. It takes experience to detect the gold when the luggage is being screened and that is how it was accomplished when the precious metal was seized thrice within 24 hours. To get the gold out of the casings is also a herculean task.” Officials claimed that all the seizures have been from peddlers travelling from Gulf countries from where flights are now operating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/smugglers-adopt-innovative-ways-to-sneak-gold-into-india/articleshow/81890764.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a PIL filed by M Lakshman, a resident of Kulsumpura. The bench earlier noted with concern the contentions of the petitioner that due to constructions in the buffer zone, water was getting stagnated and scores of such places were now turning out to be mosquito-breeding centres. The bench questioned GHMC and revenue officials why they did not file their counters even months after they were asked to do so. “Tell us what action you have taken. This time show us the proof. Bring the photos of your encroachment removal exercise,” the bench said, before adjourning the case to four weeks. “Rainy season will start within two months. You have to hurry up now,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-show-proof-of-musi-encroachment-removal/articleshow/81891201.cms||---

According to police, the deceased, identified as Satto Chaudhary, and his relatives, Jeetendra Singh and Bobby, had a scuffle over the harvest of the crop. Police believed that this could be the reason behind the murder of Satto. The matter came to light when the relatives of Satto in the morning came for milking a buffalo and saw him lying in the pool of blood with slit throat and other multiple injuries. A team of senior police officers rushed to the crime scene and took the body in their possession. “There are multiple injury marks on the body and sharp-edged weapon was used in the murder. It appears that the number of assailants could be at least three,” said a senior police officer of Udyog Nagar police station. “The family members intimated us and a team of Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) and dog squad rushed to the spot. The family has accused Singh and Bobby to be behind the conspiracy and execution of murder since they had threatened Satto that they will not let him see the sunrise on Saturday,” said a senior police officer of Udyog Nagar police station while quoting the FIR. Police so far have detained some persons and raids were conducted to nab the fleeing accused. “The murder appears to be outcome of the scuffle that had taken place a few days ago. We have got the concrete clues on the whereabouts of the fleeing accused who too would be nailed down soon,” said a senior officer. Police said that the body of the deceased Satto was handed over to the family in the evening after the post-mortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-found-killed-in-bharatpur-family-feud-likely-reason/articleshow/81890772.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Decisions of ex-CM being reversed hints at factionalism in BJP: Experts||DEHRADUN: With CM Tirath Singh Rawat reversing another major decision of his predecessor Trivendra Singh Rawat by removing over 100 BJP functionaries appointed to government posts, political observers say that the stage has been set up for further factionalism in the state BJP. Uttarakhand has had a history of camps being made within both parties — Congress and BJP — of former chief ministers and their supporters. Already, the state political scenario has various factions owing allegiance to former CMs. Political observers say that with the recent developments, the stage is being set up for the Trivendra faction to also emerge within the party. When asked whether reversing decisions of own party will tarnish BJP's image, ex-CM Trivendra Singh Rawat told TOI, “Whatever happens, happens for the best. I am not the right person to answer this question." Commenting on the issue, social worker and political analyst Anoop Nautiyal said, “Factionalism has existed in all political parties of the state. In this case, though the decisions being taken by the Tirath government may be on the lines of administrative and public feedback, the bigger message going to the public is of deepening chasm among senior leaders.” “If Tirath Rawat becomes successful in good governance and making public policies, such differences and tiff among party leaders will die down in course of time,” he added. Nautiyal did not rule out the possibility of things going in favour of CM Tirath as he was taking decisions, “which were going well with his team and party members.” Another political analyst and former journalist Jay Singh Rawat said, “After the first elected government of Uttarakhand was formed, differences between N D Tiwari and Harish Rawat came to the fore. BJP had camps of senior members like Ramesh Pokhriyal and B S Koshyari. Then Vijay Bahuguna, Satpal Maharaj and Harish Rawat were also not in good terms. Therefore, groupism is nothing new for Uttarakhand politics.” He asserted that though CM Tirath was taking popular decisions, it was also serving a message of discord among senior leaders. “Tirath is not reversing the decision of the Congress government but the one taken by his predecessor. People of Uttarakhand are politically active and they keep a close eye on developments,” said Jay Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/decisions-of-ex-cm-being-reversed-hints-at-factionalism-in-bjp-experts/articleshow/81890433.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Kochi||Central observer accused of ill-treating state govt officials||Idukki: An election expenditure observer is ordering about state government officials, treating them as orderlies, asking them to get his shoes polished and buy him things for personal use. The officials have filed a complaint to chief electoral officer (CEO) demanding immediate action against the election observer to Devikulam and Udumbanchola constituencies. The complaint filed by officials against Naresh Kumar Bansal, IRS, accessed by TOI, states that they are facing extreme mental torture from the expenditure observer and can’t work him. In the complaint, the officials stated, “The expenditure observer often treats the election officials like his orderlies. There are several incidents where he ordered officials to get his shoes polished, buy him personal gifts, etc. He even ordered a high-ranking official in Devikulam RDO office to buy him a gel pen in the middle of a meeting.” “Since taking charge, the expenditure observer has been very arrogant and getting favours done for him and his family at our expense. We were forced to buy him things, from costly spices to tender coconut, out of our pockets. We feel ashamed to say that the expenditure observer hasn’t paid, even once, for his and family’s food expenses,” the complaint said. “Last Saturday, the expenditure observer forcefully took the video surveillance team’s vehicle for a trip to Madurai with his family. The video surveillance team covered their duty on foot. The observer remained indifferent to their plight,” the complaint added. “The observer’s lodging was arranged at government guest house in Munnar. But he demanded luxury accommodation at Tea County, a four-star hotel in Munnar. There was delay at the administrative level in meeting this demand and so he harassed all officials deployed under him,” it said. Bansal resorts to threats and abuse to get his demands met, the complaint stated. “Incompetent, senseless, useless are the terms used by the observer to address election officials. He threatens officials saying that he would write to the DEO and get them suspended. Once a high-ranking official leading a surveillance team was almost manhandled by the observer,” the complaint said. Bansal favours a particular political party, the complaint said. “This has caused serious discomfort among the officers to do their job in an impartial manner,” it said. A senior revenue official said that the observer is not supposed to interfere in unrelated issues. “Revenue officials are receiving threats to get the complaint withdrawn. But we won’t do so,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/central-observer-accused-of-ill-treating-state-govt-officials/articleshow/81890779.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Jaipur||Armed robbers decamp with Rs 33 lakh from private bank in Chittorgarh||UDAIPUR: Five men looted Rs 33 lakh from a private bank in Chittorgarh’s Nimbahera town on Saturday noon. One of the robbers assaulted a bank staff when he tried to resist. While leaving with the loot, one of the men snatched a gold chain from a woman customer who had come to the bank. Armed with guns and sharp weapons, the gang entered the Nimbahera branch of Axis Bank located on Udaipur Road around 11.55am and decamped with the money kept at the cash counter by brandishing arms. Chittorgarh SP Deepak Bhargava, ASP Himmat Singh Deval and other officials rushed to the bank after being informed of the robbery. CCTV camera footage from the bank and nearby areas has been sought and the staff and customers are being interrogated to get a complete picture. Check points have been set up at several places and teams have been deployed to nab the culprits, Bhargava said. The bank employees told police that robbers had taken all staffers, guards and customers at gunpoint and asked them to assemble in one part of the room while others headed to the cashier and took the money. One of the men placed a gun on the head of loan officer Robin Singh. When Singh resisted, the robber hit him hard on the head with the butt of a gun. He was later referred to Udaipur Hospital. The staff said the robbers had asked them to open the vault, but since the branch manager who carries the vault’s key was not there at the time, the masked men decamped with the money from the counter. The robbers stacked the bundles of currencies in different denominations in bags and escaped unchallenged. According to bank sources, the branch does not generally keep huge amounts of cash, but during the first week of April, there is a good inflow of money from institutionalised deposits and hence the chance of an insider's involvement in the loot conspiracy cannot not be ruled out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/armed-robbers-decamp-with-rs-33l-from-private-bank-in-chittorgarh/articleshow/81891221.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cong delegation, CM talk Raut, other thorny issues||Mumbai: A high-level delegation led by AICC general secretary H K Patil on Saturday called on chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to discuss the key issues facing the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state. Patil was accompanied by Congress state unit president Nana Patole, revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and public works minister Ashok Chavan. “We discussed the row over statements made by Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, allocation of funds made to the departments allotted to Congress cabinet members, and implementation of the common minimum programme. It was a good meeting and I am sure issues raised in the meeting will be resolved amicably,” Patil said. Patil said most of the senior Congress politicians had brought to his notice that Raut had made a series of statements saying Sharad Pawar should replace UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. “Congress leaders have expressed strong displeasure over Raut’s statement. The Shiv Sena is not a constituent of the UPA, and as such Raut’s contention has no relevance. I am told even Raut himself has clarified his position,” Patil said. A week ago, Thorat and Patole had expressed displeasure over the statements made by Raut, saying he was exceeding his brief and it would be brought to the notice of the CM. A cabinet member had observed that Raut’s statements had widened the rift in the MVA government. Thorat said that the discussion with Thackeray also went over the state-run corporations and boards and powers for ministers of state. He, too, expressed confidence that the issues raised would be resolved amicably.Patole alleged that the NDA government led by Narendra Modi was withholding the dues of the state to tackle the situation arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic and the cyclones last year. A day after leader of the opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the NDA government had released Rs 20 lakh crore, the Congress state chief said the Centre was acting in an irresponsible manner. “Maharashtra is the only state in the country which did not get financial assistance from the NDA government to tackle the crisis. We were expecting Fadnavis to provide us specific information on the financial assistance. His statement was vague. From the data, it has been established that the Centre did not even release the rightful funds to the state. BJP leaders, instead of contributing to CM relief fund, donated to the PM Cares fund,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-delegation-cm-talk-raut-other-thorny-issues/articleshow/81891240.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Vaccination count in PMR stood at 76,954 on Saturday. In comparison to Thursday, the PMR vaccinated over 19,000 more beneficiaries on Saturday, mostly receiving their doses. Over 39,000 citizens in the 45-59 age group were vaccinated with first shots on Saturday. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “We vaccinated nearly 77,000 beneficiaries on Saturday, with the number of session sites staying at 431 in on Saturday. Within a day or two, almost a total of 500 session sites will be operational, as we aim to inoculate over 1 lakh people on Monday. Our target is 1 lakh per day beneficiaries after Monday too. People’s participation in the drive will play a crucial role.” He said the night restrictions did not impact the number of people reaching vaccination sites as travel curbs were not applicable to those stepping out for vaccination. “The authorities are also increasing manpower and extending vaccination timings to have maximum coverage. NGOs and social organisations have also stepped forward to support us in the drive,” Dr Deshmukh said. Dr Rajashree Patil, supervisor at Kamala Nehru Hospital, said, “ We did not see a drop in the number of beneficiaries on Saturday. We get an average of 650 or more people for the shots per day till 10 pm and Saturday was no different.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/almost-77k-vaccinated-in-the-last-24-hours/articleshow/81890781.cms||Neha Madaan

The demand for oxygen also increased in the last 3-4 days and on Saturday the Covid ward was full. Doctors asked people to use mask and maintain social distancing as well as appeal to get vaccination to fight against the virus. In the last 20 days, the district recorded 800 Covid patients and patients with severe complaints coming to the hospital. “The ward was full on Saturday and we recommended opening two more wards to accommodate the patients coming for treatment,” said Dr Sanjeev Maheshwari, professor and Covid in-charge of JLN Medical College. Doctors said the demand for oxygen also increased and it is not confirmed which strain of the virus is infecting people. Doctors urged people not to indulge in rumours about corona vaccine and asked them to come forward and get vaccinated. Meanwhile, the medical and health department decided to increase sampling and all health centres have been asked to collect samples of those who are coming with fever, cough and cold. The district administration identified micro containment area in Haribhao Upadhyaya Nagar and blocked two streets. Beawar, Kotra and Gulabbari are reporting higher number of patients. “We are getting patients from every corner of the district and therefore it is alarming,” said a source. Looking at the increasing number of cases, MP Diya Kumari on Saturday inspected Government Amrit Kaur Hospital of Beawar. She told reporters that the facilities at the hospital are not up to the mark. She alleged that Ajmer is the home district of health minister Raghu Sharma and still it is deprived of basic medical facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ajmers-jln-hospital-will-add-more-covid-wards/articleshow/81890774.cms||---

The meeting was held between hospitals, officials of the Pune ZP, Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations and divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao. As per the plans drawn in the meeting, the rural administration aims to vaccinate 45,000 beneficiaries on Monday, followed by PMC (35,000) and PCMC (30,000). Currently, an average of 50,000 beneficiaries are receiving the shot in PMR per day, officials said. Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner, PMC, told TOI, “To achieve the feat, the number of vaccination centres will be increased. We will also ensure adequate vaccines and skilled manpower. Volunteers will be made available with the help of NGOs and other social organisations to create awareness among the citizens about vaccination. For Monday, we have set a specific target of vaccinating over 1 lakh beneficiaries in the district in a bid to convince the Union government to release more vaccine stock to increase coverage in the coming days.” Agarwal said the night restrictions in Pune (6pm till 6am) should not impact the drive as the authorities had allowed potential beneficiaries to move out for vaccination even after 6pm. The Monday’s target has been set as a part of the Mission 100 Days campaign, under which nearly 30 lakh eligible beneficiaries will be vaccinated during the next one month. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “We had earlier suggested hospitals to start sessions from 8am, instead of 9am. Vaccination sites can continue inoculations till 8pm or beyond as they have already been given the permission to operate 24 hours.” HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, said, “Hospitals have been advised to extend the vaccination timings from 9am till 8pm, from the earlier 9am to 6pm. We will adopt these timings for Monday’s vaccinations. We would continue with these timings during the week too, if they work out logistically.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/officials-eye-1-1l-jabs-in-pmr-tomorrow-to-increase-sites/articleshow/81890777.cms||Neha Madaan

They were slapped with sedition charges along with the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).The chargesheet has been accepted and the court has fixed May 1 as the next date of hearing.Five of the eight members charged by the STF were presented before the Mathura court. They included journalist Siddique Kappan, Masood Ahmad, Atiq-ur-Rahman, Mohammad Alam and Rauf Sharif, while two of them — Anshad Badruddin and Firoz Khan — attended the court proceedings via video link from Lucknow jail. The eighth accused, Danish, is yet to be arrested.In the 5,000-page chargesheet, the PFI members have been accused of receiving funds to the tune of Rs 80 lakh from financial institutions in Muscat and Doha for the purpose.Defence lawyer Madhuvan Datt Chaturvedi told TOI that after completing their investigation within 180 days, the STF filed its charge sheet with the list of more than 50 witnesses in the court of additional district and sessions judge (first) Anil Kumar Pandey on Saturday.“Danish has been issued summons for the next hearing,” the lawyer said.“The accused have dismissed the charges as vague, groundless and initiated for promoting ideological agenda of state government,” the lawyer said, adding that the accused had verbally complained to the court that the authorities were "misbehaving with them inside the jail and had not provided them food for the past 24 hours". They also alleged that they were being treated shabbily by other prisoners.The lawyer said that, according to them, they had their last meal around 5 pm on Friday and since then they had not eaten anything despite their medical condition which is said to be "critical". One of them, Kappan, is a diabetic while Atiq-ur-Rehman is suffering from aortic regurgitation.Meanwhile, an STF officer said, “All the above named PFI members have been booked under the charges of sedition, wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot, injuring or defiling place of worship to insult the religion of any group and under the Information Technology Act, along with charges of punishment for raising funds for terrorist act and the UAPA."The chargesheet stated that materials collected from cellphones and laptops of the accused corroborate that they were trying to spread disharmony in the state by raking up crime incidents such as the one in Hathras.Documents were collected during searches at the office of PFI in Delhi and evidence was found, the STF said.ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar confirmed to TOI that a chargesheet was submitted but a probe in the case was still underway.Kappan and his three associates were arrested last year on October 5 by Mathura police when they were heading to Hathras to meet the rape victim’s family. They were picked up on the apprehension of causing a breach of peace, but were later slapped with sedition and UAPA.The STF, investigating the case, came across the alleged role of CFI’s national general secretary, Rauf Sherif, during its inquiry. He was then arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in Thiruvananthapuram on December 12 last year in a money laundering case while he was trying to board a flight. Earlier, he was lodged in Kerala jail and later he was produced in a Mathura court which sent him to judicial custody. Anshad Badruddin and Firoz Khan, natives of Kerala, were arrested in mid-February from Lucknow. The cops had seized huge amounts of explosives and weapons and the two fugitives later reportedly confessed to their plan of executing bomb blasts across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/hathras-case-up-stf-produces-5000-page-chargesheetagainst-eight-pfi-men-accuses-them-of-fomenting-unrest/articleshow/81890448.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

According to forest officials, this is the first litter of four-year-old tigress T-114, which is the daughter of tigress T-13. Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF), wildlife, and field director, Ranthambore Tiger Project, Sawai Madhopur, in his statement said, “The cubs are nearly three months old and were spotted with the mother in Todara region of Phalodi range. After witnessing that the tigress was pregnant, trap cameras were installed in the region for effective monitoring.” Sources in the department said in the trap camera, the tigress was spotted with a cub. However, during monitoring on Saturday evening, the team captured two cubs in the camera. It is estimated that the count of tigers, including the new cubs, in RNP has reached around 72. Though, the news is heartening for wildlife enthusiasts, but birth of cubs has increased the worries of the park operators as the number of big cats in RNP has reached a point where it can no longer sustain them. Keeping cubs safe is becoming difficult for tigresses as space is constantly shrinking for big cats, which are inherently peripatetic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tigress-t-114-spotted-with-two-cubs-in-ranthambore/articleshow/81890775.cms||---

All these students recently returned from their respective cities in view of the laboratory sessions after completion of their online classes. The infected students have been isolated in one of the hostel buildings within the campus separated as a super isolation ward, with all the precautions being employed, while two other hostel buildings have been reserved for keeping the students and staff, both academic and non-academic, following the contact tracing of the positive students. Spokesperson Amardeep Sharma said with the corona infection on the rise again, the administration of the institute had started taking utmost precaution to keep the campus free from infection, especially in the wake of returning of students to the campus. “We ensured that every student coming from home went to a designated isolation ward directly from the main gate, where the swab samples of students with symptoms were taken and sent to AIIMS for a test. If the samples tested positive, we sent the student directly to the super isolation ward from the isolation ward for the next 14 days,” Sharma said. Considering the seriousness of the situation, divisional commissioner Rajesh Sharma and deputy director (medical & health) Sunil Kumar Bist visited the campus on Saturday afternoon and reviewed the situation and arrangements undertaken by the IIT administration. “We have asked for mandatory 10 days’ quarantine for every student coming from home and have also given directions for random sampling of the staff,” said Sharma. He said that since the students form hostels have been reported positive, directions of contact tracing have also been issued to the administration of IIT. IIT Jodhpur has 11 hostel buildings on its campus and with students coming in hordes for practical sessions, the administration has been taking every possible measure to keep the situation under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/52-students-of-iit-jodhpur-test-positive-in-a-week/articleshow/81890778.cms||---

In fact, the royalty collections were the highest in March at Rs 830.71 crore with a growth of 43% compared to the same month last year. The record growth in March has come on a high base as in the same month last year, the collection was highest for the whole year at Rs 582.84 crore. In a statement, mines and petroleum minister Pramod Jain Bhaya said, “It was a challenging task to bring the industry back on track while adopting the Covid protocols. But the department navigated the difficult times with innovative strategies. Not only the revenue collections, the department undertook many long pending projects like exploration of potash and launched new policies like M-sand during the pandemic year.” In April 2020-21, when royalty revenues fell 85% to Rs 37.43 crore against Rs 251.23 crore in the same month of the previous year, it was not expected that the year would end with a growth of 8%. Ajitabh Sharma, principal secretary, mines and petroleum, said, “It was not easy to come back after losing over Rs 214 crore in April and about Rs 140 crore in May. But we stepped up the monitoring for royalty collection. This resulted in higher double-digit growth in collections in successive months except for a couple of months in November and February. The year began on a scary note, but thankfully ended with a sense of achievement and optimism. He said because of closure of mining activities in April, the number of e-rawanna issued came down to the lowest levels of 125-130. “After concerted efforts, the numbers rose to 33,000 per day,” added Sharma.

Ajmer stores complex (general stores depot and Ajmer division) are the biggest contributors in the scrap sale of NWR in 2020-21. Ajmer stores complex, with total sale of Rs 93.2 crore is at first place in NWR, far ahead of other divisions. Among other complex of NWR, Jaipur earned Rs 44.6 crore, Jodhpur Rs 41.1 crore, Bikaner made Rs 27.7 crore from scrap sale. General stores depot and Ajmer division have done record scrap sale of Rs 49.7 crore and Rs 43.5 crore, respectively. Railway authorities claimed that the achievement is special as the scrap revenue generation activities were badly affected last year due to Covid lockdown and other restrictions. Extensive surveys have been done to identify scrap in railway system, with a target of achieving ‘zero scrap’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nwr-earns-record-rs-207cr-from-scrap-sale-ajmer-tops-list/articleshow/81890785.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Union minister dares Kerala CM to reply to Amit Shah’s queries||T’PURAM: Union minister for parliamentary affairs Pralhad Joshi said here on Saturday that the silence of CM Pinarayi Vijayan to a set of questions raised by Union home minister Amit Shah on gold smuggling case can be considered as his confession in the crime. “The CM has not yet been able to explain about gold smuggling and Swapna Suresh, the key accused in the crime. People want to know what the chief minister has to say on these matters,” Joshi told reporters. The minister who said that Vijayan’s reaction to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on Saturday was below the standard. He said defence forces routinely generate bills for the work they do during natural calamities and it would be settled either by the state or the Centre. “Even if the work is done for Centre, they are supposed to generate bills. Somebody will have to bear the expenses. There is no ground for making baseless allegations in this regard,” he said. Joshi urged the election commission to seriously view the welfare pension and food kit distribution by LDF when they accompany EC representatives to the residence of voters in connection with postal voting. There should be a fool-proof mechanism to cast postal votes impartially, he added. The minister said the leaders of both LDF and UDF were making contradictory statements regarding their front’s stand in the Sabarimala issue. While the Congress high command and KPCC don’t agree on women entry issue, same is with the left parties, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/union-min-dares-cm-to-reply-to-shahs-queries/articleshow/81890792.cms||---

The automated reminders via SMS will start from the 26th day after the first shot, a health ministry official said. “These are automated reminders to people who haven’t taken a second-dose appointment. The reminders will start from the 26th day of the first dose and alerts will come every three days, until the 42nd day (for Covaxin) and 56th day (for Covishield) recipients,” the official said. This reminder system is already operational. Another key update is the display of vaccine-specific sites after the first dose. For example, a Covishield recipient booking a second-dose appointment will see only Covishield sites on the portal while searching by pin code or district, instead of all sites. More updates, such as the geo-link feature, will show people the nearest vaccination sites — within a radius of 10-20km — instead of the current search by pin code or state/district combination, which gives a larger, less specific picture. “With the maps tool, beneficiaries will also get the shortest route to a selected site. This additional feature will hopefully be operational within the next couple of days,” the official said. The health ministry has the geolocation of each vaccination centre. A team is also working to embed a Google Maps link in the SMSs sent out to beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cowin-to-have-2nd-dose-alerts-list-of-nearest-hubs/articleshow/81890791.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||18+ coverage not until India has ‘more’ shot options||Pune: Health ministry officials have said that vaccinations for everyone above 18 may have to wait until the country has more vaccine options, along with better reserves of doses. Certain states, including Maharashtra, Punjab and Delhi, have requested wider vaccine coverage that includes the above-18 population — essentially opening up Covid vaccination programme to all adults. But health ministry officials said such large drives cannot happen until priority beneficiaries are inoculated first. A source from the ministry said, “We are not against wider coverage. But it cannot be done at the cost of leaving the most vulnerable behind. We are hopeful of two vaccines (the Russian Sputnik V and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D) getting emergency approvals within the next two months. Their arrival will ease production pressures on Serum Institute (Covishield) and Bharat Biotech (Covaxin). Both vaccine makers have been asked to scale up current production levels.In Maharashtra, experts, including the technical advisor on Covid-19, Subhash Salunke, have been pressing the Centre to allow vaccinations of those above 18 with comorbidities in nine state districts that have had high caseloads. Salunke said, “We understand that we cannot demand doses for everyone. But cases are rising, which is why we are demanding the inclusion of everyone above 18 with comorbidities. There are many people who are below 45 with serious ailments. And they’re all waiting for their turn.”He added that the state should be allowed the freedom to use vaccines as per its own requirements. “When the Centre has clearly stated that Maharashtra has nine of the most affected districts of the country, it should allow us the discretion to vaccinate all above 18 with comorbidities in these districts. Targeted vaccination among this group will help,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/18-coverage-not-until-india-has-more-shot-options/articleshow/81890786.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Referring to the illegal mining in Baran district, the MLA said a youth, identified as Ramswroop Sahariya died on Thursday while he was engaged in illegal mining in pasture land in Kadyawan of the district. Three other Sahariya youths had lost their lives in illegal mining in the same area a few months ago, he further said and noted that the Sahariya labourers do die very frequently in illegal mining in Baran, but the act never stops. Training guns at his own minister without naming him, Singh further wrote ‘Baran is the district where the local minister chooses the most corrupt officials to be deputed in his area’ and pointed out that collector Inder Singh Rao, who is currently in jail in bribery case, was deputed at the same minister’s nod in Baran. “The illegal mining mafia would continue to thrive in the district as long as the corrupt head occupies the seat,” Singh said while noting that the ‘Gangotri’ of corruption in mining department originates from Baran district. “The cat is deputed to guard the milk’,” the MLA further reminded. While concluding his letter, the MLA pointed out that it was not fair to suspend lower grade employees and urged CM Ashok Gehlot to remove the corrupt officials from their respective posts and to suspend the head of the state mining department. Notably, on few other occasions in the past, MLA Bharat Singh alleged corruption in mining department and wrote to the CM to sack the mining minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-mla-writes-to-cm-against-corruption-in-mining-dept/articleshow/81890780.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Strays pose threat to kids on city roads and parks||JAIPUR: A peaceful stroll near the flag monument at Central park during twilight turned out to be horrifying experience for Disha Sharma and her nine-year-old daughter when the duo was attacked by the pack of stray dogs. A group of evening walkers came in for a timely rescue and dispersed the dogs, but the incident again highlighted the recent talked-about issue of increased canine menace in the city, including public parks, due to negligence of Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC). Public parks and city roads have become a breeding ground for strays, posing a serious physical threat to citizens, especially children. Rama Jain, a regular morning walker at Central Park said, “Recently, the population of dogs has multiplied manifolds. Many animal lovers feed them inside due to this dogs have made it a home as there is easy availability of food. These stray dogs charge at children and women.” A veterinary doctor claimed stray dogs have extremely high breeding rates. As per studies, two dogs can multiply to over 300 in three years over a few generations. They are also highly territorial, with each dog having its fixed niche. “The exposed garbage and slums are ideal for stray dogs to flourish. The JMC should control the situation at the earliest.” said Ramesh Saini, a private veterinary doctor. Sources at the JMC-Greater said the civic body has not invited tenders for sterilization and administering anti-rabies injections since December as there is no veterinary doctor who monitors the operation. “The technical bid to sterilize street dogs was opened in December 2020, however, the process was stalled in absence of a doctor. Also, the charge of the doctor was handed over to compounder of the animal husbandry department,” said a source. However, an official at JMC-Greater said, the animal birth control programme is ongoing and extension has been provided to the contractor. “Relocation of dogs was is not permitted according to the rules framed by Animal Welfare Board. We will look into the complaints if there is rising population issue of dogs at the Central Park,” Sources said in the past the JMC has failed to attract sincere contractors to carry out sterilization programme. “The firm that was awarded contracted earlier were not working properly. This is the reason provision contract was given to another firm. The JMC pays a maximum of between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,250 (per dog) for sterilization and administering anti-rabies. But contractors do not come at this rate. Those who take the contract on lesser rates do not work properly,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/strays-pose-threat-to-kids-on-city-roads-and-parks/articleshow/81890789.cms||---

Since the case is under investigation by the SOG, both the accused were handed over to SOG for the arrest and other required legal formalities. Amidst some claims that Jaipur police had concealed at least three silver slabs recovered from the arrested labourers, the case was handed over to the SOG. “We got a specific input on their whereabouts, thus a district special team (DST) rushed to Uttarakhand from where both of them were taken in to custody and were brought to Jaipur. We handed them over to SOG for further action,” said Ajay Pal Lamba, additional commissioner of police (Crime) while addressing a press conference on Saturday. Lamba further said the accused Agarwal and Jain were planning to move further to Nepal to make it their safe hideout. Agarwal, the kingpin who had planned and executed the theft of nearly 540kg of silver from the basement of the house of a doctor Sunit Soni, had confessed that he had debts of nearly Rs 5 crore which led him to plan and execute the theft. “He claimed that he had stolen 17 silver slabs each weighting 30kg and distributed them to various jewellers who were his debtors to clear his debts,” said Lamba. During interrogation, Agarwal stated that he had met Dr Soni in 2018. “He stated that he was into bullion trade for the past 10 years and met Dr Soni in 2018 when the doctor asked him for safer option of investment. He has further claimed that from June 2018 to September 2020 he had helped the doctor in getting 30 silver slabs each weighing around 30kg. He confessed that he was into planning and execution of this crime with the help of his employees and labourers to clear his debts,” Lamba added. Police also found that the theft took place on February 12 and thereafter Agarwal started distributing these slabs to the people from whom he had taken loans. “He confessed that he had given Rs 25 lakh to one accused Banwari Jangid, Rs 20.33 lakh to one Naeem, Rs 5 lakh to Ashish, Rs 5.50 lakh to Ramkaran. Ramkaran had further given some money to labourers who had dug the tunnel,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-cops-nab-mastermind-of-vaishali-nagar-silver-theft/articleshow/81890788.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Over 3,000 sensitive, 396 critical booths identified||Thiruvananthapuram: There are 396 booths classified as critical and 3,058 booths categorized as sensitive polling booths across the state. The figures have been finalized by the election commission (EC) in consultation with the state police and the district administrations for providing appropriate security. The majority of the booths classified as critical (264, which is 67% of the total critical booths) are located in areas flagged as Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas in Wayanad, Malappuram, Palakkad, Kannur and Kozhikode rural. Polling stations where polling percentage recorded last time was over 75% and where more than 75% votes have been recorded in favour of one candidate are considered critical. Polling stations where re-polls were conducted in the previous election due to reported electoral malpractices, and those that witnessed any electoral violence are also a criterion for categorizing them as critical. Booths located in places where incidents of violence, or clashes between political parties have been reported in the recent past, are classified as sensitive booths. Police have deployed 354 patrolling units in vulnerable areas. These are places where voters are vulnerable to threats or intimidation, causing hindrance in free and fair elections. A special focus is being given to 53 booths classified as “inaccessible booths”. They are booths with no motorable roads, those which are water-locked, etc. In order to ensure fool-proof communication systems in all booths for effective coordination and enforcement, the police this time would use satellite phones in “black out” areas, where the wireless communication network cannot be operated. Besides police’s communication network, the signal unit of central reserve police force (CRPF) has set up its repeater station at the special armed police (SAP) battalion in the capital, which will be the hub of the communication system for the 140 central armed police force (CAPF) battalions, including one company of women CRPF, deployed across the state. This time, EC has ensured that if any CAPF member suffers injury in connection with the elections, they will be provided cashless treatment at the nearest super-speciality hospital. Besides CAPF, 34,504 state police personnel and 24,788 special police officers (that includes ex-service men, former student police cadets, etc) are part of the security network. The police have sealed 152 points along the state borders vulnerable to illegal movements of people and contrabands from and to the neighbouring states. In addition to the manpower deployment, the state police will utilize drones for surveillance on election day. Its use proves highly effective during the lockdown period, when police used them for surveillance especially in interior areas. Police are collaborating with drone associations to check for unauthorized gatherings or other illegal activities on election day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/over-3000-sensitive-396-critical-booths-identified/articleshow/81890816.cms||KP Saikiran

Mahajan said that HCWs and FLWs were given enough opportunities to get the first jab of the vaccine. Majority of them have already got the dose.The Centre has raised the issue with the states and UTs that they had received various inputs from different sources that in some of the vaccination centres some ineligible beneficiaries are being registered as HCWs and FLWs and are getting vaccinated in complete violation of the prescribed guidelines. “There has been 24% increase in HCW database in the past few days,” ministry of health and family welfare officials wrote.The Centre discussed the issue in a meeting with state representatives on Saturday and took the policy decision and directed the states for its compliance. “However, universal vaccination of already registered HCWs and FLWs should be ensured at the earliest,” said the Centre.On Saturday, 1,674 HCWs and 5,114 FLWs got the first dose.

Pahari SHO Pradeep Yadav said the victim was heading to study from her village in Burana to Badoli on Friday when she was abducted by two persons identified as Anil and Sachin. The case was registered on Saturday. “They physically assaulted the victim and took her to Kaman on their bike. She was taken to a secluded place and raped for four hours. Thereafter, they dumped the victim in a semi-conscious state at a forest in Burana around 3am. Once the victim regained consciousness, she walked to her house and narrated her ordeal to her parents,” said Yadav. The victim’s family told police that since they had admitted her in a hospital, the police complaint was filed on Saturday. “Our daughter reached home in an inebriated condition and under trauma. She was not in a condition to speak and was crying incessantly. She was taken to a hospital for treatment,” the father told police.

The complaint was filed on Friday against Ramo Singh, Duli Chand and Pratap Singh. Police say initial investigation revealed that three policemen were part of the team who had visited the house of the complainant following a report of abuse by her husband against the neighbours. “The control room received a complainant against the husband of the rape complainant that he in a drunken state was abusing everyone in the neighbourhood. Three policemen rushed to the house of the drunkard, but were prevented by his wife from entering the house. The family misbehaved with police and hid the husband inside the house. The entire matter was reported by the cops at the police station,” an officer said. The rape victim, who handed over a video of the incident as evidence against three policemen, also raised doubt. The video was made from inside the house and the three policemen were seen outside asking for the husband. “If the policemen were outside and didn’t get inside, how could they have torn the clothes of the victim,” said police. ASP Vandita Rana said the matter was being investigated by a senior police officer and they have taken the testimony of the policemen.

---||Mumbai||Only 9% of Mumbai’s ICU beds & 8.3% of ventilators still vacant||MUMBAI: Half of the Covid-19 ICU beds in Maharashtra are still available, according to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s assertions on Friday, but this is not the case in the state’s capital, Mumbai, where only 9% of the 1,800 ICU beds are now vacant. However, BMC’s additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said that the situation is “under control” in the city because the municipal body is adding both normal and ICU beds every day to its Covid care facilities. On the morning of April 2, the BMC’s dashboard showed 262 of the then total 1,638 ICU beds (15%) were vacant. Within 24 hours, the numbers changed: only 168 ICU beds of the bolstered ICU bed strength of 1,800 were available. The second Covid wave, which has been resulting in a record number of daily detections in Mumbai, has hit the affluent classes in the city as against the first wave in May and September 2020 that affected the slum pockets in a big way. However, the civic dashboard shows that more ICU beds in the private sector than the public sector are vacant. Only 8.5% (87 out of 1,027) ICU beds in public hospitals are vacant, as against 10.5% (81 out of 773) in the private sector. More than half of these ICU beds have ventilators, and as per BMC statistics, only 8.3% (94) of the 1,131 ventilators in Covid care are available right now. Kakani said the BMC is alert, but not too alarmed. “The quick rise in cases is worrying, but we are ramping up the bed strength on a daily basis. It is work in progress,” he said. There are plans to increase the total bed strength to 21,000 from the 14,769 right now. “The private sector will increase the beds from 3,900 to 5,000 next week,” he added. There is another alarming aspect to Mumbai’s ‘Covid bed story’. While most of the affluent patients opt for home care, a percentage of them turn serious in the second week and reach hospital late. “We are getting many patients who, on the seventh or eighth day of infection, have a bad CT scan score and need ICU care,” said Dr Prince Surana of the Surana group of hospitals. A senior BMC official told TOI that several affluent patients call in with demands to be admitted in a particular hospital only. “Some want only a sea-facing room, while others say that they want a particular hospital only. In the current situation, when beds are getting fewer in number by the day, these conditions cannot be fulfilled,” he said. Patients are also ready to wait for a day or more to get into the hospital of their choice. “But in the meanwhile their condition deteriorates,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-only-9-of-citys-icu-beds-8-3-of-ventilators-still-vacant/articleshow/81891739.cms||Malathy Iyer

In Pune district, which has curbs on movement in place from 6pm to 6am, Sanjay Deshmukh, the assistant director (Medical) Pune circle, said vaccine beneficiaries should ideally pre-register on the CoWIN portal if they are stepping out for jabs after 6pm. “They can then show the registration and time slot at the vaccination centres,” Deshmukh said. State health secretaryPradeep Vyas said all centres would continue to operate in full swing, despite the curbs. A state health official said, “Nobody on their way to vaccination centres will be stopped. The state wants to scale up the inoculation drive. Currently, it has 35 lakh doses available for the week and the Centre has said it would keep up supply according to the progress.” Deshmukh added that the district is planning to touch one lakh daily vaccinations. The number of vaccine sites — currently at 401 — would also be increased to 500 by Monday, he said. Nearly 68.84 lakh people have received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine in Maharashtra, which is leading the country in coverage. Uttar Pradesh, with 64 lakh recipients, and Rajasthan, with 61 lakh, come second and third. Data shows that nearly 4.85 lakh health workers, 2.76 lakh frontline workers and an impressive 7.79 lakh citizens have already been given their full dosage (two shots) in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/prior-registration-ideal-if-travelling-for-vax-after-6pm/articleshow/81890796.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Capitol Police officer William “Billy” Evans, an 18-year veteran of the force, was killed on Friday when a man rammed his car into a barrier outside the Capitol. The driver, Noah Green, was shot dead after he got out of his car and lunged at police with a knife. The deaths came less than two weeks after the Capitol Police removed an outer fence that had temporarily cut off a wide swath of the area to cars and pedestrians. The fencing had been erected to secure the Capitol after January 6 riots by a mob of Trump supporters. Lawmakers have almost universally loathed the fencing, saying the seat of democracy was meant to be open to the people. But after Friday’s attack, some said they needed to procced with caution. Democrat Tim Ryan, chairman of a House spending committee that oversees security and the Capitol, said that lawmakers would be “reviewing everything”. His committee and others are looking at not only the fence but at the staffing, structure, and intelligence capabilities of the Capitol Police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/car-attack-at-us-capitol-raises-fresh-questions-about-security/articleshow/81892805.cms||---
---||Pune||Admin targets 700 more oxygen beds by Monday||Pune: Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao has told all hospitals and Covid care centres in the district to increase the number of oxygen-supported beds by 700 within Monday. “With the daily Covid caseload increasing, we want more oxygen beds at all the facilities,” said Rao. At present, there are 9,118 oxygen-supported beds in the district. With the addition of 700 oxygen-supported beds next week, the number of such units would increase to 9,818. The district administration has also asked all the hospitals to ensure enough beds for Covid treatment, following the 80:20 ratio like October last year. The pressure on the healthcare infrastructure, especially the issue of hospital beds, was discussed at length in Friday’s Covid review meeting chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. It was decided in the meeting that the majority of the beds being procured under the 80:20 scheme should have oxygen support. The district health officials claimed that Pune had adequate infrastructure and the only challenge was to manage it properly. They stressed that if there were more oxygen-supported beds, people with mild symptoms and in need of oxygen could be managed better. Civil surgeon Ashok Nandapurkar said, “We are trying to ramp up oxygen supply to all the Covid care centres for the isolation beds. We can use cylinders to convert them into oxygen-supported beds.” The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad corporations have started updating the bed availability on the divisional commissioner’s dashboard, but the data for the rural areas were still not updated. “The hospitals not updating the status have been told to do so immediately,” the official said. The divisional commissioner’s dashboard on Saturday evening showed that over 3,524 beds were vacant in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/admin-targets-700-more-oxygen-beds-by-monday/articleshow/81890801.cms||Nisha Nambiar

He isolated himself and kept on calling for the report from the very next day, but it was all in vain. He visited the GMCH testing centre at least twice but even that proved futile. After four-five days, when Ingole did not hear from the authorities, he assumed that he was Covid-19 negative. On April 2, Ingole got a call from the authorities who asked him to get admitted immediately as he was Covid positive. Now, he is in one of the CCCs in Yavatmal. In another case, Praful Dahake, 42, had Covid symptoms but he was denied admission in the GMCH in Yavatmal as he did not have a positive report. Praful’s family got him admitted to a private hospital in Yavatmal amid the bed crisis. Finally, his Covid-19 positive report came after 9 days, a day before he was about to get discharge. A stressful delay in getting RT-PCR results is common in districts like Yavatmal, Buldhana, Akola and Washim. Samples collected from rural areas get tested late and the results get delayed. As per the official figures, 2,515 reports in Yavatmal district and 3,497 in Buldhana district are pending as on April 3, apart from the 4000 plus samples collected by each district in the last 24 hours. This is a serious issue as suspected Covid patients could become superspreaders. Secondly, some of them may become serious in the gap of eight days. While authorities in all the districts in Vidarbha are boasting of increased testing, the delay in giving results is increasing from an ideal 24 hours to more than eight days. Health officials in these districts admit to the fact that reports are getting delayed, but no one is ready to come on record. Sources in the GMCH laboratory in Yavatmal told TOI that they have doubled the testing capacity in the last two months. On an average, the lab is conducting 1,600 tests per day. Other tests are done with the help of Rapid Antigen kits. In Buldhana, the average daily tests are about 5,000 of which the average 1,800 are tested in the laboratory and others are Rapid tests. AIIMS Nagpur has been the mentoring authority for most RT-PCR laboratories in Maharashtra. They are looking after quality control of RT-PCR labs. Dr Meena Mishra, who heads the microbiology department at AIIMS Nagpur, said labs too have their own problems. “Small towns like Yavatmal and Buldhana have done a commendable job by increasing their testing capacity manifold in the last few months. But there are some genuine issues. The AIIMS Nagpur lab is working round-the-clock and our teams of technicians are operating the two machines full time. This practice is not possible in many small towns,” she said. Frequent power cuts, inadequate power back-up, timely supply of kits and storage of several consumables below 20 degree C are some of the practical problems faced by these laboratories. Lab technicians told TOI that they have been given a target from the health department to conduct a certain number of tests, but the facilities, including manpower, are inadequate. DRAWBACKS OF DELAYED RT-PCR RESULTS - Patients may become serious during the delay period - Asymptomatic positives may become superspreaders - Waiting for results increases anxiety and stress - If labs work round-the-clock, pendency can be cleared - Hurdles in small towns to start 24x7 work in labs||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/delay-in-rt-pcr-reports-in-many-districts-proving-fatal/articleshow/81890805.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The torture was inflicted reportedly because the partition ply in one of the rooms had been damaged and the hostel authorities believed he was responsible for the act. The incident took place on March 17, however, the manager threatened him not to tell about the incident to anyone and hence the boy’s family came to know of the incident only when their son came home for the Holi break. Later, the boy’s father took his son to Gingla police station and filed an FIR against the perpetrators. “A case has been registered under Sections 341, 323 of the IPC and 75 of the JJ Act, 2015. The medical examination has been held and investigation is under way. The medical report confirms that the boy was beaten. We are waiting for the school to reopen so that statements of other hostel inmates will be recorded, arrests would follow soon if the charges are proved,” Sudha Palawat, CO, Salumber, told STOI. The victim’s father, an autorickshaw driver, said that his son had been studying at Ved Mata Gayatri Vidyalaya at Idana, Gingla for six years and lives in the hostel of the school. He shares the room with 10 boys and someone broke the room partition ply. The hostel manager Ambalal and a teacher Naresh held the victim responsible. They stripped him in front of all the inmates, hit on his private parts and legs. They said this would teach him a lesson not to damage property. The boy came home for Holi holidays and narrated the incident. “My son is so terrified now that he refuses to go back to the school fearing more torture. The perpetrators should be punished for serving such inhuman treatment to a grown up kid which is traumatic for an adolescent,” the father said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/teen-stripped-thrashed-for-damaging-ply-in-hostel/articleshow/81890803.cms||---

---||Nagpur||2.27 lakh healthcare workers, frontline workers take jab in divbefore govt halts these categories||NAGPUR: In six districts of Nagpur division, 2,27,744 healthcare workers (HCW) and frontline workers (FLW) have taken the Covid-19 vaccine before discontinuation of these two categories by the central government. A record 41,763 people took the jab in Nagpur district on Saturday which marks the first time jab figures went more than 40,000 in a day. The Centre on Saturday issued an order announcing no fresh registration in HCW and FLW categories from Sunday. As per the data from the office of divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, 1,15,004 HCW registered and took the first dose between January 16 and March 3. In all, 1,12,740 FLW registered and took the jab between February 5 and March 3. In Nagpur district, 1,10,951 registered and took the first dose under HCW (56,284) and FLW (54,667) categories. The number of beneficiaries in Nagpur district is much higher compared to the remaining five districts of the division. Nearly 35,461 took the jab — HCW (17,435) and FLW (18,026) categories — in Chandrapur district followed by 23,496 (HCW 9,319 and FLW 14,177) in Gondia district, 23,105 (HCW 16,119 and FLW 6,986) in Wardha district, 20,013 (HCW 8,095 and FLW 11,918) in Gadchiroli district and 14,718 (HCW 7,752 and FLW 6,966) in Bhandara district. “HCW and FLW who registered on the Co-Win application and did not take the jab by Saturday can complete their dose. In the case of those below 45 years, people cannot be registered in these two categories. Whoever is left in these two categories and are 45 and above can register and take the jab,” additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI. With spike in cases and deaths in the district, the NMC has allowed few sectors in HCW like staffers working in pharmacies and pathology labs. Many sectors, including banking, postal, railways, BNSL, MSEDCL, teaching etc were allowed inoculation irrespective of their age. People in these sectors were also exposed to a large number of citizens on a daily basis and were considered in these two categories. Now, people working in these sectors can take the jab only if they are above 45. Guardian minister Nitin Raut and Kumar had set a target of increasing the vaccination to 40,000 per day. On Saturday, 41,736 people took the jab in the district of which 24,473 were from the 45-59 age group. This is the highest-ever in a single day as the highest earlier was 31,244 on Friday. The NMC on Saturday increased the number of vaccination centres from 86 to 89. The vaccination count was 15,871 in the city. The Zilla Parishad led by CEO Yogesh Kumbhekar has increased the centres from 241 to 318, four times higher compared to the number of centres in the city. Accordingly, vaccination surged to a record 25,685 in Nagpur rural on Saturday which is higher compared to the inoculation in the city. Since the start of the vaccination drive for people from the age-appropriate group, the teams of ZP, revenue department and Gram Panchayats are mobilizing eligible people for vaccination through the door-to-door method. “NMC is planning to add more 50 centres in the city on Monday and Tuesday. The NMC did not get doses of Covaxin on Saturday forcing it to start Covishield at vaccination centres situated at NMC’s Hansapuri Ayurvedic Dispensary and Dr Ambedkar Hospital. Covaxin continued at two centres in GMCH, NMC Datke Memorial Diagnostic Centre and Viveka Hospital,” said Joshi. Around 1,500 doses of Covaxin are left with GMCH, said NMC sources. The office of deputy director of health services (DDHS) has reportedly assured the NMC of giving doses of Covaxin by getting them from adjoining districts. The NMC has sufficient stock of Covishield.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-27l-hcw-flw-take-jab-in-divbefore-govt-halts-these-categories/articleshow/81891246.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Jaipur||Protests in Ajmer over liquor shops in residential areas||AJMER: Several protests were held across the city after the allotment of liquor shops in residential areas. People alleged that these shops are being opened near schools, temples or in residential areas, which flouts rules. However, the excise department stated that allotment of liquor shops in different regions are made after getting NOC from different departments. People in Kesarganj on Saturday demanded to close the liquor shop near Sabzi Mandi. They said that there is a school as well as a mosque near the shop and therefore, it is against the norms. Hundreds of people gathered and shouted slogans against the excise department and demanded to close or shift the shop elsewhere. Clock tower police reached the spot and controlled the situation. In Nagra area on Nasirabad Road, residents came out against opening of two liquor shops and conducted ‘Sadbudhi Yagna’. They alleged that no shop can be opened on highway and Nagra passes through Ajmer-Nasirabad highway. They said that Nagra is a Dalit and backwards’ area and opening two shops there will lead the residents towards alcoholism. After the yagna, residents warned that if these shops were not closed then they will hold a massive protest. In Dholabhata, the residents gathered and broke the board of a liquor shop, demanding to shift or close the shop in their area. Residents said that the shop is situated in the residential area and the people who drink there, will disturb the peace of the area. They also threatened of a massive protest. Looking at the mass gathering, Alwar Gate police reached the spot and controlled the situation. The liquor shop owner also gave a complaint to police stating that the state government has allotted him the shop after confirming the norms. From April 1, new contract liquor shops are opened in the city after the tender process, but now the shop owners are facing protests by the local people. Excise department said that they will inspect again if any rule of allotment in the regions was flouted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/protests-in-ajmer-over-liquor-shops-in-residential-areas/articleshow/81890818.cms||---

With the city police coming forward, the traditional procession is set to get its lost glory back. The cops will be organizing a competition on next Sunday at the Police Parade Ground. Total 10 teams, each having 10 members, will be participating in the event. The idea to organize the event germinated thanks to city police commissioner Ajay Tomar’s quest to know about the traditional Holi celebrations of Surat. The quest took Tomar to Daliya Sheri — a locality that has kept various traditional festival practices alive. Tomar along with Pankaj Kapadia, a former resident of Daliya Sheri, and his friend Rohit Marfatia watched a small demonstration of Ghees. Groups in Daliya Sheri of Mahidharpura are among the last ones in city to have carried on with the tradition. “With changing times people have stopped taking out Ghees. But the city police commissioner Ajay Tomar found it interesting and together we are trying to revive it,” said Kapadia, a veteran sports enthusiast. Legendary Gujarati author C C Mehta had described Holi, Dhuleti celebrations and Ghees in his prose collection ‘Bandh Gathariya’. Within three to four days of Holi, Ghees was organized and families used to start preparing for it weeks in advance. Entire families used to join the beating of drums and other musical instruments along with neighbours. The procession used to move around in the walled city area performing loud drums until 4am. Clown and other comical impersonators dressed like businessmen, doctor, lawyer and municipal officer also participated in the precession and they used to get cash rewards from the businessmen who flocked the Ghees in the days gone by. In some areas, community-specific Ghees were also organised. “Hiranyakashap had ordered his men to play loud drums so that no one can hear Prahlad when he burns with Holika. The tradition of Ghees is believed to have derived from that tradition as per some religious books,” added Kapadia. “The Diamond City is the only city in the state that had the tradition of Ghees. These traditions are the identity of a city. They should be preserved hence we are organising this competition after Holi,” Tomar told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/cops-to-revive-surats-ghees-tradition/articleshow/81890469.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Vijayawada||Now, irregularities in contract-awarding unearthed by vigilance at Kanaka Durga||Vijayawada: After the string of Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) raids at the Kanaka Durga temple that led to the suspension of 15 employees, it is the turn of vigilance authorities to focus on irregularities at the temple. In a series of raids, officials identified discrepancies in awarding contracts for sanitation maintenance. The temple is the second-largest in the state after Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TDP) and attracts on average, around 25,000 devotees a day. In the wake of incidents such as the three missing silver lions and irregularities exposed in ACB raids, the state government and endowments department had started streamlining administration at the temple. The vigilance department is carrying out a detailed probe into irregularities and drafting a report. Slueths examined documents at the tenders wing, in stores and saree donation counters and seized vital documents. Sources in the department said sanitation tenders at the temple were awarded to KL Technical Services in 2019 without following guidelines. Though there were two other parties in the bidding process, temple officials finalised tenders for KL Technical Services on a nomination basis, even though the then endowments commissioner had vehemently opposed the move. Vigilance officials also stated that though the contract period expired on March 31, 2021, temple authorities are yet to invite tenders for the contract. The endowments department has stated it would take strict action after receiving the report. Meanwhile, the TDP and Jana Sena are demanding suspension of temple executive officer (EO) M V Suresh Babu. “We have been exposing the corrupt practices of EO Suresh Babu from the first day he took charge. But the government ignores us. How can the government continue a probe without suspending or transferring the EO, who himself is accused? Endowments minister should stop supporting corrupt officials and respect the sentiments of devotees,” Jana Sena spokesperson Pothina Mahesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/now-irregularities-in-contract-awarding-unearthed-by-vigilance-at-kanaka-durga/articleshow/81890347.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Children with autism hit hard during pandemic||VISAKHAPATNAM: The pandemic has posed several challenges for children with autism and their parents. On the occasion of World Autism Week, medical experts STOI interacted with said that behavioural issues and attention deficit have worsened in children due to the pandemic-induced lockdown which had resulted in the closure of special schools. In one case, 12-year-old Sumanth (name changed) was brought to his therapist in Visakhapatnam, from Srikakulam after a gap of nine months. The therapist observed that the boy had become somewhat violent, had an angry demeanour while his attention span barely lasted a few minutes. This, from having a attention span of around 30 minutes before the pandemic when he would visit the therapist regularly. Challenges for children with autism were aplenty even before the Covid-19 pandemic as a result of lack of awareness among parents and teachers, an inadequate number of special educators, therapists, and government-funded institutes. Children with autism need various therapists and skill trainers under one roof for proper care and growth. “Children with autism are averse to any change in routine. The pandemic has restricted their movement, interaction with peer groups and habits. Unlike regular children, they cannot attend online classes and therapy when special schools are shut down. Financial constraints, stress and work burden on parents who cannot devote their entire time to their children have worsened the situation for these children, many of whom now need regular medication and not just behaviour therapy,” said Dr Radhakant , a psychiatrist who runs Vivek — a society that looks after needs of children with mental illnesses and autism. Doctors have pointed out that children with autism should have the support of behaviour and speech therapists, psychologists, trainers in extra-curricular activities and skill development. “Self-help skills, social skills, academic skills, occupational and speech-language therapy and vocational training for their rehabilitation and creative engagement are useful for such children,” Dr Radhakant explained. Autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a form of congenital developmental and neurological disorder, characterised by signs such as impaired social interaction, delayed and deviant speech and communication, restricted, repetitive stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests and activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/children-with-autism-hit-hard-during-pandemic/articleshow/81890311.cms||Sulogna Mehta

Though Saturday was a holiday for the court, Justice N Nagaresh conducted a sitting at 2pm to hear a petition by Shanimol Usman, who is contesting from Aroor, and a joint petition moved by Udumbanchola candidate EM Augusthy, Devikulam candidate D Kumar, and Peerumedu candidate Cyriac Thomas. Shanimol had contended that there are more than 2,573 double votes in Aroor constituency and sought a directive to the Election Commission to permit video recording of the entire election in 39 booths where the double votes are majorly concentrated. Election Commission’s counsel submitted that webcasting of electoral proceedings has been arranged in 46% of the polling stations in Aroor and sufficient steps have been taken to prevent double voting. The court said only less than 72 hours are remaining for the election and a mandatory direction cannot be issued now as it would affect the free flow of election. However, as the Election Commission has a duty to see that double voting is not permitted, it should consider the feasibility of webcasting or video recording in the booths identified by the petitioner, the court directed. Candidates of Udumbanchola, Devikulam, and Peerumedu constituencies, which are bordering Tamil Nadu, told the court that large number of persons from Tamil Nadu cross the borders and cast votes in Kerala and this seriously affects the electoral process. Though police blocks roads, such roadblocks are removed after some time and bogus voters cross into the state, they contended. The Election Commission informed the court that central armed police will be deployed at the borders on the day before and on the day of the election. Following this, the court said that the proposed action should be implemented without fail, and disposed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-takes-up-pleas-on-fair-election/articleshow/81890823.cms||---

According to officials, the incident came to light when the child was called for counselling after they got a hint that the boy had been sexually assaulted and he narrated his ordeal to the officers of the child welfare home. After the incident was reported to the police, an investigation was initiated and the medical examination of the child was done. Officials claimed that while they do not know the person/persons behind the assault, it appears that the child was subjected to it for prolonged period. A case under relevant section of IPC including unnatural offences has been registered though cops are yet to detain/arrest any person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/12-yr-old-boy-sodomised-case-filed/articleshow/81890822.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Isolate for 10 days & monitor health at home for seven more’||MUMBAI: The BMC on Saturday said Covid patients who are under home isolation will be “discharged” from the civic body’s patients list 10 days after the onset of the first symptoms— that is, if they have no fever for three consecutive days and their oxygen saturation is above 95. Thereafter, the patients will be advised to continue to isolate at home and self-monitor their health for seven more days. There is no need for a Covid test after the home isolation is over. This would mean a patient would remain isolated for a total of 17 days. The BMC allows home isolation if a patient is asymptomatic or has mild symptoms, is a senior citizen or has comorbidities but has no symptoms upon evaluation by an assistant medical health officer in consultation with a family doctor. The BMC does not allow asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms to be admitted if they have requisite facilities at their residence for isolation. Dr Daksha Shah, deputy chief executive health officer, said they were only following the government of India guidelines. “The guidelines say the patient should be isolated for 10 days and after that we show the patient as discharged in our list. The patient is advised to be isolated for another seven days,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-isolate-for-10-days-monitor-health-at-home-for-seven-more/articleshow/81890825.cms||Richa Pinto

This season, however, delayed flowering has led to the delayed arrival of the Goan Mancurad, Hilario and Xavier varieties of the mango. “There is a considerable delay in the arrival of Mancurad in the local market due to improper and sparse flowering as a result of which there was scattered fruit setting,” principal scientist, fruit science, Old Goa-based, ICAR - Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute, A R Desai, said. Flowers of some trees got damaged due to the unseasonal rain seen in January and February and some trees are flowering now. “This is of no use since it will rain again in June by which time the fruits will not be ready for harvest,” he said. Only Alphonso mangoes are available in the market currently, while the Mancurad variety is very limited. Hilario on the other hand, which enters markets by this time, may be available only by the month-end. Farmer Nestor Rangel’s mango farm in Valpoi, Sattari experienced a good flowering season this year. However, unseasonal rain and thunderstorms destroyed most of the flowers. “I usually get about 50,000 mangoes, but this year I will be happy if I even get half the quantity. The Mancurad flowering was delayed owing to which there aren’t any fruits yet. We should, however, be able to harvest the variety in May,” he said. Rangel, who also has a few trees in his village, St Estevam, said that the trees there have not flowered, this year. Chorao and Madkai, which are some of the popular Mancurad mango producing areas, have also not had a sizeable harvest for commercial sale. Late fruition varieties like Fernandin and Musarat have not yet flowered due to extended and excessive rain. Kesar and Amrapali, which are introduced varieties, have shown a scattered flowering season thus leading to a disappointing fruit-setting. “It is a very weak season this time due to the climatic conditions. Goa has received more than 4,000mm rain, which has affected the normal physiology of the growth of the crop. Even the soil nutrients are washed away because of the percolation of water which means the physiological needs of the tree are not met. The temperature variations of fluctuating heat and cold have also disturbed the crop,” Desai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/off-season-rain-hits-mango-crop-delays-arrival-in-mkts/articleshow/81891254.cms||Nida Sayed

Chemically polluted water drains into the river daily despite NGT imposing a ban on discharge of effluents into the waterbody. A few days ago, the HRTS plant near the river crashed leading to lethal chemical effluents reaching a cattle fairground at Tilwara, around 15km away. Mallinath cattle fair is slated to be held on the ground this month. Pradushan Nivaran Evum Paryavaran Sankarshan Samiti secretary Om Prakash Saini informed about breaking of the plant following which samiti president Tulsaram Choudhary reached the spot and informed the pollution control board officials. Later, the state pollution control board in Jaipur, directed to close all factories associated with Balotara CETP till the under-construction plant was ready and started functioning. It is alleged that in the name of an accident by CETP trust, the wall of the plant was breached and chemically polluted water was dumped into the river. CETP trust Balotara had the responsibility to abide by the NGT orders, but the polluted water was discharged into the waterbody. HRTS (mini dam for storing treated water) of Balotara CETP at Jasol border breached at two places a few days ago. The treated polluted water from the factories went into the river. The water reached Tilwara. It is to be mentioned that the cattle fair is to be organised there after Holi, which may face issues due to the effluents. CETP president Subhash Mehta said that he visited the site and prima facie, it appears that some unidentified people had broken it. There were no chances of the breach of the wall. The water has been directed into the pond by a pump. Rajasthan pollution control board regional officer Amit Joyal said that treated water from many factories comes to HRTS which was above its capacity. CETP Balotara was repeatedly being warned and notice was given, but they did not pay any attention and thus the temporary dam was to breach. He said that the Jaipur office has been apprised about it. According to the information from official sources, the 18mld plant worth Rs 128 crore is under construction, to retreat the polluted water coming out from Balotara factories and is expected to be complete in 15 days. Till then, it has been directed to close all factories till the plant starts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/effluents-pollute-luni-despite-ngt-ban/articleshow/81890827.cms||---

The SC had on September 14, 2018 appointed the three-member panel headed by its former judge D K Jain while directing the Kerala government to cough up Rs 50 lakh compensation for compelling Narayanan to undergo “immense humiliation”. The scientist was arrested when the Congress was heading the government in Kerala. The panel, after investigation, submitted its report in a sealed cover to the apex court recently. The CBI, in its probe, had held that the then top police officers in Kerala were responsible for Narayanan’s illegal arrest. The case also had its political fallout, with a section in the Congress targeting the then chief minister late K Karunakaran over the issue, that eventually led to his resignation. Over a period of almost two-and-a-half years, the panel headed by Justice Jain examined the circumstances leading to the arrest. The espionage case, which had hit the headlines in 1994, pertained to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India’s space programme to foreign countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian women. The 79-year-old former scientist, who was given a clean chit by the CBI, maintained that the Kerala Police had “fabricated” the case and the technology he was accused to have stolen and sold in the 1994 case did not even exist at that time. Narayanan had approached the apex court against a Kerala High Court judgment that said “no action needed to be taken” against former DGP Siby Mathews, who was then heading the SIT probe team, two retired superintendents of police, K K Joshua and S Vijayan, and the then deputy director, Intelligence Bureau, R B Shreekumar, who were later held responsible by the CBI for the scientist’s illegal arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/isro-espionage-case-probe-panel-submits-report-to-sc/articleshow/81890828.cms||---

In the real-time bidding process to decide which personalised ads a user sees when a web page loads, hundreds of businesses get a user’s personal data, including search history, IP address, age and gender. “Few Americans realise that some auction participants are storing ‘bidstream’ data.

The alternative road, from Anmod to Khanapur, remains closed between 6pm and 6am on consecutive days and sugarcane-laden trucks have to be parked a whole night at Anmod if any truck reaches post 6pm. Karnataka had taken up the roadway works from Khanapur to Anmod within its jurisdiction. To speed up work, Dilip Buildcon, the road infrasctructure company, had split it into two phases. The Ramnagar to Khanapur four-lane stretch was scheduled in phase one and the Ramnagar to Goa border two-lane stretch in the next phase. With the ongoing construction, vehicles proceeding to Karnataka via Anmod have to travel through a forest road from Anmod to Khanapur. But with the road remaining closed between 6pm to 6am trucks reaching Anmod after 6pm have to spend the night there. “This halt delays transportation by a day. If the trucks reach the factory on time, they can be unloaded quickly and do an extra trip”, said Francis ‘Aytin’ Mascarenhas who has shouldered the responsibility of sending the sugarcane for processing to factories in neighbouring states. He said the road closure has also increased the travel distance by 10km. He has already despatched 19,932 tonnes of sugarcane toa factory in Khanapur, as well as 14,00 and 880 tonnes to Chandgad taluka of Maharashtra. A source said that the road work was halted as permission for construction in the forest areas was challenged and a stay order was issued. Work on the Anmod-Mollem stretch has also been incomplete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/road-closure-at-anmod-hits-cane-transport/articleshow/81891257.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

Despite the killing of more than 550 people by the security forces since the coup, protesters are coming out every day, to voice opposition to the overthrow of an elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi.Security forces in the town of Monywa fired on a crowd killing at least four people and wounding several, two media outlets said. “They started firing non-stop with both stun grenades and live rounds,” a protester in Monywa, who declined to be identified, said via a messaging app. “People backed off and quickly put up barriers but a bullet hit a person in front of me, in the head. He died on the spot.” One man was shot and killed in the town of Thaton, the Bago Weekly Journal online news portal and locals reported. Separately, state media announced that authorities had issued warrants for another 20 celebrities — including social media influencers, singers and models — under a law against inciting dissent in the armed forces, taking the number of warrants issued for high-profile democracy campaigners over the past day to 38. The charge can carry a prison term of three years. One of the wanted, actress Paing Phyoe Thu said she would not be cowed. “As long as I’m alive I’ll oppose the military dictatorship who are killing people. The revolution must prevail,” she said on Facebook. Her whereabouts were not immediately known. Military teams were also searching for protest leaders, state media said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/myanmar-junta-hunts-down-critics-kills-five-protesters/articleshow/81893017.cms||---
---||Goa||Congress: Justice Joshi should study Goa Lokayukta Act||Panaji: Questioning the motives of Justice Ambadas Joshi, Congress on Saturday urged the former Bombay high court judge to study the Goa Lokayukta Act to see if he can do justice to the post before accepting the responsibility. Congress president Girish Chodankar also asked Joshi to push the state government to strengthen the Lokayukta Act if the former was keen on cracking down on corruption. Chodankar also demanded that chief minister Pramod Sawant must inform the public of the other names recommended by the selection panel that picked justice Joshi for the post. “ If he (Joshi) is upright, self respecting and is determined to give justice, then he should speak to former Lokayukta P K Misra and only then accept the post,” Chodankar said. He also asked justic Joshi to decide what he will do about the 21 pending orders where Misra has asked the state government to take action. “There is a doubt among many Goans about the new Lokayukta since most of the powers have been diluted. The Act has no powers and so how did the justice take up the post when there are no powers left. How could any upright justice accept the post,” Chodankar said. Earlier, in March, former high court judge U V Bakre, who is currently the chairman of the Goa Human Rights Commission (GHRC), declined to take over the post of the Lokayukta citing “personal reasons”. The high court of Bombay at Goa had directed the state government to appoint a new anti-corruption ombudsman by December 2020. Misra’s tenure ended in September 2020. Congress said that the state government has not made any serious attempt to approach a former chief justice of the Supreme Court for the post of the Lokayukta. “We want to know what happened within the selection panel and who recommended which name,” Chodankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-justice-joshi-should-study-goa-lokayukta-act/articleshow/81891293.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 12-year wait to get flat unfair, realtor told to refund Rs 12 lakh||MUMBAI: Observing that it is unreasonable that a purchaser has to wait to receive possession of a flat 12 years after booking it, Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority, Mumbai, has directed a developer to refund the booking amount. It also sent the flat purchaser’s plea for compensation, for ‘mental agony caused’ to its adjudicating officer to decide the amount payable. MahaRera took note that while Preeti Singh had booked a flat at Arihant Aspire Phase I at Panvel in August 2014, the project is incomplete, and also its registration certificate mentions June 30, 2026 as date of completion. “It shows that to have a flat, the complainant has to still wait for another six years. Hence the said period is unreasonable. In the present case, the booking was done in 2014 and for possession of her flat, the complainant has to wait for 12 years till 2026 from the date of booking,’’ said member Vijay Satbir Singh in the order dated March 26. Singh had booked the flat costing over Rs 38 lakh, excluding other charges. She paid Rs 7 lakh by cheque and was to pay Rs 5 lakh by cash. Her advocate Mohit Bhardwaj said the developer had promised delivery of the flat in December 2017, but received commencement certificate in October 2017. Advocate for M/s Arihant Abode Ltd said Singh made a part payment of Rs 7 lakh and, despite reminders, did not pay the balance. In October 2020, it cancelled her booking but she did not collect the refund. The developer denied receiving Rs 5 lakh cash. MahaRera said though booking was cancelled, the amount was not refunded. “It shows the said cancellation has not attained finality and the same is illegal and bad in law. Hence, the same stands set aside and it is held that the complainant is an allottee of this project,” he said. MahaRera noted that while the developer says it received only Rs 7 lakh from Singh, the August 6, 2014 reservation/ allotment letter mentions total consideration of the flat was over Rs 38 lakh plus Rs 5 lakh toward other charges. Singh’s bank statement showed she withdrew Rs 5 lakh on August 9, 2014 and on the same date, the developer issued her a separate letter for car parking space. So, it can be inferred that she paid it towards car park mentioned as ‘other charges’ in the allotment letter. The developer is directed to refund Rs 12 lakh to Singh after forfeiting 10% towards administrative charges within a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai12-year-wait-to-get-flat-unfair-realtor-told-to-refund-rs-12-lakh/articleshow/81891364.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Though the Goa Agricultural Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 2017 was introduced to clear tenancy cases immediately, thousands are pending for more than three years, government records show. Revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate has given a written assurance on the floor of the House that the pending cases will be resolved. The Goa Agricultural Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 2017, was introduced by the earlier Manohar Parrikar government so that cases that came under the preview of the Act could be disposed of within three years. Monserrate attributed the delay in clearing the cases to delays caused by the stakeholders in the cases. “The cases which are pending for more than three years will be disposed of by the respective mamlatdars or joint mamlatdars. The reasons for non-disposal of cases are mainly on account of non-appearance or pending reply from the opponents, evidence, etc,” she said. These cases are mostly found pending at various stages including for evidence presentation, filing of written arguments and cross examinations. Most of these were transferred back to the mamlatdar court in May 2019 from civil courts with the hope of speedy disposal. Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte, who was the earlier revenue minister, had asked the government about the status of the pending tenancy cases and what steps the government intended to take to clear cases pending for more than three years. Monserrate informed Khaunte that a total of 3,586 tenancy cases are pending across various talukas. The revenue minister also said that during the Covid-19 pandemic, cases were not taken up for hearing in view of the social distancing and health guidelines in force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/more-than-3500-agricultural-tenancy-cases-await-disposal/articleshow/81891333.cms||---

Monserrate had asked the government whether the transport department had prepared any proposal to improve the city shuttle services to help decongest the capital city to which Godinho appeared to put the ball in Monserrate’s court. “The transport department will facilitate initiative taken by the CCP and Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Ltd (IPSCDL) to improve decongestion in the city, congestion caused due to movement of people and vehicles to ferry people to casinos,” Godinho said. Monserrate is a director on the board of IPSCDL, which is the SPV formed to implement the smart city mission. Monserrate’s son Rohit is the new mayor of Panaji. Highlighting the increase in speeding, Monserrate said that the transport department should identify and install traffic signals at important junctions in the state. Godinho said that “providing electronic traffic signal system” is the responsibility of local authorities. The transport minister also said that necessary route permits to operate a shuttle service for patrons and staff of offshore casinos will be granted by the transport department, but was quiet about the operator of the shuttle service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/transport-dept-to-work-with-ccp-to-decongest-panaji/articleshow/81891369.cms||---

He also accused the BJP of engineering the attack on him. Talking to media persons, Tikait said that these attacks will happen a hundred times, but he will not change his programmes and continue with the mahapanchayats. “ABVP students were present there,” he said. Addressing a mahapanchayat in Aligarh’s Gonda village, Rakesh Tikait said, “Jaan Jane tak hamle honge…yeh programme nahi rukega (these will happen but these programmes will not stop till I am alive).” On the upcoming panchayat elections in the state, Rakesh appealed to the farmers — “not to forget that this government is a cheat”. “Farmers will not leave this (agitation) easily as they know how to handle problematic bulls,” he said, adding that this will take time. Meanwhile, BKU chief Naresh Tikait has appealed to all farmers to “reach Ghazipur border for a panchayat against the attack on Rakesh in Rajasthan”. In a late night meeting on Friday, Naresh made the appeal in Sisauli village of Muzaffarnagar, which is also the headquarters of BKU. He also said the attack on Rakesh was "pre-planned". “Farmers across the country are angry over the Rajasthan incident. Therefore, an urgent meeting was called and a mahapanchayat will be held on the Ghazipur border on April 4. Further action will be taken in that panchayat,” Naresh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/mahapanchayats-will-not-stop-even-after-attacks-says-rakesh-tikait/articleshow/81890013.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Meerut||Hapur gangrape & murder Main accused, 22, arrested||MEERUT: The main accused in the alleged gangrape and murder of a girl, 15, from Hapur was arrested on Saturday. He confessed to holding the girl captive for a week. The main accused, 22, is a relative of the girl. “He was arrested near the Vait village on Saturday by a joint police team,” a statement by Hapur Police said. He was then questioned by the police. “He said she had gotten sick in captivity. On March 29, when her condition deteriorated, he took her to a hospital in Noida. Not much improved. On March 31, he said, he took her to see a doctor again, this time to another hospital in Noida. This was the hospital where the body was eventually found,” Hapur SP Neeraj Jadaun said. The girl had gone missing on March 22 after leaving for school. In the nine days between then and March 31, when the hospital where her body was lying abandoned called her parents, the main accused had been visiting the girl’s family. He would keep telling them that they should not go to the police because it could bring disrepute to the family. All that time, the girl was held captive at his house. To ascertain whether he had indeed taken her to a hospital on March 29, a police team has been sent to the Noida hospital in question, a Hapur Police official said. The motive, however, is not entirely clear. The family has accused six of his family and an unidentified person, who was seen riding pillion on the bike with the girl (which could have been her corpse) to the hospital on March 31. The main accused and this unidentified man had dropped off the body at the hospital and, when she was declared dead, had slipped away. The autopsy report had found the cause of death was smothering, which would indicate she was killed. “The claim of the accused, that she was sick, contradicts what the postmortem report found,” a police official said.

The woman filed her complaint on Friday night, a day after the incident. Giving details, Dharamveer Singh, Bijnor superintendent of police, said, "The Kiratpur-based woman runs a beauty parlour in Kashmir. She had contacted municipal councillor of Kiratpur nagar palika Arshad Chaudhary to help her in getting a ration card and a cooking gas connection.

The partner, Mohd Javed Shaikh, had tried to project the case as an accident but he got caught in the web of his own lies. Sarika Patel, a mother of three children, got involved with Shaikh, who was also a divorcee. The duo was in a live-in relationship since a few years. It’s learnt that the couple had been living and working at different cities. They had come to Nagpur on March 22 in search of work. The couple was staying at an under-construction site at Deepaknagar near Jaripatka. Apart from working there, they also stayed on the first floor of the construction site as caretakers. In the eveing on March 31, Sarika had gone to her neighbour’s place for a lengthy and late chat which made Shaikh lose his cool. He abused her and wanted her to come back home. Sarika too got enraged and confronted Shaikh before deciding to return to her neighbour’s place. As Sarika was leaving, Shaikh hurled a brick which landed on her head. She collapsed on the spot. Police said no one had witnessed this part of the drama. Shaikh then hurriedly brought Sarika’s body inside the building and kept it under the porch before raising an alarm stating that she fell from the first floor. “As Sarika’s body was under the porch, it was not believable that she had fallen from the first floor. But there was no witness,” said senior inspector Amol Deshmukh of Kapilnagar police station. “The owner of the under-construction site had installed a CCTV camera which captured the entire episode. Shaikh was arrested for murder,” said Deshmukh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/live-in-partner-kills-woman-with-a-brick/articleshow/81890845.cms||Soumitra Bose

Lakhan, 18, and a friend of his are among four suspects in the gang-rape of a girl, 14, who studied at a tuition he went to. On Thursday evening, the girl had managed to get home, collapsed at the gate, gave Lakhan’s name and said three others she didn’t know had gang-raped her. While her family said she had been poisoned by them, police said she had poisoned herself after being raped. On Saturday, Lakhan and his friend were being taken back from the local court in Meerut where they had been produced. “He snatched the service pistol that belonged to one of the policemen escorting him and fled police custody,” Meerut SP (rural) Keshav Kumar said. This happened on Meerut Road, a statement by the Meerut Police said, when he managed to open a window of the police vehicle he was being taken in, got out and, with his handcuffs still on, ran to the left of the road. “When he was cornered, he fired at the police. He was shot in the leg in retaliatory firing,” Kumar added. He was then taken to a hospital and, after treatment, to jail. “Efforts are being made to trace the other suspects who are at large,” Kumar further said. An FIR had been lodged against Lakhan and an unidentified person under the Pocso Act and for gang-rape, murder and poisoning. The autopsy report of the girl, meanwhile, was inconclusive: “Cause of death will be given after a viscera chemical analysis report.” Police had earlier said a four-line suicide note had been found at the girl’s house, in which she had accused Lakhan and three friends of raping her and said she was going to kill herself. Investigating officers said the note will be sent for forensic examination to ascertain if it was actually written by her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/main-accused-in-meerut-gangrape-of-teen-shot-at-in-encounter-injured/articleshow/81890018.cms||---

As of now, over 50% cyber crime cases have been closed due to lack of evidence. Speaking to TOI, crime branch superintendent of police Shobit Saxena said, “Once the work of the lab is completed, it will immensely help investigations using cutting-edge technology and tools to detect cyber crime and forensic investigations of such crimes.” Saxena said that most of the work on the lab has been completed and some equipment will arrive next week. “The lab will soon be functional,” he said. The Cyber Crime Cell (CCC) of the Goa police has closed over half of its cases due to lack of evidence. Not a single person has been convicted in the state for cyber crime. Since 2014, 118 cases have been registered at the CCC and closure reports have been filed in 61 cases. Currently, the crime branch has a small lab set up under corporate social responsibility. An alarming rise in cyber crime cases in the state have remained unsolved due to lack of infrastructure and cyber experts. Investigations into cyber crimes including financial crimes involving cheating, credit card frauds, money laundering, cyber photography involving production and distribution of pornographic material, sale of illegal articles such as narcotics, weapons and wildlife, intellectual property crimes such as theft of computer source code, software piracy, copyright infringement, trademark violation, deployment of virus, cyber-attack, cyber terrorism, etc, requires computer skills, mainly for on-site imaging of disks and on-site analysis and tracking of leads. However, the lack of skilled manpower is a major problem Goa police is facing. In December 2013, the state government had granted permission to set up a cyber crime cell in the state and to recruit technical persons for the same. A year later, the same was operational.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/work-on-cyber-crime-lab-nearing-completion/articleshow/81891372.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Why 8-year delay to finish NSEL probe? HC to city top cop||Mumbai: Frowning at a delay of eight years in completing the probe despite a first information report being registered in 2013, Bombay high court has directed the commissioner of Mumbai police to personally explain the breach of an undertaking to file a charge sheet. The direction by a bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale came on a 2018 petition by 63 Moons Technologies Ltd (formerly Financial Technologies (India) Ltd) in respect of the FIR by Economic Offences Wing against it the National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL) scam. Its advocate Abad Ponda submitted that the FIR was registered on September 30, 2013 but till date investigation is not completed and consequently chargesheet not filed. On January 10, 2020 the high court was told investigation will be completed and chargesheet filed on February 29, 2020. Special public prosecutor Avinash Avhad said investigation is not completed and further time would be necessary. He said the investigation officer retired in May 2020. The judges expressed “strong displeasure” at the non-compliance of undertaking given to the court. In their March 25 order, they noted that “at least on more than 20 dates the matter was listed,” but every time the response on compliance made is “evasive and not satisfactory”. “Admittedly the FIR is registered in the year 2013 and till 2021 the investigation is not completed and resultantly chargesheet or report, as the case may be, is not filed.” The judges said they “find considerable force” in Ponda’s submission that delay in the investigation seriously hampers the right of the accused to avail appropriate remedy/remedies at appropriate stages including filing for discharge before the court. “In our prima facie opinion, by any standard, it is beyond comprehension to accept the stand taken by the respondent that even officer is not sure when the investigation will be completed and chargesheet or the report will be filed,” said the judges who also “prima facie” opined that there is breach of the oral undertaking given to the high court. The judges directed the commissioner “to call for a report of the case and/or investigation paper and file his personal affidavit”, and not to authorise any other subordinate officer including the joint commissioner of police (in charge of Economic Offences Wing), explaining why the January 10, 2020 undertaking is not complied with.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-why-8-year-delay-to-finish-nsel-probe-hc-to-city-top-cop/articleshow/81891396.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Shailesh is currently out on bail on medical ground in a Rs 200 crore scam case. Santej inspector Vanrajsinh Manjaria said Shailesh and three have been arrested after a fresh complaint was filed by his elder brother Mukesh Bhandari with Santej police on Saturday against Shailesh. Mukesh stated that at about 2pm when he was returning from Gandhinagar, his son Siddharth called him and said that Shailesh Bhandari and about 25 other people had gathered outside the gate of Electrotherm at Palodia in Kalol taluka of Gandhinagar. Siddharth told Mukesh that Shailesh had a heated argument with the security guards and even attacked them. Siddharth told Mukesh not to come to the factory and told him that he had called the police. Mukesh stated that he immediately drove to the factory in Palodia and on entering the factory through the main gate he saw Shailesh and some 25 men of which two were armed with guns and the other men were carrying sticks. Shailesh and his men had locked the security guards inside the security cabin. Mukesh stated that when he later opened the security cabin, Ramprasad Kotar and Antim Dwivedi told him that Shailesh and his men had come in red SUV and four other vehicles. The guard told Mukesh that Shailesh and his men told them that they should not work at the company and henceforth their men would be deployed there. The guard said they were abused by Shailesh and his men and hit with sticks and the butts of guns. Mukesh produced CCTV footage from the gate in support of his complaint. Police registered a case of dacoity, wrongful confinement, voluntarily causing hurt, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace, unlawful assembly, rioting and rioting with deadly weapons. In February, after Shailesh was arrested for a fake billing scam, the state goods and service tax department found eight live cartridges at his office in Palodia village. Police also found 898 bottles of imported liquor worth Rs 33 lakh packed inside boxes branded with the company’s logo. On March 11, Santej police had arrested Shailesh Bhandari, following a complaint by Mukesh Bhandari, alleging that the former had availed of a Rs 200 crore loan by forgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/electrotherm-md-bhandari-booked-for-dacoity-rioting/articleshow/81890849.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra to promote Std 1-8 students without exams||NAGPUR: The state’s school education department has decided to promote students of Std I-VIII without exams due to the current Covid-19 crisis. As per existing rules, the Right To Education (RTE) Act prohibits holding back students till at least Std VIII, though an exam needs to be taken. For Std IX and XI, which are outside the purview of the no-fail policy, the state government will be taking a decision soon. “All students till Std VIII will be promoted automatically to the next academic level. We have been reaching out to students through various mediums for ensuring that their education does not stop,” said school education minister Varsha Gaikwad. Even last year the government had allowed promotion of students till Std VIII as schools were closed and the entire country was under a strict lockdown. For state’s board exams, the time table has already been announced and the minister has ruled out any chance of online exams. Last week, Gaikwad said, “Due to various technical issues, conducting online board exams across the state won’t be possible. Offline exams will be conducted by following strict safety protocols.” The state government has announced a slew of sops for students, including extra time during board theory papers plus a guaranteed second chance to those who miss out because of being either Covid-19 positive or unable to reach the centre due to local restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-to-promote-std-1-8-students-without-exams/articleshow/81891390.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Lucknow||Testing times: Inconclusive RT-PCR reports put a family of nine in Lucknow in coronavirus dilemma||LUCKNOW: Even after giving swab samples twice in five days for RT-PCR test for Covid-19, a family in Alambagh is yet to get a conclusive report. On both the occasions, when the family members logged on to the lab report portal of UP health department, it showed that “repeated sampling is required”. What has added to the confusion is that the result of the first sampling of one of the members changed to positive after a few hours, the others are still in the dark. While the health department said that third sampling would be done soon, the family, which is exposed to the risk of infection as a few members are symptomatic, fears that a delay may take a toll on their health. It all began on March 24 when advocate Ashutosh Mishra (50), who is also the former vice-president of the Central Bar Association, developed influenza like symptoms, two days after he participated in the bar elections. The condition persisted for five days. He also came to know that a few of his colleagues, with whom he had come in contact during elections, have tested positive. “I immediately called the Integrated Covid and Command Centre and informed the authorities about the situation with the request to get my family tested. On March 30, a health department team took my samples and that of three members of my family. The report uploaded on March 31 on lab result portal showed that repeated sampling is required for all four of us,” Mishra told TOI. “Out of curiosity, I rechecked my report after four hours. The result this time showed that I was tested positive, but the status of others remained unchanged. I informed the command centre about it. Another team was sent on April 1 which took samples of all the nine members of my family. However, the test results uploaded on the portal on April 2 again showed that repeated sampling is required,” he added. Mishra said rapid antigen tests of all members came negative but it was not reliable as he had also tested negative in antigen test and found positive in RT-PCR report. “The team did not take my sample during the second visit on the ground that my RT-PCR report is positive, but how do I trust the result,” he asked. Mishra again called the command centre on April 2 and lodged a complaint. “The operator asked us to go to nearest CHC for tests but I refused as venturing out would put the public at risk,” he said. Ashutosh’s brother, Sanjay Mishra, who is also an advocate, said: “It has been four days now that four of our family members have fever and cough but we are not sure about the status because of the laxity of health department.” CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said, “We are looking into the case and will take action if any laxity is found. The family will be tested again on Sunday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/testing-times-inconclusive-rt-pcr-reports-put-a-family-of-nine-in-coronavirus-dilemma/articleshow/81891386.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

During an investigation conducted by officers of Central GST Division, Bareilly, under Gautam Buddh Nagar Commissionerate, against Ajay Sharma, the proprietor of Vishu Traders, Bareilly, and Vishnu Trading Company, Lucknow, he admitted being owner of these firms, said well-placed sources. Sharma admitted that both the firms were constituted solely for the purpose of GST invoicing without actual supply of goods, said sources. According to SV Singh, principal commissioner, Central GST, Gautam Buddh Nagar, “Searches were conducted at the principal place of business of Vishu Traders, Bareilly, and two residential premises of Ajay Sharma. During the searches, incriminating documents such as copies of manual invoices and e-way bills issued by his other firm in Lucknow, a few PAN cards, Aadhaar cards issued in the name of other persons, etc, were recovered. The firm showed no business activity of any kind. The entire raid unearthed GST fraud involving issuing of fake invoices worth Rs 94.79 crore involving fake ITC of Rs 8.77 crore.” The commodities he dealt with were mentha oil, oilseeds, pulses, scrap, etc. “We have identified several recipient firms, which had availed fraudulently passed ITC, and further investigations are still underway,” added Singh. The fraud makes Sharma liable for punishment under sections 132(1)(b), 132(1)(c ) and 132(1)(i) of the CGST Act, 2017, said sources. The accused was arrested on Thursday under relevant sections of the CGST Act, 2017 and produced before the special chief judicial magistrate, Meerut, and was sent to jail on judicial remand for 14 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-businessman-involved-in-issuing-fake-invoices-of-rs-95-crore-arrested/articleshow/81890023.cms||Sandeep Rai

General secretary Amarnath Panjikar also accused BJP of insulting Shivaji. “Sawant has not even reacted to the tourism department calling Maratha warriors ‘invaders’,” he said. “We condemn the CM’s act, and demand the sacking of tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar.” He also criticised BJP functionaries for organising birthday celebrations violating Covid-19 norms, and produced photos and videos to show hundreds, including Sawant, Dayanand Sopte, Sadanand Tanavade, Vinay Tendulkar and Subhash Shirodkar sitting without masks and with no social distancing. Referring to the district collectors imposing Section 144 banning public celebrations, Panjikar said this exposes BJP’s intention to restrict participation of devotees in traditional festivals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-anti-goan-for-restricting-goan-festivals-says-congress/articleshow/81891387.cms||---
---||World||Inspired by ‘La La Land’, China launches musical to counter Uighur abuse claims||BEIJING: A new state-produced musical set in Xinjiang inspired by Hollywood blockbuster “La La Land” has hit China’s cinemas, portraying a rural idyll of ethnic cohesion devoid of repression, mass surveillance and even the mention of Islam — the religion of the majority Uighur population. China is on an elaborate PR offensive to rebrand the region where the US says “genocide” has been inflicted on the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. As allegations of forced labour inside Xinjiang’s cotton industry draw renewed global attention, Beijing is curating a different narrative for the troubled region. Rap songs, photo exhibitions and a musical — “The Wings of Songs” — are leading the cultural reframing of Xinjiang. Beijing denies allegations of abuses and has instead recast the region as a haven of social cohesion and economic renewal that has turned its back on years of extremism thanks to benevolent state intervention. The movie focuses on three men from different ethnic groups dreaming of making it big as they gather musical inspiration across cultures in the snow-capped mountains and desertscapes of the region. After the release of the film, state-run Global Times reported that overseas blockbusters such as “La La Land” have “inspired Chinese studios” to produce their own hits. But the film omits the CCTV cameras and security check. Also absent are references to Islam.

Locals alleged they were threatened by Trinamool men, though none from the party could be contacted for comment.

The hospital requires 70 to 80 bags of blood and 20 platelets every day. “After Saturday’s appeal, we got some donors and we should be able to manage till Tuesday, but we need more,” he said. Many blood donation camps have been cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Vinay Shetty of Think Foundation that works for thalassemia children who need regular transfusions said the blood shortage is acute. Most major hospitals in the city have stocks only for the next few days. The donor pool has also shrunk as people who get vaccinated against Covid cannot donate blood for two months. Those willing to donate can call Tata Memorial’s 24x7 blood bank (24177000, extn 4690). Housing colonies and associations can contact State Blood Transfusion Council (022-22830216, sbtc @mahasbtc.com) or Think Foundation (vinay@thinkfoundation.org or 9820146448).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tata-memorial-seeks-blood-donors-as-banks-dry-up/articleshow/81890857.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Coronavirus: ‘Complacency, high mobility behind spike’||LUCKNOW: The exponential surge in coronavirus infections in the second wave is mainly due to the carelessness of a section of people during Holi festival, denial mode among many due to complacency, unrestricted mobility and inadequate enforcement of safety protocol by the administration, according to experts. They also do not rule out the possibility of a new variant, more infectious than the earlier one, which may be driving the second wave. They said the surge in transmission rate with more deaths would continue in coming weeks. There were only seven cases on March 5 which increased by 150 times in less than a month to reach 1,041. Though the transmission rate grew steadily from March 15, the number of cases were below 500 before Holi (March 28 and 29). The incidence rate erupted soon after the festival with an average of over 900 cases daily from April 1 to 3. “During contact tracing, we found that many got infected during Holi because they ignored safety protocols. Later, these people transmitted the virus to their family members and colleagues, leading to a massive surge after the festival,” said CMO office spokesperson Yogesh Raghuvashi. Head, medicine, KGMU, Prof Virendra Atam said, “People are blatantly ignoring Covid advisory.  Gatherings in parties and ceremonies are taking place without safety protocol. Overcrowding is a common sight. Enforcement of norms has not been up to the mark.” He said the variant now seems to be more infectious than the one which dominated the first wave. “A through study is required to identify the transmissibility and virulence of the variant,” he added. Microbiologist at Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences Prof Manodeep Sen said the irresponsible behaviour of people defeated the purpose of vaccination which was supposed to break the transmission chain.  “Many are complacent after seeing the earlier high recovery rate while some have dropped their guard after getting vaccinated without realising that they can still catch infection and pass on to others,” he added. Former head of microbiology department at IMS-BHU, Prof Anil Kumar Gulati, said there were restrictions on the movement of people within the state and country during the first wave, besides many institutions were also closed then. “Mobility from one place to another, including the worst-hit states, is much greater as most facilities have been unlocked,” he added. Experts pointed out that herd immunity acquired during the first wave had declined as antibodies last for only 3-4 months, which has provided a chance to flourish all over again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/complacency-high-mobility-behind-spike/articleshow/81891398.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

He also accused the BJP of engineering the attack on him. Talking to media persons, Tikait said that these attacks will happen a hundred times, but he will not change his programmes and continue with the mahapanchayats. “ABVP students were present there,” he said. Addressing a mahapanchayat in Aligarh’s Gonda village, Rakesh Tikait said, “Jaan Jane tak hamle honge…yeh programme nahi rukega (these will happen but these programmes will not stop till I am alive).” On the upcoming panchayat elections in the state, Rakesh appealed to the farmers — “not to forget that this government is a cheat”. “Farmers will not leave this (agitation) easily as they know how to handle problematic bulls,” he said, adding that this will take time. Meanwhile, BKU chief Naresh Tikait has appealed to all farmers to “reach Ghazipur border for a panchayat against the attack on Rakesh in Rajasthan”. In a late night meeting on Friday, Naresh made the appeal in Sisauli village of Muzaffarnagar, which is also the headquarters of BKU. He also said the attack on Rakesh was "pre-planned". “Farmers across the country are angry over the Rajasthan incident. Therefore, an urgent meeting was called and a mahapanchayat will be held on the Ghazipur border on April 4. Further action will be taken in that panchayat,” Naresh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mahapanchayats-will-not-stop-even-after-attacks-says-rakesh-tikait/articleshow/81890044.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The case involved R K Voyagers India Pvt Ltd, a city-based booking firm, which had booked a Jet Airways ticket from Ahmedabad to Toronto for Hetang Bhavsar on March 7, 2019, for Rs 47,100. The flight was scheduled to depart on August 18, but the airline stopped its operations by then. Hetang had to book a ticket with another airline and left for Toronto on August 19. Hetang’s father Anishkumar dragged the booking firm to the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Ahmedabad demanding refund of the ticket. He also demanded Rs 92,000 more for the second ticket that they had to purchase on the spot. The booking agent said they were ready to refund, but the amount was stuck with the airline company, which had wound up, and the process was pending in NCLT. Before the tribunal, the airline company had submitted an exhaustive list of financial obligations including the ATA authorized travel agents including R K Voyagers. The airline had to pay Rs 13.73 lakh to the agent in outstanding dues. The agent said that the ticket will be refunded as and when NCLT finalizes the dispute. It added that as a booking agency, its role was limited to ticket booking and getting the ticket issued. After hearing the case, the commission said that the booking agent had nothing to do with the default committed by the service provider, Jet Airways. Moreover, the complainant had not made the airline company a party respondent. “The booking agent should refund ticket amount after NCLT verdict, and it is not liable to pay for another ticket for another airline,” the consumer court said, adding, “When the matter is pending before a superior authority like NCLT, it is not required by us to pass a separate order...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/refund-jet-airways-ticket-after-nclt-verdict-court/articleshow/81890851.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Five Telangana MLAs attended drug parties in Bengaluru: Police||BENGALURU: Bengaluru police have claimed that at least five legislators from Telangana allegedly attended ‘dance-and-trance’ parties in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Investigators say those associated with a drug cartel organised the parties and seven members of the gang have already been arrested. While police officials are yet to reveal the MLAs’ names or confirm if they had actually consumed drugs in the parties, sources said they have collected their names from those arrested and other suspects. Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant told STOI: “During investigation of the drug case, a couple of witnesses made statements and we are examining them. Since the matter is being probed, details can’t be shared.” The drug case, which is being investigated by Govindapura police, pointed to the complicity of several influential persons after the arrest of two foreign nationals and seizure of drugs worth Rs 3.5 crore from them on February 27. Based on their statements, police searched the residence of Kannada film producer Shankare Gowda apart from questioning reality show participant Mastan Chandra and small-time Telugu actor Tanish. Gowda was arrested on March 23 on charges of hosting drug parties. During questioning, Gowda reportedly dropped the names of two Hyderabad-based businessmen, Sandeep Reddy and Kalahar Reddy, as attendees to the parties, which were organised by an event manager known as Malhotra and Chandra. An investigating officer said: “We had summoned Sandeep to record his statement and he told us a few MLAs from Telangana had been present at the parties. These MLAs were brought by Kalahar, who is yet to be called for questioning.” Police said they have issued notices to Kalahar. “We will get to know the names and other details of all those associated with these parties after we record his statement,” a police officer said, pointing out that seven persons, including six foreign nationals, have been arrested till now. Tanish and Chandra have been treated as witnesses by police so far. Sources said foreign girls were also brought to the parties to entertain guests. Additional commissioner of police (east) S Murugan said: “We have summoned a few people from Telangana. We are probing the case and can’t share more details.” Meanwhile, police sources said the arrested had taken the name of a politician named Rohith as one of the VIPs who attended the parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/5-t-mlas-attended-drug-parties-in-bluru-police/articleshow/81891411.cms||Santosh kumar.B

Reddy was booked for abetment to suicide of range forest officer (RFO) Deepali Chavan, who shot herself at her home in Harisal, Amravati, on March 25. “The applicant is absent, but his counsel is present. Arguments heard from both sides. The application is rejected,” the judge said in his operative order. Reddy’s lawyers – Manish Jeswani and DK Wadhwani – had sought bail contending that he could be arrested by the police and therefore, he needs protection. Public prosecutor Parikshit Ganorkar opposed the bail plea arguing that since there is no offence registered against Reddy, there’s no point in demanding anticipatory bail. In the suicide note, the deceased RFO had allegedly informed Reddy about the torture meted out to her by deputy chief conservator of forest Vinod Shivkumar, but he ignored her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/achalpur-court-rejects-reddys-bail-petition/articleshow/81891406.cms||---

One of the five accused in the case is a minor, a 17-year-old boy. Isanpur police inspector J V Rana said the four adult accused were sent for pre-arrest Covid test on Saturday. Those nabbed are the girl’s foster father, who is from Sanand; Ravi Makwana, 19, of Saijpur-Piplaj; Dashrath Makwana, 25, of Gyaspur; and Hasmukh Makwana, 24, also of Gyaspur. The girl stated in her complaint that she used to stay with her foster father in Changodar. She said that when her mother was not around she was raped by him. She said he intimidated her into silence. The girl said her mother eventually learnt of the torment and the girl was sent away to a place near Chandola Lake about two months ago. The girl, however, wanted to be with her mother. The day she decided to reunite with her mother, she was waiting for an autorickshaw. Ravi approached her in an autorickshaw and promised to marry her. Ravi then took her to the residence of Hasmukh. Both men raped her there. The girl was thereafter raped by Dashrath. The girl was later told that the 17-year-old boy would marry her. The girl survived the ordeal and filed a complaint with Isanpur police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-nabbed-for-raping-foster-daughter/articleshow/81890855.cms||---

Last month, locals under a common banner of the Calangute constituency forum (CCF) lodged a complaint with the Goa Coastal Zone Mmanagement Authority (GCZMA) claiming that a swimming pool and other illegal structures had been constructed by the beachside property in the no-development zone. Copies of the complaint were sent to Candolim panchayat and other authorities. The panchayat had inspected the site on March 10 and the report prepared by the panchayat secretary states that the structures such as the swimming pool, a deck and some common areas have been built without any license, and hence are illegal. The panchayat then issued a show cause notice to the owners about the illegal structures. However, GCZMA which oversees CRZ violations had not conducted a site inspection, according to CCF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/clear-illegal-structures-in-beach-area/articleshow/81891407.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||‘Vaccines reduce replication of virus, decrease chances of new mutations’||is a mutation in viruses and does it occur every time? Every virus or bacteria has a genetic material called genome. In eukaryotes like humans, there is a DNA - a chemical molecule where there are sequences of nucleotide bases – ATGC - nucleotides. SARS CoV2 is an RNA virus. When a cell divides normally, the DNA forms RNA. RNA then forms proteins, which are the functional molecules like enzymes, antibodies and cytokines. They perform functions, while DNA does not perform function and carries the message which is coded in its sequence of nucleotide bases. When a nucleotide sequence has an error, it results in mutation. During the replication of the virus, it is the enzymes that make a copy of these cells. There is a proof-reading capacity in DNA polymerase, in which the enzymes read and correct the sequence in case of error. The RNA viruses do not have this capacity. For instance, HIV has a reverse transcriptase enzyme that forms DNA from RNA, as the enzyme does not have proof-reading capacity, the error gets incorporated. Therefore, the new virus formed has some or the other defects. What is a variant? What determines that a virus can be virulent or highly transmissible? Variant is a new type of virus which has come out with nucleotide sequence change (mutation) in the genetic make-up. How much functionally active the mutation is, depends on where the mutation occurred. The spike protein has a receptor binding domain (RBD) - that attaches with a human cell. The RBD has a specific sequence that binds with ACE 2 receptor. If there is a variation in this domain, the binding capacity can increase or decrease or can diminish or exceed. Thus, if the new variants bind with higher affinity with the receptor, their transmissibility will increase. Even if the receptors are less, they can bind with greater strength. Whether these new variants will replicate faster or will be more infectious, is unknown. How does genome sequencing help? Normally, there is no random variation or mutation. Mutations occur at specific positions. Random mutations are generally insignificant. Most mutations happen at hotspots or specific positions which are significant. When experts sequence the RNA of the virus, they can see where the change in the nucleotide sequence has occurred or whether it leads to a difference in the amino acid or not. Then if there is amino acid difference, they see its function, if it changes the binding capacity or increases the replication capacity that will increase its virulence. Are the present mutations in the SARS CoV2 able to escape immunity? It is yet not confirmed. The mutations do occur naturally in the viruses and they form variants as they need to evolve and survive so that the antibodies are unable to neutralise these viruses. Till now, it does not appear that there are such changes in the RBD or if these mutations can make vaccines ineffective. But such changes can appear later, as the more the virus replicates; there are more chances of mutations to appear. Can vaccines still work against these variants? Yes, it seems so at the moment. The mutations are influenced by the immunity of the host. If the virus is in an immunocompromised host, it will tend to replicate more. The more the replication, the greater is the chances of mutation. Vaccines reduce replication of the virus thereby decreasing the chances of appearance of new mutations. Consequently, there is a less chance of emergence of escape mutants (where the mutants cannot be destroyed by antibodies). Vaccine induced immunity will reduce viral load and consequently the transmission also. Vaccine is an advantage despite these variants. In fact, the vaccine should be opened for all age groups for herd immunity to be achieved faster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vaccines-reduce-replication-of-virus-decrease-chances-of-new-mutations/articleshow/81876838.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The petitioner stated that there is illegal filling of paddy fields at Socorro and Sangolda, and sought the court’s intervention. “If in the course of inspection, the authorities find that there is indeed any illegal filling of low-lying areas/fields, then the authorities will have to initiate action as is permissible under law at the earliest,” stated the division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar. “The authorities will also have to ensure that until the completion of such action, there is no further illegal filling at the sites in question,” the court added. The petitioner prayed that the paddy fields be restored to their original condition and sought prosecution of the persons responsible for the illegal land filling under section 17 A of the Town and Country Planning Act. Counsel for the petitioner suggested that inspection be done after additional government advocate P Arolkar stated that there was an issue about identification of properties at Sangolda because of incorrect survey numbers. Arolkar stated that the inspection could take place on April 5 at 10am. The court directed the deputy collector to take steps to implement the order dated May 26, 2020 against illegal filling of paddy fields “as expeditiously as possible”. “In particular, we direct the officers like the executive engineer of the electricity department, etc, to render all possible assistance for implementation of the order dated May 26, 2020,” the court stated. The high court called for compliance/progress reports from the deputy collectors by June 14. The petitioners also asked for round the clock vigil over the two sites to ensure that filing up of paddy fields doesn’t continue further in the meantime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/act-against-illegal-filling-of-fields-hc-directs-officials/articleshow/81891412.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Rs 1.9 crore: Environmental damage cost of unscientific dumping at Bhandewadi||NAGPUR: Environmental damage cost due to the toxic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from Bhandewadi dumping ground is Rs1.9 crore per year. Not just this, the total damage cost due to release of leachate into the soil is estimated to be Rs 3.54 lakh. This was revealed in the city’s latest Environmental Status Report (ESR) prepared by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri). The report focuses on identifying and estimating monetary losses on the environment due to release of leachate into the soil and emission of GHGs into the atmosphere at Bhandewadi dumping ground. The damage was assessed with a consideration that there are no major polluting industries existing in nearby vicinity other than dumping. The study estimates a total incurred damage of about Rs1.94 crore every year due to externalities from the dumping site. Located 8km from the city, Bhandewadi yard was started in 1958. The 22 hectare area is poorly managed. TOI has been reporting about problems like air pollution, leachate and groundwater contamination caused due to unscientific dumping of municipal solid waste in the area. As per Neeri’s report, health issues arising from Bhandewadi are not just limited to deteriorated air quality but also by consumption of water contaminated with heavy metals through leachate. “Leachate, when released untreated, not only contaminates water bodies but also soil quality. Continuous discharge of untreated leachate into soil surface results in the formation of inventory for hazardous heavy metals,” it stated. Leachate is the liquid containing innumerable organic and inorganic compounds generated from solid waste. It percolates through the soil and reaches the groundwater. According to scientists, the average concentration of chromium, copper, cadmium, lead, nickel and zinc was found to be relatively high. “Total damage cost due to release of leachate into the soil is estimated to be Rs3.54 lakh. The estimation is done on the basis of total release of heavy metals on soil. In comparison with all seasons, rainy season accounts for more damage cost,” the report stated. Surface and groundwater was also found to be contaminated due to direct discharge of leachate without treatment. “Apart from this, fruit and vegetable bearing plants have tendency to extract minerals and nutrient from soil during their growth. Similarly, heavy metals from leachate-contaminated soil will be taken up by plants generating an inventory of heavy metals beyond safety limits, which when consumed by humans results in health damages,” the report added. The environmental damage cost due to the emission of GHGs was estimated based on social cost of carbon (SCC), also known as the shadow pricing for carbon emissions.

A married man sought custody of a married woman from her father and in-laws, so that they could ink a live-in relationship agreement and stay together. However, the Gujarat High Court disposed of the habeas corpus petition after the woman refused to put her marriage in jeopardy after finding that the man’s wife was not ready to divorce him. The man, a resident of Surendranagar, was having a marital dispute with his wife. He fell in love with another married woman, who was staying at her parents’ house in Surendranagar after having issues with her in-laws in Rajasthan. When they decided to live together, the woman’s father restrained her from meeting her boyfriend. In desperation, the man moved the HC and requested it to release the woman from her father’s custody so that they could live together after executing a live-in relationship deed. The court wondered whether it could issue a writ of habeas corpus for a married woman for a live-in relationship. The court also discussed that the provisions of section 498 of IPC cannot prevent the petitioner from preparing such a deed with a married woman. The court summoned the woman, who was presented before the court through video conferencing. The court questioned them about the situation and it came to know that the man’s wife was not ready to divorce him. On hearing this, the woman told court that if the man was not getting a divorce and cannot marry her, she was not willing to put her marriage in jeopardy. Upon her reluctance to join him, the court did not have any occasion to direct anybody to release the woman to reunite with her boyfriend. The petitioner withdrew his petition. The court allowed the withdrawal of the petition and said, “We chose not to enter into the entire issue as to whether the married man can be permitted in wake of the law on the subject of live-in-relationship with the married woman beyond law in wake of the provisions of Section 498 of the IPC.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/married-man-files-habeas-corpus-petition-for-married-girlfriend-hc-disposes-plea/articleshow/81890861.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Revenge murder: Seven held for killing realtor in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Seven persons, including a juvenile, were nabbed by Mailardevpally police in connection with the daylight murder of Asad Khan, a realtor and murder accused, two days ago. Deputy commissioner of police (Shamshabad) N Prakash Reddy said Yaseen Khan, Mohammed Adnan, Abdul Ali, Mohammed Mahaboob, Mohammed Saddam, Mohammed Shoaib and the juvenile in conflict with law were arrested. Asad Khan died after he was attacked with knives and sickles allegedly by the accused. Police confirmed that Asad’s murder was a revenge killing by the son of Amjad Khan, who was murdered allegedly by Asad in 2018. “In 2018, Asad and a few others allegedly killed Amjad, who was the father of Yaseen. Yaseen since then bore a grudge and decided to kill Asad. Yaseen discussed with other accused and, as per plan, killed Asad,’’ he said. Yaseen and others had planned to execute the murder on Wednesday itself, but they dropped the plan since there were several persons on the road. On Thursday, the accused killed Asad at Vattepally.

---||Lucknow||Resignation letter which exposed graft goes viral||Lucknow: Technical surveillance which revealed links between mafia don-turned politician Mukhtar Ansari and an army deserter and the former striking a deal to purchase a light machine gun and the latter’s arrest by then STF deputy superintendent of police (DySP) Shailendra Singh had opened a Pandora’s Box in 2004. It eventually ended up in the resignation of the officer from police services. The details, part of the resignation letter of Shailendra, reveal how political pressure to give a clean chit to Mukhtar at that time eventually resulted in an upright officer taking the fight against political corruption to another level. The resignation dated February 11, 2004 went viral on social media on Saturday. In the letter, Singh says he joined as a Provincial police services (PPS) officer in 1994 and was made DySP in Lucknow STF. Singh further adds that in the last 10 years of his service, he noticed criminalisation in every sphere and the police department was not untouched. “This is the reason why the common people are unable to get justice and this worries me,” he added. “Hence, I am also unable to discharge my duties with sincerity and honesty,” he had written and requested seniors to accept and approve his resignation. Singh decided to write the resignation after he had succeeded in intercepting a phone conversation in which Mukhtar Ansari was trying to procure an LMG from a fugitive soldier named Babu Lal Yadav. Singh had conducted a raid and had recovered the LMG and 200 live cartridges. Babu Lal Yadav and his uncle Munar Yadav, who was Mukhtar Ansari’s gunner, were arrested on the spot. The DySP had then lodged an FIR and was planning to slap POTA on the don. However, as soon as the news about his intended actions spread, the then state government led by CM Mulayan Singh Yadav allegedly started mounting pressure on him on not booking Mukhtar Ansari in a POTA case. Singh had refused to buckle under political pressure and had tendered his resignation as DySP in February 2004.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/resignation-letter-which-exposed-graft-goes-viral/articleshow/81891418.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||‘Need to create healthy, stress-free workplace for women foresters’||Meera Iyer (49) is the chief general manager (CGM) with the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) Limited, Nagpur. An IFS officer of the 2000 batch, she has vast experience working with forestry institutions and holding frontline postings. Earlier, she worked as a programme officer in the medicinal plants conservation project in the Foundation for Revitalization of Local Health Traditions (FRLHT) Trust, Bengaluru, and was posted as deputy conservator of forests in Aurangabad (wildlife) and deputy director, social forestry division, Aurangabad. She also worked as faculty at the Central Academy for State Forest Services (CASFOS), Dehradun, and was the principal as well. TOI talked to Iyer about women’s issues at the workplace in the aftermath of the Harisal RFO Deepali Chavan suicide. Excerpts... Q. How does the forest department perceive Chavan’s suicide? A. The entire forest department stands in solidarity with the bereaved family and friends of the late Deepali. We are shocked and pained by her tragic death. We are unequivocally committed to ensuring that truth and justice prevail in the case. Q. Women officers and field staff work in remote areas of the forest. What kind of support should they get? A. There is a need for professional training to prepare them for the rigours of the job and give them the confidence to shoulder various responsibilities. This should include modules to be administered by subject-matter specialists on gender training, personality development, stress management and self-defence. This incident reiterates the need for an empathetic and responsive senior, especially a reporting officer and supportive colleagues and staff. We need to create a healthy and stress-free workplace. There should also be safe accommodation and field office with basic minimum amenities like restrooms, adequate equipment, vehicles and other infrastructure. There could also be patrolling squads for protection duties for regular inspections rather than individual inspections in remote areas by woman staff. Q. How should women officers handle a predominantly male team? A. From my experience I can say that objectivity, fair play, knowledge, competence and a consistent humane approach work well with all employees irrespective of the gender. In any organization, the number of trouble mongers is always in minority, and woman officers’ firmness in dealing with tricky issues is very critical. Competence, hard work and integrity of the employees also play a big role in tackling such persons. Overall, there should be a professional approach and the ability to disagree firmly based on facts and figures. Another important quality is the ability to articulate issues and problems at a personal level and also in staff meetings. Q. What needs to be done to avoid such incidents? A. There should be a systematic and exhaustive, horizontal and vertical pieces of training in a phased manner on gender issues, stress management and team building. Meticulous implementation of legal provisions related to women like the Vishaka provisions related to sexual harassment of women at the workplace, other measures like transparent and fair transfers and posting policy would go a long way in addressing many issues related to stress and conflicts. Q. While working in remote areas, how can women staff balance duty and family? A. There are many enabling legislation and government orders and circulars that take into account the indispensable role of a mother and family caregiver that a woman employee has to shoulder. The provisions for maternity leave, child care leave, posting of husband and wife together in the same headquarters are some compassionate measures already in place. Women officers and employees should use them to tide over their family commitments. The management should also honour the spirit of these legal provisions and implement them empathetically to empower women to work in the system. Other measures like a crèche system for employees with children while they are working or even a facility to look after their ageing parents can be made available to employees irrespective of their gender. Legal frameworks already exist for these. Q. Is there a need to streamline the present working system for women forest officers? A. Certainly. Systematic training, implementation of legal provisions, especially enabling women to balance their work commitments and family responsibilities in true letter and spirit and speedy, fair disposal of their grievances are some critical steps. Q. Is there enough scope to look after the health and welfare of women forest officers? A. The present working conditions are equally tough and challenging for both women as well as men employees. The health and leisure aspects are to be managed by each one themselves. Some of the things that need to be prioritized include taking time out to attend fitness-related activities like yoga, gym, running, jogging or any other sport. Other activities like meditation, vipasana, eating simple healthy food are other important things that have worked for me to maintain good health and fitness which are indispensable for a field-oriented job of a forester. Q. What about the stress? A. To release stress, it is important for forest employees to maintain a network of like-minded friends, not necessarily from the same profession, with whom you can discuss any stressful issue without hesitation. Such networks are extremely important for stress-busting and giving a perspective on many things that bother us at the workplace or in the family. The advent of smartphones, excellent internet facility and apps like WhatsApp have given women as well as men the opportunity to network and keep in touch with each other. Small groups which can support emotionally can go a long way in keeping people in isolated areas motivated and connected and also give them a sense of belonging. Another aspect that often gets neglected is keeping in touch with the extended family of relatives and people from native places. They also play an important role in giving advice or support if and when required. Extending the same emotional support through positive, kind words, encouragement, consoling in times of distress those around us also makes us stronger to take on the world. Q. What should one do if seniors assign tasks against the rules? A. Firstly, if the instructions are verbal, refuse firmly and politely. If the senior is insistent, then ask for a written order. Most illegal or things against rules will be dropped by this stage. If the instructions are given in writing then the rule position and disagreement/dissent can be recorded by the employee in the concerned file and if the order still persists then it can be brought to the notice of the higher authorities. Eventually, the law catches up. Being dispassionate about outcomes that are not according to your liking or expectation and patience for procedures to complete at your own pace are things that are difficult to follow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/need-to-create-healthy-stress-free-workplace-for-women-foresters/articleshow/81891430.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Hyderabad||Was at party over land issue: Hyderabad businessman||HYDERABAD: City-based businessman Sandeep Reddy, whose name cropped up in the Bengaluru police’s investigation in a drug party case told STOI that he had attended a party there two years ago. Sandeep, who is a resident of Kukatpally and native of Nellore in Andhra Pradesh, said Kannada film producer Shankare Gowda had taken a loan from him and that he had taken help from local politicians to help resolve some financial issues. “Gowda had told me that there is a litigation land and asked me to look around for buyers. I informed a local Telangana MLA about it and reached Bengaluru along with another friend Kalahar Reddy,” he added. “Gowda brought some dance girls at the party. Later, (reality show participant) Mastan Chandra was introduced to me. The MLA did not stay for long at the party and left after having a couple of pegs.” Sandeep further said police picked up Mastan after his name was found in the mobile phones of two Nigerians, who were arrested in February this year in connection with the drugs case. “Mastan named Gowda, who told the cops about the party in Bengaluru two years ago. I was then summoned by Karnataka police. They recorded my statement and took my signature. I don’t know what they wrote on it because the wording was in Kannada,” he said. He said, “Later, they took me to a magistrate and recorded my statement. After the judge left, the cops again got some statement typed and took my signature on it. The statement was in Kannada and they manipulated it.” He alleged that the cops are unnecessarily dragging everyone into the case. Sandeep said he had gone to Karnataka a week ago. “I was told Kalahar Reddy and another friend Ratan Reddy have also been issued notices. They are yet to appear before police,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/was-at-party-over-land-issue-bizman/articleshow/81890876.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Mumbai||Pandemic flattens trade at Mulji Jetha cloth market in Mumbai||Mumbai: There is a disquieting sense of deja vu at the Mulji Jetha cloth market in Mumbai’s Kalbadevi area. The old-style wholesale traders in the historic market were just navigating their way out of the pandemic’s economic shock when the second wave flattened business again. The 187-year-old market where textile tycoon Dhirubhai Ambani began his journey as a yarn trader remains one of the largest wholesale cloth markets in the country. Massive stacks of churidar and suit material, designer saris, linen fabric and blankets make their way from here to stores in different states. Here, deals worth lakhs would be struck daily by traders sitting cross-legged on traditional white mattresses inside wooden alcoves. The market was closed during the lockdown. It reopened partially in July 2020 and then in full swing in September. Trade picked up between October 2020 and February this year. By March, though, as the second wave gathered steam, business was down again. “Since March, business is down by 70%. Our agents have found it difficult to visit wholesale shops in different states. It was difficult for the wholesalers to visit us. This affected sales,” says Vikram Doshi from B Maheshkumar, which supplies Raymonds suit fabric to shops across the country. “The pandemic has given us the most difficult situation I have seen in the last 40 years,” says the market’s chairman Mukesh Desai. “Since the market was closed for several months last year, trade was down by around 50%. Then, since March, it was down by 70%.” Over the last year, many here embraced technology which became the only route to transactions. Deals with wholesalers in different states were struck online or on WhatsApp, says Deepakbhai Sanghvi from Shreenath Fabs. “WhatsApp mainly works with older clients who are sure of our quality and are only using WhatsApp to make choices between different patterns on clothes,” says Sanghvi. With the dip in demand as cases started rising, though, WhatsApp trade did not help. “Purchasing power has reduced and people are in a panic. Retailers and wholesalers still have old stock. So, they are not buying as much as they used to,” says Desai. The informal credit system in the market has also had to change. Earlier, traders would extend credit to wholesalers for 60 days. Now the period has been extended up to five months. “Now, I am waiting for payments to be settled for a five-month period. Wholesalers say their stock is lying unsold and they cannot settle the dues,” says Sanghvi. Like most in the business community, traders here oppose a lockdown. “Clothing is a necessity. At least there is some trade. If things shut down again, it will be difficult to sustain,” says Ritesh Jain from Rameshkumar Shirting Fabric. Rows of shops in the market lie vacant. “Those who own their shops are still here. Many with rented shops have gone. Some are taking a break but others have moved on to to some other line of work because they could not afford the overheads,” says Sanghvi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pandemic-flattens-trade-at-mulji-jetha-cloth-market-in-mumbai/articleshow/81890589.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Lucknow||Wanted in Lucknow, is former BSP MP campaigning in Jaunpur?||Lucknow: Don-turned-politician Dhananjay Singh, wanted in the sensational Ajit Singh murder case and who carries a reward of Rs 25,000, is said to be clandestinely campaigning for his wife in Jaunpur. Dhananjay’s wife Shrikala is a BJP leader and is a ticket hopeful for the zila panchayat election. According to Lucknow police, Dhananjay, a former BSP MP from Jaunpur, was the mastermind of Singh’s murder. Singh, who belonged to the rival group of Mukhtar Ansari, was sprayed with bullets in Gomtinagar on January 6. When police stepped up the heat, Dhananjay surrendered before a court in another case and was sent to Fatehgarh jail. Dhananjay was granted bail by an MPMLA court earlier this week as Lucknow police failed to produce summons before it on time. After getting released, the former MP, along with his supporters, drove down to Jaunpur. Sources say Dhananjay campaigning for his wife shows his defiance for the police despite the warrant against him and also his proximity to some netas and police officials in UP, who might be allegedly protecting him. Lucknow police commissioner DK Thakur told TOI: “Dhananjay is wanted in criminal cases and also carries a reward of Rs 25,000 on his head.” Thakur, however, said he was not aware of the don-neta campaigning for his wife in Jaunpur. In the bloody rivalry in the underworld of the state, Dhananjay is seen as an arch rival of the imprisoned independent MLA and history-sheeter Mukhtar Ansari. Dhananjay, who had been MLA in 2002 and then BSP MP in 2009, is involved in several heinous crime cases, including the one in which one of his rivals in Lok Sabha elections in 2009 was found murdered in a gruesome manner. It remains to be seen if his wife will get BJP ticket for the panchayat election given his tainted record and also how long will Jaunpur bahubali continue to defy UP Police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wanted-in-lucknow-is-former-bsp-mp-campaigning-in-jaunpur/articleshow/81891436.cms||Subhash Mishra

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad’s high street on fast track; 1.3 mn sft on the cards||HYDERABAD: After being under lock and key for most part of 2020, Hyderabad’s high street retail sector is once again witnessing hectic activity this year. According to rough market estimates, the city is eyeing around 1.3 million square feet (sft) of demand in this sector -- set to come up in areas such as Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills, A S Rao Nagar, Kompally among others. High street retail is defined by standalone showrooms of brands – of various categories – dotting prominent roads of a city. Hyderabad’s high street has always been counted as among the most expensive in India. Realtors say, a host of brands are making a beeline to either make a foray into the city’s high street market or expand their existing ventures. On the cards are: top-line apparel stores, hyper markets, electronics and automobile showrooms, and even breweries. “Of this total demand for space, about 75% to 80% is expected to be signed over the next 9 to 12 months alone,” said Veera Babu, managing director of Cushman & Wakefield (Hyderabad) attributing the recovery, significantly, to the vaccine rollout that’s improved footfalls in malls and stores over the last few months. He added: “Brands are coming back with new strategies and are experimenting with formats. We can expect rapid growth over the next three to four years.” Given the rush of ventures, the rentals too, industry analysts say, are reverting to pre-Covid times. “The average monthly rentals are highest in Banjara Hills –Jubilee Hills, anywhere between Rs 140 and Rs 180 per sft per month (average), while in Kukatpally, Miyapur etc it’s between Rs 90 and Rs 120 per sft. Given that supply is more, rentals are being negotiated depending on location, facilities etc,” said Anuj Kejriwal, CEO and managing director, Anarock (Retail). With the city sitting on multiple untapped locations for high street retail, experts say that pockets across the western and eastern corridors might attract a lot of business, going forward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyds-high-street-on-fast-track-1-3-mn-sft-on-the-cards/articleshow/81891434.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Alka Vyas, a resident of Parshwanath township, filed a complaint against her husband Mukesh Vyas and maid Hetal with Nikol police. Alka told police that she fell in love with Mukesh and married him. They have a 15-year-old daughter Ayushi and a 14-year-old son Vashisht. She stated that when she was pregnant with Vashisht, they had employed Hetal, a resident of Bapunagar, as their maid to help her with the household work. In her complaint, Alka said that Hetal and Mukesh began an affair and the two began harassing her mentally and even physically. The complaint stated, "Mukesh said he wanted to have a relationship with Hetal, which Alka opposed. Later, they moved to Nikol and began living at Kunj Society. Mukesh insisted that he wanted to have a relationship with Alka as well as Hetal. When Alka refused, it led to a dispute. Hetal began taking decisions in the house and would assault Alka. Mukesh threatened to kill Alka's brother if she revealed anything about his relationship with Hetal to anyone." In April 2020, during the lockdown, Mukesh allegedly threw Alka out of the house. She went to live with her parents. In her complaint, Alka said that she was not even allowed to meet her children. “Mukesh even gave an application in the children's school asking them not to allow Alka to meet the kids,” the complaint stated. She said that on January 1 this year, she submitted an application with the Nikol police. She finally registered a complaint against Mukesh and Hetal on April 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-falls-in-love-with-maid-throws-wife-out-of-house/articleshow/81890871.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Ex-Miss India finalist to take plunge in UP panchayat polls||LUCKNOW: UP’s panchayat elections, largest in the world with nearly seven lakh candidates, received a dash of glamour when 2015 Femina Miss India finalist Diksha Singh announced to contest the zila panchayat election from her native district, Jaunpur. Talking to TOI, Diksha said that she would contest from Baksha ward of the district and would be filing her nomination paper on Sunday. Jaunpur goes to poll on April 15 and the result would be announced on May 2 after four phases of polling. Diksha has already started campaigning in her ward. A native of Chittori village of Jaunpur, Disha studied in Jaunpur till class III after which her parents moved to Mumbai and then to Goa. She went to the MES College of Arts and Commerce, Zuarinagar, Goa, to complete her graduation. When she was in the second year in college, Diksha participated in the Femina Miss India pageant in 2015. She was one of the 21 finalists and also the winner of a sub-contest 'Miss Body Beautiful'. Thereafter, she signed several modelling assignments and recently appeared in several music videos, including one in February 2021. The UP girl has over two lakh followers on Instagram. Diksha’s announcement to contest village elections led to rumours that she jumped into the fray on behalf of his father Jitendra Singh, who wanted to contest but the seat was reserved for women candidates. However, her family denies it. “It is her independent decision and is driven by her desire to serve her native place,” said the proud father who runs his business in Goa and Rajasthan and believes that empowering women was the first step toward real social change. On the reason for her decision, Diksha said: “The life of people has not improved over the years. My native place is still under-developed. Whenever I came here, I felt that the place was stuck somewhere in the 1990s. I intend to work for the people here and change the situation.” Diksha, who has studied political science college and is into writing as well, added that her recent visit to the interiors made her conclude that Jaunpur was yet to get its due. "Many cannot relate with the situation here. But I have grown in this place which is like a scene from old classics such as 'Mother India' and 'Purab aur Paschim' where misery and poverty drive the way. Women lead a restricted life and children are forced to give up their dreams," said Diksha who has identified as education and women empowerment as the key issues to work on. Although she doesn't have support of any party, she said that PM Narendra Modi was her role model. Social commentators and experts lauded the girl’s move and called it exemplary. “Covid-19 has changed the way many thought and saw life. The desire to live and settle down in big cities is being openly questioned by many and some of them want to go back to their roots," said lawyer and social activist Abha Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ex-miss-india-finalist-to-take-plunge-in-up-panchayat-polls/articleshow/81891447.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Night curfew, they alleged, has been affecting their business adversely. Some of the members also alleged that the police have been behaving with traders like criminals if they get delayed or have to come out for any reason after 9pm. The meeting decided to meet CM Vijay Rupani to suggest alternatives of curfew. Vice president of RCCI, Parth Ganatra said, “When a businessman has to come out after 9pm it has to be owing to some emergency of business. The police can impose fines on us, but cannot behave like criminals.” Another suggestion was total lockdown from Friday night to Monday morning, but allow normal business for five days without any curfew restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/traders-want-night-curfew-alternatives/articleshow/81890146.cms||---

He also appealed to business owners to follow all guidelines and cooperate with the state. Indicating that lockdown-like restrictions may be levied in the coming days and certain businesses may be impacted, Thackeray said the current priority is in the following order: “Zindagi, jaan, uske baad kaam (life and then livelihood).” “The situation is grim in the state. We don’t want to fault anyone. But to break the chain of infection, we will have to take certain stringent steps,” said Thackeray while addressing multiplex and auditorium owners. Thackeray held virtual meetings with mediapersons, owners of gyms and health clubs, cinema halls, multiplexes and film exhibitors on Saturday. The CM said he was aware their businesses had just started to come back on track, but at the moment the state has to prioritise lives. Kamal Gianchandani of PVR and producer Rohit Shetty reportedly agreed to cooperate with all the steps the government would take for public welfare. Nitin Datar, president of the Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India, though, appealed to the government to address multiple concerns being voiced by theatre owners. “Single screens in particular are staring at closure. We had requested a waiver of property tax as per an existing law that applies in times of national calamity. Plus, we are paying hefty electricity bills, although we are not using any power. There are certain charges in the bill to the tune of Rs 14,000-15,000 per month which are levied irrespective of use. Those should be waived. We also requested loans—not subsidies —to enable our members to reopen after the lockdown. These are valid concerns that are awaiting redressal. The government says, ‘Sar salaamat toh pagdi hazaar (life is more important)’. But we risk losing our very lives and livelihoods. Our 6pm and 9pm shows have been cancelled since the 8pm deadline for closure was implemented recently.” “The CM told us about the Covid-19 situation. We have our demands with the government, but those are secondary at the moment,” said Shalini Bhargava, a gym owner at the meeting. Senior officials said the state was considering shutting malls, cinema halls, gyms and religious places, and orders will be issued in the next two days. It is also likely that specific restrictions will be announced for the top eight districts that have the highest caseload in the state and are driving the Covid-19 numbers nationally as well.

Following tribal traditions in this area, women are kept out of their homes for around five days during their monthly menstruation cycle. The final-year student of Bachelor’s in physical education has been on a crusade to raise awareness about menstruation cycles and hygiene ever since the gram sabha elected her as a people’s sarpanch without any political connections. Lekami, daughter of a Zilla Parishad teacher, has been teaching tribals about hygienic practices for the menstrual cycle. Traditionally, such women are made to stay at separate accommodation facilities, called ‘kurma ghar’, in the villages. “I intend to erect at least two kurma ghar in each big village and one in smaller ones, where tribal women would have better facilities to stay, cook food and have a comfortable stay while menstruating,” said Lekami. She rides a bike to move around among the nine forested villages of Koti gram sabha, despite Naxal threat in the locality. The area serves as the getaway to the Maoist stronghold of Abujhmadh on Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border. “The existing kurma ghar are plagued by leaky roofs and broken floors, inviting snakes and poisonous insects and also dripping water in the monsoon,” she said. “Apart from trying to allow them better accommodations, I am also making them aware about maintaining hygiene during the cycle to avoid falling prey to infections,” said Lekami, who rued losing a year due to Covid lockdown and related hurdles. Lekami, the younger of two siblings, has also been distributing sanitary pads among young girls and women, trying to convince them to use and dispose them of properly instead of the traditional cloths pads. Lekami was a unique sarpanch candidate in 2019 for Koti gram panchayat in the interior Bhamragarh tehsil when she filed her nomination form. Lekami was not only barely 20 years of age but also a woman who had filled the nomination without any political backing. “My agenda revolved around people-centric issues as I was elected by the gram sabha as a will of the people and not on the basis of political backings or symbols. I had been striving to make people aware of their rights, the benefits due to them through government projects or schemes, and budgetary allocations,” said Lekami whose mother is an anganwadi sevika. “I was born and brought up in the same locality, as a local madia girl, where I am now serving as sarpanch. Hence, I know the issues and people here, and am more motivated to work for them without any interest,” said Lekami. She also aims to become a physical and sports instructor after completing her academics. “If people want me to return, I shall come back to serve them or else move on to pursue my dreams of becoming a sports teacher,” said Lekami, who is a volleyball player.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/22-yr-old-peoples-sarpanch-on-crusade-to-teach-gchiroli-tribals-period-hygiene/articleshow/81891470.cms||Soumitra Bose

Of the 36,000 schools in the state, 25,000 were operational in various districts including those in small towns and villages. When asked how many children or teachers were infected in various rural and town schools, Rao said, “We don’t maintain any such data.” An Ahmedabad-based teacher Tejal Patel asked, “Don’t we teachers have families and children at home who may get infected? Also, if the government has no data for Covid spread in schools and among children, on what basis are they taking the closure decisions.” Digvijay Jadeja, president of the Gujarat primary schoolteachers association claims, “More than 2,000 teachers, a majority of them being government primary schoolteachers, have been infected with Covid after schools reopened. The government could be more vigilant and act, since it has access to all disease data and infections from across the state.”  Members of a few parents’ association in Ahmedabad had recently complained to the DEO how schools continued to call their children to school in regular clothes even as the government had restricted schools from functioning. Earlier, the state government had decided to reopen schools for students of Classes 6 to 8 from February 18, after being shut down for almost 11 months owing to the Covid pandemic. “But rapid rise of the pandemic necessitated closure of the schools,” said a senior education department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/schools-across-state-to-be-closed-till-further-notice/articleshow/81891005.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Don’t delay RT-PCR for travel’||AHMEDABAD: It’s a dilemma for many Amdavadis – what comes first, negative RT-PCR report or confirmed booking! While the fresh wave of Covid-19 has resulted in postponement of several events and travel plans, Amdavadis are still travelling within and outside country. With the spike in cases, the test reports are getting delayed. Dr Kamlesh Patel, a city-based pathologist, said they advise those in dire need to travel to give their samples as early as possible to meet the window period – 72 hours in most cases.  “Don’t delay the RT-PCR for travel till last moment. With the rise in cases, the testing and result timings have increased,” he said, adding that almost all the pathology labs in the city are working round the clock to meet the rush with optimum staff. With ever-increasing case numbers – Gujarat on Saturday added nearly two cases per minute and Ahmedabad one case every two minutes – the stress is also felt by the labs. Experts pointed out that the scenario could have been worse if the pandemic had not motivated majority of the labs to improve infrastructure and manpower. But the crunch has put the citizens in a fix. While queues were seen outside majority of the labs to submit samples, some labs agreed that they have to send the staff for sample collection during curfew hours to meet the demand. A senior pathologist said that the sample collectors are also overworked. “The samples are also collected at 11.30pm and at 6am depending on the urgency. Even then, often the sample collection is delayed by up to 24 hours. We had to request the patients’ families to come to the lab if they want quicker results,” said a city-based pathologist. Saumya Brahmbhatt, a city-based professional, said, “My relative had to give a sample for Covid-19 testing and we called up two private labs but they refused to send someone for collecting samples because they’re overloaded.” Experts pointed at increased test positivity rate (TPR) among RT-PCR tests in the city.  “It has more than doubled in past 30 days. The viral load has remained relatively milder compared to the post-Diwali surge,” said a city-based pathologist. Dr Mukesh Maheshwari, a city-based pathologist and member of Gujarat chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) committee, said that the momentum must continue. “Some of the new variants are not detected by the RAT. If a positive person tests negative on RAT and gets confident, it can lead to higher spread of infection. Testing must be increased in both government and private labs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dont-delay-rt-pcr-for-travel/articleshow/81891023.cms||---

Lack of sufficient time to prepare for the exam is taking a toll on them.S Swathi, a government school student, said she is losing confidence as exams approach. “After schools reopened in January, teachers brushed up the portion as per the revised syllabus and it took one-and-a-half month to do it. We started revision only in mid-February and completed two revision tests. We expect another one before the practical examinations that commence on April 16. I hardly have a handful of days to study 50% of the remaining syllabus,” she told TOI.“Revised practical portions were announced only in January. We spent a few weeks of crucial preparation time to write practical records. Every year, record notebooks would be completed in advance in order to ensure solid preparation time for the public examination,” Swathi said.The students are also under pressure to perform well, said S Mithun Meenakshi, a private school student. “We used to get at least six months to plan and prepare for the examination. This time, it was cut down to half. Also, we did not have much writing practice due to online classes and had to work hard to pick up speed in the last few months,” she said.Pointing out the uncertainties over the examination in the last few months, Meenakshi said the students had difficulties in assessing themselves based on the examination result even though the school management conducted regular tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/class-xii-students-struggle-to-cope-with-exam-anxiety/articleshow/81891454.cms||Nivedha Selvam

When we were informed, we roped in fire brigadiers from Peelamedu fire service station.” One of the firemen climbed the tower and held talks with Gurusamy, who told police that he was under depression after his wife left him and demanded them to take steps to reunite him with his wife.When officials assured him of all possible help, Gurusamy climbed down. The Singanallur police subsequently took him to police station and warned to arrest and put him in jail if he repeats the offence again.

---||Ahmedabad||Remdesivir shortage? Gujarat govt says ‘all is well’||AHMEDABAD: Mihir Mishra (name changed to protect privacy), a Covid-19 patient was admitted at a private hospital in Vastral area of Ahmedabad on Saturday, when he was told he requires remdesivir injection. Remdesivir is an anti-viral used in treatment for Covid-19. “The hospital where I am admitted does not have any stock since yesterday, and therefore I have requested my kin to arrange it,” said Mishra. At a time, when Covid-19 cases in Gujarat are touching a new peak almost every other day, a shortage of remdesivir seems to have surfaced. Several stockists in Ahmedabad said they ran out of stocks for at least a couple of days in the past 3-4 days. “At least for two days we did not have enough stock of remdesivir, but it was only on Friday that stocks got replenished. The demand is very high against a limited stock, due to which supply-side constraints are there,” said Jashvant Patel, chairman, Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists’ Association (FGSCDA). Even though stockists and hospitals are clearly out of stock for the medicine, and are finding it difficult to procure remdesivir injections, the state food and drug control administration (FDCA) claims there is enough stock of remdesivir of different brands available in Gujarat. Well-placed sources also confirmed that the shortage also prevailed in a number of government-run hospitals as well. “As on date, we have some 38,446 vials of remdesivir available with us in the state, of which some 32,062 vials are distributed to various centres acrossdistricts of Gujarat. The remaining is diverted towards the government stock. Ahmedabad alone has some 7,700 vials of remdesivir stock,” said Dr H G Koshia, commissioner, FDCA – Gujarat. Ankur Aggarwal, founder, MedKart, said, “The stock is available, but not readily. We have to reach out to at least four to five stockists, one of whom will have some stock of the injection. There has been a major upsurge in the demand due to rising cases of Covid-19 and also the increasing severity in patients, due to which Remdesivir demand has gone up.” Dashrath Patel, another city-based chemist and druggist, said, “For four good days, we did not have stock of remdesivir injections though many inquiries came from patients’ kin. We are directing them to other stockists we know where it may be available so that they don’t have to run around much.” In fact, several hospitals have also ran out of stock for remdesivir. Shalini Shah (name changed to protect privacy), whose father was prescribed remdesivir earlier this week, moved through some five hospitals i.e. at VS Hospital, Sushrusha Hospital, Shalby Hospital and Parekh’s Hospital, where she could not find the said injection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/remdesivir-shortage-govt-says-all-is-well/articleshow/81891016.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Killed, robbed victim to finance wife’s deliver: Murder accused||Mumbai: Robbing and killing a commuter left a 23-year-old man richer only by Rs 70. Asif Shaikh, arrested for the murder of a commuter on a Harbour line local, confessed to the Government Railway Police (GRP) that he had robbed the victim because he was facing a financial crunch even as his wife had gone into labour. On Friday, the 30-year-old victim, Neeraj Jaiswal, was identified by investigators. Jaiswal worked at a zip making company in Ghatkopar and came from modest financial background. On March 29, a corpse was found in the luggage compartment of a Panvel-CSMT local when it reached CSMT at around 10.45pm. The unknown victim had been stabbed multiple times and had bled profusely. After examining CCTV footage, the railway crime branch established that the victim (Jaiswal) had boarded the luggage compartment at Kurla station. All travellers, except one, had got off. So, the police deduced that the remaining traveller at Kurla, besides Jaiswal, was the culprit.  Shaikh was captured on camera as he boarded the local at Govandi with a backpack. Later, he was captured jumping off the coach, from the opposite side, at GTB Nagar. He was tracked down to a transit camp at Wadala truck terminus and arrested on Thursday. The murder accused told the police he had snatched Jaiswal's phone and wallet, but he found a meagre sum of Rs 70 in it. “Shaikh may have stabbed him out of fear that Jaiswal would go to the police after being robbed,” said Pravin Bhagat, senior inspector of CSMT GRP. Shaikh told the police that his wife had been admitted to the Sion Hospital for delivery and he was in need of money. Jaiswal's identity was established a day after Shaikh’s arrest.  “Jaiswal hails from Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh. He lived in Mankhurd and is survived by two of his brothers, Pankaj and Shivprabhat, who identified his body,” said Shailendra Dhiwar, senior inspector of railway crime branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-killed-robbed-victim-to-finance-wifes-deliver-murder-accused/articleshow/81891482.cms||Nitasha Natu

In a video conference held on Saturday, G Raghuma Reddy, chairman and managing director of TSSPDCL directed all officials to ensure that this is done through the summer season, across the limits of the discom. He said the power peak demand has touched 80 million units in Greater Hyderabad and 185 million units (MU) in the TSSPDCL limits. “There has been a significant jump in power consumption since 2014. Rise in agriculture due to 24x7 power supply and industrial demand have resulted in huge power demands,” Reddy said reiterating that necessary arrangements have been made for uninterrupted power supply in the TSSPDCL limits comprising Hyderabad, erstwhile Ranga Reddy, Medak, Mahbubnagar and Nalgonda districts. On the day of state formation — June, 2, 2014 — peak power demand stood at 49.56 MU. It reached 73.84 MU on May, 29, 2019 in Greater Hyderabad. Within the entire TSSPDCL limits too, peak power demand shot from 119.6 MU on April 3, 2014 to 180.5 MU on March 26, 2021, he said. He said that 56 power transformers, 1,725 distribution transformers and 11 33/11 KV sub-stations have been added to the distribution system of Greater Hyderabad to meet the additional power demands during the summer season.

The perceived side effects – including body ache, fever, etc – are actually effects of the vaccine and it should not be a deterrent.” The CoWIN dashboard data on Friday revealed that Gujarat is second in India in vaccination with 68.27 lakh doses, surpassing Uttar Pradesh which has so far vaccinated 65.75 lakh persons. Maharashtra is on the top position with72.66 lakh inoculations. Dr Atul Patel, a city-based infectious diseases specialist and member of the task force, said that the vaccination works as breaker of the chain. Answering a question about remdesivir, Dr Patel said that it’s not a life-saving drug. “It can only reduce the hospitalization period by five days. Excessive use of the injection should be avoided as it not only increases financial burden of the patient but also causes side effects,” he said. The experts stressed on need for Covid-19 protocol due to the high infection rate of the new virus variant. Ahmedabad city on Saturday recorded 646 new positive patients and discharge of 601 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vaccinations-a-must-for-herd-immunity/articleshow/81890931.cms||---

The new app, meanwhile, has been designed to send instant SMS via mobile to contact persons of Covid-19 positive patients to alert them for rapid antigen testing and guide them to the nearest primary health centre. Meanwhile, the health minister has appealed to citizens to undergo Covid-19 tests even if they have mildest symptoms and if they have come in contract with any patient. During the meetings, it was decided to convert all hospitals that provided corona treatment in the past into full-fledged corona hospitals. Corona wards in 33 district centres would be ensured and staff availability of doctors, nurses, sanitary staff, patient care workers, medicines and oxygen has been mandated 24 hours a day at these centres. Also, liquid oxygen tanks have been installed in 22 hospitals, the minister said assuring that patients on ventilators would not have any problems. The minister said that around 60,000 Covid-19 tests are being done every day and the number of RT-PCR tests will be increased further. He asked district health officials to work in coordination with the municipal authorities in the GHMC area and superintendents of district hospitals and take all measures to reduce deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-converts-city-hosps-into-covid-centres-to-use-tech-to-track-and-trace/articleshow/81891479.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Lucknow||BJP will restore the glory of ‘Sonar Bangla’: Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath mounted attack on Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC), accusing it of transforming Bengal into land of hooliganism and anarchy and promised that BJP will restore the glory of ‘Sonar Bangla’ as per the ideals of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and great personalities who nurtured the cultural and educational heritage of the state. Invoking the ideals of the mystic saint during his road show and public meetings in Bengal on Saturday, Yogi said, “The land of Ramakrishna Paramhans, Rabindranath Tagore, Bankim Chandra is witnessing anarchy due to appeasement policies of Congress, Left and TMC. The time has come to restore the pristine glory of Bengal.” He urged the people to help BJP in realising the dreams of the great personalities of Bengal and restoring its resplendent past. “The wave of change is very much visible. After two phases of polling, it has become clear that BJP is going to come to power in West Bengal,” the UP CM said. “The large turnout here indicates that the days of Mamata Banerjee as CM are numbered. We need your support to dethrone this dispensation, to pave way for good governance and bring a government having compassion,” he added. He said Mamata Banerjee has jeopardised her own career by opposing Lord Ram. “She used to oppose BJP, but now she has started speaking against Shri Ram. Whosoever has opposed Lord Ram, has been stripped of power,” he said, adding Mamata Didi has spelt doom for herself. CM Yogi said it is beyond imagination that the rich heritage of Bengal nurtured by the high ideals of Subhas Chandra Bose, Bankim Chandra, Tagore, Syama Prasad Mookerjee has been spoilt by the goons of TMC. “Let the BJP come to power, the criminals and mafia will beg for their lives just like they are doing in Uttar Pradesh,” he said. “You gave 30 years to Congress, 30 years to the Left and 10 years to TMC. I ask for five years for BJP and you will see pro-public and pro-development governance,” Yogi added. “In UP, in just four years, we provided 40 lakh houses to poor, one crore free electricity connections, protected the old, women, girls, traders, farmers through various welfare schemes. Mamata Banerjee should be asked what she did in the 10 years while she was in power. TMC should tell why the benefits of various welfare schemes did not reach the common man,” said Yogi. UP CM said he even felt sorry for the government employees in Bengal who have still not got the full benefits of 7th Pay Commission. Even a lower rank employee in Uttar Pradesh earns more than a class one officer of Mamata’s state. Recalling the contribution of BJP ideologue Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Yogi said, “He raised voice for nationalism from this land when he said ‘Ek Desh mein Do Vidhan Nahi Chalenge (There can’t be two constitutions in one country).” “It was the courage of Prime Minister Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah that Article 370 was scrapped from Kashmir and now even a Bengali can buy land in J&K,” he added. The CM did not mince his words while coming down heavily on Mamata government alleging public money was swindled in corruption and appeasement without any vision of long-term development plan. Yogi, who was on a day’s tour to West Bengal for campaigning, received a tumultuous welcome at several places and was received by huge crowds and chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’. CM held roadshows in Uluberia, Howrah West, Howrah North before addressing public meetings in Kultuli, South 24 Parganas and Falta, Diamond Harbour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-will-restore-the-glory-of-sonar-bangla-yogi/articleshow/81891480.cms||---

They said that it will be a herculean task to complete the entire syllabus in the online mode as they also have to take screen time into consideration. “It is definitely going to be difficult. In fact, we are preparing our year plan and are trying to fit everything in, but it is looking practically impossible,” said Latha Shankar, principal, P Obul Reddy Public School. She said that as per the board’s directive, they can conduct classes only for five days a week and that too for three hours a day in the online mode. “Unless physical classes resume by June or July, the board should re-examine its decision or else schools will have no option except to take extra classes,” she added. A few others said that the least the board could do is change the question paper pattern and make it more student-friendly. “Equal weightage should be given to objective and subjective type questions at least for the coming academic year. In the objective type, they should also have questions related to logical thinking along with the subject,” said Simi Nagi, principal, Pallavi Model School, adding that once the physical classes resume in full swing, the board can again go back to being stringent, but for now it has to give priority to interest of students. Some of the principals, however, said that as the decision has been taken well in advance, schools can prepare students better for the examinations even with 100% syllabus. “Down the line, there is a possibility that the board might reconsider its decision and reduce the syllabus. But, right now, we have to be prepared to teach students the entire syllabus. In a way, it’s good as there are many chapters which will have a link to related topics in the next or higher class. Skipping them now will make it difficult for students in the future,” said S Narasimha Reddy, principal, Hyderabad Public School, Ramanthapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tough-task-to-complete-entire-cbse-syllabus-online-principals/articleshow/81890926.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The surge in the hospitalization of coronavirus patients has almost trebled the consumption of medical-grade oxygen in the state. The sales of the antiviral drug remdesivir galloped eight times to 1.63 lakh vials (injections) in March from 19,825 vials in February. The sales stood at 20,683 vials in January, according to the data gathered by the Food and Drugs Control Administration (FCDA), Gujarat. As many as 98,614 vials were sold from March 22 to 31 alone, the data showed. Alpesh Patel, president, Federation of Chemists and Druggists’ Association, Gujarat, said: “The number of cases has spiked and so has the demand for remdesivir injections.” Patel added: “A stockist has reported an estimated 300% increase in the sales of these injections in March vis-à-vis February this year.” Similarly, the sales of favipiravir 200mg rose from 1,650 tablets in February to 4.53 lakh tablets in March. While the sales of favipiravir 400mg increased to 11.90 lakh tablets from 2,240 tablets, the sales of 800mg tablets rose to 96,302 from 3,280 during the same period. These Covid-19 medicines had registered a similar spike in sales last September and November when infections skyrocketed in the state. Back then, remdesivir sales had gone up to 2.27 lakh vials in November and 1.79 lakh in September. Meanwhile, the rise in Covid hospitalizations has pushed up the consumption of oxygen for medical purposes almost three times to 141 metric tonnes (MT) per day on March 31 as compared to 50 MT per day on March 1. The daily consumption stood at 155 MT on April 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-medicine-sales-spike-as-cases-skyrocket-in-gujarat/articleshow/81890968.cms||Kalpesh Damor

The woman was found lying opposite to the police commissioner's office. A group of young people who were running a voluntary organisation, Indur Yuvatha Association, informed DLSA secretary Kiran Mahi about the plight of the woman who was begging for food in the town for the last few weeks and had collapsed three days ago. As per the directions of the DLSA chairperson and principal district judge Sai Rama Devi, the woman was shifted to the local government hospital. Padma Singh, a paralegal volunteer and revenue officials who were entrusted with the task of tracing the kin of the woman, found that the name of the old woman is Nagubai and that she has two sons and a daughter. Nagubai was living at her younger son's house. However, both the son and daughter ill-treated the woman. The daughter was miffed with her mother because she gave her one acre land to the younger son, who later abandoned her. The officials summoned Nagubai’s children and counselled them. There were injuries on the hands of the mother. She did not complain against her children, but said that she was happy to see them and claimed that she had sustained the injuries when she fell on the road, officials said. Meanwhile, the younger son agreed to look after her and took her home. The officials fixed a counselling session next week for the daughter who had allegedly beaten up her mother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/legal-services-officials-rescue-woman-abandoned-by-children/articleshow/81890935.cms||---

Dhull left the charge after governor notified Attray’s appointment. Dhull is the second such political appointee who could not get an extension. According to sources, till late night on Friday, Dhull and his supporters had made last-minute attempts for reappointment. “I met CM sahab. He has expressed satisfaction with my work in the council and appreciated the extraordinary efforts made by me during my tenure. As per CM’s version, they want my services to be used in some other capacity,” said Dhull. Interacting with media here on Saturday, Dhull claimed to have changed the working style of the council in addition to have made the council self-sufficient in terms of managing finances for projects and salaries. “Ahead of my joining, the council had a budget of Rs 5 crore. After three years, the budget is now Rs 30 crore, with a significant rise in donations to council from corporates, departments and public undertakings in terms of CSR schemes,’’ he said. To reckon with, Liberty Shoes and promoters of MDH Spices are among those wo have made huge contributions. Last week, Haryana government had appointed a new chairperson of Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) by denying the third appointment to Bharat Bhushan Bharti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/parveen-attray-is-new-gen-secy-of-hry-child-welfare-council/articleshow/81890953.cms||---

Cops suspect he had possibly shot himself from his service revolver in a suicide bid. No suicide note was found though. Lakshmikanta Roy Chowdhury posted at Security Control Office of Kolkata Police was admitted to SSKM Trauma Care Centre as doctors struggled to get the bullet out of his spine. His condition remained extremely critical till late into Saturday. Police said Roy Chowdhury had reported to duty at the hospital around 9am with his team of HRFS on law and order maintenance responsibility. He reportedly asked his colleagues to remain at their designated zones and went inside the under-construction neurosurgery building behind the Woodburn Block. Minutes later, people nearby heard a gunshot and as they ran inside the building, they found the officer slumped on the ground with blood spatters all over and his service revolver lying beside him. Police said Roy’s first wife had died and he had remarried recently but he was possibly suffering from depression due to personal issues. A senior officer said they had started an enquiry to find out the reason behind him taking the step.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-battles-for-life-after-shooting-self/articleshow/81890624.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Architect wins award for restoring iconic 96-year-old building in Fort||Mumbai: Refurbishing a 36,000-sq-ft heritage building, that came up soon after the last global pandemic—the Spanish Flu—and reflected the common and unifying facades of the city then, has led to conservation architect Vikas Dilawari winning a prestigious award. His effort at restoring the 96-year-old Commissariat building at Fort— one of the multi-tenanted commercial buildings —was declared structurally unsafe not too long ago—have earned Dilawari the first prize at Housing Urban Development Corporation's Design Awards 2020-2021, reinstating the architect's long-standing belief in the endangered heritage dictum: “Repair, don’t redevelop”. Built in 1925 in the Renaissance Revival style, the Commissariat building— standing at the junction of the busy Dr DN Road and R Dadaji Street —boasts of the trademark pedestrian arcade on the ground floor which became the unifying factor for all the buildings that came up here after the demolition of the Fort walls in 1860s.  Erected between 1890 and 1910, these buildings on the then Hornby Road, were used as commercial head offices of banks and insurance companies. After World War I put paid to their construction activity, the arcade— that proffered shaded areas for walks —was replicated by all the buildings that underwent redevelopment on the eastern side of the road. Among such redeveloped single-ownership buildings of the 1920s, was the eponymous Commissariat, a ground-plus-four storeyed structure belonging to a wealthy family of Parsi merchants. Its ground floor boasted of shops while the top floors belonged to offices. A fifth floor had been added in the early 1950s. Problems are many when it comes to restoring such structures. While (rental) cessed heritage Grade III and precinct buildings built prior to 1944 are now allowed redevelopment, high-rises keep popping up in heritage precincts. ' Another hindrance to the sustenance of heritage properties is the Rent Control Act of 1944 which makes most tenants prefer redevelopment over conservation that make them owners from a tenant. Which is why Commissariat —which had received several notices from MCGM for its repairs —stands out. “Typically, such buildings undergo reconstruction but here, the owners decided to fund the restoration and the tenants cooperated by emptying the premises as required,” said Dilawari, about the 36,000-sq-ft structure which, in a neighbourhood of similar dilapidated buildings, stands testimony to the fact that it is “wiser, economical and sustainable to repair and restore than to redevelop,” as Dilawari puts it. When the architect started restoration work in 2018, all the wooden queen-post trusses (the arch-shaped frames on the roof) were in a precarious condition. So were the terrace slabs on the fifth floor and the tiled roof. Given that the building was both vulnerable to damage under harsh repairs and in constant use, Dilawari divided the work into five phases, starting—literally—from the top. After he replaced the roof with traditional wooden boarding and Mangalore tiles, the building not only got a massive facelift but also became insulated from the ravages of heat and water. Later, his team removed the paint from the dilapidated facades, sutured their cracks with stainless steel staples and camouflaged them with stone dust. With the eye of a dentist working a cavity, he then filled missing ornamentation details of cornices, corbels using lime surkhi, mortar and repaired the monsoon-ravaged jack arches . Soon, common areas like the staircase, lift lobby and the toilets were refurbished. In the end, his team rehauled the building’s electrical circuitry which was a mess. As lockdown held up the work, final touches are still in progress. With the provision of CCTVs and internet cables, the Commissariat looks all set to weather another new normal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-architect-wins-award-for-restoring-iconic-96-year-old-building-in-fort/articleshow/81891489.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

---||Goa||After Centre’s approval, integrated coastal plan awaits World Bank nod||Panaji: The ministry of environment forest and climate change (MoEFCC) has approved the preliminary project report to implement the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan (ICZMP) funded by the World Bank in the next five years “The preliminary project report has been approved by MoEFCC and central government and is awaiting approval of the World Bank,” a senior officer said. The detailed project report of four projects, including establishing and designating coastal sand dune parks in the state and erosion/accretion assessment studies to ascertain feasibility of annual replenishment of sand along the estuarine stretches identified for sand removal by traditional methods, is completed. Other projects that would be undertaken include assessment and documentation of potential fishery zones, marine biodiversity of critical marine habitats of the state - their status, threats, conservation measures and management plan and a pilot project on conversion of non-biodegradable waste to energy. While the state had submitted around 12 projects to be undertaken under ICZM at a total cost of over Rs 200 crore, the Centre has approved funding of around Rs 53 crore to take up six projects under ICZMP. Funding for the projects would be shared between the World Bank (50%), central government (30%) as grants, and the state government (20%), a senior government officer said. The officer said the union government has approved the funds based on a preliminary project report, done by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai. NCSCM will find out what the problems are and accordingly give solutions based on which projects would be taken up in the state. While Gujarat and Odisha were taken up under phase one, Goa and the rest of the states will be taken up in the second phase. TOI was the first to report that Goa could lose Rs 400 crore for coastal development under the integrated coastal zone management project as the government failed to submit a detailed project report to the environment ministry. Based on the TOI report, former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had given a go-ahead for the projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-centres-approval-integrated-coastal-plan-awaits-world-bank-nod/articleshow/81891493.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Army must pay pension to 2nd wife if 1st relinquishes her right: HC||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has clarified that once the former wife of a soldier has suffered a statement before the court relinquishing her right in favour of the second wife, the army authorities are required to pay the benefits to the second wife according to her entitlement. HC was of the view in such a situation, the authorities cannot insist on the proof of divorce by the late soldier to his first wife, who is voluntarily making statements in favour of her former husband’s second wife. Justice Anil Khsetarpal of the HC has passed the order while dismissing the appeal filed by record officer of Top Khana Abhilekh (artillery record office of Indian Army), Nashik, Maharashtra. The dispute before the HC was with regard to entitlement to the pensionary benefits of Gunner Mohinder Singh, a retired soldier of artillery regiment and now deceased. He was native of Ambala district in Haryana. His wife Daljit Kaur had claimed the pensionary benefits for being the widow of Mohinder Singh. The army authorities, however, were insisting that according to the records, Mohinder Singh was married to one Bant Kaur and pensionary benefits cannot be granted to Daljit Kaur. However, during the hearing of the matter at a lower court Ambala, Mohinder Singh’s first wife Bant Kaur made a statement that she was married to Mohinder Singh in 1960 and a daughter was born. It was further stated that she was left by Mohinder Singh in 1964 after which she remarried Kartar Singh. She also made a statement that she has no objection if the pensionary benefits are released in favour of Daljit Kaur exclusively. On the basis of her statement, the lower court asked the army authorities to pay benefits to Mohinder’s second wife Daljit Kaur. Aggrieved to these orders, record officer Top Khana Abhilekh (artillery record) filed an appeal before the HC. During the hearing of the case, the HC observed that Mohinder Singh got married with Daljit Kaur and the couple was blessed with four children. However, the army authorities insisted that the benefit of pension cannot be granted to Daljit Kaur because Bant Kaur was never legally divorced Mohinder Singh. Hearing all the parties, the HC observed that once Bant Kaur herself has given up her right, the appellants are required to pay the amount of pensionary benefits to Daljit Kaur who is the widow of late Mohinder Singh, once Bant Kaur has appeared in court and suffered a statement relinquishing her right in favour of the other widow. “Therefore, this court does not find any error in the judgment passed by the lower court,” held the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/army-must-pay-pension-to-2nd-wife-if-1st-relinquishes-her-right-hc/articleshow/81890941.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat’s power equipment makers train sights on foreign shores||Once a flourishing industry in the state, power equipment makers lost business over the last few years due to a sharp fall in orders from the Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL). And the protection policies in other states implemented by power distribution companies (DISCOMs) to protect their local manufacturers added to the woes of the industry in Gujarat. Power equipment manufacturers from Gujarat have now begun looking abroad for greener pastures. Several small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have either tied up with power equipment makers in other countries or are scouting for good firms to forge joint ventures. "The Gujarat government isn’t giving local companies much of an edge over firms from other states. And our business in other states has gone down due to their local reservation policies. To survive and thrive, we have to now shift focus to the foreign markets," said Samir Kumar Thakkar, managing director, Akshar Energy Structures Ltd, which makes transmission line towers and sub-station structures. "We will manufacture the products here, and then they will be assembled in Kenya," Thakkar told TOI. Industry players said that the firms looking for JVs abroad have their eyes set on Africa as only 20% of the continent is covered by power supply, and the demand for power equipment is set to grow. UAE is another lucrative market for setting up JVs. "Africa has huge potential for the power equipment industry, and their policies are also friendly. Apart from exporting products, the power equipment makers from Gujarat are also setting up joint ventures with the local firms there. The JVs aim to get better business for the power equipment makers in Gujarat that are currently facing a crisis," said Amit Patel, secretary, Gujarat Electrical Equipment Manufacturers Association (GEEMA). Patel added that his firm, Danke Electricals, is already in talks with some firms in Africa for setting up a joint venture. "The manufacturing business for us is no more lucrative in India. Gradually, we may shift our entire operations from Gujarat to Africa, where government policies will benefit us," Patel said. Vadodara is considered a hub for electrical equipment manufacturing, and just four years ago it commanded 30% of the market in power equipment in the country. But the industry is now struggling to survive and has demanded that Gujarat DISCOMs should increase reservation of business from the current 50% to 75% for local power equipment manufacturers. The Covid-induced pandemic has further hit the industry hard as the government reduced electrical equipment orders by at least 50% last year. It’s an enormous loss for the industry that earns most of its revenues from DISCOMs. "The demand for power equipment is going down in Gujarat, as electrification has already been done in 90% of the state. In other states, we can’t compete as they give preference or majority reservation to their local firms. In Gujarat, local firms have only 50% reservation, so we are losing business from all sides," said Amol Damle, director, Airbreak Switchgear Products Pvt Ltd. "Setting up joint ventures with local firms in African countries like Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and others is a lucrative business proposition for Indian SMEs. But they have to be cautious as the Chinese power equipment makers have already forayed into Africa and are dominating the markets there. Our firms will have to fight it out with them to capture their market share," said Nimish Phadke, director of Comfort InstaPower Ltd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/states-power-equipment-makers-train-sights-on-foreign-shores/articleshow/81891044.cms||Tushar Tere

The toll of casualties now stands at 835. With two deaths, the mortality count rose to 835.  Two men, a 60-year-old from Kolhapur, and an 85-year-old from Ponda, succumbed to the virus while undergoing treatment at Goa Medical College. The case positive rate dropped from 14 % on Friday to 10.5 % over the last 24 hours. A health officer, however, said this should not be a reason to lower one’s guard. “There must be a consistent drop for a week and more to say with some confidence that new infections are lessening. Until that happens, we can’t heave a sigh of relief,” he said. On Saturday, Margao’s caseload breached the 200-mark while that of the Porvorim primary health centre inched closer toward 200 cases. The caseload at Mapusa was 103. Besides Panaji, Margao, Porvorim, Ponda, Vasco and Mapusa, some smaller towns and villages are also witnessing a steady rise in infections over the last few days, though their numbers are still down. After Candolim, whose case tally stood at 151 on Saturday, the rise in cases reported from Siolim is also a cause of concern among smaller towns. “Though Siolim is a village, over the last decade it has become populous and sees a high turnout of tourists heading towards the coastal belt of Mandrem. Also, it has a high concentration of migrants who are mostly employed as construction labourers,” the health officer said. On Saturday, Siolim’s caseload was 83, but in all probability, the number will go up in the next few days. Similarly, Sankhali, Aldona, Chimbel and Corlim in North Goa and Cansaulim, Cortalim and Loutolim need to be watched. “If these places show a rise on lines of major towns, the state’s daily average will be 300 or more. I pray, we are proven wrong,” the officer said. Over the last 24 hours, 102 patients were home isolated and 27 hospitalised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/219-new-covid-19-cases-2-casualties-reported-on-sat/articleshow/81891496.cms||---

The latest guideline mandates passengers coming to Gujarat to compulsorily show RT-PCR negative report upon arrival. Following chaos over payment for the test, many passengers left the airport without giving their sample. Narrating the incident, Ashok Prajapati, a city-based businessman who arrived from Chandigarh, said, “I did not carry an RT-PCR report because I just left from Gujarat two days ago and I have no symptoms. I was made to wait in queue and there were some 80-90 passengers ahead of me for getting tested. There was some chaos as many passengers argued over paying for the test.” The incident took place after 2.30pm on Saturday. Sources confirmed that at least 30 passengers left the airport after arguing with officials of the health department of the civic body who are deployed at the airport for testing the passengers. Sources said that passengers were reluctant to pay Rs 800 while giving their sample for RT-PCR tests. “Many of them said that if the government has laid out guidelines of a mandatory test, they must bear the charges,” said the source. An estimated 10,000 passengers arrive at the city airport daily. AMC officials said that people cited several reasons for not bringing their RT-PCR report, urgencies being among the most common. “Many others also complain that they need to report to office urgently and therefore need to leave, while trying to escape testing,” said an AMC official. A team of AMC health department officials has been deployed at the arrivals area of the domestic terminal of the city airport. Besides, there is another set-up by a private lab near the international terminal of the city airport where passengers can voluntarily get themselves tested for Covid (RT-PCR).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fliers-resist-payment-for-virus-test-many-head-home-after-chaos/articleshow/81890997.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Chandigarh||Amid Covid spike, PSGPC seeks info from Pak govt on Baisakhi celebrations, Indian jatha||Amritsar: Pakistan government might just allow Indian devotees to celebrate Baisakhi at Gurdwara Panja Sahib in Hasanabdal, said Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PGPC) president Satwant Singh, while talking to TOI, on Saturday. Earlier, Pakistan’s National Command Operation Center (NCOC ) had put a ban on large religious gatherings owing to spike in Covid-19 cases. Satwant said 1,300 devotees were expected to arrive from India on the occasion. Evacuee Trust Property Board chairman Aamer Ahamd said NCOC of Pakistan, which is the overarching body for the coronavirus pandemic, had refused to hold religious congregations so far. “But they are still considering and the matter is being examined on a day-to-day basis,” said Aamer, adding that they were waiting for NCOC’s final decision and the kind of restrictions to be imposed would be the final deciding factor. PSGPC president Satwant Singh said they had sent a request letter to the government seeking to know how much congregation PSGPC could invite for Baisakhi. He said they were yet to hear from the government, following which a decision would be taken. However, the PSGPC president said everyone would have to adhere to the SOPs prescribed by the government. He said PSGPC would urge local devotees to visit the gurdwara turn by turn to avoid crowding. “Hopefully, we will celebrate Baisakhi with religious zeal and enthusiasm,” he said. The Centre had on February 17 refused to allow SGPC’s jatha to leave for Pakistan to observe Saka Nankana Sahib at Nankana Sahib, birthplace of Sikh’s first master Guru Nanak Dev, citing security reasons and Covid situation in Pakistan . The jatha was scheduled to leave on February 18 and was to be led by the officiating jahtedar of Akal Takht, Giani Harpreet Singh . Giving details of the PSGPC’s Baisakhi programme, Satwant said as par the schedule programme, they would receive Indian pilgrims at Wagah border on April 12, from where they would be taken to Gurdwara Panja Sahib, Hasan Abdal, where the jatha would stay for two days. On April 14, the main function of Baisakhi would be held at Gurdwara Panja Sahib, following which they would leave for Nankaka Sahib. During their pilgrimage, devotees would also pay obeisance at Gurudwara Saccha Sauda, Gurdwara Dera Sahib, Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, and Gurdwara Rori Sahib before departing for India on April 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amid-covid-spike-psgpc-seeks-info-from-pak-govt-on-baisakhi-celebrations-indian-jatha/articleshow/81890973.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Lahaul-Spiti police had received information at about 9:20pm that two tourists had lost way while hiking towards 14,900-feet-high Kunzum Pass. A search team was formed immediately and started looking for them in the vast area which has no mobile network or any human settlement. Luckily both the tourists, who were shivering in cold, were found and brought back to Kaza in Spiti. Lahaul-Spiti SP Manav Verma said both the tourists, identified as Rahul and Vikrant, resident of Nangal Pathani in Rewari district of Haryana, were medically examined and found in good condition. “The night temperature at Kunzum is below minus 15 degrees Celsius. The weather could have proved fatal if they were not found. They should not have moved towards Kunzum in this season,” he said. Spiti-Kunzum Pass-Manali road is still blocked with snow. Tourists are visiting Spiti valley via Shimla and Kinnaur. Despite advisory not to go to higher areas in winter time, some tourists ignore warnings and put themselves in danger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/two-haryana-tourists-rescued-from-kunzum-pass/articleshow/81890982.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Stalin might win Tamil Nadu elections, predict Dharavi’s Tamil voters||On December 5, 2016, the day Tamil Nadu's sixtime chief minister Jayalalithaa died, Sion's Paul Nagarajan shaved his head. Soon, the black-red-and-white border symbolizing his dyed-in-thewool fealty to AIADMK disappeared from the white veshti of this Tamil shop owner and so did the photo of "Amma" that used to jut out of his shirt pocket at all times. "She was an iron lady. Had she been alive, she would've been the PM," says the 41-year-old native of Thiruvarur district who is fondly referred to as 'Mumbai Paul' as a hat-tip to his backstory. Paul had arrived in Mumbai as a frail teenager in 1996 "with barely one pair of clothes" and soon became the moustachioed owner of a men's wear shop each in Dharavi and in Thiruvarur, where he is now preparing to cast his vote for the upcoming TN elections on April 6. For the first time, Mumbai Paul will trek up to the voting booth in a border-less veshti to vote for a party other than AIADMK: Naam Tamilar Katchi, a Tamil nationalist party, which "does not encourage joblessness by distributing free rations and TV sets". In his gut, though, Paul knows who will win. "90 per cent DMK," he says. That's more or less the aggregate prophecy of many of the Tamil residents and entrepreneurs of Dharavi who have returned to their native towns to cast their votes. The elections are being fought in the absence of the state's two larger-than-life figureheads: DMK's M Karunanidhi and AIADMK's Jayalalithaa. In a different time, this dutiful election-season voyage would've had the aura of a carnival for these Tamilians. However, Covid-19 has not cast a profound shadow over their mood and raised their expectations. "Total loss, madam," paraphrases Paul who incurred losses to the tune of Rs 10 lakh during the lockdown. Dharavi resident Michael Nadar had carried baggage--both emotional and real--when he appeared at his parents' doorstep in Thirunelveli after losing his Thanebased elder brother to Covid on May 21 last year. "I didn't get to see his face," says Michael, who had identified the plastic-shrouded body of his 46-year-old sibling at a Thane hospital. Still haunted by thoughts of the premature demise Michael, a work-from-home employee ensconced in the peace of his green hometown, concedes that TN's AIADMK government handled the pandemic better than Maharashtra did. "But that may not help it win the elections," says the advertising professional who believes DMK president M K Stalin would become the next chief minister. Besides, its contributions to higher education and small-scale industries in TN might just tilt the luck in DMK's favour, feels Srithar Tamilan of Mumbai Vizhithezhu Iyakkam (MVI)--an association of Tamil residents of Dharavi--which has sent a list of demands on behalf of Maharashtra's 25-lakh-odd Tamil migrants to parties contesting the TN elections. "If our votes are required, our demands should be incorporated into election manifesto," states the letter, which seeks Tamil-medium education for students up to standard 10 and a separate ministry to maintain records of migrants outside the state. "When the lockdown was announced in March, around 4,000 migrant labourers from TN were stranded in Maharashtra. We faced challenges in helping them as we didn't have the exact figures," reveals Srithar, a native of Thirunelveli's Pattamadai village, whose letter also seeks an increase in the frequency of trains from Mumbai to Tamil Nadu. "At the moment, there are only 15 trains from Mumbai to TN when there are 25 trains going to Kerala, a smaller state," says Srithar. With its assortment of actors and unfailing shower of freebies, the TN elections have always been a vibrant vortex of mass hysteria. Dharavi-based press photographer Ravi Nadar has followed this seasonal political circus with childlike glee and is among the few who puts his money on CM Edappadi Palaniswami's return.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-stalin-might-win-tn-elections-predict-dharavis-tamil-voters/articleshow/81891516.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

Of the 14 rescued, 10 are from Bengal including one, 18-year-old from Baruipur. On February 2021, a missing diary was lodged under Basanti PS about a 21-year-old woman. In mid-March, her brother-in-law received a call from her, seeking help to rescue her from the spa in Surat where she was being forced into sex trade. The mother of two children had been lured by promise of a lucrative job at a restaurant by a local linkman. When the relative visited the mall on March 23, he was threatened and somehow managed to escape. He then reached out to Birangana Seva Samity, a non-profit organization working to prevent child and women trafficking in South 24 Parganas. After getting information, Mission Mukti Foundation joined Rescue Foundation, Surat Child Line and Crime Branch Surat to conduct a joint raid on Friday evening. Another woman rescued is from Baruipur PS area. Married to one Mijanur Rahman Sardar on March 18, 2021, she was forced into sex trade. However, she has has been kept in quarantine after she tested Covid positive during a health check. The others have been kept in a local rescue shelter. Sources said the other eight girls were later released after they refused to return home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/10-bengal-girls-rescued-from-a-sex-racket-in-surat/articleshow/81890637.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Minor ports give false impression of MPT expansion’||Panaji: Based on the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) for Goa, many citizens had expressed fears that it appears that the Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) could be expanding its activities to other coastal areas of Goa. The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) has, however, now clarified that MPT and all minor ports in Panaji, etc have been marked in a single colour code in the CZMP. This, it said, has given the wrong impression that MPT is taking over minor port areas as well. “The National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) sought a notification of port limits with an email to the department of environment. Consequently, copies of the notification of major port limits i.e. MPT, including Betul, and of minor ports - Panaji, Chapora, Tiracol, Sal and Talpona - were provided to NCSCM,” the GCZMA has said, clarifying objections raised to the draft CZMP for Goa. The coastal authority has said that the NCSCM has shown the port limits in the CZMP maps and that major and minor ports have all been shown in a single colour code. “This has thereby created confusion and doubt among the general public that all areas shown under port limits is a major port i.e. MPT. Numerous objections and suggestions have been received from the general public on this issue, including apprehensions that the ports authority proposed to be constituted under the Major Port Authorities Bill may acquire their land shown within port limits,” GCZMA has said. Some local bodies have also expressed apprehensions regarding dilution or overlapping of their jurisdictions with the port jurisdiction. “An email seeking clarification was forwarded to the NCSCM as to why the port limits were depicted in the draft CZMP maps. The NCSCM has clarified that as per the provision of the CRZ notification, the no development zone of CRZ is not applicable within port limits,” the GCZMA said. The GCZMA, however, noted that as per the guidelines for preparation of the coastal plan provided to states, it has not been expressly specified that port limits should be depicted in the draft CZMP. “Hence, the GCZMA decided to recommend to the NCSCM to remove depiction of port limits from the draft CZMP before submission to the National Coastal Zone Management Authority,” the GCZMA has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/minor-ports-give-false-impression-of-mpt-expansion/articleshow/81891532.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Cong gave only 35,000 jobs against promise of 55 lakh: YAD||Mansa: Youth Akali Dal has accused the state government led by Captain Amarinder Singh of betraying the youth of the state by giving only 35,000 jobs instead of providing one job per family to 55 lakh households as promised before 2017 assembly elections. Addressing a rally in Mansa on Saturday, YAD president Parambans Singh Romana said after assuming power in the state, the Congress government forgot all promises, particularly those made to the youth. He said the Congress had promised one job per household in its election manifesto but during the recently held state assembly session, the government, in an answer to a query by SAD, stated that 35,000 government jobs were provided during the last four years. He said the government was bound to create 55 lakh jobs under its ghar ghar rozgar scheme. Romana also alleged that drug addiction had increased in the state and the government was “shielding those who had misappropriated five crore tablets meant for drug de-addiction.” During the last four years, the sale of drugs had spread to every nook and corner of the state and the youth were the worst sufferers while illicit liquor had claimed 126 lives in Tarn Taran, he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-gave-only-35000-jobs-against-promise-of-55-lakh-yad/articleshow/81891003.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Repeat of 2020: Covid patients rush to govt hospitals in last stages, die||HYDERABAD: In what appears to be a repeat of 2020 — when the first wave of Covid-19 started peaking — several critically-ill patients are seen rushing to government hospitals, in the eleventh hour. Result: government facilities are reporting more casualties, with some patients dying in the ambulances while in transit. Over the last five days alone, 12 such patients have died on their way to Gandhi Hospital. According to authorities, most of these patients are from rural areas and far-off districts who first get admitted to small and mid-sized private hospitals in Hyderabad. Through the course of treatment, when are unable to pay any more, they are redirected to government hospitals. “The ones who are exhausting their resources early into the treatment are coming to us in time and we are able to save them. But many are coming to us so late that not much can be done. We have at least two-three patients being brought dead each day,” said Dr M Raja Rao, superintendent, Gandhi Hospital that’s attending to all critical cases of Covid-19. Similar instances are being reported from the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS), admit officials. “A lot of patients we are getting here are coming from private hospitals. They were already admitted in some hospitals and were redirected to us when they could not pay for treatment any further,” said Dr Ehsan Ahmed Khan, superintendent, TIMS. Along with more patients rushing to private facilities, there’s also a surge in grievances against hospitals — again much like what was being reported during this time last year. In one such complaint, a patient said that he was was charged Rs 50,000 per day — for three days — at a private hospital, under the pretext of being Covid-19 positive. “When he later went to an independent lab to get tested, he found that he was Covid negative,” said a source from the state health department. This urge for private hospital treatment, despite the experiences that people underwent last year, is the real problem, say some experts TOI spoke to. “It is perceived that private sector gives us better service, although there is no difference in treatment seen in private and government sectors. There is a need to sensitise people and stress that people should not panic and run to private hospitals even if they have minor symptoms. That creates an artificial shortage of beds,” said professor Subodh Kandamuthan, director, Centre for Healthcare Management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/repeat-of-2020-covid-patients-rush-to-govt-hospitals-in-last-stages-die/articleshow/81891524.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Chandigarh||CM’s Rohtak visit sparks protest & then clash between cops, farmers||CHANDIGARH: Farmers and police clashed during a protest against Haryana chief minister (CM) Manohar Lal Khattar’s visit to Rohtak on Saturday. To prevent the situation from deteriorating further, the CM’s chopper landed at an alternate location. There were injured persons on both sides, including an elderly farmer and a cop. Though the number of injured persons could be more, it could not confirmed by the time this report was filed. Police were also yet to register an FIR in connection with the violence. Before the clash, farmers — who have been protesting against leaders of the BJP-JJP coalition in the state over the Centre’s three farm laws — had gathered outside the campus of Baba Mastnath University here on coming to know that Khattar was coming to the town to attend a prayer meeting in the memory of the deceased father of Rohtak MP Arvind Sharma. His chopper was scheduled to land at the university. However, it later landed at police lines in Rohtak. Police had set up a three-layer security cordon around the university’s campus to thwart any law and order trouble, but farmers tried to break the barricades and a clash followed in which the farmers pelted stones at the cops and the police retaliated with a lathicharge. One of the police personnel was injured in the incident, said a police official. An elderly farmer was also injured in the melee, said protesting farmers. Earlier, Rohtak SP Rahul Kumar and ADGP Sandeep Khirwar, who is in charge of Haryana Police’s Rohtak range, attempted to pacify the protesters. SP Sharma claimed that police did not use any force. He accused some persons among the protesters of pelting stones and injuring cops and protesters both. “The helipad at police lines was closer to the venue of the event where the CM had to go. We handled the situation peacefully and without use of force. There were some fringe elements among farmers who pelted stones. We are examining the footage,” said Sharma. Congress leader and former MLA Krishan Moorti Hooda condemned the incident, describing it as an outcome of government and police action on farmers. “In fact, the government itself is provoking farmers. When BJP-JJP ministers, MLAs and leaders are avoiding all public programme, the CM too should have cancelled his programme. Use of force, especially lathicharge and teargas shells on farmers, will only anger protesters,” said Hooda. Protesting farmers were shouting slogans ‘Kisan Ekta Zindabad’. Farmers have been opposing leaders of the BJP and its alliance partner JJP in the wake of the Centre’s three farm laws. Farmers had on Thursday, held a protest against Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala outside Hisar airport.

---||Chandigarh||Jind roads blocked to oppose action||Jind: Villagers have started blocking roads at various points in Jind district in protest against police action on the farmers’ protest in Rohtak during the visit of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday. According to reports, villagers have gathered on the roads outside their villages on Jind-Chandigarh highway, Jind-Barwala highway, and Hisar-Chandigarh highway and blocked vehicular traffic. Police and the district authorities have not taken any action so far. Monu Kandela, a native of Kandela village and one of the protesters, said it was a spontaneous reaction from villagers as a mark of protest to the incident of lathicharge by police on farmers in Rohtak. He said some farmers have suffered injuries in the police action.Kandela said the government seemed to be in a mood for confrontation with farmers, instead of opening a channel for dialogue. “The assault on BKU leader Rakesh Tikait by some BJP activists in Rajashtan yesterday and the police action on farmers in Rohtak today have caused resentment among villagers,” he said. Amit Kumar, a protester at Intal village who blocked the road from Jind to Barwala, said, “We will not accept any action on farmers. We are blocking the roads indefinitely as farmers are angry with the attitude of the BJP-led state government. If the government tries to initiate any action in future, we will take stern action,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jind-roads-blocked-to-oppose-action/articleshow/81891506.cms||---

Traffic is being stopped by Lahaul-Spiti police at Darcha traffic check post. According to police, they are still to get inputs from Border Roads Organisation (BRO) about the exact reason behind road blockade as there were rumours of a landslide and even about a truck overturning on the highway. Lahaul-Spiti SP Gaurav Verma said, “Vehicles will not be allowed beyond Darcha, the last village of the district towards Ladakh. Traffic will be allowed only after receiving a message from the BRO.” Traffic movement on the highway is expected to come to a standstill as meteorological department has predicted snowfall in the higher regions from Monday.

Jaising’s brother is admitted to Lilavati Hospital. She told TOI: “My brother was admitted in a triage area in the basement on March 31. After a couple of days, he was shifted to a ward with six people. Since then there has been no assistance. No bed pan initially. When it was given on one occasion, it was not removed for hours. He is too weak. No water bottle within arm’s reach.”  Jaising met Dr Jalil Parkar who said doctors and nursing staff were working hard since the pandemic and were suffering from fatigue. “He assured me my brother whose last dosage of medicine is due will be discharged on Sunday.” Dr Parkar said the patient was admitted under his care and is doing well. “The family had no complaints about the treatment but was unhappy with certain services.

---||Chandigarh||Farmers gherao Karnal market committee office, admn steps in||KARNAL: Farmers, on Saturday, gheraoed the Karnal market committee office and staged a dharna to protest against the scheduling system for bringing the wheat crop in grain markets. On Saturday morning, a number of farmers, led by farmer leader Jagdip Singh Aulakh, reached the Karnal market committee office and started raising slogans against the BJP-JJP government. They alleged that government agencies were turning away farmers bringing their produce to the mandi without the scheduling system. Apart from opposing the scheduling system, farmers also demanded that gate pass be issued for 24 hours, regardless of whether the farmer came as per schedule or not. They also demanded that the crop be procured immediately at minimum support price. Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha tried to pacify the protesting farmers but they were adamant. Thereafter, Karnal DC Nishant Kumar Yadav and SP Ganga Ram Punia reached the spot and assured farmers that they would be provided with online gate pass on arrival at the mandi, with or without schedule SMS, provided they were registered on the Meri Fasal Mera Byora portal. Yadav announced that the gate pass would be issued to farmers from 4am to 8pm and the entire crop would be procured. The DC also assured farmers that they would not face any problems in the procurement process. He urged them to bring only dry and clean produce to mandis to prevent problems or delays in selling the produce. Following the assurance of the deputy commissioner, farmers ended their protest.

First, the government agency procured the produce of farmer Bhupinder Singh, who had dumped it outside the Karnal market committee office on Friday after being denied entry inside the market, as he did not have the schedule message.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-gherao-karnal-market-committee-office-admn-steps-in/articleshow/81891526.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Capt writes to PM: Stay with old system for now||Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to seek continuance of the existing system of payment to farmers till a consensus can be evolved on the issue of direct benefit transfer (DBT). Asserting that arhtiyas were not middlemen between farmers and procurement agencies, but service providers, the CM urged the PM to ensure that the livelihood of farmers and all others involved in the procurement of food grains was not jeorpardised. In a letter to Modi, Amarinder also sought a meeting to apprise him about the concerns of various stakeholders about changing the existing payment system “before the situation gets out of hand”. On behalf of the Punjab government, he assured Modi of complete support towards evolving a consensus among the stakeholders for long-term durable reforms. Expressing concern over recent efforts to “rock” institutional and social arrangements through some guidelines and directives of the Centre, the CM said he had noticed a pattern in some recent one-sided decisions and steps taken by the Centre. He added as a soldier and a farmer himself, he “would like to highlight risks and threats that are likely to be posed to the food security of the nation, as a result of some of these decisions for being completely detached from ground realities of farming in this part of the country”. Recalling the role of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Western UP in ushering in the Green Revolution and ensuring national food security, he said security systems and defences are built over decades, but can be compromised and demolished in seconds. “While I endorse the views that as a society, and as nation, we have to continuously evolve and reform, and as the political leadership of the world’s largest democracy, we have to continuously think of improving, I strongly believe that reforms are most successful and sustainable if carried out through a consultative process with all stakeholders, ensuring ownership of all,” said Amarinder. He asked the PM to advise the department of food and public distribution and the Union ministry of finance to initiate discussions and consultations with all stakeholders. Amarinder stressed that any reforms, including reduction in the time of transfer of the payment to farmer/direct payment to the farmers by the procurement agencies should be first discussed with all stakeholders. “Any sudden changes that disturb existing arrangements may jeopardise procurement operations, thereby not only affecting food security, but threaten the livelihood of millions of farmers, farm workers and traders.” He added that Punjab, in its efforts to ensure transparency in procurement and track payments, had implemented an elaborate online ‘Anaaj Kharid Portal’ (http://anaajkharid.in) in which all farmers have been registered, and procurement is done through this portal. The payment to the arhtiya is made online through the portal,and the payment made to farmers is also recorded on the portal,which is integrated with the PFMS portal of the Centre, he said. Citing existing rules and court decisions, Amarinder said both provided for “freedom” and “choice” to the farmer for payment against his produce. Pointing out that every year about Rs 54,000 crore of payment was made to about 12.5 lakh farmers in two cropping seasons, he said there had been no major complaints or reports of non-receipt of payment by farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-writes-to-pm-stay-with-old-system-for-now/articleshow/81891521.cms||---

Making the announcement to guardians, the school authorities said it was no longer possible for them to run the institutes on the 2019 fee structure. Following court orders, the fees were not revised in 2020 and following another directive from the high court, the schools slashed tuition and sessions fees by 20%. Now, citing a high court order of October 13, 2020, the authorities said they were allowed to revise their fees from the new financial year. Some schools have, however, decided not to immediately revise the fees but to do away with the 20% slash, while a few others said they would wait till the end of the first quarter and then increase the amount. La Martiniere Schools had already revised fees and the new amounts were payable from the first quarter, confirmed school secretary Supriyo Dhar. “ There are huge expenses we have incurred because of Covid-related sanitisation and upgrade required for virtual teaching. We have gone for a 10% revision of fees, as is the tradition in our school,” he said. Pratt Memorial also increased amounts on some heads and informed parents about it, said principal Carolyn Lionel. “It will be difficult to give a clear percentage as we have not increased fees equally across heads,” she said. Schools, such as Don Bosco Park Circus, are going back to 100% fees immediately and will work out the details of a hike, which will be implemented from the second quarter. Principal Father Bikash Mondal said, “We have decided to go easy in the first quarter, but we hope the pandemic will improve by the time we are in the second quarter and parents will be able to pay the revised fees.” St James’ School and St Thomas’ Kidderpore have both decided to do away with the 20% rebate from the first quarter before any decision on hike is taken. Ram Mohan Mission is likely to announce the revised fees by April 14. The administration has decided to wait for the Supreme Court hearing slated for April 5.. St Lawrence School had also worked out the details of a hike but was waiting for the SC hearing on April 5, said principal Father Sebastian. More than 145 city schools had filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against the HC order of October 13 and the hearing is slated for Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-hike-fees-from-first-quarter-some-roll-back-slash/articleshow/81890648.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Ludhiana||Communal spin to MLA assault on social media||JALANDHAR: The issue of thrashing and stripping of Abohar MLA Arun Narang in Malout may have been between farmers and BJP, with several local leaders and members of a farm union being named in the FIR, yet there appears a consistent attempt to give it a communal colour and make it a Sikhs versus Hindus issue. There have been hate messages against Sikhs on social media platforms after the incident, some even referring to the massacre of November 1984 and several branding farmers as terrorists and Khalistanis. Though farmers accused of assaulting Narang came from diverse communities and at least one prominent among them is a Brahmin, BKU (Sidhupur) block president Lakhanpal Sharma, yet nothing seems to be stopping a set of netizens from making it a Sikhs versus Hindus issue. “Make no mistake about it. The attack on BJP leader Arun Narang is another attack on Hindu minority in Punjab by Khalistan supremacists. Even before the so called ‘farmer protests’ emerged on the scene, Hindu leaders have been frequently targeted and assassinated in Punjab,” tweeted @BharadwajSpeaks, an influential handle followed by quite a few social media influencers. “It’s an attack on Hindus emanating from Khalistani supremacism. But most will go home laughing that’s it’s a BJP leader attacked, so funny,” tweeted Rahul Roushan from verified Twitter handle @rahulroushan, with thousands of retweets and likes. Replying to this @Hrishi83706699 tweeted, “RW Hindus should stop invoking 1984 riots as a mean to demean Congoons and showing solidaritywith sikhs as their own brethern. As a matter of fact Congress showed spine by dealing with Khalistanis in their own way when their main leader was assainated. Any party would do the same.” “#Khalistanis pretending as #Farmers. Seems like they have forgotten 1984,” tweeted ParulBhatnagar6. “Notaware of this pls share more details @FltLtAnoopverma @Gurdeep15087618 @AmitShahOffice @OfficeofJPNadda @capt_amarinder if this is true it shows how Khalistanis has (sic) taken over Punjab n u have lost it completely,” tweeted @Rajat_Hind, which is followed by BJP leaders Kapil Mishra, Shazia Ilmi and BJP MP and Karnataka unit vice president Shobha Kranadlaje. “What Khalistani Sikhs did on #ArunNarang shows they are not human. As I was saying these Khalistani terrorists are not protesting against Bill but against existence of Hindus in the state. Terrorist (sic) are supported by Punjab Govt. Hindus of Punjab needs (sic) to stand up against Khalistanis,” tweeted @me_ganesh14. “These Khalistanis still have no shame for shameful act on Jan 26 or attacking anyone with different viewpoints. Instead they feel proud. Just like their fake or distorted history, they are fraud deskbhakht and religious bigot,” tweeted @avinashgoyal1984. “It’s attack on Hindus,” tweeted Ajit Asthana using twitter handle @shivtradingcoka. “BJP MLA stripped naked and attacked in Punjab by Khalistanis and still its not national news,” tweeted, Minty Sharma using twitter handle @MintOminty. In a widely shared video on Facebook a fellow identifying himself as Arvind Gautam of Shiv Sena (Hind) said, “Sikh terrorists are masquerading as farmers. Earlier, Hindus taught them a lesson and then they sat quiet. But now they are again raising their head… Punjabi Hindus are facing oppression and I request Hindus in the entire country to give them befitting reply. They did similar things in 1984 but when Hindus united they cried and settled down.” Reacting to the Hindu-Sikh binary being built on the issue and hate messages against Sikhs on social media, Doaba Kisan Sangharsh Committee senior vice-president Mukesh Chander Sharma, said, “Our farmers are opposing BJP only and not any community. There seems to be a deliberate attempt to vilify and target Sikhs to weaken the farm stir and there can also be political calculations behind it. The farm stir has rather showed united Punjab to the world and has brought different communities and castes even more closer.”In a widely shared video on Facebook a fellow identifying himself as Arvind Gautam of Shiv Sena (Hind) said, “Sikh terrorists are masquerading as farmers. Earlier, Hindus taught them a lesson and then they sat quiet. But now they are again raising their head… Punjabi Hindus are facing oppression and I request Hindus in the entire country to give them befitting reply. They did similar things in 1984 but when Hindus united they cried and settled down.” The Punjab BJP leaders have also been vouching for Hindu-Sikh unity and to protect it any cost. On Thursday, Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma said they would ensure and protect Hindu-Sikh unity in the state while general secretary Jiwan Gupta said that their party never defamed Sikhs or called farmers Khalistanis or terrorists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/communal-spin-to-mla-assault-on-social-media/articleshow/81891534.cms||IP Singh

---||Chandigarh||Pak Sikh girl back with her family||Amritsar: Family members of a Sikh girl and a Muslim boy from Nankana Sahib, whose relationship had brought their communities to the brink of a clash, have chosen to strike a truce. The girl's family has agreed not to lodge an FIR against the boy. A Sikh leader from Nankana Sahib, birthplace of Guru Nanak Dev, told TOI that the boy, Junaid, had allegedly abducted Jagmeet Kaur (17). “Before Junaid could change the girl’s religion and marry her, Sikh leaders of Nankana Sahib intervened and managed to strike a truce between the two families,” said sources. Sources said Junaid and Jagmeet are the relatives of Mohammad Hassan and Jagjit Kaur, the Nankana Sahib couple whose marriage saw similar incidents, but this could not be confirmed. Sources said tension mounted between the two communities after Ranjit Singh, father of Jagmeet, took up the issue with Sikh leaders and sought their intervention. In 2019, Nankana Sahib Sikh girl Jagjit Kaur had allegedly eloped with Mohammad Hasan and embraced Islam to become Ayesha. Her parents had lodged an abduction complaint with police against Hasan’s family. This created bitterness between Sikh and Muslim communities of Nankana Sahib, with a mob even storming Gurdwara Nankana Sahib because of this. Mohammad Sultan Sheikh, who was the counsel for Mohammad Hasan and Ayesha, said “The girl has now returned to her parents and there is no tension between the two communities.” Denying that Junaid was related with Hasan, Sheikh said, “The fact is that the girl is the sister-in-law of Manmohan Singh, brother of Ayesha”. Sources informed that if both the families had chosen a collision course, then there was a possibility of the girl being sent to Dar ul Aman as had happened in the case of Jagjit Kaur, so they chose not to file FIR and instead struck a compromise. Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) president Satwant Singh denied having any knowledge of the incident. Chela Ram Kewlani, from Pakistan's National Commission for Minorities, could not be contact for comment. Though his personal assistant said they would get back with a comment, nothing had happened till the time this report was filed on Saturday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pak-sikh-girl-back-with-her-family/articleshow/81891539.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Personal anxiety and fear of e-teaching took a toll on faculty members who struggled due to lack of training in using digital platforms, frequent technology failures, poor internet connection, lack of adequate equipment and increased workload. These are the findings of the study titled ‘Assessment of Barriers and Motivators in E-teaching among Medical Faculty of Punjab during COVID-19 Lockdown’. The study was conducted by a team of Government Medical College, Amritsar, in which 209 faculty members of medical institutes teaching MBBS, BDS, BPT and BSc nursing and having teaching experience of more than 10 years participated. It found that lack of personal interaction with students led to poor response from students and difficulty in creating lesson plans. They also faced the issue of visual fatigue and distractions during teaching. Over 52% of teachers delivered live online lectures, while over 43% shared recorded video lectures with the students. About 12% of teachers used other modes of e-teaching included sharing written material and sharing PPTs along with audio recordings. Over 64% of the faculty took lectures once or twice a week. About half of participating teachers used the classroom of the institution for e-teaching while 21% worked from home. Over 58% used the institute’s internet and 41.6% personal. Over 97% of the teachers were found facing some issue with e-teaching, with the most common being lack of personal interaction reported by 92% of teachers, poor response from students (55%), frequent technological failures/limited access to the internet (55%), lack of training regarding usage of digital platforms (25%), lack of adequate hardware (21%), visual fatigue (19%) and personal fear of e-teaching (9.6%). As per response of 42% of teachers, 70-90% of students were attending or reading the online lectures while online assignments were submitted by 50-70% of students in 22% cases, 70-90% in 17% cases, more than 90% of students submitted assignments in 13% cases while less than 50% submitted in 3% cases. Regarding the benefits of online teaching, about 48% were of the view that it was somewhat useful while about 38% felt it was useful in the current situation. About half of teachers were in favour of incorporating online teaching in the routine-teaching curriculum as an aid to face to face teaching. The findings of the study done by Dr Amandeep Singh, Dr Sanjeev Mahajan, Dr Harjot Kaur, Dr Mohal Lal, of the department of community medicine, Dr Gagandeep Singh of the department of pathology and Dr Prabhjot Kaur of the department of microbiology, has been published in the Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research and Health Care. The study has concluded that online teaching cannot be a substitute to routine classroom teaching but can be used as a supplement along with routine teaching.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/with-no-interactive-methods-medical-faculty-in-pb-find-e-teaching-difficult/articleshow/81891028.cms||Vinod Kumar

Some farmers are already on protest near YPS Chowk in Patiala city. In last week of March, they had blocked the road near YPS Chowk, but cleared it after a meeting was fixed with a cabinet minister for March 30. The farmers claimed that the minister had promised to urge CM Capt Amarinder Singh to take up their demands with the central government and NHAI. “Our meeting with the minister had turned fruitless as the government has given us no response so far. We have not blocked roads and farmers are sitting on roadside in protest, but the protest will be soon intensified. The meeting was held today in this regard and a consensus was reached on intensifying the agitation,” said Delhi-Katra Expressway Kisan Sangharsh Committee (DKEKSC) coordinator Harmanpreet Singh Jeji. He added several farmers of many other highways under state and central government had been protesting along with DKEKSC against the acquisition of their land. He said farmers were demanding that land acquisition process for national highways in Punjab be stopped until the matter of the three farm laws is resolved. He said farmers were demanding Rs 1.5 crore per acre as compensation for their fertile agricultural land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-body-to-step-up-e-way-protest/articleshow/81891538.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: In a first, some BMC hospitals to give vaccine on Sunday too||Mumbai: In a bid to bolster Covid-19 vaccination and reduce vaccine hesitancy among Mumbaikars, the BMC will for the first time hold vaccine drives on Sunday at some of its hospitals. The decision was announced on Saturday, when the 116 Covid-19 vaccine centres in the city inoculated a record 64,186 recipients. The BMC will also carry out awareness drives to encourage people to take the vaccine, so far considered the best bet against Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus. “We realise there is vaccine hesitancy among Mumbaikars,” said a senior BMC hospital doctor. “We have observed in each of the three segments (healthcare workers, frontline workers and senior citizens) for whom vaccination opened up in phases since January 16 that those interested in the vaccine make a beeline for the centres in the first 10 days.” The doctor said that as a result of the phenomenon, the numbers fail to rise proportionately. “We have not yet finished vaccinating all the healthcare workers even though their drive began almost three months ago. This points to a certain hesitancy,” said the doctor. So far, 1.67 lakh healthcare workers have taken the vaccine at least once, with 85,095 having taken the shot twice so far. The BMC had estimated a figure of more than two lakh healthcare workers in the city. The Sunday vaccination drive is supposed to tackle these issues. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said: “We will keep some of our centres with high footfalls open on Sunday as well and even operate double shifts so that we can reach out to the maximum number of people in the city.” Kakani said that the focus is on vaccinating more and more people so that they can develop antibodies over the next two months and help the authorities check the Covid-19 pandemic. The BMC has given 13.3 lakh vaccine doses since January 16. The BMC has plans to vaccinate 75,000 people a day within the next few days. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has said the goal is to vaccinate a lakh people a day. The state once again crossed the 3 lakh vaccination mark on Friday, with 3.28 lakh people getting the Covid-19 vaccine. The bulk of the recipients were in the 45-59 age group, accounting for 1.79 lakh recipients on Friday (the state public health department shares vaccination data a day later). Senior citizens formed the next big group with 1.07 lakh recipients on Friday. The state has managed to provide 68 lakh vaccine doses since January 16, said public health department officials. It leads the rest of the states in the number of doses given, accounting for over 9% of the 7.3 crore doses given across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-a-first-some-bmc-hospitals-to-give-vaccine-on-sunday-too/articleshow/81891564.cms||Malathy Iyer

The victim has been identified as Gurpreet Singh of Dhilwan village of Tapa tehsil. Acting on the complaint of his uncle, police have registered a case against his tentmate Randhir Singh alias Satta, who is in his mid-twenties, at Sector 6 police station of Bahadurgarh and arrested him. It is learnt that on Thursday late night Gurpreet and Satta left the tent to drink at a place near pole number 141 on Bahadurgarh bypass road. The duo reportedly had an argument over some issue which soon escalated to a full-blown fight and Satta allegedly bludgeoned Gurpreet to death. When the incident came to light in the morning, police were informed and the corpse was sent for autopsy. “We sent our teams and arrested the accused, who has confessed to the murder,’’ said Jhajjar SP Rajesh Duggal. Satta was remanded to judicial custody after police claimed to have recovered the case properties from his possession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmer-batters-tentmate-to-death-after-spat-in-tikri/articleshow/81891552.cms||---

As the struggle is under a collective leadership, he felt the participation of youths to be paramount and had jumped with this motive and ensured youths support the struggle wholeheartedly, the statement read. In such struggle, though opinion of individuals or organisations may differ yet collective approach remains paramount and differing opinion of anyone did not matter much, it added.

---||Kolkata||‘Edited’ video of TMC’s Koushani Mukherjee irks BJP’s Bonny Sengupta||KOLKATA: Actor and BJP member Bonny Sengupta hit back at his party for “targeting” his actress girlfriend and TMC Krishnagore North candidate Koushani Mukherjee with an “edited” video of her. A day earlier, Bengal BJP’s vice-president Ritesh Tiwari posted a video on Twitter, claiming Mukherjee had “openly given threats to BJP voters”. On Saturday, BJP lodged a complaint with the chief electoral officer against Mukherjee for making statements that were allegedly a “threat to free, fair and peaceful elections”. Controversy broke out when Tiwari tweeted Mukherjee’s video, saying: “TMC leaders have always used rape threats to intimidate the opposition. This time no one is scared.” In the video, Mukherjee is seen saying, “Hey you, come here. Are you all supporters of BJP? Think and vote. Everyone has mothers and sisters at home.” But Mukherjee posted the entire video online, explaining the context in which she had said it. Protesting against BJP’s efforts to malign her by circulating edited videos, she emphasized her intent of referring to the law and order problems in BJP-ruled states, where she said, women were unsafe. “My integrity, education and ideology towards women empowerment can never let me speak against other women,” she posted on Facebook on Saturday. She found support in Sengupta, who told TOI it was “unfair” to target a woman and edit her speech to create a controversy. “A party will try to find an opponent’s weak points. But I did not like the way BJP edited her video and posted it,” Sengupta said. He added: “I know her personally. This is the way she speaks. Koushani is very upfront. This tone might not be right during a campaign. But I know she is not so foolish to threaten voters. The video was edited wrongly to make it seem as if she was doing so. I don’t approve of this.” Actress-turned-BJP worker Rupa Bhattacharya didn’t agree: “I have heard her clarification. Koushani’s tone and body language smacked of arrogance. Bonny might be OK with that, I am not. A public figure has to choose her words carefully so that she isn’t misunderstood.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/edited-video-of-tmcs-koushani-irks-bjps-bonny/articleshow/81890661.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The procession reached Mansa from Sirsa district in Haryana. Soil collected from various parts of the country is being taken to protest sites on the borders of Delhi, where a memorial will be built in the memory of farmers who have died during the ongoing agitation by farmers. The first leg the yatra was carried out from March 12 to March 28, and it passed through Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand. The second leg of the Mitti Satyagraha Yatra started from Dandi in Gujarat on March 30 and will reach Shahjahanpur and Tikri border on April 5, and Singhu and Ghazipur borders the next day. The yatra entered Punjab after passing through Gujarat, Rajasthan and Haryana. “Soil from all over the country is to be dedicated to the martyrs of the farmers movement as farmers are determined to carry forward the idea of restoring the values of the freedom struggle through this protest,” said Narmada Bachao Andolan convener Medha Patkar upon entering Punjab. The yatra also crossed Sabarmati Ashram. From Mansa, it will go to Sunam, the birthplace of martyr Udham Singh, and reach Rohtak on April 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mitti-satyagraha-yatra-enters-punjab/articleshow/81891540.cms||---
---||Goa||Azossim church turns to Kerala’s ‘metal’ town for new bell||PANAJI: A search by parishioners for a 250-kg bell for a 400-year-old church in Tiswadi has led to a digital link with Kerala’s bell metal town of Mannar, known across India for its 200-year-old tradition of craftsmanship. Church bells last a life time, but the one adorning Azossim’s St Mathew church belfry developed a huge crack after just around four decades of being installed. “To seek a replacement for the damaged bell, we approached and received quotations from four firms in Mannar,” parish priest, Fr Cornelius Brito Fernandes said. Mannar, a hive of industrial activity in Kerala’s Alappuzha district, prides itself on its forges, which are hubs of creativity that churn out lamps, bells and vessels. “The world’s biggest church lamp at Kuravilangad and the world’s largest temple lamp at Chettikulangara Devi Temple, trace their origin to this tiny town..” a website tom toms proudly. With a foot-longcrack that has mistuned the bell’s sound, a replacement is inevitable. “The crack will keep on increasing and repair is not possible. The use of an iron clapper on the bell may have damaged it,” Sargam Kasar, a Bicholim-based artisan who inspected the bell said. Sargam, a local source for church and temple bells, said iron clapper is inappropriate for the bells made of brass and bronze. “A suitable clapper has to be separately made,” he said. In Mannar, the craftsmen use bell metal with copper and tin component to cast and mould bells for religious purposes, Jomi V Varghese, sales head of a reputed firm in Mannar said. Mannar’s fame started 200 years ago after Vishwakarma community from Tamil Nadu settled here at the king’s invitation to build temples. Next, they turned their talent to carving out handicrafts of brass, bronze and silver. “Almost every shop here is related to metal craft,” Varghese said. The east Tiswadi parish is seized with the bell issue. “We are processing the matter with higher church authorities to finalise a quotation,” the parish priest said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/azossim-church-turns-to-keralas-metal-town-for-new-bell/articleshow/81891547.cms||Paul Fernandes

The directions were issued after the government reviewed the Covid-19 situation, with a special emphasis on 11 states and UTs, including Chandigarh, reporting a “very high rise” in daily cases. A senior UT official said states and UTs were also asked to ensure people follow protocols, including wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing in public gatherings for which deputy commissioner and sub divisional magistrates (SDMs) are issuing permission. The administration is issuing permission after an undertaking from the host of following all Covid protocols, the official added. The states and UTs were also asked to increase number of beds in the hospitals for patients and strengthen ambulance services to ensure people reach hospitals on time, besides plan for a suitable number of necessary medical equipment like ventilators and oxygen cylinders. The city has sufficient number of beds and other medical facilities and if needed, the administration will further strengthen it, the official assured. The city’s total weekly Covid positivity rate of 13.8% is the third-highest in the country after Maharashtra (23.2%) and Nagaland (15.1%). The national average is 6.3%. On March 30, the seven-day average total positivity rate in the city was 13.5% and was second after Maharashtra with 23%. At that time, the seven-day average daily growth percentage was 1.03%. Following the nudge from the ministry of health and family welfare, RTPCR testing has increased to 80% recently. It was earlier flailing at 40% for a while. Tests per million per day remain consistent, with the UT occupying the third place since the last 15 days after Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/centre-hands-city-toolkit-to-curb-spread-of-covid/articleshow/81891036.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Chandigarh||Farmers, Dalits call for unity at rally||Shahabad-Markanda: Farmers and Dalit organisations on Saturday held a joint “Dalit Va Kisan Mahapanchayat” at a hall near Shaheed Udham Singh Chowk in Shahabad-Markanda town of Kurukshetra district. Coming close on the heels of the Union government’s observations on treatment of labourers in border areas, the event was aimed at presenting a joint stand besides protesting against the “anti-people” agri-marketing laws of the Centre. The rally has been held under the leadership of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Haryana (Charuni) state president, Gurnam Singh Charuni and All India Parisangh national president, Udit Raj, who is also national spokesman of All India Congress Committee (AICC). A number of people from farming and Dalit communities attended the meeting. Before the rally, farm and Dalit leaders paid floral tributes to Dr BR Ambedkar and Sir Chhotu Ram. The speakers said the new agri-marketing laws brought about by the Centre would not only affect farmers but also impact the livelihood of every section of society. Asking the gathering to continue the protest, Udit Raj said, “There will not be a better opportunity than this to save the Constitution made by Baba Sahib Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar and fight against privatisation. Farmers are also fighting for Dalits of the entire country. We have complaints from Dalit leaders, including MLAs and MPs, who are not speaking up and are sitting at home.” Maintaining that the cause is bigger than repeal of the three agriculture laws and legalising of MSP (minimum support price), Udit said farmers are struggling for the rights of all sections. “To save the Constitution, the movement is the only way against the dictatorial government. All possible efforts are being made to alter the Constitution and a large number of government bodies have been sold or are being sold. Education has also entered the policy sector,” Udit alleged. When asked about the stand of opposition parties against the government, Udit said, “So far, the opposition has not been able to take a strong stand. Central agencies like CBI, ED and income tax department are being misused against the opposition leaders to keep them silent. Farmers have been able to give a befitting reply, therefore, Dalits stand united with them,” he said. Farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni also accused the government of exploiting people. “Every section, including labourers, farmers and Dalits are being exploited. We blame each other but the fact is that the entire country is being looted by a few corporate houses. We are fighting against the corporate and we need the support of every section of society. The rank of India on the global hunger index is very poor and lakhs of people die of hunger in the absence of proper medical facilities and debt. The country has ample resources but distribution is not right,” he alleged. On grain markets and ongoing procurement, Charuni claimed, “The government is making all possible efforts to close grain markets. We had never asked for direct payments and we will not follow the schedule given by government agencies to bring produce in the market. The produce will be brought to the grain market when it matures. BJP believes in divide and rule but we need to stay united.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-dalits-call-for-unity-at-rally/articleshow/81891556.cms||JK Singh
---||Lucknow||UP: STF chargesheet accuses PFI men of fomenting riots||LUCKNOW/AGRA: A five-member team of UP STF filed a chargesheet of 5,000-page document against eight members the Popular Front of India (PFI) before a Mathura court on Saturday, accusing them of receiving funds from abroad to foment caste riots in Hathras in the wake of alleged gang rape of 19-year-old girl which led to her death in September 2020. They were slapped with sedition charges along with the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The chargesheet has been accepted and the court has fixed May 1 as the next date of hearing. Five of the eight members charged by the STF were presented before the Mathura court. They included journalist Siddique Kappan, Masood Ahmad, Atiq-ur-Rahman, Mohammad Alam and Rauf Sharif, while two of them — Anshad Badruddin and Firoz Khan — attended the court proceedings via video link from Lucknow jail. The eighth accused, Danish, is yet to be arrested. In the 5,000-page chargesheet, the PFI members have been accused of receiving funds to the tune of Rs 80 lakh from financial institutions in Muscat and Doha for the purpose. An STF officer said, “All the above named PFI members have been booked under the charges of sedition, wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot, injuring or defiling place of worship to insult the religion of any group and under the Information Technology Act, along with charges of punishment for raising funds for terrorist act and the UAPA." The chargesheet stated that materials collected from cellphones and laptops of the accused corroborate that they were trying to spread disharmony in the state by raking up crime incidents such as the one in Hathras. Documents were collected during searches at the office of PFI in Delhi and evidence was found, the STF said. ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar confirmed to TOI that a chargesheet was submitted but a probe in the case was still underway. Defence lawyer Madhuvan Datt Chaturvedi told TOI that after completing their investigation within 180 days, the STF filed its charge sheet with the list of more than 50 witnesses in the court of additional district and sessions judge (first) Anil Kumar Pandey on Saturday. “Danish has been issued summons for the next hearing,” the lawyer said. Kappan and his three associates were arrested last year on October 5 by Mathura police when they were heading to Hathras to meet the rape victim’s family. They were picked up on the apprehension of causing a breach of peace, but were later slapped with sedition and UAPA. The STF, investigating the case, came across the alleged role of CFI’s national general secretary, Rauf Sherif, during its inquiry. He was then arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in Thiruvananthapuram on December 12 last year in a money laundering case while he was trying to board a flight. Earlier, he was lodged in Kerala jail and later he was produced in a Mathura court which sent him to judicial custody. Anshad Badruddin and Firoz Khan, natives of Kerala, were arrested in mid-February from Lucknow. The cops had seized huge amounts of explosives and weapons and the two fugitives later reportedly confessed to their plan of executing bomb blasts across the state. “The accused have dismissed the charges as vague, groundless and initiated for promoting ideological agenda of state government,” the defence lawyer said, adding that the accused had verbally complained to the court that the authorities were "misbehaving with them inside the jail and had not provided them food for the past 24 hours". They also alleged that they were being treated shabbily by other prisoners. The lawyer said that, according to them, they had their last meal around 5 pm on Friday and since then they had not eaten anything despite their medical condition which is said to be "critical". One of them, Kappan, is a diabetic while Atiq-ur-Rehman is suffering from aortic regurgitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/stf-chargesheet-accuses-pfi-men-of-fomenting-riots/articleshow/81891558.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Goa||IIT-Goa, GMC may team up to surveil infectious diseases||PANAJI: Even as Goa grapples with a fast-spiking second wave of Covid-19 cases, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Goa’s newly-instituted school of interdisciplinary life sciences has proposed the establishment of a common entity involving government bodies, academic institutes of importance and reputed private NGOs located in Goa. The school has already begun talks with Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC), with an aim of establishing a Goa infectious diseases surveillance hub. The initiative is being headed by Sudhir Krishna, whose laboratory is based at the national centre for biological sciences at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. Now also affiliated to IIT Goa, Krishna said that IIT is working to bring GMC, National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa University, BITS Pilani-Goa and reputed NGOs like Sangath on a common platform. The common entity will then strive to work on gaps in infrastructure and training in treatment of infectious diseases in Goa. It also plans to work in the areas of local variants of Covid-19 and even vaccine research in collaboration with Indian companies. “We have all the capacity, but Goa has underutilised its academic capabilities. By working together, by taking an interdisciplinary approach by getting GMC, GU, IIT, etc, on board, we can be at the cutting edge. We need to have both competition and collaboration,” said Krishna. With the presence of production units for all major pharmaceutical companies in Goa, the state also has potential to become a global vaccine producing hub, said Krishna. He said that the data on Covid-19 variants is crucial during the second wave of infections, and carrying out genome sequencing can help identify variants and update vaccines (to make them) effective on local variants. “We are already in talks with GMC and we look forward to working with them. We must break the public-private entity divide. At present, we are in the midst of a crisis and crisis drives change,” said Krishna. He said that the infectious diseases surveillance hub, once established, will expect GMC to identify a problem of importance in public health for the state and then identify the gaps in infrastructure and training, which the new entity can help address. “We first have to admit that we cannot work alone, and that research requires an interdisciplinary approach. Goa has done well so far, but we are being complacent. This to the time to raise the bar,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iit-goa-gmc-may-team-up-to-surveil-infectious-diseases/articleshow/81891554.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: CBI books lawyer, Sector 11 man in Rs 30 crore plot grab case||CHANDIGARH: The CBI has booked taxation lawyer Kapil Khanna and Sector 11 resident Amardeep Singh Brar in connection with filing a “forged” writ petition before the Punjab and Haryana high court in an alleged attempt to grab Rs 30-crore plot in the city’s upscale Sector 5. The forged petition (CWP no 9464 of 2020) was drafted by advocate Anadeshwar Gautam at the instance of Brar, who approached him with Khanna, according to the preliminary inquiry conducted by CBI. “During a discussion, they (Khanna and Brar) informed him (Gautam) that Padamjit Singh (50% owner of the property) has entered into a settlement with Peshaura Singh Thind regarding the sale of his interest and title in the suit property, for which he is purposed to have executed some GPA or SPA, though documents were not produced before him (Gautam). Brar had paid Rs 50,000 to Gautam as legal fee,” said the CBI probe. The CBI registered the FIR on March 24 under Sections 120-B, 204, 205, 420, 466, 467, 468 and 471 for criminal conspiracy, cheating, false personation for purpose of act or proceedings in suit or prosecution, preparation of forged document and destruction of documents to prevent its production as evidence and abuse of official position as public servant. Some Sections of Prevention of Corruption Act were also added in the FIR that named Khanna, son of Brij Mohan Khanna of Sector 9, Brar, son of Darshan Singh Brar of Sector 11, unknown public servant and unknown others. The FIR was registered by Ashwin Shenvi, senior IPS and head of Chandigarh branch of CBI in compliance of the directions issued by the high court in October last year. The CBI inquiry said the ‘vakalatnama’ and accompanying affidavit with the petition filed through Gautam did not bear the original signature of Padamjit Singh. Initial probe had also revealed that a false email purported to be of Padamjit Singh was created and used to send email to the estate office, UT. The CBI probe had revealed that in the estate office, original file pertaining to the property -- H No 17, Sector 5 A, Chandigarh, was got issued by Chappi Rajneesh Krishan, the then junior assistant, estate office, UT, on June 12, 2012. Since June 12, 2012, whereabouts of the file is not known. The estate office reconstructed the file in 2018 and processed the matter pertaining to transfer of 50% share in favour of Padamjit Singh and 50% share in favour of Mary Singh, wife of late Kanwal Sunder Singh (brother of Padamjit Singh) and her two children Meera and Nicholas. In this case, Padamjit Singh, 84, who is settled in the US, was shocked to know that a petition number 9464/ 2020 was filed before the HC on July 3, 2020, in his name by forging documents in relation to his share in the controversial property. Later, he had filed an application before the HC revealing the fraud and forgery in his name after which the HC had ordered CBI probe in the matter. The dispute pertains to ownership of house number 17 in Sector 5 having value of around Rs 30 crore. Padamjit’s father, Sunder Singh, was the owner of the house. After his death in 1986, the house became a property of Padamjit Singh and his brother Kanwar Sunder Singh, with 50% share each. Although the family of Padamjit’s brother had filed a suit related to full ownership of the house, Padamjit had won the case. Later, Padamjit had sold his share to Pritam Kaur, wife of Peshaura Singh Thind. Even a sale deed was also executed by him in favour of Pritam Kaur. However, Padamjit came to know from Pritam Kaur’s son Rupinder Singh Thind that a petition was filed before the court on his behalf in which he has been claiming that he is still an owner of 50% share of the house and never sold his share to anyone. The matter was sent to CBI on Padamjit’s original petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/lawyer-sec-11-man-booked-in-rs-30cr-plot-grab-case/articleshow/81891037.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Aurangabad||IGP (Spl) to Aurangabad range cops: Finalise all applications within 24 hrs||Aurangabad: Police personnel in the Aurangabad range have been directed to finalise every application (complaints) received by the police station within 24 hours to ensure speedy delivery of services followed by appropriate legal action. Though earlier there were deadlines set for deciding the applications, the 24-hour time frame is the shortest given to the police stations. Those failing to meet the set deadlines have been warned of show-cause notice and appropriate disciplinary action. The directives have been issued by Aurangabad range special inspector general of police Prasanna Mallikarjun, who has also announced rewards for the police personnel meeting the 24-hour deadline. This is for the first time that the police personnel are being rewarded for meeting the deadline in deciding complaints. All the 86 police stations in the Aurangabad range have changed the sitting arrangement of police personnel by bringing police station officer, intelligence constable, constable of the crime and criminal tracking network and systems (CCTNS) and Barnishi (crime record keeper) together. This has been done to ensure the closing of the applications within the stipulated time. Police authorities said the move is also set to bring a check on scope of corrupt practices at the stage of preliminary inquiries. During this time frame, police will check if the complaint is civil or attracts sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). In case of a civil complaint, a written reply is given to the complainant for reaching out to the civil court or appropriate authority, while in complainant attracting sections of the IPC, an offence is immediately registered and the case is handed over to the investigation officer for appropriate action. Aurangabad range comprises police units of Aurangabad Rural, Jalna, Beed and Osmanabad. The IGP decided this after he found that several applications have been pending for days, weeks and even months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/igp-spl-to-aurangabad-range-cops-finalise-all-applications-within-24-hrs/articleshow/81889775.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The solar panels have been installed on the roof-tops of the academic buildings. GIM alone will be now helping the state meet 14% of its target of solar power generation to be attained by 2022, set based on the Paris accord. “It is one of the largest solar power generation systems in Goa today. The institute should now soon be off the grid of the electricity department. Within the next three years, this dream can be a reality I think. The panels used by GIM are the best available in the market today,” power minister Nilesh Cabral said. The plant was set up taking advantage of the state government’s scheme that facilitates the storage of surplus solar energy generated by prosumers in the grid. The facility has been installed on Opex basis by JLTM Energy India Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of Technique Solaire of France. The contract requires GIM to purchase all the power generated by the power supplier and the net metering permits the consumer to store the excess power not utilised in the grid for use subsequently, except during peak hours. All the capital investment and also the operation and maintenance is ensured by the Opex operator, who guarantees a minimum generation, failing which he pays a penalty. “GIM has always been conscious about the impact of its decisions on the ecosystem around it and has continuously strived to reduce its carbon footprints. The solar project is one such initiative and is aligned to our efforts in adopting sustainable practices on campus. We are possibly the only educational institute in the country to have an energy management system where we track the live power per capita consumption across the campus. The consumption pattern is tracked and analysed on a regular basis via a specially designed software,” GIM director Ajit Parulekar said. The solar cells installed are of the monocrystalline variety that ensures a better solar energy conversion and utilise lesser roof area. The solar panels are of 500 Wp capacity and manufactured by Trina Solar of China. Parulekar said that the entire solar plant was set up in a record time of three months. PFX D’Lima, member of the board at GIM and former director, said that the central government decided to charge all private educational institutions the commercial tariff which is higher than even the industrial tariff. The solar plant is now set to reduce the costs for the institute. Former chief minister Pratapsingh Rane said that the solar plant at GIM will also inspire its students and to promote renewable sources of energy when they become future managers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gims-solar-plant-to-help-state-meet-14-of-its-target/articleshow/81891580.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Shorter summer break this yr to meet syllabus deadline for online classes||Kolkata: School vacations seem to have fallen casualty to the pandemic.  Several schools in the city have decided to cut down on summer holidays so that they can complete the syllabus within time. Also, some school heads claimed, that after long breaks, students often found it difficult to focus during online classes. South Point School had earlier planned their usual holidays, hoping to return to campus soon but the rising Covid cases has forced them to change the schedule. Spokesperson Krishna Damani said, “If we have to revert to online classes, the vacation schedule will change. Holidays will be in small parcels. There will be a seven-day break after every four weeks. The holidays will be distributed so that children are not bored. But if students are on a month-long break, they lose touch with their online lessons.” The vacation is scheduled from mid-May. At Julien Day group of schools, summer holidays are likely to be slashed. “We usually have a month-long vacation, but this time, it will be for three weeks. We need additional time to cover the syllabus, while there is an SC recommendation not to hold classes beyond a fixed number of days. So, we are squeezed for time. So, the vacation will start from May 15 and reopen in the first week of June,” said principal Bobby Baxter, principal at Julien Day School Ganganagar. Vivekananda Mission School students are likely to get a two-week vacation, when no lesson will be assigned. “There won’t be any homework. The fortnight break will be the only summer vacation for 2021. The learning progress is slow as students are not physically present in classes. Completing the syllabus may get hampered. We are occasionally suspending some classes to give the students break. This year, the concept of traditional vacations is bound to change,” said princiapl Sarmistha Banerjee. The head of a CISCE school in Moulali said a decision was yet to be taken. “We will reduce the number of days. To complete the syllabus within a deadline and at the same time, offer students some relief, we will have to curtail the vacation. It’s likely to begin from May 9 or 10,” the principal said. Students are unhappy with the “curtail” plan. “Even when there are gaps between online classes, we are inundated with homework. Vacation is the only time when we can relax. My family has planned a trip to Uttarakhand, but either the itinerary will have to be changed or we will have to push it to Puja holidays,” said Vikram Roy Chowdhury, a student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shorter-summer-break-this-yr-to-meet-syllabus-deadline-for-online-classes/articleshow/81890672.cms||Somdatta Basu
---||Ranchi||Time to bring all adults in Cov vax drive, say experts||RANCHI: With the second wave of coronavirus gripping the state despite the inoculation drive going on in full swing, healthcare experts are of the view that vaccinating just the vulnerable age group won’t help unless those within the 18-40 age range are also included. The experts feel that age group is more likely to contribute to the disease spread as many of them step out for work. Dr Vijay Mishra, the critical care expert and director of the Ranchi-based Shree Bhagwan Mahavir Medica Hospital, said, “Around 15% of the patients admitted here are below 35 years and although the percentage is not very high, we need to keep this in mind that there are many Covid patients within that age range who do not require hospitalisation and are in home isolation. When that is considered, then there’s a big chunk of mostly young people who are currently infected and can become super-spreaders.” He added, “Keeping these factors in mind, it is imperative to include the young and the middle-aged population in the vaccination programme.” The ongoing vaccination drive covers the age group of 45 and above. Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences’ (Rims) trauma centre head Dr Pradip Bhattacharya said the number of youngsters getting infected has increased during the second wave and resultantly, they have a considerable number of patients aged between 25 and 40 years. “This particular age group is pretty negligent when it comes to maintaining safety norms which is why they need to be vaccinated as soon as possible,” he added. He said the vaccines are completely safe and people shouldn’t have any second thoughts about taking it. As an example, Dr Bhattacharya cited a recent study conducted by the Journal of American Medical Association which reportedly showed that the vaccine is effective in safeguarding people against on all four mutant variants of the virus. A senior doctor of a reputed hospital here, who is treating Covid patients at the moment, said, “The virus transmission from the young to the old is very high these days. For example, nine members in my family, including two senior citizens, a middle-aged woman and a 14-year-old kid, have tested positive after my teenage daughter got infected and spread it among almost everyone in the house. This transmission chain needs to be broken and that can only happen if the youngsters are inoculated.” Public health expert and professor of community medicine at Rims Dr Devesh Kumar agreed that vaccination is required for everyone but pointed out that the decision to vaccinate the vulnerable population was done keeping their co-morbidities and the death rate in mind. “I understand that the young population needs to be vaccinated at the earliest and it will start soon. Having said that, we cannot expect the government to vaccinate everyone all at the same time for it might cause us more harm in our fight against the disease,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/time-to-bring-all-adults-in-cov-vax-drive-say-experts/articleshow/81890667.cms||Gaurav Pandey

He announced that the Centre will invest Rs 1 lakh crore for road construction projects in Jharkhand in the next three years. “The Bharatmala project, which will develop an economic corridor, will be completed by next year and we expect the state government to prepare a detailed project report for the road projects specified in Bharatmala and send it to the Centre on time,” Gadkari said. He urged chief minister Hemant Soren, who was present at the inaugural ceremony, to ensure speedy land acquisition for the project and expedite the process pertaining to forest clearance formalities. Speaking on the inaugurated road projects, Hemant dedicated them to the people of the state and said, “Jharkhand is a mineral-rich state and a bulk of those minerals is transported through roads and so a robust road network was essential for this purpose.” The CM detailed the money allocated by the Centre to Jharkhand for road construction projects over the years and explained how the state used that money for the seven projects. “The Centre allocated Rs 205 crore in 2017-18 FY, Rs 169 crore in 2018-19 FY, Rs 500 crore in 2019-20 FY and around Rs 675 crore in 2020-21 FY. Out of that total sum, we spent around Rs 1,116 crore just for constructing the 72-km-long Mahulia-Bahragora road along the Jharkhand-West Bengal border which will improve our connectivity with Bengal and Odisha,” he said. He urged the Centre to prioritize road projects according to the needs and aspirations of the state. “As part of the Bharatmala project, the proposed Raipur-Dhanbad, Sambalpur-Ranchi, Varanasi-Ranchi, Ranchi-Paradeep and Bakhtiyarpur-Oremanjhi road projects will improve Jharkhand’s connectivity with West Bengal, Odisha and UP,” he said. He also asked the Centre to speed up work on an overbridge on the Ganga river in Sahebganj. Hemant’s demand was seconded by Union minister for tribal affairs Arjun Munda, who also attended the online event. Munda said Jharkhand’s connectivity with Bihar through the overbridge will open new trade routes. He also underlined the importance of developing the multimodal port and waterways in Ganga for easy communication with the north-east. Meanwhile, Hemant pointed out that the state has identified several elephant corridors where the Centre should consider constructing underpasses while developing green field road projects. “Plantation on the either side of the roads should also be taken care of in order to protect the environment,” the CM said. Gadkari assured him that he will address the state’s concern about elephant corridors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/gadkari-opens-7-roads-to-public-in-jharkhand/articleshow/81890645.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

State health secretary K K Soan has directed the authorities to start mandatory testing of every passenger from all parts of the country, while the airport officials will bar the entry of people without masks and deploy extra manpower inside and outside the terminal to implement Covid protocols and penalize violators. Ranchi civil surgeon Dr V B Prasad said: “We have already intensified testing and, in the wake of directions from the state government, will start mandatory sample collection of all flyers from Monday. Earlier, samples of people with Covid-like symptoms and those who wanted to get themselves tested were being collected.” As the volume of samples to be collected at airport will be over 2,000 on a daily basis, the district health authorities have started their preparations for the same and three booths will be set up outside the airport building for this. Birsa Munda International Airport director Vinod Sharma said: “We had started contactless travel protocol at departure as well as security check area in August and the same is still in practice. We had also made markings outside and inside the terminal building to maintain physical distancing and that is being followed. Having said that, we have noticed that visitors are being lax in following Covid-appropriate behaviour and we have enforced the fresh set of norms.” Sharma said they have deployed extra manpower from CISF and AAI for constant surveillance of visitors violating the protocols. “They will ensure that no one removes their masks at any time and violators will be penalized.” When asked if out-bound flyers will also be tested, Sharma said: “We are conducting thermal scanning and most travellers heading out are carrying a negative RT-PCR tests as per the protocols in place at their respective destination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cov-test-for-all-in-bound-flyers-at-ranchi-airport/articleshow/81890652.cms||Gaurav Pandey

We have collected a sample of the infection for culture and the minister has been kept under observation. We have been administering antibiotics to him. The culture test report will give us a clearer picture on the gravity of the situation,” Rao said, adding that Mahto’s condition was stable and his transplanted lungs were functioning fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/7-cov-deaths-in-a-day-edu-min-back-in-hosp/articleshow/81890636.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Unnecessary admissions will invite action: DyCM||Vadodara: Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel said on Saturday that hospitals that admit Covid patients unnecessarily will face action. Patel who was visiting the city in the wake of the scary Covid-19 situation said that no lockdown was being considered in the state. Patel reached Vadodara in the forenoon and remained in meetings for about four hours. Elected representatives, officials and BJP functionaries had remained present in the meetings. Addressing media persons after the meeting Patel said that the cases had been increasing in the four bigger cities of the state much like in other parts of the countries. “The second wave has come around the same time in several parts of the country. From 700 to 800 cases a day, the state now sees 2,200 to 2,300 positive cases a day. Cases have also been rising in Vadodara city and district too,” said Patel. In wake of the rising cases in Vadodara, Patel announced that it was decided to set up two testing camps per assembly seat in the city. Rapid antigen tests will be done at these camps that will be set up at public places and will be readily accessible to people. The deputy CM who also holds the health portfolio said that four community halls of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) in the city will be converted into Covid care centers for the poor and middle class. “Persons having no symptoms or very mild symptoms will be kept there. Medical teams will monitor their condition and refer them to hospitals if the need arises,” said Patel. Patel said that it had come to light that some private hospitals were admitting patients unnecessarily. “Patients have mediclaims or their companies foot treatment bills. Hospitals keep such patients unnecessarily to inflate bills. Not all may be involved in the practice, but there are some who are doing so,” Patel said. A committee will be formed by the civic body to look into admissions at hospitals. They will check documents to ensure that people are not admitted in hospitals unnecessarily.“If it comes to light that patients were kept in hospitals without any reasons, we will take action,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/unnecessary-admissions-will-invite-action-dycm/articleshow/81890393.cms||---

Since the outbreak of the pandemic on March 31, 2020, the number of cases reached 18,000 in the district on January 29 this year and it took only 52 days more for the cases to cross the 18,500 figure. After a mere 11 days, the number crossed the 19,000-mark. According to the district health department figures, between January 30 and March 22, a total of 453 cases were detected and from March 23 to April 2, another 547 cases were reported. Given the surge in cases, additional district magistrate (law and order) Nand Kishore Lal, who is also the nodal officer for Covid-19 surveillance in the district, urged the public not to lower their guards and follow the safety protocols strictly. He said, “We are imposing fines and initiating penal action against those who broke the protocols to discipline and warn them.” Notably, the district administration has started a drive against the violators at public places. In the first three days of April, over 150 people have been penalised for inappropriate Covid-safety behaviour. Meanwhile, the district health department has conducted a total 6,24,619 tests so far with an average of 1,800 tests daily. Additional chief medical officer Sahir Pall said, “Testing of the samples is an important measure for identifying and isolating infected persons." Jamshedpur Chapter secretary of the Indian Medical Association, Mrityunjay Singh, said people should follow the protocols of wearing masks, washing hands and maintaining social distance to avert the infection. “But at the same time, taking the vaccine is equally important to keep the virus at bay,” Singh said. The first case of the Covid-19 was reported in the district on May 12 last year and the first death from the pandemic was reported on July 4, 2020. Out of the 19,359 infected persons so far, 18,538 have recovered and 357 have died while 464 are active and undergoing treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/covid-count-nears-20k-in-steel-city-464-cases-active/articleshow/81890663.cms||B Sridhar
---||Goa||State implements novel programme to help people with mental illness||PANAJI: In a novel initiative involving health counsellors, medical officers, psychiatrists and psychologists, the state’s health services is implementing ‘MANAS’, a project that is aimed at helping people suffering from any kind of mental illness. MANAS has been developed by the voluntary organisation, Sangath, and is targetted at people, specially those from rural areas, who do not get the right medical help at the right time or end up visiting a general physician instead. It is presently being implemented at the Valpoi community health centre. Dr Rupesh Patkar, a psychiatrist with the North Goa district hospital, said that of the total mental illnesses, around 55% are common disorders, including anxiety and depression. “But most of the time, these patients approach a physician or a medical officer instead of a psychiatrist when they have symptoms such as backache, headache, generalised weakness, fatigue, disturbed sleep and lack of appetite,” Patkar said. There is a possibility that such patients do not get counselling and the required medication that will address their mental illness, he said. Recounting the case of a 28-year-old Valpoi woman who was working in the unorganised sector, Patkar said, “She suffered from breathlessness, weakness, decreased appetite and occasional stomach pain. She was unwell for two years despite consulting different physicians and only receiving temporary relief. Finally, she was referred to us,” he said. While examining her case, it was found that she came from a poor socio-economic class and remained worried due to financial crises. “She was worried about her future and was consistently in low spirits. Due to her illness, she avoided attending family or social functions. We counselled her and put her on anti-depressants for a month. Within that time, there was an improvement in her condition,” he said. Her medication was reduced within six months when she showed more improvement. Meanwhile, she was taught problem-solving skills to help her deal with stress, Patkar said while using the case to highlight how people who are unable to access psychiatric help suffer, due to which their condition aggravates over time. Health workers and medical officers are trained as part of MANAS, too. The role of a health worker is crucial as he, being part of the community, can take psychiatry to the doorstep of the people by screening patients with the help of a standard questionnaire. The role of a medical officer involves confirming the diagnosis of the patient who comes up positive on a screening test, prescribing the necessary medication or referring the case to a health counsellor. A psychiatrist will supervise the case, give tips and take over if the case is not manageable at the medical officer level, Patkar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-implements-novel-programme-to-help-people-with-mental-illness/articleshow/81891600.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida: Girl taken to quack when she was sinking, key accused held||MEERUT/NOIDA: The 15-year-old girl who was brought dead to a Noida hospital earlier this week had spent nine days in the NCR city – in a room at Barola in Sector 49 – since she went missing from her village in Hapur on March 22, police said on Saturday. The man accused of kidnapping her, a 22-year-old related to the girl’s family through her brother’s in-laws, was arrested on Saturday and police said he had admitted to holding her captive. He worked in Noida and lived in a rented accommodation. But the police investigation is yet to lift the fog around what caused the girl’s health to fail so drastically. Whether it was repeated sexual assault, which her family has alleged, or breathing problems, which the accused has claimed. What is clear, though, is that she did not get proper medical treatment. Police said on March 29, the girl was taken by the accused to a Priya hospital in Noida, where they spent just a few hours. From there, they went to a quack, who apparently put her on a glucose drip. On March 31, when the accused and the quack took her on a bike to Surbhi hospital, doctors there found she had passed away. The accused was picked up near Vait village, police said. “He said she had gotten sick in captivity. On March 29, when her condition deteriorated, he took her to a hospital in Noida. Not much improved. On March 31, he said he took her to see a doctor again, at another hospital in Noida. This was the hospital where the body was eventually found,” Hapur SP Neeraj Jadaun said. “The quack, Asif Dutt, has been detained and action will be taken against him too as he is not authorised to treat the patients. Asif was the second person who was seated on the bike on which the accused took the girl to hospital,” Jadaun added. The girl’s family told TOI the accused had made several visits to their house while they were looking for her. They said police should find out who was with her when the accused was away and whether she was sexually assaulted by others as well. The girl’s sister said there were injuries on her head, neck and feet and her face and lips were swollen. The girl’s brother told TOI that she wasn’t suffering from any ailment. “She had no history of any medical condition. We suspect she was gang-raped and murdered,” he said. Jadaun said the accused had denied the involvement of anyone else but could not explain how the girl fell sick. Police are yet to receive the girl’s medical reports from Priya hospital. An FIR invoking charges of murder, kidnapping and gang-rape has been filed against the accused, five of his family members and the quack.

---||Goa||Fading Sounds Of Musical Diversity||Goa’s secular percussion instrument, the ghumot, has received a huge boost after the government declared it the state heritage instrument. While religious and cultural traditions of both communities, Hindu and Catholic, have ensured its survival amidst threats of a fade out, several other folk instruments have either become extinct or face the threat of disappearing from the cultural landscape due to various reasons. Indigenous heritage instruments that were an integral part of the cultural kaleidoscope are being seen less as social change keeps chipping negatively at community traditions. State patronage to the ghumot — an earthen pot mounted with animal skin — promises to halt the decline due to the erosion of social commitment towards protecting ancestral legacy. In this background, a few unique and once popular musical instruments used by Goa’s folk communities face the prospect of becoming part of history. Researchers say the ‘mhadallem’, ‘korno’, ‘banko’, ‘surpavo’ and ‘nakxer’ are among once prestigious and indigenous instruments that are in various stages of disappearance from the state’s religious and cultural scene. “All these instruments require effort and appropriate skill to be played. Nowadays, their use in cultural and religious functions is not a must. If there was some kind of compulsion, everybody would have practiced and their use would not have become optional,” says Pandurang Phaldesai, enthnomusicologist and former member secretary, Kala Academy, Panaji. ‘Maddhalem’, a percussion instrument, is one of the few being used increasingly infrequently in local traditions. An earthen pot like the ‘ghumot’, but cylindrical like the ‘pakhawaz’, both its open ends are covered with animal skin, earlier monitor lizard, now goat skin. The instrument was used by the Christian Gawda community during ‘zagor’ and other singing and dancing events. A package (bond) of cooked and burnt rice is fixed to the centre of the instrument’s playing side to raise the requisite pitch and enhance sound quality. Sadly, traditions are fading among Christian Gawdas, though a slight resurgence in recent years spells some hope. ‘Surpavo’ is a wind-blown instrument exclusively used by the dhangars. The community still uses it at gatherings and during festivals, but as change keeps knocking at traditions, uncertainty stares it in the face. ‘Nakxer’, the type of instrument used by snake charmers, is also used only by the dhangar community. Similarly, and luckily, it is still being used by the shepherds during their annual Dussehra, Shigmo and Gajandra performances. As the name suggests, ‘korno’ is about a metre-long, funnel-shaped wooden or metallic trumpet. It is also called an aerophone, being a wind-blown instrument, and was used during religious processions, ‘palki’, ‘romot’, ‘mell’ and ‘roth’. The blaring of the ‘korno’ conveyed messages of joy and sadness or alerted people in the neighbourhood like a bell. Another wind-blown instrument, the ‘banko’ is used as an accompaniment to the ‘ghumot’ and ‘xamell’. The slightly curved instrument produces a lower decibel sound than the ‘korno’. The passing away of a generation of musicians, who had contributed greatly towards sustaining musical traditions and lack of interest among millennials to take up the baton are among major factors for the present malaise. Most of the instruments that face oblivion are wind-driven ones as their sophisticated electronic counterparts have changed the entire dynamics of sounds. “It requires force to blow into these traditional instruments and the younger generation does not seem to have the deep chests to pump wind into them,” Phaldesai says. Similar is the fate of some Western instruments — clarinet, trombone and saxophone. These were used by the local Catholic community, but the keyboard has rendered them superfluous. “The local maestri at the church level would teach solfeggio to the boys and girls. Solfeggio helped them to play the violin and, in turn, they could pick up any other instrument as well. But now playing organ or such instruments is easier and we don’t see maestris teaching the rudiments to youngsters,” says Andrew Pereira, who is the Goa police band section in-charge. Lovers of musical heritage say finding an activity to promote the use of these instruments can serve their conservation cause. During Phaldesai’s tenure, Kala Academy mooted a scheme to start ghumot aarti competitions, which was taken up at the Rajiv Gandhi Kala Mandir, Ponda, triggering a musical revolution. The number of aarti mandal groups has risen to 150, and young artistes to more than 1,200. Most of them can play the ghumot expertly. “In this way, a model linked with an activity to promote use of the instrument can work wonders for its revival,” Phaldesai says. Agreeing with him, Marius Fernandes, a cultural events organiser, says the instruments have to be brought into the mainstream by organising theme-based events. “We cannot wait for the government to do it, but people have to bring communities for events or festivals,” he says. A ghumot with a goat’s skin was introduced at a world ghumot festival at Siridao by Fernandes on February 26, 2017. “Voluntary organisations can provide a new direction to traditional folk forms and contribute to music traditions, if they hold such events,” a heritage lover says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fading-sounds-of-musical-diversity/articleshow/81891679.cms||Paul Fernandes

Sources said that the car was on its way towards Karjan from Padra when the driver, Zuber Vanzara, a resident of Tandalja, lost control over the vehicle near Saraswani village around 6 pm. The SUV, being driven at a high speed, rammed into a tree due to which the front part of the car was completely mangled and the passengers were trapped inside. Locals called fire brigade from Vadodara city and also crane from nearby industrial units. The roof of the SUV had to be torn open to bring the passengers out. A woman, whose identity was not ascertained till night, was found dead while Vanzara was rushed to a health centre in Padra. He was, however, declared dead later. An unidentified boy who had suffered minor injuries was taken to SSG Hospital. Eye-witnesses said that the boy was conscious, but in a state of shock, when he was brought out of the SUV. “We contacted the driver’s family members to inform about the incident. It turned out that the woman, who was killed in the accident, was not his wife. The boy is not in a condition to talk so we are still trying to find out about the woman identity,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/driver-co-passenger-killed-as-suv-rams-into-tree/articleshow/81890403.cms||---

BJP leader Pathuri Nagabushanam, TDP leader Varla Ramiah and others moved the house motion petition. Senior counsel Veera Reddy and Vedala Venkata Ramana, appearing for the petitioners, said the election notification issued by the SEC on April 1 was unconstitutional as it is against the orders given by the Supreme Court, according to which election notification needs to be issued at least four weeks before the polling date. “The election process was suspended for six weeks on March 15, 2020 due to Covid-19. The order was challenged by the state government in the Supreme Court, which upheld the SEC’s decision and directed it to restart the election process by issuing notification four weeks before the polling date. Many candidates who filed nominations in 2020 are not in a position to contest now. The SEC should invoke Rule 7 of AP Panchayat Raj Act and issue a fresh notification,” the counsels for the petitioners argued. They further stated that lakhs of youths enrolled as voters after March 2019, but they will miss their right to vote as the elections will be conducted with old electoral rolls. The single-judge bench of Justice U Durga Prasada Rao posted the matter for further hearing to Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/secs-poll-notification-unconstitutional-oppn-counsel-tells-high-court/articleshow/81890404.cms||Venu Lanka

It may be recalled that in May 2018, the previous trust board of the temple body during the TDP regime had forcibly retired then Tirumala temple chief priest AV Ramana Deekshitulu and other hereditary priests by fixing a retirement age for them. Subsequently, hereditary priests associated with other TTD temples were also forcibly retired on age grounds. The priests then moved the AP high court which directed the TTD to reinstate them with immediate effect, but the temple body kept the court order in abeyance. After YS Jagan Mohan Reddy became chief minister in May 2019, he kept his promise of quashing the controversial resolution and passed a GO (No. 76) in October 2019, which restored the hereditary rights of the priests. The order, however, could not be implemented in totality. While Deekshitulu was reinstated on honorary basis, other hereditary priests were kept in waiting. On Saturday, the TTD management finally issued orders to reinstate all hereditary priests who were forcibly retired in 2018, with Deekshitulu becoming the chief priest of Tirumala temple again after nearly three years. Deekshilutu thanked the chief minister on behalf of all hereditary priests. “Hereditary priests who dedicated their entire lives in the service of the Lord were forcibly retired by the previous regime. We thank chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy for keeping his promise. We hope this move will benefit many hereditary priests associated with other temples who too were forcibly shunted out on age grounds,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ttd-reinstates-all-hereditary-priests-who-were-forcibly-retired-in-2018/articleshow/81890394.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Visakhapatnam||Proposals for new fire stations in Vizag gather dust||VISAKHAPATNAM: Plans and proposals to set up three more fire stations in Vizag still lie in waiting. The effective industrial centre of Andhra Pradesh, which is also tipped to be the executive capital of the state, needs to urgently upgrade its fire safety infrastructure, say fire safety personnel. Personnel in the fire safety services feel that the city urgently needs more fire stations in keeping with the way Vizag has been growing over the years. Further, the fire services department does not have adequate machinery or manpower, they say. A city with over 22 lakh population spread across seven assembly constituencies has only three major fire stations. Sources inform that the fire services department is planning to set up one more fire station at Simhachalam with the support of Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Devasthanam. BVS Ram Prakash, Visakhapatnam district fire officer, said that the department has sent proposals to set up three new fire stations. One at Simhachalam, another at Madhurawada and a third at Araku Valley in the Agency. “We have been witnessing forest fires and other fire incidents at Simhachalam hill-top. Madhurawada has emerged as a major residential area and Araku Valley too has many establishments. We have sent proposals but they are yet to turn into reality. We will send fresh proposals again,” said the fire officer. Fire safety personnel inform that they only have one hydraulic sky-lift. Even that can reach only up to a height 54 metres. The city needs at least two more 90 metre-capacity hydraulic sky-lifts to tackle fire mishaps. Further, there are over 50 vacancies for firemen in the city. Although the fire safety department has set up a temporary station at Autonagar, it’s yet to get official status and needs an upgrade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/proposals-for-new-fire-stns-in-vizag-gather-dust/articleshow/81890416.cms||Nalla.Babu

Elected governing councils of panchayats, including sarpanches, upa-sarpanches and ward members conducted their first meetings with focus on development of villages. Sarpanches reached offices in big processions to take charge by signing official documents of key projects. Many first-time sarpanches thanked people for giving them the chance. “I feel honoured to have been elected as a representative of 23,000 residents of Ramavarappadu panchayat. Though our place is situated right beside Vijayawada, we have been facing problems with waste management, poor roads and improper drinking water. We will work hard to resolve these issues,” said V Sridevi, elected sarpanch of Ramavarrappadu panchayat. A total of 1,31,023 ward members also took charge on Saturday. Though the panchayat election process ended on February 22, elected members were asked to wait until the end of the financial year before assuming charge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/sarpanches-take-charge-of-panchayats-across-ap/articleshow/81890423.cms||Venu Lanka

Andhra University closed its hostels and classrooms recently after 100 students of the AU College of Engineering tested positive for Covid-19. Consequently, the varsity switched to online classes. Protesting students said that they are finding it very difficult to find accommodation outside the campus amid the pandemic and requested the authorities to reopen hostels. “We don’t have any novel coronavirus cases on the south campus. But the hostels are still closed for inmates. This puts a heavy burden on students,” said one of the protestors. Meanwhile, AU vice-chancellor Prof PVGD Prasad Reddy met students of a private school who have won several prizes in the NASA Space Settlement Contest and congratulated them. Holistic development of students in key to make India a superpower, the vice-chancellor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/au-students-want-hostels-to-reopen/articleshow/81890440.cms||---

But born and brought up in the Port City, the mother of two children is keenly aware of the city’s issues, demographics, and the people’s expectations of her. In a freewheeling conversation with TOI on Saturday, Hari Venkata Kumari laid down her vision to make Vizag a future-ready city just as the city braces to become the executive capital of Andhra Pradesh. “The 98 corporators of the city hail from diverse backgrounds and professions. Some are advocates, some engineers, social workers and doctors. I will take their support and suggestions to steer the city towards development and modernisation while not missing out on providing basic amenities to the public,” said the newly-elected Vizag mayor. Asked how it feels to become an overnight icon in the city’s political horizon, Venkata Kumari, the corporator from ward number 11, says she never imagined to be at the city’s top job someday. “I will forever be indebted to chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and Rajya Sabha member V Vijayasai Reddy for reposing confidence in me. I became acquainted with public issues of the city during my campaign and am gradually getting accustomed to the day-to-day affairs of the GVMC (Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation),” she said. “At a workshop held recently for newly-elected mayors and deputy mayors, the chief minister asked me to provide corruption-free governance to the public and extend welfare schemes to all eligible,” said the former math teacher. Discussing her priorities for Vizag, Hari Kumari said that the GVMC is preparing a detailed project report to construct four flyovers in various parts of the city to ease traffic congestion along the national highway. Of these, the first would come up at Hanumanthawaka Junction. The Vizag mayor further said that the Mudasarlova Park would be given a complete facelift to provide a delightful experience to visitors. “A DPR is also being prepared to bring water from Godavari through a separate pipeline, which may address the water needs of the city over the next few decades. Several measures would be taken to address the increasing pollution levels in the city with the funds devised under the national clean air programme,” said Hari Kumari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/math-teacher-mom-and-now-mayor-hari-kumari-wants-to-make-vizag-future-ready/articleshow/81890454.cms||---

The suspended staffers were identified as dispatch officer Viswanath and emergency medical technician G Bhargavi. On Saturday, state health minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas (Alla Nani) received information about a road accident in Vangayagudem road in Eluru. Swinging into action, the minister called 108 ambulance to take the injured, identified as Subbaiah, to the hospital. It was at this time, the minister said that the ambulance service took too long to respond. The injured Subbaiah died while being transferred from a hospital in Eluru to another in Vijayawada on Sunday morning. Following the death, the minister called on Aarogyasri CEO Mallikarjuna Annam to probe into the reason for delay in the ambulance responding on Saturday. The Aarogyasri CEO’s probe revealed negligence on part of dispatch officer Viswanath and emergency medical technician Bhargavi, causing them to be suspended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/two-ambulance-staff-suspended/articleshow/81890465.cms||Samson Raj

He is also associated with various clinical trials as an investigator. His cardiology hospital in West Nagpur is also treating Covid-19 patients. Dr Harkut has been instrumental in promoting vaccination in heart patients and also clearing common doubts. Talking with TOI, he says vaccination is the only long-term remedy for Covid and if we follow it meticulously then the third wave, if at all it comes, won’t be too severe. He feels the pandemic will turn into an endemic, and that the next 100 days will be crucial. Excerpts from an interview... Q. Who should or should not get vaccinated? A. Those who have more risk of the infection should get vaccinated on priority. This is the policy we are following as a nation. We have vaccinated doctors, health workers and front line workers, irrespective of their age groups, then the 60 plus citizens and then the ones above 45 with co-morbid conditions. Now, the 45 plus category is eligible for vaccination. Every eligible person must get vaccinated. Only those who recently got infected with Covid should wait for four to six weeks for the jab. They should get vaccinated whenever possible. Q. There is confusion among heart patients who are on blood thinners. Should they take the vaccine? A. They should take it on priority. We are in the same storm, but not in the same boat. Those with a heart problem are more at risk. More risk means more benefit of vaccination. So, those who have co-morbid conditions like a cardiovascular issue should get themselves vaccinated. Same is the case with patients having kidney, cancer or any other ailment. The vaccine is safe even even if you are on blood thinners or have undergone a bypass surgery. Those who are still confused must have a word with their doctor and get vaccinated. Q. How come so many are getting infected even after vaccination? A. There’s no guarantee that you won’t get infected even after taking the second dose of the vaccine. If you do get infected, the disease won’t be that severe. You may not require oxygen support or ICU or a ventilator. In short, this is long-term remedy. Vaccination won’t end the pandemic at once, but it will certainly bring it down to the endemic stage. Q. Many have complained that they got Covid only after vaccination. A. The vaccine is not the reason behind the infection. Some may have got infected at the vaccination centre or some may have had the infection in the latent phase before getting vaccinated. The vaccine cannot give you Covid-19. It only protects you. It’s a long-term process. One cannot expect complete protection in the days or weeks after the first jab. Another prominent reason behind the increased infection could be the false sense of protection too. After getting vaccinated, people are becoming casual about Covid-related guidelines. Q. For how long will we have to follow guidelines like wearing masks, distancing and hand hygiene? A. Until we vaccinate a large part of our population. Covid-appropriate behavior should be a part of our daily life for the next one year or even more. We can’t ignore it at all. Those below 45 years of age will also get the vaccine in the next phase. The age group between 18 and 30 may become more careless after vaccination. We must avoid this. Q. Can we avoid a surge in cases if a majority of us get vaccinated? A. Covid-19 is here to stay. Smaller surges will keep hitting pockets even in the future, but vaccination will ensure that the surge is not as serious as the present one. This will happen only if we take vaccination seriously and not fall prey to any miscommunication or confusion. India has a massive population and it will take years to complete the vaccination process. Q. Many don’t have faith in the vaccine for various reasons. A. I come across many educated people who don’t believe in the vaccine because it was developed in 18 months. I tell them about the latest advancements in biotechnology and genetic sciences. We have made significant progress in genetics which has helped our scientists to bring out the vaccine in such a short span of time. The approved vaccines across the world have gone through all the trial phases and they are safe and effective. Q. Have you come across any comparative queries regarding the vaccines? A. We have two approved vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin. Both are equally safe and effective. As Covishield completed its third phase of human trials, it got the final approval early. Covaxin received approval earlier but with conditions. During this period, Covishield production had already risen and hence it reached more centers. Covaxin was available at limited centers. It’s a common psychology that the rarely available commodity is considered valuable. But there’s nothing superior or inferior about it. In the future, India will approve more vaccines. That doesn’t mean the recently-approved one will be better. Q. Can we take one jab of Covishield and one of Covaxin? A. Technically it’s not banned, but it’s not advisable clinically. If you have taken the first jab of Covishield then you must go for second jab of the same vaccine. In the case of Covaxin, the difference between the two jabs should be 28 days. In Covishield, the difference is ideally six to eight weeks. Avoid any such misadventure and go for the second jab of the same vaccine for better results. Q. What is the status of non-Covid ailments? A. Non-Covid ailments like heart attacks had gone down significantly during the first lockdown. It wasn’t due to issues like low pollution, low stress levels etc. It was because people were finding it difficult to reach hospitals. Now, after a year, we have to fight Covid-19 as well as other ailments together. We can’t neglect other ailments. Another factor is that asthma and heart patients have symptoms similar to Covid. They get diagnosed as Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaccination-only-long-term-remedy-to-deal-with-covid/articleshow/81890478.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

They will not call you bohiragato. You will get to meet alot oftilakwallahs andchotiwallahs there. They will chant ‘Har Har Mahadev’. But they, along with others in Varanasi, will give you love. They may make you stay there,” the PM said at the Sonarpur rally in what was evidently a response to the declaration by Trinamool leaders that Mamata would, after defeating BJP in Bengal, take on Modi in his LS constituency of Varanasi. PM cites Netaji to blunt ‘outsider’ jibeBJP members, including Modi, have claimed Mamata “is looking for a second seat as she is scared of losing from Nandigram”. TMC members, including MP Mahua Moitra, have responded to that by saying — sarcastically — that Banerjee might contest from Varanasi in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls to take on Modi directly. Modi seized upon TMC’s taunt to make an attempt to cast it as parochial while seeking to depict BJP as an outfit that does not differentiate among people on the basis of states they belong to. PM countered TMC’s “anti-outsider” plank also by reiterating that the the leader of a BJP government in Bengal would be a “son of soil”. BJP tacticians seem to reckon that TMC’s nativist pitch would not play well with “outsiders” who constitute a chunk in many constituencies. However, PM said public disparagement of outsiders militated against Bengal’s inclusivist grain. He cited Odisha-born Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s example to debunk TMC’s “outsider” campaign. Modi’s speeches were marked by trademark aggression. He said that Bengal had made up its mind to vote TMC out of office, and dubbed it a “Taka Mar Company (TMC)” at the Haripal rally and accused it of taking “cut money” even for admission of patients to government hospitals. “Apni nijer goondader samlan (Rein in your goons),” he said, adding that the BJP government would use Digital India to transfer welfare benefits to people without any need for “cut money”. The PM sounded confident of BJP being able to form Bengal’s next government. “I will attend the swearing-in and ask the CM to expedite the process of transferring Rs18,000 to each farmer’s account under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi,” he said. Modi took a jibe at the Bengal CM’s complaints against security forces, EVMs and the EC. “Didi, why are you angry? Is it because you did not get to do chhappa votes (rig the poll)? You were all praise for the EC, EVMs and security forces when you came to office 10 years ago.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/varanasi-wont-call-you-outsider-pm-modi/articleshow/81893131.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Surat||Gujarat: Apparel thief turns out to be a cross-dresser||RAJKOT: The mystery of disappearing female apparels, hung out to dry in Kirit Shah’s backyard, in Lal Tekri area of Bhuj kept the local trader flummoxed for more than six months now. However, it was not until that he installed virtual eyes to monitor the backyard that the thief was exposed. The CCTV find was rather a revelation of sorts when Shah found the thief to be none other than his neighbour. But, the suspense doesn’t end here. When the aggrieved Shahs marched down to accost the offending neighbour, much to their horror, he was found dressed in one of the stolen attires! In his complaint lodged with Bhuj B division police station on Friday night, Shah alleged that his neighbour, a teacher, stole clothes mostly female attires hanging in the backyard of his house for the past six months. The complainant alleged that the accused had allegedly stolen approximately 90 clothes worth Rs 30,000 — all during the night. According to the police, after clothes went missing again from the rope on January 22 night, Shah checked his CCTV and discovered the harrowing fact. Thereafter they searched for the invoices of the stolen clothes and lodged a police complaint. The accused’s mother had died recently and separated from his wife, he lives alone. Many other neighbours also complained of missing clothes and other valuables, cops added. “Our neighbour is a teacher which makes us even more surprised by his act. When we went to his house suddenly after discovering his theft, we were even more shocked to see him dress up as a woman in the stolen clothes. We tried to make him understand that he should stop this illegal activity but it did not work out,” Shah told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/apparel-thief-turns-out-to-be-teacher-who-likes-cross-dressing/articleshow/81890545.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Ex-CM takes jibe at MVA govt over fin package, netas too return fire||NAGPUR: Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday took a dig at state cabinet minister Jitendra Awhad saying the latter suffers from “memory loss” and is unable to recall the Central government’s financial package of Rs 20 lakh crore. This latest jibe by Fadnavis is a result of the two leaders sparring on Twitter over lockdown in European countries and how citizens there benefitted from welfare packages. On Friday, Awhad had tweeted to Fadnavis that it’s the central government of those countries which provided financial assistance. While interacting with reporters at the Nagpur airport, Fadnavis said, “It seems to me that Jitendra Awhad is suffering from memory loss because he cannot recall the Central government’s Rs 20 lakh crore. In fact Maharashtra is the only state which has not announced any relief for its citizens. To trouble citizens, to disconnect their power line seems to be Maharashtra’s agenda.” When TOI contacted Awhad, the state housing minister said, “Maybe Fadnavis is right, my memory has indeed become weak. So can he help in recollecting exactly how much of Maharashtra’s GST share has been transferred by the Central government till date. And out of that Rs 20 lakh crore package, how many zeroes have landed in Maharashtra’s lap.” Countering Fadnavis’ allegations about disconnection of power, state energy minister Nitin Raut said that it all started with the Central government’s refusal to help. “I wrote to the Central government for an interest-free loan of Rs 10,000 crore so that we can provide relief to consumers in Maharashtra. But they offered us an almost commercial rate of 10.75%. During Fadnavis’ regime they did not ensure collection of bills due to which the financial trouble has mounted for us,” said Raut, who’s also the district’s guardian minister. Shiv Sena MP and party spokesperson Sanjay Raut too questioned Fadnavis’ statements. “If a financial package is to be given, it can’t be done without Central government’s help. Fadnavis is a former chief minister and current leader of opposition. He must approach the Prime Minister to seek relief on behalf of Maharashtra. Nobody is stopping him from at least taking a delegation to the Centre,” said Raut. The senior Sena leader expressed displeasure over Fadnavis’ comments on the state. “It’s not right to malign the image of Maharashtra, and that too by the former CM. I don’t appreciate him putting Maharashtra in the dock all the time and constantly criticizing the state to which he belongs,” said Raut. Awhad said that Fadnavis’s “anti-Maharashtra tirade” is unwelcome. “I don’t know what’s his problem with Maharashtra. He’s been criticizing the state government at every available forum and has forgotten our political tradition in which all parties come together in times of a crisis. So instead of standing with the government as we tackle this (Covid-19) problem, Fadnavis is demoralizing the bureaucracy which has been working to find tangible solutions,” said Awhad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ex-cm-takes-jibe-at-mva-govt-over-fin-package-netas-too-return-fire/articleshow/81890529.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Shortage of doctors, trained HCWs can be resolved within a day, say experts||NAGPUR: Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his Facebook live session on Friday, had said that the state can build up infrastructure and health facilities, but it’s not possible to bring out doctors, trained health manpower to operate this system. NGOs working in the field of health, doctors and academics told TOI this future crisis can be dealt with strict implementation of existing service rules. State AYUSH committee members said the crisis is not the issue at all and could be resolved within a day if AYUSH doctors get proper involvement in Covid services. “This month, we will be getting 2,900 MBBS doctors coming out of medical colleges after completing their internships. As per established rules, these doctors should do one-year bond service with the state government’s public health department. If government makes it mandatory for them to complete bond service in state Covid hospitals, we will get 2,900 doctors in a day,” said Amrut Bang, executive committee member of SEARCH organization founded by Dr Abhay and Rani Bang. Amrut has been a leading RTI activist and has managed to bring a change in the state government’s policy to ensure availability of doctors in tribal and rural areas. “As per rules, doctors who skip the bond service have to pay Rs 10 lakh to the state government. Recovery of this amount from hundreds of doctors is pending since the last 3-4 years. If the government recovers this amount strictly, it could raise Rs500 crore,” said Amrut, adding that the said amount could be used in providing facilities to doctors ready to work in times of crisis. Senior officials of the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) seconded Bang’s claim that 2,900 doctors can be made available if bond service is implemented strictly. Dr Manish Patil, member of AYUSH task force of Maharashtra, alleged that AYUSH doctors are neglected in this fight against Covid-19. “In fact, they are providing service to society. AYUSH doctors are running small clinics and doing the job of counseling the people in these testing times. The state government can involve AYUSH doctors in Covid service and the problem of manpower will be resolved for sure,” said Dr Patil. While Ayurveda doctors (BAMS and MD) are performing Covid duties, homoeopathy (BHMS) are not yet involved in the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/shortage-of-doctors-trained-hcws-can-be-resolved-within-a-day-say-experts/articleshow/81890539.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Even as the family was yet to come to terms with the loss, the members learnt that the deceased, a father-son duo, tested Covid positive on Saturday at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) where they had been declared ‘brought dead’ on Friday. At the time when the son, 31, was declared dead at the GMCH, his 67-year-old father too started feeling uneasy and later collapsed at their home. He had no Covid symptoms till date. He was rushed to the GMCH where he was referred to by a private clinic in Manewada but the doctors declared him dead before admission. The family performed the last rites on Saturday afternoon after the NMC workers brought the bodies from GMCH. The family is planning to undergo Covid tests soon. Though the family, now comprising three members, did not want to be identified, they agreed to narrate their plight for the sake of other citizens who they feel should not take Covid lightly and must take utmost precaution to avoid the infection. A source in the family said the son, who was looking for a job, had developed some cough and felt uneasiness in the chest on Thursday late evening, but had no temperature. The family had taken him to a doctor in Manewada who prescribed some tablets and sent him home, said the source. “On Friday morning, I gave some medicines to my elder brother. He collapsed on my lap. We rushed him to the private hospital from where the doctor referred him to GMCH. He was declared dead at GMCH even before admission,” said the family source. It’s learnt the senior citizen, who was a priest, had collapsed on hearing about the critical condition of his elder son. The family feels that he might have suffered a cardiac arrest. “We have no clue how my elder brother and father got infected as they had barely stepped out of home in the last few days,” said the younger brother. In the meanwhile, GMCH treated the deaths as ‘medico-legal case’ as the victims were brought dead and later tested Covid positive. Accidental death was registered in both cases at Hudkeshwar police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-dad-die-in-couple-of-hrs-later-test-ve/articleshow/81890548.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||‘Six-minute walk test’ for home isolated to be stepped up||NAGPUR: District collector Ravindra Thakare has decided to stress on the ‘six-minute walk test’ for the home isolated patients by replacing the existing mode of observing the oxygen level through the pulse oximeter in maximum cases. The decision to initiate the special oxygen level test on a war-footing was taken for early referrals and also to curtail the death rate. The health teams are being urged to vigorously start the ‘six-minute walk test’ with the home isolated patients by issuing guidelines. The step was undertaken after it had been observed that the oxygen level and condition of several home isolated patients had deteriorated beyond revival in several cases even after their pulse oximeter tests had reflected a safe level earlier in the day. Thakare said the test can be effective in indicating the spreading of infection in the affected lungs which the ordinary pulse oximeter would not be able to detect. “A pulse oximeter may show the oxygen level to be hovering around 98% even if the lungs are infected. But the six-minute test would detect a sharp drop in the oxygen level by four counts or below the 94-mark, indicating immediate requirement of referral to hospitals,” he said. “We are aiming at zero death rate now,” said Thakare, adding, “The oximeter test would require barely one minute but the six-minute walking test would need at least eight minutes. Hence, we also need to re-organize our teams.” District health officer, Dr Deepak Selokar, said around 1,731 trained female health activists or ASHA and anganwadi sevikas have been instructed to re-direct their focus on home isolated patients, especially the ‘six-minute walking test’ for early referrals. “The six-minute walk test is simple and can be easily done. ASHA and anganwadi workers have been already sensitized regarding this issue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/six-minute-walk-test-for-home-isolated-to-be-stepped-up/articleshow/81890567.cms||Soumitra Bose

Nine persons were rounded up by police after registering an offence. Hospital’s director Dr BK Murli and his staffer Shashank Upgade sustained injuries in the incident which occurred at around 3pm. Senior PI Kishore Nagrale said a woman Covid patient died at the hospital at around 10.30am on Saturday. “Doctors from the hospital informed the NMC about the death. Soon, the NMC team came and shifted the body for cremation,” Nagrale said. The woman’s kin, including her husband, visited the hospital and expressed anguish against the hospital administration. They also claimed that the hospital did not inform them about the death. Instead, they were demanding charges, family members claimed in a video which went viral in social media. Later, they also ransacked the hospital’s reception and set it afire by pouring petrol, said the senior PI. The members of Vidarbha Hospitals Association, who are forced to run Covid centres under unconstitutional capped regulated charges, are disturbed by such acts of violence wherein attempts to burn the hospital with all its patients and occupants were made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-victims-kin-ransack-hosp-try-to-set-it-afire/articleshow/81890570.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Shops and businesses in congested areas of Lunawada town, the district headquarters of Mahisagar district, will remain shut for 15 days. Various traders’ associations, as well as district officials, took the decision on Saturday in wake of the increasing cases in the district. Even street vendors and vegetable sellers stayed away from the business in these areas. The congested areas have also been declared as containment zones by the administration. In Santrampur town of Mahisagar district too, it was decided that all businesses except essential services, remain closed on Sunday.

While the infrastructure was ready last year, the government notified it as a Covid hospital during the first surge, after a shortage of beds at the ESI hospital and Goa Medical College (GMC). “We had been told that the South Goa district hospital will be a Covid hospital till the pandemic ends," said a senior health official. "Currently, it is the only Covid hospital in Goa and has the required facilities for the treatment of Covid patients.” After the first wave, when the statet saw its Covid cases dropping, other Covid-only facilities — the ESI hospital and the sub-district hospital — were denotified, but the South Goa district hospital was not. “It was not done as it is better-equipped to treat Covid patients than other hospitals in the state,” he said. “GMC is a tertiary care hospital, though several of its wards were reserved for Covid patients last year and it continues to receive Covid patients. Non-Covid patients will suffer if the entire place is turned into a Covid hospital.” The South Goa district hospital was conceptualised when current leader of opposition Digambar Kamat was CM, between 2007 and 2012. Kamat, in whose constituency the facility is situated, has been in the forefront of pushing the issue. The design of the hospital underwent a change after the BJP-led government came to power in 2012. The estimates for the hospital were reworked owing to changes in the layout. The construction work , too, was delayed several times, with the government not clearing bills raised by the contractor. At the moment, Hospicio hospital serves the people of South Goa, although the structure is in bad shape. It has been repaired several times. Most critical patients and even some non-critical ones are frequently referred to GMC for lack of facilities at the Margao institution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-spike-to-further-delay-opening-of-s-goa-dist-hosp/articleshow/81891461.cms||Bindiya Chari

The commissioning of state-of-the-art block has been delayed owing to the pandemic. Last year, its work slowed down due to lockdown and it picked pace post-September. “We are likely to open it on August 15, but the date has not been finalised,” an official who was close to the project said. Existing superspecialities of the Goa Medical College will be shifted to the new block and new one or two additional ones will be introduced. However, the crux of the problem, he said, is that some of the existing super specialities such as urology, nephrology, have few consultants, while consultants for other super-specialities that are proposed, have not been appointed yet. “Though the structure is ready, we do not have consultants and other skilled manpower appointed yet,” he said. While the government was contemplating to operate the superspeciality block on public-private partnership (PPP) mode, there has been no decision yet though discussions on this topic were held for over a year. “We only had discussions and no decision has been made,” another official said. Of late, he said there have also been suggestions that the government must drop the idea of having private players on board to run superspeciality block. The GMC’s cardiology and cardio thoracic departments started over eight years ago, had consultants appointed offering them special pay packages. Their services have been better than those by corporate hospitals in the state.“||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/superspecialty-block-may-be-opened-on-august-15/articleshow/81891483.cms||Bindiya Chari

---||Ranchi||3 JSR schools sealed after students, teachers test +ve||Jamshedpur: A day after two schools were shut in the Steel City, the East Singhbhum administration on Friday closed Loyola School in Bistupur after one of its senior teachers tested positive for Covid-19. Other staff and students, who came in contact with the infected teacher, were asked to get themselves tested immediately. The administration also said random tests of teachers and students of schools in the district will start immediately. While Loyola School principal, Fr Pius, was not available for a comment, a Class VIII student said, "We are asked to stay home until further notice." Earlier on Thursday, the district health officials sealed DBMS English School and Andhra Association English School (AAES), both located in the Kadma area, after two Class IX students of DBMS and a Class X teacher of AAES tested positive. Sources said all three schools are likely to be reopened on Monday after the sanitization process is over. Joint chairman of DBMS Group, B Chandrashekar, said the school management has advised its teachers aged 45 and above to get themselves vaccinated soon. AAES sources said the infected teacher is undergoing treatment at the Tata Main Hospital. Confirming the shutdown of the schools, additional chief medical officer Dr Sahir Pall said orders for the closure have been issued to the district education department to ensure that the students and the teachers produced negative test reports before reopening the schools. Additional district magistrate Nand Kishore Lal said random checking of students and teachers in Steel City schools will begin to check the spread of the virus. Reacting to the news about the surge in Covid cases and the rising infection among school students and teachers, Jamshedpur Abhivavak Sangh convener Umesh Kumar said, "In the wake of the abrupt increase in Covid-19, the district administration should not permit physical classes in schools. Right now, online classes are the best way to avert the risk of getting infected." Notably, physical classes for new academic sessions for Class III to XII in all private English schools in the city started last week. Meanwhile, 152 train passengers alighting at the Tatanagar station and from Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Delhi were tested. In another special drive led by SP (city) Subash Chandra Jat, 80 people without wearing masks at the Kadma market area were also tested. Sources said such drives would be conducted across the city to ensure that people follow the Covid safety protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/3-jsr-schools-sealed-after-students-teachers-test-ve/articleshow/81877016.cms||B Sridhar

Of the 200 companies, Cooch Behar will get 111 and the rest will be deployed in Alipurduar. ADG (law and order) Jag Mohan, in a letter to district police chiefs on Saturday, said of the total 1,000 companies, 793 will be on poll duty and also guard strongrooms for the fourth phase. They will be aided by 16,000 state police personnel. Special observers are learnt to be apprehensive about April 10, when polling will be held in 44 seats across Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, Howrah, Hooghly and South 24 Parganas, which includes parts of Kolkata. For the city’s six assembly seats — Metiabruz, Kasba, Jadavpur, Tollygunje, Behala East and Behala West in Kolkata Police area — there will be 101 companies. Since Cooch Behar has witnessed violence in the recent past, the CAPF allocation is highest at 188 companies for the nine assembly seats in the district. Alipurduar will see 99 companies for five seats. A few days ago, the Trinamool Congress had complained about deployment of state police personnel from BJP-ruled UP and MP. They are currently manning South 24 Parganas for the third phase on April 6. Now, 12 SAP companies from Bihar and another 12 from Jharkhand will be deployed in Cooch Behar and Alipurduar. State armed police from Mizoram, Manipur and Nagaland will also be deployed in these two districts. Fifty companies have been allotted for guarding EVMs for phases one, two and three, along with maintaining law and order in districts during the first three phases of polling. Howrah police commissionerate, where polling will be held in six seats on April 10, is another area of concern for the EC. Hence, 103 companies are being allotted. For five seats in Hooghly (rural police area), 91 companies will be on duty. The entire deployment process will be over by April 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/200-more-capf-companies-to-reach-bengal/articleshow/81891164.cms||Debasish Konar

Company’s officials and a private investigator hired by them unearthed the counterfeit scam, police informed. After receiving the information from the company representatives, Vadodara rural police raided the shop owned by Mitesh Patel on Friday and found counterfeit Polycab India Limited products worth Rs 47,871 in the shop. Police said that the company’s officials and a private investigator had found that Patel was selling fake products. The private investigator told the police that the company was suspicious about the sudden drop in sales of its product in Dabhoi. During the probe it was found that many shop owners were selling counterfeit products of the company. On Friday, the investigator and an official of the company went to Patel’s shop as decoy customers and asked for a cable. When the official verified that the product was a fake, they informed police. During the interrogation, Patel told cops that he had purchased the fake products, worth Rs 29,000, from a man named Bhatia living on Ajwa Road. Police said that Patel doesn’t know much about Bhaita’s whereabouts. However, based on his mobile phone number police are trying to trace him. Both, Patel and Bhatia, were booked at Dabhoi police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/shop-owner-booked-for-selling-rip-offs-of-electrical-products/articleshow/81890425.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Don’t split minority votes, don’t vote on Hindu-Muslim lines: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||TARAKESHWAR: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Saturday appealed to the minority community not to let its votes be divided, and to Hindus not to vote on “Hindu-Muslim lines and fall in the trap set by the BJP... which wants to divide Bengal”. “I appeal to my minority brothers and sisters with folded hands. That shaitan who is fighting with the BJP’s money... do not listen to him and let minority votes be divided,” Banerjee said at a rally in Hooghly’s Tarakeswar — in a reference widely interpreted as aimed at Indian Secular Front’s Abbas Siddiqui, who has debuted in electoral politics in alliance with Congress and Left. “He speaks a lot of communal stuff. He will try to create fissures between Hindus and Muslims. He is a BJP aide, a BJP comrade. He has taken money from the BJP to divide Muslim votes. Please do not let this happen. You will face the biggest danger if the BJP comes to office,” she added, echoing the estimate that Siddiqui’s aggressive rhetoric may wean away a section of Muslim voters. She then appealed to Hindus not to vote on the basis of religion. “I appeal to my Hindu brothers and sisters: do not heed the BJP and do Hindu-Mussalman. The BJP is trying to divide Bengal. The days of the Bengal Partition are here again. They want to loot Bengal. They want to destroy Bengal, its language and culture. They will take your votes and flee and leave you among the ruins,” she said, asking them not to fall in the BJP trap “of dividing people on the basis of religion”. The pitch to the majority community not to vote on the basis of faith takes on significance in the context of a strong assessment in certain quarters that BJP’s sustained focus on ‘appeasement of minorities’ may have found traction among a significant chunk of the majority community. But while Mamata’s contrasting exhortations to the two communities seem to make political sense, political observers also feel BJP may cite it as an attempt to polarise Muslims on communal lines. In her speech, however, Mamata focused on communal amity and said that BJP’s politics was antithetical to Bengal’s ethos. “Their religion is different from ours. They are anti-women. They will keep misspelling Bengal as Bangal. Why? They will resist renaming Bengal as Bangla. They kept shouting slogans for Narendra Modi even during Netaji’s birth centenary celebrations. This is not what we have been taught since childhood, in schools. We were always taught to respect people,” she said. Banerjee compared the 2021 poll battle to Rabindranath Tagore’s struggle against the 1905 Bengal Partition. “Eta amader sanskriti noy, eta amader sabhyata noy (This is not Bengal’s culture),” she said. “Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had gone to a Muslim home to have tobacco. Nazrul in his songs and writings spoke against this (the Hindu-Muslim divide). There is a dargah inside the Ramakrishna Math. Tagore used rakhis to resist Bengal’s partition,” she added. “Did Amphan differentiate between Hindus and Muslims when it hit Bengal? Do you ask whether it is Hindu blood or Muslim blood when you are in an emergency?” Banerjee asked. She then focused on her experience in Nandigram: “Nandigram fought many battles together. They blew conch shells, gave aazan to build up resistance as mass murders took place. Hindu and Muslim suffered together, fought together. But, after this election, a young boy (son of Trinamool supporter Rabin Manna) told me that he and his family, including his mom and sister, were evicted. They stayed in a Hindu village. Now, a Muslim family has given them refuge. Their fault: they are TMC supporters.” “How can you divide a village?” she asked voters at the Raidighi rally. “It is our culture to celebrate our festivals together. We go to each other’s home for tea. How can you divide a village?” Banerjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dont-split-minority-votes-dont-vote-on-hindu-muslim-lines-cm/articleshow/81891484.cms||Falguni Banerjee

Bokaro Civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak said, “It was noticed in the first phase of the pandemic that the private hospitals and nursing homes had isolated themselves from treating Covid-19 patients. But this time, it will not be tolerated. They have to treat Covid patients by following all the safety protocols.” Pathak on Saturday held meeting with owners and representatives of more than two dozen private hospitals and nursing homes. At present, there are more than a dozen private hospitals that are enrolled with health department for providing Covid vaccinations. Meanwhile, all practising doctors in the district have been asked to prescribe Covid-19 tests to patient found suffering from symptoms of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). The private hospitals have also been instructed to provide details of patients coming to their institutions with SARI symptoms. “The rising number of Covid-19 cases requires contribution of private healthcare facilities to fight back the virus,” said Pathak. Meanwhile, Bokaro General Hospital has already augmented its beds by reopening the 40-bedded Covid Ward with the number of positive patients admitted in the hospital rising to 41. Earlier, BGH has reopened the Covid Critical Care Unit. “The pace of the new infections is a cause of concern. In February, the number of patients had reduced to zero and since March 4-5, patients started surfacing on a daily bases, which has now increased to above 25 every day,” said Pathak. The spike in Covid cases has also alerted the district administration, which has reconstituted the Covid management cells, aiming to control the spread of the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bokaro-admin-asks-pvt-hosps-to-dedicate-beds-for-covid-patients/articleshow/81890586.cms||---

According to hospital sources, the total number of Covid patients admitted at TMH was eight just two weeks ago but now it has gone up to 80. “Currently, we have 140 general beds and 18 ICU beds for Covid patients but in the wake of a surge in cases, the infrastructural and diagnostic facilities are likely to be increased at the hospital,” Rajan Chaudhry, Tata Steel’s advisor of medical services, said. He added that the next couple of weeks will be crucial for the district in terms of a jump in the number of active cases. Currently, the number of active cases in the district is 464 (as of Saturday morning). Rajan also said Covid testing has been ramped up at TMH. “At the moment, we are conducting more than 1,100 tests daily with a weekly positivity rate of 8.49%,” he added. “Some of the hospital staff, like doctors and paramedical workers, are getting infected because of their exposure to the Covid patients. If the number of infections do not reduce, then routine activities of the hospital might be curtailed,” he said. When asked, Rajan did not mention the number of hospital staff who have tested positive and said, “We have to see how we can run OPD services if the number of patients continue to go up.” The general manager of TMH, Sudhir Rai, said from Saturday it has become mandatory for the doctors and assisting staff to wear PPE gear at the emergency and OPD wards. Meanwhile, both Rajan and Rai urged everyone to get inoculated at the earliest “as that is the strongest tool to beat the virus”. Rajan said, “The infection rate of the mutant coronavirus is such that if one person contracts the disease, it can spread to the entire family within two hours.” On April 1 and 2, TMH administered vaccines to 750 and 1,200 beneficiaries, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/amid-surge-in-cases-tata-hosp-to-increase-cov-infra-facilities/articleshow/81890568.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A fourth, who spotted the train in the nick of time, leaped to safety but sustained grievous injuries. Sources said the noise of a goods train passing by on adjoining tracks appeared to have drowned the warning honk of the express. Though the driver applied the emergency brake, the train came to a screeching halt only after it had run over the three men at work. An inquiry has been instituted. The accident took place 25km from Kharagpur junction, on a section where there are three pairs of tracks. The four gangmen were greasing fasteners that hold rails down to wood sleepers. Around 9.55am, they heard an engine honk and saw the goods train heading from Duya halt towards Balichak station on the first set of tracks. Although this railway stretch is a straight one, they did not notice another train heading in the same direction on the very tracks they were working on. The loco pilot of the express said he had “honked several times” before applying the emergency brake, “but the men never looked up”, probably because the rattle of the goods train had drowned the powerful air horn. While Manik Mondal of Radhamohanpur and Nripen Pal and Bapi Nayak of Kharagpur died on the spot, Kolaghat resident Krishan Bera was hit by the train while trying to get out of harm’s way. The express slowed down and stopped at Balichak station, where the pilot and guard reported the accident. A team rushed to the spot and rescued the injured worker. The train carried him to Kharagpur, where he was admitted to the railway hospital with serious limb trauma. He was transferred to the railway hospital in Kolkata. Divisional railway manager Monaranjan Pradhan said an inquiry would reveal whether there had been safety lapses. “For changing of fishplates, welding and other complex and time-taking maintenance work, railway blocks are required and no train is allowed to ply. For something as routine as greasing or inspection of tracks, there’s no norm of enforcing traffic blocks. Workers are trained to be alert and must move away from the tracks to let an approaching train pass,” a railway official said. Also, since the work involves moving from one section of the line to another, gangmen do not put up red flags to warn loco pilots. “Had the workers taken turns to watch out for approaching trains, the tragedy could have been averted. But, it seems, all four men were engrossed in maintenance work at the same time,” said a railway official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/gangmen-fail-to-hear-honk-3-mowed-down-by-express/articleshow/81891247.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Kolkata||Cooch Behar civic board administrator joins BJP||Cooch Behar: An administrator of the Trinamool-run Cooch Behar civic board quit the party and joined BJP on Saturday. Bhushan Singh took the BJP flag from Suvendu Adhikari, who was in the district for a poll campaign. Singh had been airing his dissent for quite some time. He was upset when he didn’t get a seat on the dais during Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s public meeting there. Later, he gave up the Cooch Behar Town Block Committee vice-presidency following differences with Trinamool district president Partha Pratim Ray over formation of party committees. Singh’s joining BJP ahead of the polls came as a shock to a section of Trinamool ranks in the town. He is the second TMC leader from Cooch Behar, after Mihir Goswami, to have joined BJP. While Goswami is the BJP candidate from Natabari, Singh’s induction has given the party a boost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cooch-behar-civic-board-administrator-joins-bjp/articleshow/81891178.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya
---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly elections: PM Narendra Modi returns ‘bohiragoto’ jibe, calls TMC ‘Taka Mar Company’||SONARPUR: PM Narendra Modi used his weekend election rallies in Hooghly’s Haripal and South 24 Parganas’ Sonarpur to return the Trinamool Congress’s “bohiragoto (outsider)” fire by saying that the Bengal CM was welcome to contest polls from Varanasi without having to face xenophobia. He also dubbed Trinamool a “Taka Mar Company (TMC)” and accused it of tak-ing “cut money” from people. “Didi, the people of Varanasi and Uttar Pradesh are large-hearted like the people of Bengal. They will not call you bohiragato. You will get to meet a lot of tilakwallahs and chotiwallahs there. They will chant ‘Har har Mahadev’. But they, along with others in Varanasi, will give you love. They may make you stay there,” the PM said at the Sonarpur rally in what was evidently a response to the declaration by TMC leaders that Banerjee would, after defeating BJP in Bengal, take on Modi in his Lok Sabha constituency of Varanasi. BJP leaders, including Modi, have claimed that “Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is looking for a second seat as she is scared of losing from Nandigram”. Trinamool leaders, including MP Mahua Moitra, have responded to that by saying — sarcastically — that Banerjee might contest from Varanasi in the 2024 Lok Sabha to take on Modi directly. “Contesting from second seat?... Yes Mr Prime Minister, she will. And it will be Varanasi! So go get your armour on,” a Trinamool tweet had said. Modi on Saturday latched onto the Trinamool’s response. Modi seized upon Trinamool’s taunt to make an attempt to cast Trinamool as parochial while seeking to depict BJP as an outfit which does not differentiate among people on the basis of states they belong to. The PM countered Trinamool’s “ anti-outsider” plank also by reiterating that the the leader of a BJP government in West Bengal would be a “ son of soil” BJP tacticians seem to reckon that Trinamool’s nativist pitch would not play well with “ outsiders” who constitute a chunk in many constituencies. However, PM said that public disparagement of outsiders militated against Bengal’s inclusivist grain. He cited Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s example to debunk the Trinamool’s “outsider” campaign. “Born in Odisha and having his education in Bengal, Netaji used to say ‘Bharat ek hai’, our hopes and aspirations were the same. It pains me when the Trinamool and Mamata Didi talk about outsiders in India,” the PM said. Modi’s speeches were marked by trademark aggression . He Bengal had made up its mind to vote the Trinamool out of office, and dubbed Trinamool a “Taka Mar Company (TMC)” at the Haripal rally and accusing it of taking “cut money” even for admission of patients to government hospitals. “The middle class has slogged, the Trinamool has taken a cut from their income. It looted the poor’s rations following Amphan. It took away a major chunk of the 23 lakh tonnes of rice and 1 lakh tonne of pulses that the centre sent here during the lockdown. Apni nijer goondader samlan (Rein in your goons). Bengal has had enough of their torture. Bengal wants education, security for its women,” the PM said, adding that the BJP government would use Digital India to transfer welfare benefits directly to people without any need for “cut money”. PM sounded confident of the BJP being able to form Bengal’s next government. “Come May 2, someone from Bengal will be sworn in as Bengal’s CM. I will attend the swearing-in ceremony and ask the CM to expedite the process of transferring Rs 18,000 to each farmer’s account under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi,” he said. Modi took a jibe at the Bengal CM’s complaints against security forces, electronic voting machines and the Election Commission. “Didi, why are you angry? Is it because you did not get to do chhappa votes (rig the poll)? You were all praise for the EC, EVMs and security forces when you came to office 10 years ago,” he added. “ When an athlete starts complaining against the umpire than you can safely conclude that the game has been lost.” “There is a churning going on inside the Trinamool itself. Sensible people are saying Didi made a big mistake by shifting to Nandigram. A few reportedly advised her to contest from a second seat. But others prevailed upon Didi. I think this was sane advice because it would be difficult to run the Trinamool if Didi lost from two seats,” he said. Modi, sensing Banerjee’s traction among women, said the Bengal government was sitting on files for establishment of fast-track courts for trial of crime against women when a thousand such such courts had already come up across the country. “We have provisioned for setting up an anti-trafficking unit and a women’s desk in each police station. The government here is not making full use of it,” he said. PM also harped on the “double-engine sarkar” promise to emphasise how Bengal could be developed and connected if there was the same party in office both at the centre and in the state. “Look at Singur today. The Trinamool drove away industry from the state. It lacks vision and political will. Potato growers in Hooghly are selling their produce cheap because the government has not set up adequate cold storages; and the existing storages are being run by Trinamool syndicates. Jute growers in Hooghly are facing a similar plight. We have set up an infrastructure fund to give a boost to the jute industry but things are not moving because the state government does not support jute mills,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/modi-returns-bohiragoto-jibe-calls-tmc-taka-mar-company/articleshow/81891497.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||‘For West Bengal, BJP’s plan of action is to mislead the state’s electorate’||BJP is good at spreading fake news and tampering EVMs, says Yashwant Sinha, who joined the Trinamool Congress last month. The former Union finance minister for two terms and former Union external affairs minister also tells Udit Prasanna Mukherji that the Covid-19 pandemic alone cannot be blamed for the economy’s continuing downward spiral. Excerpts from an interview:What is your take on the elections in Bengal?You can say I am a part of it. I was also part of the TMC delegation that met the Election Commission on Friday. I have information that on Friday evening, PM Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda had met to discuss the Bengal election. What I got is that as per ground-level information, what they have gathered is not very favourable for them (BJP). This is why they were discussing a plan of action. BJP’s main target will now be to mislead voters. They are trying to spread the news through various channels that Mamata Banerjee is going to contest from a second constituency so that they can mislead the electorate here. They are good at spreading fake news and tampering EVMs. Will you elaborate on EVM tampering?This is a fact. Only the other day, a BJP candidate was caught with an EVM in Assam. It was found in the car of the candidate. Now it is anybody’s guess how many such EVMs are being tampered with. These people (the current BJP leadership) will not shy away from doing anything, including changing EVMs. There is an allegation from some distributors of PSU oil companies that the ministry is asking for customer data with phone numbers in Bengal.This is the first central government in the country which does not follow any rule. This includes using central PSUs as election machinery. They have an illusion that all Hindi-speaking people in Bengal would vote for them, but that is not the case. I have addressed two election rallies in Hooghly district and could see the overwhelming response from the public. What will you say on the current level of inflation?Yes, the inflation is quite high, and the situation is dangerous. We are in a stagflation situation. When there is a downward spiral in the economy and inflation, then it is a stagflation situation. The pensioners, elderly people, middle class and the poor, all are in a very bad shape. Your comment on the shape of the economy and what was the impact of the pandemic?The economy was not doing well much before the Covid-19 pandemic. For the last three years, the basic problem was lack of demand, which was never addressed. Even before Covid, the GDP growth came down from 8% to only 4%. There was a decrease in GDP growth for eight consecutive quarters. So, you cannot blame the pandemic alone. Demonetisation was also responsible for the current state of affairs. Last year, the Centre came out with mindless economic measures. Actually the pandemic has saved them (Centre) as the economy was already in a mess. The Rs 42-lakh crore package announced by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman was, too, an eyewash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/for-bengal-bjps-plan-of-action-is-to-mislead-the-states-electorate/articleshow/81891243.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji
---||Pune||Pune: Weekly RT-PCR test diktat for firms comes under fire||PUNE: Friday’s order by collector Rajesh Deshmukh, mandating weekly RT-PCR tests for on-site employees of all industrial and commercial establishments, has drawn sharp criticism. State industries department officials said the order applies to all employees physically present at factories and offices. Industries and service units said this would be difficult and expensive to implement, especially given the weak testing infrastructure in industrial areas. According to experts, even accounting for the high percentage (95%) of IT employees working from home, conducting weekly tests would entail a total cost of around Rs70-80 crore. There are around15 lakh employees on the rolls of manufacturing and IT units in the district. “This does not seem practical as each test costs around Rs 800. Besides, there are not many test centres in industrial areas, and the few that are operational would be overwhelmed,” Charanjeet Singh Bhogal, COO of Hinjewadi Industries Association, said. “If they want to make it mandatory, the authorities should bear the responsibility and cost of testing. This could cost companies crores and may force them to fold,” Dilip Batval, secretary of Federation of Chakan Industries, said. “We will write to the authorities about this issue and urge our members to observe Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Prashant Girbane, director-general of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (MCCIA), said. Deshmukh told TOI they would work out a solution, “be it testing only symptomatic employees or allowing rapid antigen tests”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-weekly-rt-pcr-test-diktat-for-firms-comes-under-fire/articleshow/81893222.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

This is the highest single-day case total in the last 140 days. The cumulative caseload currently stands at 9,05,946. Also, for the first time in the last four months, nine patients succumbed to the novel coronavirus. The deaths were reported from Guntur district (2), Nellore (2), Chittoor (1), Kadapa (1), Kurnool (1), Prakasam (1) and Visakhapatnam (1). Altogether 787 people were declared cured. There are currently 9,417 active cases with 8,89,295 cumulative recoveries and 7,234 fatalities. Four districts have at least 1,000 active cases each. Guntur reported 273 new infections, followed by Visakhapatnam (198), Chittoor (190), Krishna (178) and Nellore (163). These five districts account for nearly 72% of the new cases on Saturday. The state tested 31,260 Covid-19 samples to detect the 1,398 new cases, translating to a case positivity rate of 4.5%. The intensity of the sudden surge in the transmission rates of Covid cases can be gauged from the fact that the positivity rate stood at a mere 0.25% in the month of February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/covid-cases-continue-to-increase-in-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/81895359.cms||---

The number of fresh cases on Saturday crossed 1,000-mark, the biggest single-day spike (1.041 cases) in nearly 200 days. At least six more persons lost their battle for life. Infection and deaths accounted for 32% and 43% of the total cases and casualties in the state, making the city a hotspot. The first wave took 67 days to reach 1,000 cases in a day, from 35 cases on July 1 to 1,006 on September 5. In comparison, the second wave recorded 35 cases on March 15 and crossed 1,000 within 19 days. Meanwhile, only 213 patients recovered in 24 hours. As a result, the number of patients with active infections jumped to 5,408, highest since the first week of October. At present, 3,450 patients are in home isolation and the rest in hospitals. The virus has infected 88,693 people so far. Of these, 82,157 (92.6%) have recovered while 1,228 (1.4%) died. The recovery rate was over 98% in mid-March which has dropped by almost six percentage points in 15 days.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata hospitals gear up for Sunday vaccination||KOLKATA: Hospitals across the city have geared up to vaccinate on Sunday following an instruction from the state government to continue with the inoculation drive without a break till April 30. While some had introduced round-the-clock vaccination last month, others had not been inoculating on Sundays. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) will operate three counters but may add a couple in case there is a rush. "We will see how it goes. On Sunday, we don't expect a huge crowd but it may build up later in the day and we are prepared," said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. AMRI Hospitals, too, will flag off Sunday vaccination at its Salt Lake and Dhakuria units. Its Mukundapur unit has already been operating on Sundays. "All our arrangements will remain the same. Initially, we expect more in the 45-plus group to visit on Sundays since it is a holiday for them. Senior citizens could be fewer since they generally avoid going out on Sundays," said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. State hospitals, too, will be launching their Sunday vaccination. Duty rosters have been prepared for those in charge. "We don't expect a huge crowd to begin with. But it may change in subsequent weeks. In that case, more will be put on duty," said a hospital source. KMC is seeking vaccinators from the state health department to meet the challenge of keeping its 80 vaccination centres open seven days a week. "From mid of April, we will have to run 100 vaccination centres across the city. We have imparted special training to our paramedics for the Covid vaccination. Apart from that, we have sought vaccinators from the state health department," a KMC health department official said. According to a civic official, the KMC health department has decided to shift some paramedics from those primary health centres where the number of recipients is less to those witnessing a heavy rush. "We have targeted to bring 12,000 citizens under the vaccination drive every day once we open 100 centres," said a KMC health department official.  The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) is conducting the vaccination drive at 10 centers, including three civic body-run hospitals and seven urban primary health centers but unlike KMC, the BMC authorities are in much pressure to conduct the vaccination drive seven days a week due to shortage of manpower. As per civic estimates, nearly 2,500 are getting inoculated in Bidhannagar area daily, out of which around 1,750 are receiving the jab from private centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-hospitals-gear-up-for-sunday-vaccination/articleshow/81893437.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||West Bengal puts inoculation drive on the fast track||KOLKATA: Bengal on Saturday crossed 6 million vaccination doses to put up a valiant fight against a possible outbreak of the second wave of coronavirus. Keeping in mind the rising number of infected patients, the health department wants to ramp up the vaccination drive to 5 lakh a day from the current average of 2.5 lakh a day. Bengal stands third in the nation's vaccination ladder. On Saturday, inoculation was carried out from 2971 sites. Out of which 2800 were government and only 171 were private. The sites will be increased further to accelerate vaccination to the desired level, said a senior health department officer. The doctors are harping on fast-track immunization to build herd immunity against the virus. From April 1, anyone above 45 with or without comorbidities can get vaccinated. Health experts are worrying that there can be a surge in infection in Bengal with large gatherings being very common during this assembly election, where Covid-19 guideline becomes the biggest casualty. The indefectibility of the new strains are much higher than the strain we have encountered, said a virologist. The number of people having infection is hovering around 2000 in Bengal. Apart from the state government's proactive steps, several private hospitals in the city have increased their Covid beds because of a steady rise in the number of cases and an increasing percentage of people testing positive are being hospitalised. Over the past week, hospitals have been converting non-Covid beds into Covid ones. Vaccines reached Kolkata on January 12 and vaccination of frontline healthcare workers began on January 16. Now vaccination will continue without any respite all through the week, said an officer. A number of hospitals in the city saw an unusual rush for Covid vaccine doses on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, the first few days of vaccination for all people above 45. "We want to leverage this enthusiasm to maximise the inoculation. More the merrier as the second surge is getting prominent with every passing day," said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/west-bengal-puts-inoculation-drive-on-the-fast-track/articleshow/81893450.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Chased by police, his three abductors — daily-wage workers in their late 20s — had abandoned him in the forest and tried to flee.  The first-time offenders are now cooling their heels in jail. Santosh Gowda and Viji Kumar of Gadaranahalli village and Vasant Kumar of Avaremala village abducted 74-year-old Parameshwar, father of Radhakrishna Prasad, on March 31 in a bid to make a quick buck, police said. “They monitored Parameshwar’s movements for a few days and decided to abduct him in a car. Vasant borrowed the vehicle of his friend Arun Kumar of Rampura village, saying he wanted to visit a temple with his family. They chose to kidnap Parameshwar in the morning in the hope of getting ransom by evening,” police said. On the day when Radhakrishna had gone to Anekal, the trio waited near an agricultural field in Maralavadi village, a kilometre from Parameshwar’s farmhouse. “Parameshwar started his morning walk around 6. The accused, covering their faces with monkey caps, blocked him and pushed him into the car. They drove to Rampura forest, around 15km away,” police said. At 7.15am, they called Radhakrishna on his mobile and threatened to kill his father if Rs 25 lakh was not paid. They parked the car deep inside the forest and threatened Parameshwar at knife-point. They called Radhakrishna again and enquired whether the cash was ready. They told him that they would call in the evening to tell him where he should come with money. At 9am, Radhakrishna filed a complaint with Harohalli police. Tracking the phone from which Radhakrishna had received the calls, police reached Rampura forest range. “Personnel from neighbouring stations too had arrived at the spot. Split into five teams, we entered the forest. At 4.30pm, we spotted Parameshwar sitting beneath a tree. He told us that sensing trouble, the trio drove away by 2pm. While we rescued him, another team chased the abductors and arrested them from Rampura village by night,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-3-abandon-senior-in-forest-as-kidnap-plan-goes-haywire/articleshow/81893480.cms||---

The last time over 600 cases were reported was on November 28. With this, the city’s Covid tally has increased to 64,398 and the number of active cases has also gone up to 2,627. On November 28, Gurugram had reported 668 new Covid cases and the number of active cases on that day was 6,367. the city witnessed its peak in Covid cases in November. The city is again showing a sharp spike in cases now — Gurugram has added 2,102 new cases to its tally since Monday (March 29). In contrast, whereas the last week of March (March 22 to March 28) reported 1,468 cases. With the surge in cases, the health department has also ramped up testing. While the previous week saw Gurugram testing an average of 5,000 people, the number of tests conducted has now been increased to 6,000 on an average per day. In the last 24 hours, a total of 6,109 tests were conducted by private and government labs. “We are going to increase testing in the district. We are currently running around 10 to 12 rapid antigen test camps, which will be increased to 14,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. In view of the surge in Covid cases, the district administration had earlier directed private and public hospitals to reserve at least 50% of their beds for the Covid patients. “People need to adhere to the Covid protocols that they were following earlier. We are having an inter-departmental meeting on Monday to discuss the issue. We will be carrying out aggressive containment measures. We will also be doing massive challaning for non-adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour. The vaccination drive will also be intensified,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram. Meanwhile, the health department said one more person succumbed to Covid, taking the toll to 367. 7k turn up for jabs in Ph-4The third day of Phase 4 of the vaccination drive saw 7,176 people above the age of 45 years getting inoculated at 93 session sites.

---||Gurgaon||400 shanties gutted in fire near DLF-3||Gurgaon: Hundreds of migrant workers were left homeless after a fire reduced to ashes over 400 shanties in a slum cluster in Nathupur near DLF-3 around midnight on Friday. Fortunately, no casualties were reported. The shanties were spread over five acres of government land and had illegal power connections. Most of these were rented out to migrant workers for Rs 1,500-Rs 2000 a month by locals who had encroached on the land. Fire officials suspect an electrical short-circuit triggered the fire, which engulfed the illegal colony. Gurgaon fire officer IS Kashyap said a call was received around midnight from the slum cluster and immediately four fire tenders from Sector 29 fire station were dispatched for the spot. And later six more fire tenders arrived from Bheem Nagar, Sector 37, and Udyog Vihar fire stations. “It took the fire tenders nearly two hours to douse the flames, but by that time, around 400 of the 600 shanties in the slum cluster were completely gutted,” he said. According to fire officials, the shanties did not have proper power connection and the dwellers stole power from a nearby electric pole. “It looks like an electrical short-circuit in one of those wires illegally connected to the power supply line triggered the fire. The blaze soon engulfed the entire slum cluster,” Kashyap said. While there were no casualties as the residents evacuated on time, they lost all their personal belongings, including cash, jewellery and household items in the fire. “Most of the slum residents work in the DLF area as domestic staff, housekeeping staff, drivers, gardeners etc,” said an official. Amal Khan, a slum dweller who works as a housekeeping staff, told TOI that the fire aggravated as cooking cylinders exploded in the shanties. “Everyone lost whatever little things they had. Now they don’t have a roof over their head, no means to cook and no money to restart their life,” he said. In May 2019 also, a fire had broken out at the same place, in which nearly 80 shanties were gutted by the time firemen brought the blaze under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/400-shanties-gutted-in-fire-near-dlf-3/articleshow/81891376.cms||Bagish Jha

A senior GMDA official said the rules are expected to be approved at the next state cabinet meeting. The service rules specify the terms of appointment and the salary structure of the staff at the metropolitan authority. Asked about the delay, the official said, “The process took some time but we have finally drafted the rules and sent them for approval.” He refused to elaborate further, saying he would be able to divulge details once the rules are approved. As of now, there are around 50 people working with GMDA. Most of them are employed on a contractual basis. The GMDA Act says the state government may ‘without any prejudice’ decide on salaries and allowances payable to and other terms and conditions of service of officers and other staff of the authority. The state government has to also decide upon the manner and qualifications for appointment of officers and employees. Meanwhile, the GMDA chief executive officer (CEO) may appoint, in such manner, for such temporary period and on such terms and conditions, such other staff, as it may consider necessary for the efficient performance of its functions, as may be specified by regulations.

---||Kozhikode||Kerala assembly elections 2021: LDF govt stabbed fishermen in the back, says Rahul Gandhi||KOZHIKODE: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday made a scathing attack on BJP and LDF, saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not have any problem with the Left as both their ideologies were founded on “hatred and anger”. Keeping UDF-backed candidate in Vadakara K K Rema, the wife of slain RMP leader T P Chandrasekharan, by his side at a campaign meeting at Purameri, Rahul said Rema was the answer why the Prime Minister always says “Congress Mukth Bharat and never Left Front Mukth Kerala”. Lashing out at CPM, Rahul said, “I want to ask the Left Front why they took away her husband, what did they get by giving her pain, what did they get by taking a father away from his son? She was after all from their family. Imagine what they do to their own family.” Earlier addressing a rally at Koyilandy, Rahul attacked the LDF government on the deep sea fishing deal and said that the government tried to stab fishermen in the back by secretly entering into a deal with a US firm. “There is a difference between someone who stabs you from the front and someone who stabs you from behind. While you were going out into the sea, the LDF government entered into a deal with those who are trying to destroy your livelihood. The government made the deal secretly and silently tried to stab you in the back,” he said. On the matter of how CPM and BJP were two sides of the same coin, Rahul said that RSS understands that the real threat to them comes from those who unite everybody. “They understand very well that just like them, Left Front is also a divider of society. Left Front is also an ideology of anger and violence,” he said. Rahul said that Kerala can never succeed with an ideology of anger and hatred. “Kerala can never succeed with an ideology that makes widows, an ideology that takes away fathers from their sons. This will never be the path of success for Kerala,” he said, adding that the Congress party has instead tried to unify and bring people together. Nyay will solve state’s economic crisis: RahulRahul said that UDF’s election promise of Nyay scheme will solve the problems of poverty, unemployment and economic crisis in the state. He said that Kerala can show direction to the rest of India. “Your spirit of brotherhood, your history, your tradition, your respect towards women, these are things that can give direction to India,” he said. Rahul also attended campaign meetings at Peravoor, Alakode and Kannur harbour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kerala-assembly-elections-2021-ldf-govt-stabbed-fishermen-in-the-back-says-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/81893500.cms||---

The resident’s group also asked the commissioner to increase the number of places for offering prayers in the city. “Any administrative step taken by the administration should be based on orders and circulars that are fair and applicable to all citizens irrespective of faith, belief and denomination,” the residents said in a letter to the DC. One of the residents who met the Gurgaon deputy commissioner, Altaf Ahmed, said, “Despite the mentioned site being in the list finalised by the administration for offering Friday prayers, we weren’t allowed to offer prayers on Friday. Dinesh Bharti, who leads Bharat Mata Vahini, came and chanted slogans and stopped us from offering prayers. While the police detained him, we were also stopped from offering prayers at the place.” Abdul Hasif, the imam, told TOI, “The right-wing group had assembled at the spot since morning and there were rumours that they might pelt stones on those offering prayers. Hence the police requested us to offer prayers at another site. We chose not to offer prayers.” He claimed that the group had threatened to stop prayers at all public places in the coming weeks. When contacted, deputy commissioner Yash Garg said, “I have discussed the matter with the police commissioner and we will ensure that nobody is able to disrupt the Friday prayers at the sites decided by the administration.” Bharat Mata Vahini has been disrupting Friday prayers for the past three weeks. They have even managed to stop the prayers at a couple of sites. “When people from the Hindu community aren’t allowed to pray in open spaces, Friday prayers should also be banned,” Bharti had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/friday-prayers-residents-seek-security-for-muslims/articleshow/81891378.cms||Shubhra Pant

Sources said the authority was likely to go ahead with the first option, which says that the Film City project in Sector 21 must have an amusement park with 60 rides, almost 600 rooms to house visitors and other ancillary facilities over 321 acres by the end of 2024. The entire Film City project, which will come up on 1,000 acres, will be developed in three phases by 2029. While preparing the developing models, the consultant — CBRE — had studied the functioning of prominent studios in the US, Japan and Singapore. Moreover, the number of visitors in popular studios and film cities of the country were also taken into account while preparing the suggestions for the project. Moreover, the report also mentions the number of films, TV series and over-the-top media services that were produced in the past few years. The demand and occupancy ratio was calculated after interactions with executives of Mumbai Film City, Ramoji Film City, Mehboob Studios and Kamal Amrohi studio. YEIDA’s chief executive officer, Arun Vir Singh, said the most crucial part was to figure out the land requirement for various facilities and development options. “The report has given us an idea about the number of visitors who will come to Film City by 2029, the number of hotels and rooms required and what features an amusement park should have. Without experience, deciding the product mix for such a big project is a challenge for any authority,” said Singh. He added that a decision on all such facilities would be discussed at the meeting scheduled with government officials. It was decided to develop the Film City project in phases so that the viability and optimum value is maintained. While the first phase will come up on 321 acres, the second and third phases will be developed over 298 and 382 acres, respectively. According to CBRE’s report, the Film City could attract 439 producers during the initial years of operation. Close to 3 lakh people are expected to visit the area in the first year of its launch. Once operational, the Film City and amusement park can together earn revenues of up to Rs 25,000 crore during the initial period and Rs 30,000 crore in 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/film-city-likely-to-have-park-with-60-rides-600-rooms/articleshow/81891370.cms||Shalabh

This has been confirmed by the gangster’s lawyer. Dujana, who has around 43 cases of murder, extortion and attempt to murder lodged against him across different police stations in western UP, walked out of jail in February after getting bail in different cases. And that month only, Dujana — who famously got married to his girlfriend Pooja on February 15, 2019 — visited the famous Dadi Sati temple in Dujana when he had come to the Surajpur court for a hearing. The temple is revered by the Gujjar community, and politicians like former PMs Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee also paid visits to pay obeisance. Dujana’s visit to the temple led to buzz that he may once again contest the zila panchayat elections. His last attempt in 2016 led to a win with a sizable margin of 10,030 votes against Sangram Singh. Dujana’s lawyer Jitendra Nagar said that Pooja purchased a nomination letter on Saturday and will soon file her papers. “Pooja would campaign for the polls soon after filing her nomination. My client wants to stay in his native village and work for the people. He wants to forget his past. Pooja hopes to win the election.” Pooja also told a local news portal that her purpose was to bring her husband out of the crime world and improve his image. Dujana, orginally Anil Nagar, was first arrested in 2012 in connection with the murder of a food trader from Muzaffarnagar named Robin Tyagi. His name later surfaced in the BJP politician Vijay Pandit’s murder case. This time, panchayat elections involve polls in five wards. While the SP has given the candidature to Geeta Bhati, the BSP has decided to field Jaywati Nagar. Additional DCP (central Noida) Elamaran G said that so far, they do not have a written communication about Pooja’s nomination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gangsters-wife-may-contest-zila-panchayat-elections/articleshow/81891392.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Bengaluru||As Covid cases jump, BBMP asks private hospitals to reserve 40% beds||BENGALURU: With infections soaring in the tech capital, private hospitals have been directed to reserve 40 per cent of their beds for government-referred Covid-19 patients and be ready for a challenging phase. During a virtual meeting on Saturday, officials of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) indicated that private hospitals should be prepared to treat more severe Covid-19 cases in the coming days.  Representatives of more than 80 private medical facilities attended the meeting, which was chaired by BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta. Creating adequate treatment capacity and increasing the vaccination coverage were the two main talking points. Currently, there are 26,544 active cases in Bengaluru. More than 85 per cent are in home isolation. Hospitalisation is advised for only people who have severe symptoms and comorbidities. “Private hospitals have been asked to reserve up to 40 per cent of the beds for patients referred by BBMP under the Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust. However, we have been told that a detailed government circular will follow,” said Dr HM Prasanna, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA). Currently, hospitals have kept 10 per cent of their beds for government-referred Covid-19 patients. On June 23, 2020, when cases were high, officials had directed private hospitals to reserve 50 per cent of their beds. After the infection rates fell, the requirement was relaxed in November 2020. Since June, BBMP has sent 43,863 patients to private facilities.  In its reply to an RTI query in January this year, the civic body said that private facilities had been paid Rs 133.2 crore for treating 31,624 patients. Some corporate hospitals have expressed concern about the latest directive. “A year ago, treatment for conditions other than Covid-19 took a back seat and hence, we had beds dedicated for Covid care. It’s not the same now. Leaving 40 per cent of the beds for Covid care will lead to a further shortage of beds for other patients. It’s a tricky scenario,” said the chairperson of a leading hospital in Bengaluru. The chairperson added that medical facilities were better prepared and experienced than before, but problems might arise if staff managed both Covid care and other treatments. There is some relief for smaller facilities. “The BBMP commissioner has assured us that hospitals with fewer than 50 beds would not be asked to reserve beds for Covid patients at this stage,” Dr Prasanna said. BBMP special commissioner (health) Rajendra Cholan P told STOI the requirement applied to hospitals with more than 100 beds. “Private hospitals must declare how many beds are already used for Covid-19 patients,” he said. Expressing concern over the rising cases, he said a contingency plan was needed. “We don’t know what is going to be the condition in the next one week. Currently, we have 1,200 beds in government hospitals and medical colleges. Private medical colleges in the city have 4,000 beds. Of these, nearly half can be reserved for Covid,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/as-covid-cases-jump-bbmp-asks-private-hospitals-to-reserve-40-beds/articleshow/81893503.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Kozhikode||Remembrance of things past behind PM Narendra Modi’s ‘Saranam’ chant, says Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan||KOZHIKODE: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that he chanted ‘Swamiye Saranam Ayyappa’ at the campaign rally at Konni on Friday after remembering about the things he had told during his earlier visit and on realizing that he was not able to do anything on those things. “He had told certain things during his earlier visits… and could have chanted ‘Saranam’ realizing that he was not able to do anything on those things,” Vijayan said, responding to a question during a press conference in Kannur on Saturday. In a sharp retort against Modi who had launched a broadside against the LDF government, Vijayan said the making a ‘development speech’ after trying to scuttle even the attempts by the state to survive in the face of recurring disasters during the last five years amounted to mocking the people. Vijayan also said the Sangh Parivar has been trying to punish Kerala just because of the reason that the state is not succumbing to communalism. He added that leaders of both Congress and BJP were portraying Kerala in a poor light. He said when some people are now talking with great interest about state’s development and helping the state, it would be good to look back at the state’s experience when it faced the biggest floods in a century. “It is normal for Central forces to help us. But after they went back after the relief operations we had to pay the bill for their services. This was when the state’s own army-the fishermen -didn’t ask for a single paisa for their selfless service. Though many had claimed that the Centre had provided rice to be distributed as relief aid, out experience is that the price for it was collected to the last dime,” Vijayan added. He added that the even foreign countries, which came forward to help in the post-flood reconstruction, were prevented from providing help while such restrictions were not seen in states like Gujarat. “So, when such persons come to the state and speak something, people will see through it,” he said. Countering the remarks made by Modi that LDF and UDF were twins, Vijayan said, “The people of Kerala know the ‘bhai bhai’ relation between Congress and BJP.” “Congress should not harbour the thought that it can gift the state in a silver platter to the BJP. The people should give a severe blow to such attempts,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/remembrance-of-things-past-behind-pm-narendra-modis-saranam-chant-says-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan/articleshow/81893520.cms||---

As many as 6,334 people were fined for not wearing masks, spitting in public and not following social distancing guidelines in the 31 days, suggesting an average of 204 violators a day, according to police data. The maximum of 3,837 challans were issued for not maintaining social distancing in markets and public places. Next came spitting in public places – 1,607. A total of 890 slips were handed over to people caught without masks. The drive helped the police earn Rs 35.64 lakh. In a further break-down, the east division of the police issued 2,253 challans for violating social distancing guidelines, 1,136 for spitting and 334 for not wearing masks, and collected Rs 20.31 lakh.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Give relief or keep us open, say gyms||BENGALURU: The state government’s decision to shut gyms as part of the fresh Covid containment measures has not gone down well with fitness studio operators in Bengaluru. A segment already facing job losses and shutdowns, fitness centres are now grappling with angry new customers who are demanding their membership fee back. The Karnataka State Gymnasium and Fitness Owners’ Association on Saturday demanded the government should either announce a financial relief package to support gym operators or allow them to run their business at 50 per cent capacity. “The government’s intention is appreciable, but there is no point in shutting down businesses citing Covid, that too at a time when gym operators are in the recovery phase,” the association stated. “People use gyms to improve fitness and immunity. So, it is ironic that the government wants such spaces to be shut down,” said AV Ravi, the association president.  Ravi pointed out that the lockdown has already led to the closure of over 2,000 gyms across Karnataka.  “About 7,500 gymnasiums are staring at permanent shutdown,” he said. It is estimated that 1.5 lakh people, including trainers and other staff, are employed in the fitness industry.  “Many lost their jobs during the initial lockdown. The latest move would push several others to the verge of losing jobs,” Ravi added. Owners, who have been struggling to bring their fitness business back on track, are facing the wrath of customers ever since the government ordered the gyms to be shut. “Many of them who enrolled a week or two weeks ago are demanding their money back,” said Ravi. He clarified that the association was not against the government’s decision to curb the spread. “When restaurants and movie theatres run with 50 per cent attendance, why cannot gyms operate the same way,” he asked. Gymnasiums in Karnataka rake in revenue of about Rs 20 crore.  “We pay taxes to the government. No relief was provided when the lockdown was announced. Many wound up their businesses since they were not able to pay rent and staff salaries,” said Harish S, operations manager of Addict Fitness in Banashankari. Bharath Balasubramanya, secretary of the fitness owners’ association, said that gymnasiums were strictly adhering to Covid protocols mandated by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-give-relief-or-keep-us-open-say-gyms/articleshow/81893543.cms||Kiran Parashar

Of these 1,554 schools across the state, 1,418 are Model Sanskriti Primary Schools while 136 are Model Sanskriti Senior Secondary Schools. And 85 of these schools are in Gurgaon, in which the CBSE curriculum will be taught. All the 1,418 Model Sanskriti Primary Schools will follow the ‘bag free’ concept, where the schools will provide lockers and other infrastructure so that children don’t have to carry it on their shoulders every day from classroom to home and back, an official said. On the other hand, Model Sanskriti Senior Secondary Schools will have a separate section for students wanting to study in English. In all these schools, 30% of the seats have been reserved for children from the economically poor families. Admission forms can be submitted to the school authorities by April 10, officials said. In these schools, there will be 30 students from classes I to V, 35 students from classes VI to VIII and 40 students in classes IX and XI. Of these seats, 50% will be for students already studying in the school and wanting to migrate to English medium instead of Hindi, while the remaining 50% seats will be filled with children from other English medium schools. Last week, the Haryana government ruled out the possibility of closing down schools in the wake of rising cases of Covid-19 in the state. “The situation is very much under control and schools have been told to ensure strict adherence of SOPs for exams. We have plans to start the new academic session after April 10,” said a senior official. A nominal fee will be charged for the upkeep of these schools. Students from classes I to V will have to pay a one-time admission fee of Rs 500, which will increase to Rs 1,000 for the senior classes up to XII. The monthly fees will be Rs 200 (classes I to III), Rs 250 for classes IV and V, Rs 300 for classes VI to VIII, Rs 400 for classes IX and X, and Rs 500 for XI and XII.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/admissions-are-on-in-bag-free-model-schools/articleshow/81891485.cms||Shahnawaz Alam

Here is a look at what we know so far. Massive operation launched on Friday On Friday night, seperate joint teams of security forces, comprising over 2,000 personnels, launched a major anti-maoists operation from Bijapur and Sukma districts in the South Bastar forests, considered as the Maoist stronghold. Personnel belonging to the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), its elite unit CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action), the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and the Special Task Force (STF) were involved in the operation launched from five places - Tarrem, Usoor and Pamed (in Bijapur), and Minpa and Narsapuram (in Sukma). Patrolling party ambushed 500 km from Raipur When the patrolling team that was dispatched from Tarrem was advancing through a forest near Jonaguda, located around 500 km from the state capital Raipur, it was ambushed by cadres of the PLGA (Peoples' Liberation Guerilla Army) battalion of Maoists, leading to the gun-battle, reported PTI. According to initial reports, five security personnel were reported as killed and 30 others received injuries in the gunfight. Several other security personnel were reported to be missing. A senior police officer from Bastar said "chances of survival of missing jawans are slim, but we are hopeful of finding them alive". Maoists have reportedly suffered a huge loss in the gunfight, but the body of only one woman maoists could be recovered from the spot amid the heavy exchange of fire.

The chief minister as well as power minister M M Mani had earlier said the government had not made any agreements with Adani Group in the power sector. Chennithala termed the statements as blatant lies. The agreement (with the Solar Energy Corporation of India, that he cited on Friday) itself says that the government guarantee for the deal’s completion should be ensured, he said. “It is after ensuring it that KSEB went ahead with the agreement. There is a provision that if KSEB is unable to use renewable energy as fixed by the regulatory commission, it can purchase a renewable energy certificate for the equivalent unit. It is by ignoring this provision that KSEB went ahead with power purchase from Adani Group,” Chennithala said. He said as per the figures of the state electricity regulatory commission, the state is considered as a power-surplus state for the last five years. In 2021-22, KSEB will have 811 million units of power. Under these circumstances, the government should answer why it chose to purchase power from Adani Group. The chief minister is directly involved in the deal, Chennithala said. Responding to the reaction of the chief minister and the power minister, Chennithala said their comments were on the expected lines. “The power minister said KSEB has not made any agreement with Adani Group. But there is another direct agreement between KSEB and Adani Group for the purchase of power. The director board that met on February 15 this year, decided to purchase power directly from Adani Group for the April and May months,” he said. He said the larger question is while power from small scale hydropower projects and solar projects is available at Re One per unit and Rs 2 per unit, respectively, why did the government choose to purchase power from Adani Group at the rate of Rs 2.83 per unit, offering a profit of approximately Rs 1,000 crore to the corporate. Solar Energy Corporation of India is only an intermediary that charges a commission, between KSEB and Adani Group, he added. Chennithala had earlier cited the Thiruvananthapuram airport bidding row to allege that the government has been taking a stand in favour of the Adani Group. He had said that while the government openly criticized the Central government move to hand over the airport to Adani Group, it covertly helped the group in the bidding for the airport. Asked about the allegations raised by Chennithala regarding power purchase agreements with Adani, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in Kozhikode on Saturday that something serious has happened to the opposition leader and it is unbecoming for his post to level false allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/why-is-power-rich-kerala-buying-units-from-adani/articleshow/81893576.cms||---

The notices were issued after a detailed survey carried by the department, in which it found that several owners have made changes and carried out additional construction after getting occupation certificate (OC) from DTCP. Unauthorised construction after getting OC has emerged as a major challenge for the department in private developer colonies. The district town planner (DTP) of the enforcement wing, RS Batth, issued 100 notices for gross violations of building plans and OCs on Saturday. The department had received several complaints and recently carried out a detailed survey of the area. “We have issued notices due to violation after OC. The plot owners have been given seven days’ time to reply. Thereafter, we will initiate action,” DTP Batth said, adding that people need to follow the rules and refrain from making unauthorised and illegal construction. In February, the department had directed DLF to disconnect water and sewer connections of buildings with illegal construction. The developer was also directed to coordinate with the electricity department to disconnect power connections. The directions were issued after the department during a survey found that multi-storey buildings have been constructed on small plots allotted under economically weaker section (EWS) category in violation of norms in DLF areas along Golf Course Road. Meanwhile, the department also issued notices to four illegal guesthouses in Uppal Southend. “After receiving a complaint on the CM Window, a site inspection was carried out. It was found that guesthouses have been constructed illegally,” Batth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/100-dlf-5-buildings-under-government-scanner/articleshow/81890965.cms||Bagish Jha

The official of the department of town and country planning (DTCP), who had given OC to the building, will likely face departmental inquiry and action, officials said. The house was constructed over a plot of 150 square yards. However, officials said that the basement has been extended over another 100 square yards on a plot of land that belongs to the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG). The plot was purchased in a re-sale in the name of Shabnam, wife of district horticulture officer (DHO) Deen Mohammad, in 2016. The construction started on the plot in 2017 after getting approval of the building plan from the DTCP. The building got the OC in December 2018. The OC mentioned a basement of 52.028sqm. Ravinder Yadav, a resident of DLF Phase-1, said he filed complaints with the DTP(E) and DTP (P) in 2019 as well. “This one-of-a-kind case where everything is fine on the surface, but the encroachment is underground,” he said. On March 15, Yadav filed a complaint on the CM Window against the DTCP officials for not taking action. On Friday, senior town planner (STP) Sanjeev Man conducted a hearing on the complaint filed by Yadav. The STP directed the DTP (Enforcement) to take the necessary action as per the law against the unauthorised construction, if any, raised after obtaining the occupation certificate. “DTP (P) was directed to check the site within a week and withdraw the OC, if not found in order. Along with this, necessary disciplinary action may also be initiated against a field official,,” said STP. DTP (P) was also asked to write to the MCG commissioner for removal of encroachment from MCG land if found at the site. Deen Mohammad, district horticulture officer (DHO), said the house was constructed as per the law. “The complainant is my neighbour who has filed the complaint with a personal vendetta,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/encroached-mcg-land-extended-basement-government-official-on-radar/articleshow/81890995.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Gurgaon||Illegal hoardings: Mayor orders inquiry||Gurgaon: Mayor Madhu Azad on Saturday ordered an inquiry on unauthorised unipole hoardings erected in several areas of the city. The move comes after a councillor alleged that the business of unauthorised advertisements are flourishing because the MCG officials are not taking any action against them. The mayor has ordered the joint commissioner-headquarters to submit a report on the matter by April 5. “There are two aspects here - one is unauthorised unipoles and another is these advertisers not giving charges to the MCG. There are some advertisers, who have been given permission to instal small ads but they are flouting the rules. I had raised the issue and submitted a memorandum to the city mayor and MCG commissioner for them to take action,” said Dharmbir, councillor of ward number 21. The mayor said: “It is one of the important sources of income for the corporation. The revenue collection from advertisement has been less in the last one year. There will be strict action taken against the illegal unipoles erected in the city and if we find any unauthorised illegal advertisers working, the official concerned will be held responsible and action will be taken as per law,” said Azad. When asked about the areas where the unauthorised unipoles are put up, the councillor said they are spread across the city. “I am going to conduct a survey at my level. Along with my team, I will go to all these sites and check the unauthorised unipoles so that we don’t have to be dependent on officials to carry out the survey,” added the councillor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/illegal-hoardings-mayor-orders-inquiry/articleshow/81891006.cms||---

Officials said beneficiaries without comorbidities are coming out in large numbers and are getting vaccinated. The health department targeted 3,300 beneficiaries of all categories on Saturday. Dr Meenu Sassan, district immunisation officer (DIO), said on the first day of the vaccination i.e. on April 1 for people between 45 years and 59 years, a total of 1,651 persons came forward for the jabs. On Friday, 1,476 persons received the first shots, while on Saturday, 1,660 took the vaccination, taking the total to 4,787. Those above 60 years of age have also started coming out in large numbers. On Thursday, 1,031 received the first dose. The numbers doubled on Friday as 1,880 received the vaccination. While on Saturday, 798 received the shots, taking the total number to 3,709 in three days. Dr Sassan said earlier people with comorbidities were afraid of getting the vaccination, but awareness in this regard was done through various modes and more people are coming to the health centres. “Out of the total beneficiaries coming to our health centre, 90% are aged between 45 years and 59 years of age. The more people will get vaccinated, the sooner are the chances of getting over with the Covid-19,” said Dr Sassan. The recovery rate of Panchkula has fallen down to 90.99% from 97.48%, which was reported on March 1 when 87 active cases were reported. On February1, the recovery rate of Panchkula was 97.77% with only 87 active cases while on January 1, it was 96.61%.

---||Gurgaon||As we evolve, should brands find newer ways to form connections?||By Chandana Agarwal In the long weekend that went past, I was going through some ads and came across the 2011 Jeep commercial. It said, “It’s the things that we make that make us.” It talks of the fact that America is built by people who make things and that’s what being American is about — it is about building things. It got me thinking of this notion in the larger context, specifically, in the way we interface with the new global world. This can’t be any truer than in the case of advancing technology and science and the “progress” we make. Let’s take a step back and look at the progress of technology that helps us connect and our self-perception and the lens through which we view the world. In the oral tradition, before the printing press was invented, it was a given that our opinions were closely linked to us, they defined who we were and how we were seen. With the invention of the printing press, it became possible to write our views under a pseudonym and express a view that was not in keeping with our public image. We could have a revolutionary view or an anti-religious view and stay dis-associated with it in the public domain. Now, in the age of social media, it is possible to create a public profile that is completely divergent to the one that people think of us to be. If technology is merely an extension of our senses, telescope being the extension of our eyes and a phone being the extension of our ears and voice, then internet is an extension of our entire sensory system. Since we perceive the world through our senses, technology impacts not just our response to the world but even how we perceive and process it. For instance, in the written tradition, the narrative is linear and sequential. May be that’s what shaped our views about time and life in that era. We believed there is a progression to things — we believed in causality, we believed everything leads to something else and that journey was important for the story of our lives to unravel itself. Now, if we look at the present times, where social media is the currency, it is possible to edit a status of the past, or even delete it from our timeline. We can manage who can comment on our lives. We can have multiple versions of ourselves. I think that for the generation born into it, their views of life would be influenced by the way social media operates. It is okay to do your graduation in one subject and choose a career path quite divergent, akin to updating a status. Nothing in life is absolute, everything is editable and it is possible to make everything prettier by using a filter. Nothing is sacrosanct. This lack of a sense of the absolute is what makes it difficult for a lot of us to relate to Generation Z. This is the first generation that is pure digital native. Is it surprising then that they are expected to be the people who will eclipse all other generations in embracing diversity and inclusion? The digital world allows you to communicate by texting or by voice command and everything else can be hidden, your gender, race, ethnicity, caste etc. It is easy to hide or change all the things that defined your access in the offline world. Connections between people are influenced by common group memberships based on interests and ideologies rather than the social clubs their parents belong to. Your self-view is possibly more important than how the world views you, because that is what you project. The world only knows you from your timeline. Do brands in this scenario have to find newer ways of forming connections, of building relationships? In order to be loved and respected, brands have to start thinking about taking a stand with regard to causes to be identified with and adopted. It is time that Benetton and Dove are no longer the exceptions in this space. Today, what one stands for is as important as what one does. This is true for people and brands. For instance, an organisation’s reputation is not just dependent on the quality of products it makes but also how it treats its employees. There are many clients and agency brands that won hearts by paying back the salary cuts made during the pandemic. I doubt that the makers of technology consciously think of these unintentional consequences of what they make, just like the makers of advertising often are ambivalent about the impact of the ads that they create. The debate on whether the ads should merely portray the reality of our culture or should they be a medium of change has been on. Does a brand really have to leverage that aspect of our ugly truth to sell some more of what it is selling? Let us not forget that as people in advertising, it is the ads that we make that make us the agency brands that we are.

---||Bhopal||Bhopal techie shot dead in US, hate crime suspected||BHOPAL: Sharif Rahman Khan, a 32-year-old software engineer from Bhopal, was shot dead in the US last Wednesday by a local resident who allegedly had a “romantic fixation” with a girl who was Sharif ’s friend, say local media reports. A section of the media had raised concerns that it was a ‘hate crime’. Sharif ’s family has expressed deep reservations about these media reports. “My younger brother has been shot dead in St. Louis (Missouri). That’s all I know. I had called the University City police for details, but they refused to share any information unless I showed up there. They say it’s their SOP. None of Sharif’s colleagues have told us anything close to what’s being reported in the media,” Sharif’s elder brother Mukeem told TOI. Sharif ’s mother and brother live in Bhopal’s Subash Nagar area. They have decided to have his last rites performed in the US considering the Covid-19 situation in both countries. Indian diplomats in Chicago have assured all possible help and tweeted: “The consulate team is in contact with HR head of the company Birlasoft for which he was working, and will ensure expeditious requisite assistance.” The techie was found with gunshot injuries on Wednesday at the University City apartment, where the girl lives, and died during treatment at a hospital. University City police arrested a 23-year-old suspect named Cole J Miller from a bar on South Big Bend Boulevard in Maplewood and charged him with murder, armed criminal action and receiving stolen property, say US media reports. A .380 Ruger LCP pistol — reported missing / stolen — was found in his truck. “Miller had ‘expressed a romantic fixation’ with Sharif ’s friend and the two men apparently argued before Miller opened fire,” says a report published by St Louis Post-Dispatch. Two .380-caliber shell casings and a cellphone belonging to Miller were found on the crime scene. Local media have reported about two witnesses — one who heard shouting on Wednesday afternoon and another who saw Sharif and a man involved in an altercation. “Sharif threw a punch, one witness said, and then there was gunfire,” said a media report. University city police reportedly told local media there that the girl had some issues with a suspect whom she knew as ‘John Mills’. She shared a phone number with investigators, who found that police had received a call from that number on Monday to report that the girl had been ‘kidnapped’. According to American media reports, Miller has told police that she had gone to the apartment because he believed she was being trafficked. “Miller said he had argued with a man, who knocked the cellphone out of his hands, and he shot him three times during a struggle. Miller identified the cellphone recovered from the scene as his,” St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Police also told local media that Miller poses a danger to Sharif ’s friend because he has a “romantic fixation” with her and knows her schedule. Investigations have also revealed that Miller was facing trials for two gun-related cases in St Louis County besides a pending case of domestic assault and harassment in St. Louis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-techie-shot-dead-in-us/articleshow/81893619.cms||P Naveen
---||Chandigarh||HC senate poll ruling weakens the moral authority of Panjab University VC||By: Rajesh Kochhar The Punjab and Haryana high court has ordered Panjab University to conduct senate elections within two months. Senate is the supreme authority of the university. It comprises chancellor, vicechancellor, exofficio fellows, and ordinary fellows, with the vice-chancellor as the principal executive and academic officer. It is constituted every four years. The term of the latest senate ended in October 2020. Process for holding elections was initiated in August 2020 but abandoned on the grounds of Covid-19. The high court rejected the Covid excuse, pointing out that elections to state assemblies and local bodies have been conducted. The court noted with dismay that the university ‘is being run as a one-man show’, and that the indefinite postponement of senate elections was a pretext for the vicechancellor to usurp the powers of the senate. The court quoted the 18th century English writer Charles Caleb Colton to point out that ‘No man is wise enough, nor good enough, to be trusted with unlimited power.’ When the court specifically asked if tangible consent of the chancellor had been obtained for postponement, ‘the counsel was clearly at loss of words’. And yet there is evidence to show that there has been some coordination between the chancellor and vicechancellor. If Covid has been the excuse for the non-constitution of new senate, National Education Policy is the pretext for dispensing with it altogether. On November 10, 2020, the University Grants Commission (UGC) asked Panjab University to initiate action for governance reforms in the light of the National Education Policy, 2020. Quoting it, the chancellor, on February 8, 2021, constituted a high level committee of experts to examine various facets of the existing governance structure of Panjab University and recommend the way forward. Most members are either ex-officio or holders of paid positions. Significantly, the counsel for the university in the case before the court is chancellor’s nominee on the committee. The notice announcing the formation of the committee makes it clear that it cannot recommend maintenance of status-quo. Ominously, the notice mentions that the present procedure of constituting the senate is cost-intensive. Money spent on strengthening democratic institutions is a very sound investment. If this logic is extended further, elections to Parliament and state assemblies should also be dispensed with. NEP is merely a proposal at the moment. It cannot be the basis either for UGC or the chancellor to try to carry things forward in accordance with its proposals. As the court notes, ‘it would be too preposterous for the court to hold’ that till the new education policy is implemented, provisions of the Act and the regulations governing the university ‘have to be put in coldfreezer’. Each institution has its own history and traditions which give it stability and strength. Panjab University is the first university in the subcontinent to be named after a province rather than a city. Unlike the preceding (four) universities, its establishment involved kings, landed gentry, and chieftains. There is a general erroneous tendency to equate Panjab University with its Chandigarh campus. Even if the campus was closed down, the university would still exist. Panjab University regulates and oversees a large number of colleges in Punjab and Chandigarh. Maintenance of reasonably high standards of college education in the region is due to the traditions established by Panjab University. About 15% of all members of the senate are elected from registered graduates’ constituency. This provision has been much commented upon. It needs to be pointed out that it brings independent voices into the senate. In the 1960s, a conspicuous member of the senate was Lok Sabha speaker Gurdial Singh Dhillon. Given his personal stature and high office, he had a sobering influence on all. Panjab University is the only university in the country which has no bureaucratic control. Neither central education ministry nor state government has any role in it. A high functionary like the vice-president discharges the functions of chancellor in his personal capacity. A total of 40% of senate members are nominated by the chancellor. If these nominees were carefully chosen, level of senate will be enhanced. It is important to choose people who would regularly attend meetings and contribute to debates, and participate in the nitty gritty. In the light of the high court observations, the position of the governance committee has become untenable. It should be wound up. In fact, it should not have been formed in the first place. No change in the rules and regulations of Panjab University can take place without Punjab government being party to the changes. When the new senate is constituted, the chancellor should preside over it and initiate debate on the needed reforms The high court judgment has weakened the moral authority of the vice-chancellor. Executive authority cannot be exercised if it is not accompanied by moral authority. These questions need to be immediately addressed at the level of vice-chancellor and chancellor.

The tails of two soft toys had been tied together and were wrapped around his neck. Police have investigated the room with forensic experts and are waiting for the post-mortem report to ascertain cause of death. Investigation officer SI Ravindra Chokle said the victim, Arjun Valmiki, hailed from Shivpuri but had been living with his uncle Deepak and aunt in Bhopal where he studied. His uncle and aunt work with private firms and were away on Friday, leaving behind their kids, aged two and three, with Arjun. They had left home around 8.30am, as usual, and the three kids were playing. Around 10am, a neighbour’s 12-year-old daughter went to play with Arjun and found him lying unconscious, say police. She called Deepak, who rushed home. Deepak has told police that when he went into the room, he saw Arjun lying still with the tails of two toy tigers tied and wrapped around his neck, said SI Chokle. He took the boy to JP Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. The hospital alerted police, who went to Deepak’s home and began investigations. Arjun’s father Ashok was informed and he arrived from Shivpuri on Saturday after which the autopsy was conducted. SI Chokle said the tails of the stuffed toys were 2 feet and 1 foot long. Police believe the autopsy report will help solve the mystery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-boy-found-dead-with-soft-toys-wrapped-around-neck/articleshow/81893631.cms||---

In the letter, they sought the intervention of the PM in the ongoing insolvency resolution process of the Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL) and demanded that the two resolution applicants — NBCC and Suraksha — should provide “unconditional bids” so that they easily pass the “legal scrutiny of the committee of creditors”. The buyers have requested that if the companies face a shortage of start-up funds to complete the pending flats, the government should help them. They said that the FIRs registered against the builder should be investigated first. Pramod Kumar, a buyer said, “We are hopeful that we will get some response from the government. We are ready to launch a series of protests if the flats are not completed. We want our flats now no matter who builds them.” JIL is facing insolvency proceedings since 2017 for non-payment of corporate debt. It is yet to deliver around 17,000 flats at its Wish Town project. According to the NBCC, of the 30,000 flats in Wish Town, 17,756 are yet to be completed. Of the pending flats, 656 are in Aman, 2,945 in Garden Isles, 1,871 in Kasa Isles, Kensington Boulevard has 3,372, Klassic 1,371, 2,585 flats in Krescent Homes, 2,548 in Kosmos, 1,103 in Orchards and so on. On March 24, the Supreme Court had ordered the NCLT-appointed resolution professional of Jaypee Wish Town to resume the resolution process and conclude the same within 45 days. Two resolution applicants — NBCC and Suraksha — have been allowed to participate in the current bidding process. The court had given them two weeks to submit their plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/wish-town-homebuyers-at-pmo-door-over-flats-delay/articleshow/81891072.cms||---
---||Noida||Okhla Barrage road will be repaired, to get lights too||Noida: The UP irrigation department has decided to repair the Okhla Barrage road that connects Kalindi Kunj with the city and install lights on the stretch. Officials said the irrigation department had set aside a fund of Rs 12 crore for maintaining the barrage. Of the total amount, nearly Rs 6.2 crore would be utilised for repairing the road as well as replacing the defunct lights. The officials said the entire approach road from the Kalindi Kunj turn to the Okhla Bird Sanctuary — nearly a 1km stretch — would be overhauled. Since the stretch is maintained by the irrigation department, repeated complaints lodged by the residents were being directed to it by the Noida Authority and the public works department, which oversee all the other major roads of the city. Ramesh Chandra, the chief engineer of the department (Yamuna), said tenders for the road repair work would be floated soon. “We have got the permission to undertake repair work at the Okhla Barrage road. Lights will also be installed along the road besides other civil work for the maintenance of the bridge,” he added. The irrigation department had in September last year written to the headquarters in Lucknow, seeking permission to begin repairs. The approval from the government came on March 30. While heading to Shaheen Bagh, Delhi or Faridabad, commuters have to pass through the Kalindi Kunj bridge, which is a smooth ride. But on the way back to the city, vehicles have to take the Okhla Barrage road, which is riddled with potholes. “My parents stay in Delhi’s Kalkaji and I have to visit them every week. The ride back home is extremely bumpy. A number of potholes and cracks have developed over the barrage. It seems the stretch has been lying in disrepair for years,” said Seema Jaiswal, a resident of Sector 77 in Noida. PK Srivastava, the district forest officer, said, “A number of visitors coming to the bird sanctuary have complained about the poor condition of the road and the absence of streetlights. We had taken up the issue with the officials of the department during our routine meetings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/okhla-barrage-road-will-be-repaired-to-get-lights-too/articleshow/81891101.cms||Shalabh
