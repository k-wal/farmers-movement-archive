The reason, is because the second wave of COVID-19 has increased the number of covid cases. The Hop-on Hop-Off double decker, which was operated on a temporary basis during Dasara, has been introduced on a full time basis. Speaking to us, chairperson of Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation, actress-turned-politician Shruthi says, “Due to the sudden spike in covid cases, the occupancy rate is low. Some of the people who have boarded the bus have shared positive reviews. We have also asked to run the bus in vicinities of Mysuru so that at least people will get to know that such facilities are available for tourists.” On condition of anonymity, a person associated with KSTDC says, “The bus was opened for tourists officially from April 10. Despite holidays and weekends, we did not get the desired response from the people.”  A tour operator, Sachin Kumar says, “When the bus was launched, the number of covid cases were very less. But the cases have shot up by manifold now. I think the timing of the launch was wrong. During peak summer season no one likes to travel in an open bus. Having said that, the second wave is another big blow for the tourism sector as the number of tourists visiting has reduced drastically due to curbs imposed in Maharashtra and other states.” The bus, which has seating capacity of 40, ferries tourists to prominent heritage structures and tourism destinations like Deputy Commissioner’s building, Crawford Hall, Kukkarahalli Lake, Karanji Lake, University of Mysore, Folklore Museum, Palace and Zoo. The ticket price per person is `250.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/no-takers-for-hop-on-hop-off-double-decker-bus-in-mysuru/articleshow/82163484.cms||Vinay Lokesh

The company's Jamnagar refineries in Gujarat initially produced 100 tonnes of medical-grade oxygen, which has quickly been ramped up to over 700 tonnes, people aware of the matter said. The supplies being made to states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh will provide relief to over 70,000 critically ill patients everyday. The company plans to raise medical-grade oxygen production capacity to 1,000 tonnes, sources said, without giving a timeline. An e-mail sent to the company for comments remained unanswered. Medical-grade oxygen is not a product that was produced at the Jamnagar refineries, which convert crude oil into products such as diesel, petrol and jet fuel. But with demand for oxygen rising due to a rapid surge in coronavirus cases, Reliance has installed equipment and set up processes to produce and supply medical-grade oxygen. Sources said industrial oxygen is being diverted to produce medical-grade oxygen. "Every day nearly 700 tonnes of oxygen is being supplied to states across India. This will provide relief to over 70,000 critically ill patients daily," one of the persons said. The entire supply of oxygen, including transportation in special tankers at minus 183 degrees Celsius is made at no cost to the state governments, sources said, adding this was a part of the company's CSR initiative. State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) too have begun diverting oxygen produced at their refineries to supplement the availability of medical oxygen in states worst hit by COVID-19. IOC on Monday said it has "begun the supply of 150 tonnes of oxygen at no cost to various hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab." Separately, BPCL said it has started supply of 100 tonnes of oxygen at no cost. Oil refineries can produce limited volumes of industrial oxygen in air-separation plants meant for nitrogen production. Scrubbing out other gases such as carbon dioxide can convert it into medical-use oxygen with 99.9 per cent purity. Dhanraj Nathwani, Vice President, Gujarat Cricket Association and a close associate of the promoters of Reliance, in a tweet on Tuesday said: "400 tons of #oxygen is being supplied to #Gujarat by the Reliance Jamnagar, on a daily basis. This shows our commitment for Gujarat." His father and Rajya Sabha MP Parimal Nathwani tweeted: "RIL has always been on the forefront in supporting the nation in times like these. Oxygen produced at our Jamnagar refinery is supplied to many states. We've been supplying oxygen in Gujarat on daily basis. Being a Gujarati company, our commitment towards Guj is unquestionable." Senior Nathwani is Director-Corporate Affairs at Reliance. Reliance operates the world's largest oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat. Sources said the supply of medical-grade oxygen is another initiative of Reliance Industries and Reliance Foundation to provide relief in the ongoing pandemic. Reliance Foundation set up the country's first COVID hospital in Mumbai in collaboration with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The 100-bed hospital was set up in just two weeks, which was soon scaled up to 250 beds. Reliance also built a fully-equipped isolation facility in Lodhivali, Maharashtra and handed it over to the district authorities. Besides, Reliance Foundation supported the setting up of a quarantine ward for suspected patients at Spandan Holistic Mother-And-Child Care Hospital in Mumbai. It also supported digital and medical infrastructure at Sardar Patel COVID-19 Care Centre, Delhi. In addition, Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital set up an exclusive 10 bedded dialysis centre in HBT Trauma Hospital, Mumbai in collaboration with BMC. Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital was the first institute in Maharashtra identified by ICMR to be part of a multi-centre clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of plasma therapy. Reliance also produces 1,00,000 PPE and face masks per day for India's health and frontline workers. To keep the emergency services uninterrupted during the nationwide lockdown last year, Reliance provided over 5.5 lakh litres of free fuel, supporting over 14,000 ambulances across 249 districts in 18 states. Reliance Life Sciences is providing test kits and consumables for effective testing, helping enhance India's testing capacity. To support marginalised and under-resourced communities during the lockdown, Reliance Foundation launched Mission Anna Seva, the largest meal distribution programme undertaken by a corporate foundation anywhere in the world. Mission Anna Seva has provided over 5.5 crore meals across 80+ districts, 18 states and 1 Union Territory. Reliance also donated Rs 556 crore to various relief funds, including the PM-CARES Fund. In addition, Reliance Foundation launched Mission Covid Suraksha, a mask distribution program, to reinforce the message of preventing the spread of coronavirus by wearing a mask. Reliance Foundation has distributed over 67 lakh masks to frontline workers and vulnerable communities across 21 States and 2 Union Territories, sources said. The group's retail arm Reliance Retail is ensuring availability of essentials through all 736 grocery stores. Along with home delivery services for senior citizens, takeaway orders from the stores have also been facilitated so that the consumers and staff are not exposed. Telecom venture Jio has been providing uninterrupted and reliable digital connectivity to over 40 crore individuals and thousands of organisations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/reliance-increases-supply-of-oxygen-to-over-700-tonnes-a-day-to-covid-hit-states/articleshow/82168279.cms||---

According to a government spokesperson, the night curfew has been extended to all municipal and urban local body limits of all 20 districts as a precautionary measure. “It was already in force in eight districts earlier from 10 pm to 6 am. Only 50% of shops in markets/malls within the municipal limits/urban local body limits will be open on an alternate basis through a rotation system,” an official said. Public transport will also be permitted to ply only at 50% of its authorized seating capacity. The district magistrates of all districts across J&K have been asked to devise a mechanism to implement the measures in consultation with local market associations. The official Twitter handler of lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha mentioned: New Covid control measures, including corona curfew at night, to be extended to all municipal/urban local body limits of all 20 districts of Jammu & Kashmir. Night curfew was already in force since April 9 in the municipal areas of Jammu, Udhampur, Kathua, Srinagar, Baramulla, Budgam, Anantnag, and Kupwara districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-surge-jk-extends-night-curfew-to-all-urban-areas/articleshow/82168766.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Covid-19: Indian students in turmoil after India added to UK's red travel ban list||LONDON: Indian students enrolled at British universities who have been studying remotely in India for months and were planning to return for the summer term now that the pandemic is under control in Britain woke up Tuesday to discover they will face huge costs and may struggle to even get a flight after India was added to the UK’s red list of travel ban countries. On Monday, UK health secretary Matt Hancock said the UK government had taken the "difficult but vital decision" to add India to the list after detecting 103 cases of the so-called Indian variant in the UK. From 4 am on Friday, UK/Irish citizens and residents who have been in India will have to quarantine in a government hotel for 10 days at a cost of £1,750 each (Rs 1.8 lakh), while others will be refused admittance. This has led to flight prices shooting up and a dearth of available seats. Yajvin Sharma (21), in his final year of an economics and finance BA (Hons) at Manchester University, went back to Delhi in March 2020 as his parents were worried about rising Covid cases in the UK. He has studied online in Delhi since then despite paying £22,000 per year for tuition fees and £7,000 for student accommodation. "Now the UK is better I was getting ready to come back," he said. "I want to see my friends and have a real-life experience in my final term. But I can’t come back unless India gets moved off the red list as paying £2,000 for hotel quarantine doesn’t make sense. I will be very upset if I finish my course online as I paid so much money for this," he said. "…I wish they could reduce the quarantine fees for students or offer students something else." Read AlsoUK adds India to travel red list amid surge in Covid casesThe United Kingdom on Monday added India to its travel 'red list' amid an unrelenting surge in coronavirus cases in the country. The decision comes after Britain detected 103 cases of a coronavirus variant first identified in India. All arrivals from India have been banned. The UK and IrishSanam Arora, chairperson of the National Indian Students and Alumni Union (NISAU) UK, has been flooded with queries. "A lot of students studying remotely from India were planning on coming back in April and May as they need to be here by June 21 to be eligible to apply to the graduate route, which allows them to work for two years. The Rs 2 lakh cost of a quarantine hotel is too expensive for them. Most have been in India since their courses started last autumn and wanted to spend at least the final semester in Britain to get a physical experience. Now even those who are commencing courses in May do not even know if they will be allowed in," she said. Stavan Desai (43), from Baroda, who is reading a one-year MSc in international social and public policy at LSE in London, has not gone back to India but is left worried about family and friends back home. "A lot of students like me have family and friends in India who have caught Covid and our thoughts keep going back to them and it is difficult to concentrate on our studies …The red list makes me more concerned as even if God forbid something happens that may require my presence in India, I wouldn’t be able to go as I would not be able to pay £2,000 to come back. And now my wife and daughter can’t come and visit me," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/covid-19-indian-students-in-turmoil-after-india-added-to-uks-red-travel-ban-list/articleshow/82168832.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Unlike in the previous years, one bidder, whose domicile should be the J&K, could bid for one location only, as per the policy, the official said. Incidentally, only four bidders submitted their bids for four locations in Kashmir Valley, “owing to religious as well social barriers”, he added. Excise officials said the invitation to the auction process received a “huge response”, which indicates the high demand in the local market, as tourism remains battered by the Covid pandemic. “Two bidders quoted more than Rs 3 crores and four above Rs 2 crores, while 34 participants have pledged to shell out more than a crore in licence fee,” they said. More than 20 existing licensees retained their vends being highest bidders for the locations. Notably, J&K has previously been earning Rs 1,300 crores annually from liquor licence auctions. The wine business was largely affected in Kashmir Valley with advent of militancy in 1990 when several terror outfits including Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) and outlawed Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) banned the sale and supply of the liquor on religious grounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/from-rs-10cr-jks-earnings-from-liquor-licence-auction-jumps-to-rs-140cr/articleshow/82169109.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||Covid-19: Save the country from lockdown, use as last resort, PM Narendra Modi tells states||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said current strategies to contain the rapid resurgence in Covid-19 infections were aimed at ensuring least loss of lives and livelihoods and appealed to states to resort to lockdowns only as the very last resort. Addressing the nation, the PM said he would appeal to states to consider micro-containment zones rather than lockdowns. "In today's situation, we have to save the country from lockdowns," he said. The comments assume significance in the wake of Delhi being placed under lockdown for a week and reports that Maharashtra was considering similar measures. The possibility of a lockdown imperilling a nascent economic recovery seemed to weigh heavy on the PM who said state governments should work to assure migrant workers that there was no need to leave for their homes. "They should be asked to stay where they are and assured that they will be vaccinated and also continue to be employed," he said. The PM laid emphasis on efforts to improve the supply of oxygen at several levels with the measures including setting up new plants and making sure industrial-use oxygen was utilised for medical purposes. "This time, the corona crisis has meant that the demand for oxygen has risen in many parts of the country. The Centre, states and private sector are all working to ensure that everyone who needs oxygen gets it," he said. Read AlsoSecond Covid wave: Lockdown should be last resort, focus on micro-containment zones, says PM ModiNEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the second wave of Covid had hit the country like a storm but made it clear that imposing lockdown should be the last resort. The PM urged the states to focus on creating micro-containment zones and work together to save the country fromThe PM referred to Navratri and Ramzan, and said Ram Navami, which will be observed on Wednesday, reminds us of the need to remember our limits (maryada) and Ramzan is about self-discipline and restraint. "Covid discipline should be followed completely," he said. Modi expressed condolences and sympathy for those who had lost loved ones to the fresh Covid surge, saying the country should not lose courage and hope in facing the challenge that only a few weeks ago seemed to be manageable. "We will take the steps that we need to take without losing courage. That is how we will win," he added. Referring to the decision to permit all above 18 to be vaccinated, Modi said this would help secure the workforce and lead to faster vaccinations. Referring to the decision and other measures such as states and hospitals being allowed to procure vaccines, he said the decisions would soon bring down the rising curve of infections. Urging people to follow Covid protocols carefully, the PM appealed to the younger population not to venture outdoors unless absolutely needed. "In your mohallas and apartments, please form small committees and help maintain discipline," he said. "The decision to make vaccination available to those above 18 is intended to ensure that the workforce in cities is able to access vaccines rapidly," he said, adding that the ongoing programme of vaccinating vulnerable groups would continue in government hospitals. The PM said leading figures in the pharma industry had stepped forward to increase production of medicines. "Beds are being increased and special and big Covid hospitals are being set up. We started work on vaccines early and scientists have developed the cheapest vaccines. The private sector has shown innovation and enterprise and we have speeded up approvals," he added. He said during the first wave, India lacked medical infrastructure and there were inadequate labs and PPE suits. "The country fought corona with determination, discipline and courage. I am sure that in cooperation with the public, we will be get the better of this storm," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-save-the-country-from-lockdown-use-as-last-resort-pm-narendra-modi-tells-states/articleshow/82169156.cms||---

There was high drama when Calangute were awarded a penalty by referee Mario Pereira after Melvin Lobo’s shot was handled by Salgaocar defender Linbert Rebello inside the danger zone. Kouame Junior converted the penalty but the referee overruled the goal and called for a retake as one Calangute player had his foot inside the box when the penalty was taken. Salgaocar objected and the referee then consulted with his assistant and changed his earlier decision of a retake. Instead, Salgaocar, who are in fray of the title along with Sporting Clube de Goa, were awarded a free-kick. The GFA admitted the referees blunder and president Churchill Alemao requested the teams to complete the game in “sporting spirit” in his letter on Friday. GFA planned to schedule the game on Monday, but Salgaocar replied only on Monday as their offices were closed on weekends. “As per your above letter for the abandoned match no. 61 to be replayed, please note that the match was not abandoned for force majeure or any other field related incident or weather or flooldlight failure, but was abandoned because the Calangute Association players refused to take the field of play and due to absolute inefficiency and incompetence of the match officials to take timely decisions. “Therefore, based on the above incidents/evidence, Salgaocar shall not replay the match as mentioned in your letter. Instead, as per the prevailing regulations and rules of the game, the match should be awarded in favour of SFC with three points and three goals,” Salgaocar general secretary Adlear D’Cruz wrote in his letter. In the final round that could decide the winners, Salgaocar face Sesa FA while Sporting take on Guardian Angel SC. Sporting are on 20 points while Salgaocar are two points behind and will have to wait for GFA’s final decision on their abandoned tie. The Pro League was curtailed last season due to the coronavirus pandemic with Churchill Brothers SC and Sporting Clube de Goa being declared joint winners. This season, with just a single leg being played, every point is crucial in the title race and battle to save relegation. In their letter, Salgaocar have pointed out how the match commissioner entered the field and was seen speaking on the phone. “The MC/RA had no right to enter the field of play at the 94th minute. On observing the recording and the behaviour of the MC on the field of play, we are of the firm belief that the MC influenced the referee’s decision, with external inputs and factors, as he is seen using the mobile phone and talking into it. “The MC should have given his report after the match or he should have informed the referee to abandon the match since the opponents refused to play during the regular 90 minutes,” said Adlear. The GFA now has to decide on the outcome of the match.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/salgaocar-seek-three-points-for-abandoned-game/articleshow/82169649.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

Derek Chauvin will learn whether he has been convicted when the decision is announced in a Minneapolis courtroom at 3:30 pm Central Time (2030 GMT), the court said. Chauvin, 45, was charged with murder and manslaughter for Floyd's May 25, 2020 death, which sparked protests against racial injustice around the world and is being seen as a landmark test of police accountability. The seven-woman five-man jury held four hours of deliberations on Monday evening at the end of a three-week trial and reconvened on Tuesday morning. Speaking to reporters ahead of the announcement that a verdict had been reached, President Joe Biden called for the "right" decision in the racially charged trial. The president stressed that he would not be speaking out if the jury had not been sequestered, meaning that it is isolated from the public until it reaches a decision. Chauvin was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes as the handcuffed 46-year-old Black man said repeatedly "I can't breathe," then died. US cities have been bracing for possible violence, depending on the verdict, and Minneapolis is under an unprecedented security lockdown. Biden told reporters he had spoken with the Floyd family by telephone and said "I can only imagine the pressure and anxiety they're feeling. So I waited till the jury was sequestered and I called." Read AlsoProsecutor: Derek Chauvin 'had to know' George Floyd's life was in dangerOfficer Derek Chauvin "had to know" he was squeezing the life out of George Floyd as the Black man cried out over and over that he couldn't breathe and finally fell silent, a prosecutor told jurors Monday as closing arguments began at Chauvin's murder trial."They're a good family and they're calling for peace and tranquility, no matter what that verdict is," Biden said. "I'm praying the verdict is the right verdict which is -- I think it's overwhelming in my view." Prosecutors and the defense presented closing arguments on Monday and Judge Peter Cahill sent the case to the jury. In his final instructions to the jury, the judge noted the gravity of the case, which comes amid heightened tensions fueled by other police killings. "You must not let bias, prejudice, passion, sympathy or public opinion influence your decision," Cahill said. "You must not consider any consequences or penalties that might follow from your verdict." A unanimous verdict is required for conviction on any of the charges -- second-degree murder, third-degree murder or manslaughter. Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis Police Department, faces a maximum of 40 years in prison if convicted of second-degree murder, the most serious charge. Three other former police officers involved in Floyd's deadly arrest -- he had allegedly just tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill in a store -- are to go on trial later this year. Amid fears of unrest, National Guard troops have been deployed in Minneapolis and Washington, the nation's capital. Minneapolis has been the scene of nightly protests since Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, was shot dead in a suburb of the Minnesota city on April 11 by a white policewoman. In Washington, the National Guard said some 250 troops were being deployed "to support local law enforcement" in response to potential demonstrations. Prosecutors, in closing arguments on Monday, showed excerpts from the harrowing bystander video of Floyd's death that was seen by millions around the world. "This case is exactly what you thought when you saw it first, when you saw that video," prosecutor Steve Schleicher told the jury. "You can believe your eyes," Schleicher said. "It's exactly what you knew, it's what you felt in your gut, it's what you now know in your heart." "This wasn't policing, this was murder," Schleicher said. "Nine minutes and 29 seconds of shocking abuse of authority."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/verdict-reached-in-george-floyd-murder-trial/articleshow/82169912.cms||---
---||World||Explainer: What are charges against Derek Chauvin in George Floyd's death?||MINNEAPOLIS: The 12 jurors who reached a verdict Tuesday in the case against Derek Chauvin had three counts to consider as they weighed whether he is responsible for the death of George Floyd. Chauvin is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He could be convicted on all of the charges, some or none. The decision was expected to be announced Tuesday afternoon.  The case comes down to two key questions - whether Chauvin caused Floyd's death and whether his actions were reasonable - and each charge requires a different element of proof as to Chauvin's state of mind.  Here's an explanation of the charges: How do the charges against Chauvin compare?  For all three charges, prosecutors had to prove that Chauvin caused Floyd's death and that his use of force was unreasonable.  Prosecutors didn't have to prove Chauvin's restraint was the sole cause of Floyd's death, but only that his conduct was a "substantial causal factor." Chauvin is authorized to use force as a police officer, as long as that force is reasonable.  To convict on any of these counts, jurors must find that Chauvin used a level of force that would be considered unreasonable to an objective officer in his position. Hindsight can't be a factor.  The charges differ when it comes to Chauvin's state of mind - with second-degree murder requiring some level of intent - not an intent to kill but that Chauvin intended to apply unlawful force to Floyd - all the way down to manslaughter, which requires proof of culpable negligence. What's second-degree unintentional murder? It's also called felony murder. To prove this count, prosecutors had to show that Chauvin killed Floyd while committing or trying to commit a felony - in this case, third-degree assault. They didn't have to prove Chauvin intended to kill Floyd, only that he intended to apply unlawful force that caused bodily harm.  Prosecutors called several medical experts who testified that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen because of the way he was restrained. A use of force expert said it was unreasonable to hold Floyd in the prone position for 9 minutes, 29 seconds, handcuffed and face-down on the pavement.  "No reasonable officer would have believed that that was an appropriate, acceptable or reasonable use of force," prosecution witness Seth Stoughton testified.  Defense attorney Eric Nelson tried to raise doubts about Floyd's cause of death - saying underlying heart issues and drug use were to blame. He also argued that Chauvin's actions were reasonable, saying Floyd was big, under the influence of something, could start fighting and that nearby bystanders presented a threat.  "It's easy to sit and judge ... an officer's conduct," defense witness Barry Brodd testified. "It's more of a challenge to, again, put yourself in the officer's shoes to try to make an evaluation through what they're feeling, what they're sensing, the fear they have, and then make a determination." What about third-degree murder? For this count, jurors must find Chauvin caused Floyd's death through an action that was "eminently dangerous" and carried out with a reckless disregard for and conscious indifference to the loss of life.  Mark Osler, a professor at University of St. Thomas School of Law, said prosecutors tried to prove the elements of this count through testimony about the dangers of subduing a handcuffed person in the prone position.  Dr. Martin Tobin, a lung and critical care specialist, testified for the prosecution that any healthy person subjected to this restraint would have died. Minneapolis Police Lt. Johnny Mercil, a use-of-force instructor, testified that officers are trained to "stay away from the neck when possible." Osler said Police Chief Medaria Arradondo was also effective in showing that Chauvin was not trained to use such a hold.  "They wanted to have a lot of evidence showing that what Chauvin did is not what he was trained to do and that the reason they don't train people to do that is because it's eminently dangerous," Osler said. And second-degree manslaughter? Prosecutors had to show that Chauvin caused Floyd's death through culpable negligence that created an unreasonable risk, and that he consciously took the chance of causing severe injury or death.  Testimony that revealed Chauvin should have known to put Floyd in a side recovery position, that he should have provided medical care before paramedics arrived and that he stayed in his position after he was told Floyd didn't have a pulse could all point to negligence, said former U.S. Attorney Tom Heffelfinger. What does Chauvin face if convicted? Each count carries a different maximum sentence: 40 years for second-degree unintentional murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter.  But under Minnesota sentencing guidelines, for a person with no criminal history, each murder charge carries a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years in prison, while manslaughter has a presumptive sentence of four years.  Prosecutors are seeking a sentence that goes above the guideline range. They cited several aggravating factors, including that Floyd was particularly vulnerable, that Chauvin was a uniformed police officer acting in a position of authority, and his alleged crime was witnessed by multiple children - including a nine-year-old girl who testified that watching the restraint made her "sad and kind of mad."  Chauvin has waived his right to have a jury decide if aggravating factors exist. So if he is convicted, Judge Peter Cahill will make that decision and would sentence Chauvin at a later date. In Minnesota, defendants typically serve two-thirds of their penalty in prison, with the rest on parole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/explainer-what-are-charges-against-derek-chauvin-in-george-floyds-death/articleshow/82170267.cms||---

You can see limited stalls on Zakaria street — the traditional food alley of the season, and Iftar — the fast breaking evening feast — has turned more of a homebound affair than a community one. However, there’s some good news for those who enjoy the food trail in the alleys of central Kolkata during the month of Ramzan. Several restaurants, home chefs, and even small eateries of Zakaria Streets, are now delivering iftar platter at your doorstep. From dates and fruit salad to halim, biryani, kebabs and even bakharkhani — food lovers can just order in and gear up for an iftar party at home. Home chef Manzilat Fatima barely gets any time to relax around this time of the year. “I became a home chef by making halim for my friends and their friends. This has always been a busy time for me. Now, with COVID related restrictions, I am getting more orders. I am delivering with all the necessary garnishes,” she said. Another home chef, Nandini Nandy, is offering not just halim but an entire iftar platter. “My friends requested me to start an iftar platter this year and I had to comply. You usually have dates, fruit salad, aloo pakora, dal pakora, onion pakora, halim and biryani. My friends are happy with the spread,” she said. Meanwhile, the foodies have also welcomed the move wholeheartedly. Musician and filmmaker Anindya Chattopadhyay, who is a regular at Zakaria Street, said, “Even last year, I could not visit Zakaria Street due to the pandemic outbreak. This year, the scene is worse. I’m happy that I am getting many of my loved dishes right at my doorstep. I will have to order more halim in the coming days,” he told us.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iftar-platters-come-to-your-doorstep-amid-covid-restrictions/articleshow/82170468.cms||Shamayita.Chakraborty

States with oxygen producing facilities have been reluctant to let go of supplies, fearing that they may face shortages. Rajasthan was seen to be holding up supplies from a facility in the state, prompting the home ministry to intervene and discuss the issue with the states. From Tamil Nadu to Madhya Pradesh and some of the eastern states, there have been demands for higher allocation as the national Covid count is on the rise.

The sources said that states have shared the requirement with the nodal officers designated by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade but often they do not disclose the new beds that they add. “Unless that is done the exact demand projection cannot be done. You have to contact oxygen to ensure that the new beds that come up have supplies,” explained a government source. Demand for medical oxygen has shot up during the second wave of the coronavirus in India.

---||World||Minneapolis ex-policeman Derek Chauvin convicted of murder in George Floyd case||MINNEAPOLIS: Former Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder on Tuesday in the arrest of George Floyd, a milestone in the fraught racial history of the United States and a rebuke of law enforcement's treatment of Black Americans. The 12-member jury found Chauvin, 45, guilty of all charges including second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter after considering three weeks of testimony from 45 witnesses, including bystanders, police officials and medical experts. Deliberations began on Monday and lasted just over 10 hours. In a confrontation captured on video, Chauvin, who is white, pushed his knee into the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man in handcuffs, for more than nine minutes on May 25, 2020, as he and three fellow officers arrested Floyd, who was accused of using a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a grocery store. Chauvin, wearing a gray suit with a blue tie and white shirt as well as a light-blue pandemic-related face mask, nodded and stood quickly when the judge ruled that his bail was revoked after the verdict was read. He was taken out of the courtroom in handcuffs and placed in the custody of the Hennepin County Sheriff. https://t.co/qBtbXPnuNj— Governor Tim Walz (@GovTimWalz) 1618953115000Outside the courthouse, a crowd of several hundred people erupted in cheers when the verdict was announced. Cars honked and chants of "George Floyd" and "All three counts" broke out. Chris Dixon, a 41-year old Black Minneapolis resident, had tears rolling down his face. "I was hoping that we would get justice and it looks like we did,” he said. "I’m just very proud of where I live right now." At George Floyd square in Minneapolis, the intersection where Floyd was killed and is now named after him, people screamed, applauded and some threw dollar bills in the air in celebration. The site has since become a rallying point for racial justice protests. "Justice for Black America is justice for all of America," the Floyd family's attorney Benjamin Crump said in a statement. "This case is a turning point in American history for accountability of law enforcement and sends a clear message we hope is heard clearly in every city and every state." Chauvin had pleaded not guilty to the charges of second-degree unintentional murder involving "intentional infliction of bodily harm," third-degree unintentional "depraved mind" murder involving an "act eminently dangerous to others," and second-degree manslaughter involving a death caused by "culpable negligence." While the US criminal justice system and juries have long given leeway and some legal protection to police officers who use violence to subdue civilians, the jurors in this case found that Chauvin had crossed the line and used excessive force. Under Minnesota sentencing guidelines, Chauvin faces 12-1/2 years in prison for his murder conviction as a first-time criminal offender. Prosecutors could, however, seek a longer sentence up to the maximum of 40 years if Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over the trial, determines that there were "aggravating factors." In Minnesota, convicted criminals generally leave prison on supervised release after completing two thirds of their sentence. Chauvin had no previous criminal convictions. The jury included four white women, two white men, three Black men, one Black woman and two multiracial women, according to court records. Earlier on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said he had spoken by phone with members of Floyd's family. "They're a good family, and they're calling for peace and tranquility, no matter what that verdict is. I'm praying the verdict is the right verdict, which is - I think it's overwhelming in my view. I wouldn't say that unless the jury was sequestered now, (would) not hear me say that," Biden told reporters at the White House. The intersection of race and law enforcement has long been contentious in the United States, underscored by a series of deadly incidents involving white police officers and Black people in a number of American cities in recent years. Floyd's death prompted protests against racism and police brutality in many cities in the United States and around the world last year. The Minneapolis Police Department fired Chauvin and three other officers the day after Floyd's arrest. The three others are due to face trial later this year on aiding-and-abetting charges in Floyd's death. Medical expertsA cardiologist, a pulmonologist, a toxicologist and a forensic pathologist were medical experts called by prosecutors to testify that videos and autopsy results confirmed that Chauvin killed Floyd by compressing his body into the street in a way that starved him of oxygen. The defense argued that Chauvin behaved as any "reasonable police officer" would have under these circumstances, and sought to raise doubts about the cause of Floyd's death, saying heart disease or even the exhaust fumes from the nearby police car may have been factors. Darnella Frazier, a teenager who told the jury she was taking her 9-year-old cousin to the Cup Foods grocery store that evening to get snacks, was among the witnesses called by prosecutors after jurors began hearing testimony on March 29. Frazier had used her cellphone to make a video depicting Floyd's excruciating ordeal, images that catalyzed the subsequent protests. Floyd can be heard on the video crying out for his mother and telling officers he could not breathe. Eventually Chauvin lifted his knee to allow paramedics to place Floyd's limp body onto a stretcher. Other eyewitnesses described the horror and lingering trauma of watching Floyd die in front of them. Courteney Ross, Floyd's girlfriend of nearly three years, recalled their first kiss and their shared struggle with opioid addiction. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo appeared as a prosecution witness to testify that Chauvin's actions during the arrest represented an egregious breach of his training. Throughout the trial, Chauvin wore a suit and took notes on yellow legal pads while sitting alongside defense attorney Eric Nelson. Members of Floyd's family took turns attending the trial, though some tried to avert their gaze when video of Floyd's death, recorded from multiple angles, was replayed to jurors. The judge ordered the jurors to be sequestered after they began deliberations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/minneapolis-ex-policeman-derek-chauvin-convicted-of-murder-in-george-floyd-case/articleshow/82170681.cms||---
---||World||In Minneapolis, a fortified city in wake of Derek Chauvin verdict||MINNEAPOLIS: Just outside the entrance to Smile Orthodontics, in a Minneapolis neighborhood of craft breweries and trendy shops, two soldiers in jungle camouflage and body armor were on watch, assault rifles slung over their backs. Snow flurries blew around them. A few steps away at the Iron Door Pub, three more National Guard soldiers and a Minneapolis police officer stood out front, watching the street. A handful of other soldiers were scattered nearby, along with four camouflaged Humvees and a couple police cars.  Across the street was a boarded-up building spray-painted with big yellow letters: "BLACK LIVES MATTER ALL YEAR ROUND."  Adam Martinez was walking down the street when he briefly stopped to stare at the scene.  "This city feels like it's occupied by the military," said Martinez, a commercial painter who lives in nearby St. Paul. "This is so weird."  The jury of six white people and six Black or multiracial ones came back with its verdict Tuesday after about 10 hours of deliberations over two days. Chauvin was found guilty on all charges: second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.  More than 3,000 National Guard soldiers, along with police officers, state police, sheriffs deputies and other law enforcement personnel have flooded the city in recent days, with a verdict looming in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer charged with murder in the death last year of George Floyd.  But in the city that has come to epitomize America's debate over police killings, there are places today in Minneapolis that can feel almost like a police state.  It leaves many wondering: How much is too much?  Concrete barriers, chain-link fences and barbed wire now ring parts of downtown Minneapolis so that authorities can quickly close off the courthouse where the trial is being held. It's become normal in recent days to pass convoys of desert-tan military vehicles on nearby highways, and stumble across armed men and women standing guard.  One day they'll park their armored vehicles in front of the high-end kitchen store with its $160 bread knives and $400 cooking pots. The next they'll be outside the Depression-era movie theater, or the popular Mexican grocery store or the liquor store ransacked by rioters during the protests that followed Floyd's death.  Meanwhile hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of stores and other buildings have been boarded up across the city, from Absolute Bail Bonds to glass-walled downtown office towers to Floyd's 99 Barbershop.  Behind all the security are the days of violence that began with protests over Floyd's death. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz faced withering criticism for not stepping in quicker to deploy the National Guard. City officials estimate the city suffered roughly $350 million in damage, mostly to commercial properties.  "They're between a rock and hard place," said Eli Silverman, professor emeritus at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a longtime scholar of policing. "You don't want to overmilitarize and make it appear that you've converted a sovereign state into a police state. But on the other hand, you have to be prepared, too," in case protests flare again.  More important than the size of the force, he said, is the expertise and planning behind it. Law enforcement leaders, for example, need to ensure proper crowd control training, and that officers from other jurisdictions are under a single command.  "It's not just numbers, it's the strategic decisions that are incorporated in these things," he said.  Minneapolis has a coordinated law-enforcement plan, called Operation Safety Net, that oversees planning and law-enforcement responses.  Speaking on Monday to reporters, top law-enforcement officials stood alongside local community leaders and vowed to protect property, allow peaceful protests, and try to de-escalate tensions before demonstrations turn violent.  Recent history, though, hasn't been so peaceful. A little over a week ago, 20-year-old Daunte Wright, a Black man, was killed by police during a traffic stop in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center.  Protests outside the city's police headquarters regularly spilled into violence, with protesters lobbing water bottles and the occasional rock at an array of law enforcement officers, and law enforcement responding by going after protesters - and sometimes journalists - with pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets.  "We know we need to do better. What happened the last few days wasn't something we wanted," Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchinson said at the press conference. "But we had to act to keep the community safe. And I will never back down from anybody when it comes to keeping this county safe."  Many here doubt the promises of law enforcement, which has long had a troubled relationship with the city's Black community.  Burhan Israfael, a community organizer who lives in Cedar-Riverside, a Minneapolis neighborhood with one of the largest East African communities in the country, said the presence of military vehicles and armed soldiers was terrifying. He said the terror strikes particularly sharply at the city's many immigrants who fled violence for the safety of the United States.  "I don't know anybody that experienced and lived through something like that, that feels comfortable coming outside," he said. "To be faced with the violent image of somebody dressed in all that camouflage, sort of parading around those massive weapons - is unsettling for sure."  But plenty of others believe the city needs to be ready for trouble.  The Rev. Ian Bethel, a leader in the city's Black church community, sounded almost angry Monday as he spoke alongside the law enforcement officials.  "We're at a difficult time here, all of us having emotions, anxieties and stress that most of us have not been able yet to express in a proper way," he said. "But let me make this clear: One way you do not express whatever you got tied up in you is through violence."  On Monday afternoon, soon after lawyers' closing arguments and the Chauvin case going to the jury, about 300 protesters marched outside the courthouse.  There was no sign of violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/in-minneapolis-a-fortified-city-in-wake-of-derek-chauvin-verdict/articleshow/82170881.cms||---

The average global temperature was thus merely 0.3° C less than the threshold of 1.5°C which the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) considers a level that may push the world towards facing more frequent and intense extreme weather events such as cyclones, hurricanes and heat waves. “We are on the verge of the abyss,” said the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, while announcing the WMO’s findings.

The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by CM Yogi Adityanath. "The PM's decision (to open vaccination for 18+) will help in better management of Covid and massive vaccination will help in defeating coronavirus. We have decided to vaccinate all above 18 years free of cost. The state government will take forward the vaccination programme with its own resources," the CM said, according to a statement issued here. During the deliberations, the chief minister asked the state health department to work out an action plan to conduct the vaccination campaign on a large scale. "We have to increase vaccination centres and create a database of people in the target age group," the CM said. At the cabinet meeting, a detailed discussion was held over the current situation. Adityanath said his government was working to save "life and livelihood". "The war against Covid is being fought vigorously under the guidance of the Prime Minister," he said, asking all the ministers to monitor the status of coronavirus treatment in districts. The CM also directed to take care of migrants returning from other states and keep them at quarantine centres. The CM said that like the previous year, the success in the fight against the virus can be achieved by keeping the public aware and preventing rumours. On Tuesday, the toll in UP crossed the 10,000-mark with 162 more fatalities, while the infection tally exceeded nine lakh after the detection of 29,754 fresh cases.

---||World||Derek Chauvin likely to appeal, claiming trial tainted by civil settlement, media coverage||Former Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin will likely seek to overturn his murder and manslaughter convictions by arguing that the jury was prejudiced by media coverage and a settlement in the civil case brought by George Floyd's family, though his odds of success are slim, legal experts said.  A jury on Tuesday found that Chauvin was guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree "depraved mind" murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of Floyd, a Black man.. Video of the incident touched off global protests over race and police brutality.  Chauvin's attorneys will have to notify the trial court within 60 days if they plan to appeal. His lawyers then have months to review transcripts and court filings dating from the start of the case to build their arguments.  Two weeks before trial testimony began, Minneapolis agreed to pay $27 million to settle a civil lawsuit brought by Floyd's family over his death.  The agreement was reached while jury selection in the criminal case was under way and Chauvin's attorney Eric Nelson said the settlement had an "incredible propensity to taint a jury pool."  Judge Peter Cahill on March 19 rejected Nelson's request to delay the trial because of the settlement, a decision which the defense is likely to raise on appeal.  Chauvin's lawyers may also cite Cahill's decision to hold the trial in Minneapolis as a reason to overturn the conviction.  The defense had argued it was impossible to find an impartial jury in the city, which was rocked by protests over Floyd's death. But the judge said the case was one of the most scrutinized in history and moving it would not make much of a difference.  Legal experts said there was little precedent for challenging a case based on venue and that trials are rarely moved in Minnesota.  "I just don't see there are a lot of close calls in terms of the judge's discretion," said Paul Applebaum, a Minnesota criminal defense lawyer.  Another potential point of appeal could be media coverage and protests over a fatal police shooting in a nearby Minneapolis suburb during the late stages of the Chauvin trial  Police shot and killed Black motorist Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. US Representative Maxine Waters was in Brooklyn Center over the weekend and urged protesters "to get more confrontational" if Chauvin was found not guilty.  That prompted Cahill on Monday to call her comments "abhorrent," though he also denied a request by Nelson to declare a mistrial.  "I'll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result on this whole trial being overturned," Cahill said.  Joseph Friedberg, a Minnesota criminal defense attorney, said an appeals court would not overturn a conviction because of media coverage or emotional protests.  "Cases aren't going to be reversed on that basis," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/derek-chauvin-likely-to-appeal-claiming-trial-tainted-by-civil-settlement-media-coverage/articleshow/82171262.cms||---
---||World||Joe Biden to Floyd family after verdict: 'We're all so relieved'||WASHINGTON: Before Tuesday's guilty verdicts were read out, President Joe Biden said he was praying for "the right verdict" in the trial of former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin.  Telephoning George Floyd's family later, he said of himself and Vice President Kamala Harris: "We're all so relieved."  Chauvin was convicted of two counts of murder and one of manslaughter in the death of Floyd, a case that sparked a national reckoning on race and policing.  Biden said he hoped the verdict would give momentum to congressional police reform efforts.  Floyd family attorney Ben Crump posted video on Twitter of a phone call from Biden and Harris to the family. Asked by a family member how he was doing, Biden said, "Feeling better now. Nothing is going to make it all better, but at least now there is some justice." President Biden and VP Harris call the Floyd family after the GUILTY verdict! Thank you @POTUS & @VP for your suppo… https://t.co/CLKhtZqjSg— Ben Crump (@AttorneyCrump) 1618955032000 "This is a day of justice," Harris told the family after joining Biden to watch the verdict in the private dining room off the Oval Office.  Speaking hours ahead of the verdict, while the jury was deliberating in Minneapolis, Biden said he called Floyd's family on Monday to offer prayers and could "only imagine the pressure and anxiety they're feeling." The president was expected to address the outcome of the trial Tuesday evening.  "They're a good family and they're calling for peace and tranquility no matter what that verdict is," Biden said a few hours before the verdicts were announced. "I'm praying the verdict is the right verdict. I think it's overwhelming, in my view. I wouldn't say that unless the jury was sequestered now."  Biden said he was only weighing in on the trial into the death of Floyd, who died with Chauvin's knee on his neck, because the jury in the case had already been sequestered.  The president has repeatedly denounced Floyd's death but had previously stopped short of weighing in on Chauvin's trial, with White House officials saying it would be improper to speak out during active judicial proceedings. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki repeatedly refused to explain Biden's comments, doing nothing to dispel the impression that he thought Chauvin should be found guilty.  The White House has been privately weighing how to handle the verdict, including whether Biden should address the nation and dispatching specially trained community facilitators from the Justice Department, aides and officials told The Associated Press. With word that a verdict had been reached Tuesday afternoon, Biden postponed planned remarks at the White House on his infrastructure package.  Biden's Tuesday comments came a day after Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over the trial, admonished public officials about speaking out.  "I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that's disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function," he said shortly after sending the jury to begin deliberations.  Defense attorneys often cite remarks made by public officials as a reason to appeal a verdict, in part because they could poison the jury against the defendant.  Cahill delivered his rebuke after rejecting a defense request for a mistrial based in part on comments from California Rep. Maxine Waters, who said "we've got to get more confrontational" if Chauvin isn't convicted of murder. Speaking of politicians in general, the judge said, "I think if they want to give their opinions, they should do so in a respectful and in a manner that is consistent with their oath to the Constitution to respect a coequal branch of government. Their failure to do so, I think, is abhorrent."  He conceded to Chauvin's attorneys that Waters' comments could potentially be grounds for an appeal.  On Monday, Cahill ordered that jurors be sequestered in an undisclosed hotel during their deliberations and instructed them to avoid all news about the case.  Despite Cahill's remarks, Brock Hunter, a criminal defense attorney and past president of the Minnesota Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said he considered a successful appeal over remarks like Waters' and Biden's extremely unlikely.  "It's inevitable that public officials are going to comment on a case and its impacts on communities," he said. "Unless there is direct evidence that statements by a public official directly impacted a juror or jurors, I don't think this even gets off the ground."  Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, told NBC's "Today" show that Biden "knows how it is to lose a family member ... so he was just letting us know that he was praying for us and hoping that everything would come out to be OK."  The verdict - and the aftermath - will be a test for Biden, who has pledged to help combat racism in policing, helping African Americans who supported him in large numbers last year in the wake of protests that swept the nation after Floyd's death and restarted a national conversation about race. But he also has long projected himself as an ally of police, who are struggling with criticism about long-used tactics and training methods and difficulties in recruitment.  Vice President Kamala Harris said Tuesday, before the verdict, "Let's say there is a guilty verdict on the highest charge, it will not take away the pain of the Floyd family."  "It will not take away the pain of the communities, all communities, regardless of their color or geographic location, that felt sadness and anger in what they witnessed in that video," she told CNN. The White House, meanwhile, stepped up preparations. Psaki said administration officials had been in contact with leaders in Minnesota and in other cities and states that saw unrest after Floyd's death last year.  The FBI and the US attorney's office in Minnesota have been working with local officials to support law enforcement as they prepare for the possibility of unrest after the verdict, officials said.  And the Justice Department has also dispatched specially trained community facilitators, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the plans publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.  The officials, part of the Justice Department's Community Relations Service, tout themselves as "America's Peacemaker" for mediating disputes in communities and holding listening sessions to help prevent future conflicts.  A federal civil rights investigation, separate from the trial, remains ongoing. Several witnesses were subpoenaed earlier this year to appear before a federal grand jury considering charges against Chauvin.  The Justice Department's civil rights investigation has been focused on Chauvin and some of the witnesses, including other officers who worked with Chauvin, people familiar with the matter have told the AP.  Chauvin was prepared to plead guilty to third-degree murder in George Floyd's death before then-Attorney General William Barr personally blocked the plea deal last year. Barr rejected the deal in part because he felt it was too soon, as the investigation into Floyd's death was still in its relative infancy, law enforcement officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-to-floyd-family-after-verdict-were-all-so-relieved/articleshow/82171264.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: 1.2 billion doses needed from May, capacity for 115 million/month||MUMBAI: There would be a need for an additional 1.2 billion doses (assuming two jabs per person) from May, with the government opening up vaccination for everyone above 18 years. This is because an estimated 44% or around 600 million of the country’s population falls in the 18-45 years age group. Assuming the ramped up capacity by June, three vaccine firms — Serum Institute (100 m doses per month of Covishield), Bharat Biotech (10 m per month of Covaxin), and Dr Reddy’s (around 4 m doses per month of Sputnik V) will together be able to throw up only 115 million jabs per month, just about 10% of the total demand. This comes with a rider that Dr Reddy’s will initially be able to import a limited number of Sputnik V doses from Russia, and there would be no additional vaccines at the country’s disposal till mid-year. The projection does not take into account four additional vaccines, including Zydus Cadila’s indigenous vaccine, and three foreign vaccines J&J, Novavax and Pfizer/BioNTech expected later this year. Zydus Cadila is expected to apply for regulatory approval in June, while a minimal contribution from J&J vaccine (facing clot issues and suspension across many countries) and no contribution from Pfizer (limited supplies) and Novavax (still in trials) has been taken into account. J&J has submitted an application to India’s Drugs Controller General requesting approval to conduct a bridging clinical study of its single-dose Janssen Covid-19 vaccine candidate.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); At present, the combined monthly capacity of both the vaccine makers — Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech— is about 75 m doses. A further ramp up in capacity is expected in both Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute in the next few months. The Pune-based company has been facing a shortage of key raw materials from the US, which has hampered its capacity expansion. Further, at this rate, the vaccination of the 18-45 age group could take over a year with the limited number of doses available in the country, experts added. With Serum’s and Bharat Biotech’s entire monthly capacity tied up under the Centre’s advance purchase agreement, there may not be much capacity left to supply to state governments or the private market. On its part, Serum will be able to market Covishield in the private market only after a few months, and not before August or September, sources say. There is no clarity on how deliveries for the state governments will work, and how pricing will be determined, a company official said. Faster approvals to potential new vaccines (including that of Zydus Cadila), import of fully ready-to-use vaccines like J&J, and better pricing would help enhance capacity to meet the demand for around 1.2 b vaccine doses, Tushar Manudhane of Motilal Oswal Institutional Equities told TOI. The projection does not take into account four additional vaccines, including Zydus Cadila’s indigenous vaccine, and three foreign vaccines J&J, Novavax and Pfizer/BioNTech expected later this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-1-2-billion-doses-needed-from-may-capacity-for-115-million/month/articleshow/82171131.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

It may be noted that the 38 juveniles of the home, including its superintendent Dharm Veer Singh, were found positive on Sunday and were shifted to the isolation ward. Confirming the incident, Saran SP Santosh Kumar said a list of missing juveniles is being prepared and legal action against the absconders would be initiated. However, he hoped that most of them had gone to their villages in Siwan and Gopalganj districts out of fear of this disease. The policemen on duty said only the doctor is allowed inside the isolation hall and under this condition, we could not prevent the escape of juvenile prisoners. On the other hand, the position of the remand home is also not safe and such incidents have been reported on different occasions in the past. This Home is located in a building owned by the district unit of the Red Cross Society, Chhapra which has requested the district administration several times to vacate this building for Red Cross activities. In this connection, ZZ Masih, secretary of district Red Cross Society said, “The administration always informs that land has been procured and after the construction of the building the Red Cross building would be vacated,” adding that this building was constructed for the Red Cross, but not for a single day Red Cross has utilized this building since 2005.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/19-covid-positive-juveniles-escape-from-chhapra-sadar-hosp/articleshow/82167118.cms||---

In Gaya town, emergency and the OPD facilities are available only at two other hospitals – Jaiprakash Narayan (JPN) hospital and Prabhawati hospital. At ANMMCH, only the emergency of paediatrics department is open for general patients. In paediatrics department, serious patients would be admitted in intensive care unit (ICU), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Abhay Kumar of Paraia block in the district said his father Ramswaroop Bhai suffered paralysis on early Monday morning. “I took him to ANMMCH, but the emergency was closed. I consulted a private medical practitioner. Although ANMMCH is the only big hospital for serious patients, there is neither a neurology department nor any neurologist available here,” he said. In view of rapid increase in Covid cases, the health department has declared ANMMCH a dedicated Covid hospital. On Tuesday, 1081 people tested positive in the district with active cases going up to 5437. So far 14050 people have tested positive out of which 8531 have recovered. Even Gaya district magistrate Abhishek Singh and ANMMCH superintendent Harish Chandra Hari have tested positive. The DM is in home isolation. “I have taken both the doses of the vaccine. I am recovering very fast. It is not unusual to get infected even after taking both the doses. But if vaccinated, the health condition would not become critical and the recovery will be very fast. I appeal to people to get vaccinated,” the DM said. Civil surgeon Kamal Kishore Rai admitted that the patients load would increase at Prabhawati and JPN hospitals following the closure of OPD and emergency services for general patients at ANMMCH. “All efforts would be made to ensure that other patients get better treatment facility at Prabhawati and JPN. It is the department’s decision to provide treatment to the Covid positive patients only at ANMMCH. If other general patients are allowed there, they can get infected,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/opd-emergency-services-at-gayas-anmmch-closed-for-general-patients/articleshow/82167109.cms||---

A career central banker who moved to the finance ministry, Narasimham (94) was seen as an institution in banking circles. As a senior RBI official, he influenced policy at the time of bank nationalisation in 1969 and reversed the process by authoring a report in 1991 that paved the way for private banks. Although his report is better known for opening up banking, the 1991 committee recommendations went beyond that and introduced reforms that made lending more efficient and strengthened banks. The resilience of the Indian banking sector during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis is seen to have been an outcome of the reforms. He was again tasked with reviewing the progress of reforms in banking in 1998. It was his committee’s recommendations that led to the implementation of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002. He holds the record for being the only governor to be appointed from within the central bank. Narasimham was appointed RBI governor briefly in 1977 by the Janata government, which was formed after the emergency but stepped down in six months. He later joined the government as a senior bureaucrat in the finance ministry. A recipient of the Padma Vibhushan in 2000, he penned his story in his book ‘From Reserve Bank to Finance Ministry and Beyond: Some Reminiscences’. Narasimham’s colleague in the bureaucracy and former SBI chairman D N Ghosh in his book ‘No Regrets’ describes him as enigmatic and a complete aberration from the popular image of a central banker — that of a staid and conventional persona guarded in his speech. “He had a gift for conjuring up witty metaphors and could talk incessantly without being a bore.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/narasimham-father-of-bank-reforms-dies-at-94/articleshow/82169641.cms||---

The new service incorporates an algorithm that uses an adaptive machine learning framework for continuously monitoring behavioural trends of similar data subjects. According to Cibil, this will enable first-time borrowers to get credit. “Our analysis clearly shows that if provided credit opportunities, new-to-credit (NTC) consumers can be good borrowers and form a profitable customer base for credit institutions. By using the NTC Score, institutions can significantly scale profitable growth by tapping into the NTC market,” said Rajesh Kumar, MD & CEO, TransUnion Cibil. Data shows that two-wheeler loans account for the highest number of enquiries from this segment, followed by consumer durables and home loans. According to Cibil, in February, retail credit demand (as measured by inquiry volumes) was back to 91% of the levels observed in February 2020, and was significantly up from the low levels observed during the early months of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tu-cibil-to-provide-lenders-score-of-first-time-borrowers/articleshow/82169693.cms||Mayur Shetty

Farmer unionist Prahlada Singh Bharukhera honoured him at the protest venue. Bainiwal said: “Since the BJP government stopped listening to the farmers, I am unable to go out anywhere in the constituency. The other reasons for quitting is the neglect of Ellenabad, where the chief minister’s pet projects haven’t got off since 2014.” He claimed even the officers had stopped listening to him, so he couldn’t stay in the BJP. Bainiwal is likely to join the Congress. He contested the Ellenabad assembly seat in 2014 and 2019, losing each time to Abhay Singh Chautala of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), who has resigned in support of the farmers, forcing a by-election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hisar-ex-nominee-quits-bjp-to-support-farmers/articleshow/82169239.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna: Lack of beds in hospitals, oxygen crisis create fear psychosis among people||PATNA: The second wave of Covid pandemic has created a fear psychosis among the common people in general and the elderly in particular. Negative projections about the pandemic have depleted their morale and confidence considerably, creating a sense of despair and gloom. When some senior citizens of the city were contacted by this newspaper to gather their feelings about the current situation in the wake of the recent spike in Covid cases, they appeared tense and fearful. Reports of people being infected with the virus even after taking both the doses of vaccine have been dampening their spirit and lust for life. Magadh University retired Hindi teacher Satyadeo Narain Sharma (87) said the second wave is more virulent and dangerous than the first one and even those who do not venture out of their house are being infected. “Unprecedented rush at all the government and private testing laboratories and growing scarcity of beds in hospitals and oxygen cylinders have made the people all the more apprehensive. Even if people get common cold and cough, they become apprehensive of Covid-19 infection and want to get them tested for the virus. But, they have to stand in long queue for hours and days for getting their samples collected at the testing lab and have to wait for several days to get their test results. All this creates greater rush at all the labs and increases the risk of getting infected too,” Sharma said. Patna University (PU) English department’s former head Shiv Jatan Thakur said the elderly are more prone to anxiety due to reduced self-confidence, decreased activity and mobility, losing friends and reduced physical and financial independence. And, the various types of news relating to the pandemic have only been aggravating their problems. The fact remains that barely 3% death rate is recorded in the second wave of the pandemic with the total cases of 2.30 lakh people getting infected. Thakur said the months of March and April are notorious for common cold and allergic reactions exactly, similar to those of Covid-19 which cause panic among the people. Instead of measuring their oxygen saturation level with a portable oximeter at home, they unnecessarily rush to private clinics and government hospitals for getting them tested for the virus’ infection. He said people should not worry for the disease, rather they must take all necessary precautions to remain safe and healthy. B N College’s retired history teacher N K Sinha said high prevalence of anxiety among the elderly is due to the fact that they suffer from many physical problems, chronic diseases, movement disorders, physical disabilities, and dependence on others. Retirement and the ensuing loneliness also contribute to their anxiety. Recently, they have got more panicky with the reports of delay in the RT-PCR reports, scarcity of beds and testing kits and acute shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir in the city, he said. Patna College’s former principal Nawal Kishore Chaudhary said the chances of people getting infected with the Covid-19 virus have increased multiple times in the new wave of the pandemic and the fatality rate has also increased. “Lack of essential facilities and medicare at the hospitals have shaken the confidence of the common men who are gradually getting disheartened. However, Chaudhary said people need to be too optimistic. Like so many crises of the past, the present crisis would also be over sooner or later. “There is always a light at the end of a tunnel,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lack-of-beds-in-hosps-oxygen-crisis-create-fear-psychosis-among-people/articleshow/82167386.cms||B K Mishra

---||Rajkot||First Covid patient of Gujarat turns water Samaritan||RAJKOT: Smiles reappear on weary faces of Covid-19 patients and their relatives seeing a young man driving into the sprawling Chaudhary high school ground every morning. He carries hundreds of bottles of chilled water on his scooter and starts distributing them to people, providing the much-needed respite from the blistering heat and frustrating wait for hours to get admission into the Rajkot Civil Hospital. For 33-year-old Nadeem Sevangiya, who has a rather forgettable tag of being Gujarat’s first Covid-19 patient, the gratitude expressed by these hapless people is gratifying. Sevangia, a resident of Jangleshwar area, had tested positive for the novel coronavirus on March 19, 2020, after returning from a foreign tour. He recovered after a fortnight of hospitalization. “This second wave of Covid has been really cruel. People are painfully waiting in long queues and water is the basic requirement in this blistering heat. I have been distributing 600-700 bottles every day,” said Sevangiya, who has a factory making sewing machines in Kothariyanagar. He has been running this free service with this partner Jayprakash Khushwah. On an average, 50-60 vehicles including private vehicles and ambulances are lined up for three to four hours at any given time with patients awaiting hospitalization, some even seen with oxygen cylinders. The school is located right behind the hospital. Sevangiya now plans to start distributing tea at night. “The administration is now making arrangements for drinking water but I got a request that patients and their relatives don’t get tea during the night. I will soon start distributing tea at night to all people who are camping on the ground while their near and dear ones are under treatment in the hospital,” he added. Tea stalls close due to night curfew after 8pm and Sevangiya will start making tea at his house for people. Sevangiya lives in a joint family with parents, brother, wife and two children. In the last wave, Jangleshwar was the hotspot but this time there are very few cases in the area. Sevangiya also donated plasma after recovering and helped the police and municipal corporation teams manage the situation in Jangleshwar area when it was a hotspot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/first-covid-patient-of-guj-turns-water-samaritan/articleshow/82172703.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Patients wait for beds, while 60 Covid coaches of Railway lie empty||AHMEDABAD: Even as rows of autorickshaws and ambulances stand parked for hours outside Covid hospitals with patients and kin praying for fast admission, the Ahmedabad division of the Western Railway has 60 empty coaches that had been refurbished as Covid care facilities during the first wave. Ready to be deployed at notice, the coaches, however, languish in the railway yard, awaiting their expected occupants in absence of any formal request from the government to use these beds in wake of the health crisis triggered by Covid-19 surge. When corona broke out early last year, the railway board had asked all zonal railways to refurbish coaches to be used as isolation centres. On April 2, the Ahmedabad division began converting the coaches at an approximate cost of Rs 60,000 per coach. Each coach can accommodate eight to 16 patients. “This means that a minimum of 480 and a maximum of 960 patients can be accommodated in these facilities. Though meant to function as isolation wards initially, each coach has two oxygen cylinders which can be used at the time of emergency if the patient gets critical,” said railway officials. Divisional railway manager, Ahmedabad, Deepak Kumar Jha said, “These coaches can be used as isolation wards. We have 60 coaches which are ready to be deployed immediately to any place where there is a demand.” Western Railway is divided into six divisions across three states. These include Mumbai Central in Maharashtra; Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar, Rajkot, and Vadodara in Gujarat; as well as Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh. The DRM added, “So far, only Nandurbar district administration has started using the converted coaches. So far, there has been no formal request from the Gujarat government.” A senior railway official said that in case the government wants to use the coaches for patients in need of oxygen, all it has to provide is oxygen cylinders, medicines, and medical manpower. “The coaches have everything else that is needed. These can be parked on an unused track at the nearest station where there’s an uninterrupted supply of electricity and water,” the official added. These coaches are non-air conditioned. “If required, the government can install coolers to give relief from heat,” he said. However, it is up to the government to use these coaches, the official said, adding, “The Railways is ready. All we need to do is check the expiration date on the oxygen cylinders. However, the medical and paramedical staff arrangement will have to be done by the state government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/patients-wait-for-beds-while-60-covid-coaches-of-rly-lie-empty/articleshow/82169108.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

With the government hospitals facing a rise in day-to-day oxygen consumption, the district administration in Udaipur has sought assistance from Hindustan Zinc Ltd to ensure uninterrupted supply of it. Collector Chetan Ram Deora said the company has agreed to provide 5 kilolitre of liquid oxygen daily from its Dariba plant. Deora said, so far, the situation has been under control and there are enough beds with oxygen supply in the hospitals as well as private Covid-dedicated centres. However, looking at the soaring cases, anticipatory measures are being taken to make sure there is uninterrupted supply of ox ygen for critical patients. The first tanker carrying liquid oxygen arrived from Dariba plant to Udaipur on Tuesday. Deora said the government is sending uninterrupted supply of oxygen through the state cell from Bhiwadi plant which is being used with the help of a private gas agency and at the oxygen plant at MB Hospital. Another private agency is manufacturing oxygen in a separator machine and supplying 1,500 cylinders daily to hospitals. Besides them, Udaipur is receiving 200 cylinders from Nathdwara in Rajsamand and 300 cylinders each from Azoliya ka Kheda and Nimbaheda, Chittorgarh daily. Committee to check hoarding, adulteration Looking at the probability of hoarding and adulteration of edible items during the ‘self-discipline fortnight’ imposed by the state government, the administration has formed a committee for effective monitoring. Collector Deora said the committee would take stringent action on getting complaints of hoarding essential items and adulteration. DSO Jyoti Kakwani with selected members will inspect stockists and supply outlets under PDS as well as private entrepreneurs.

Railways sanitised not only the coaches of the affected special passenger trains, but also the entire premises at Patna Junction, Danapur, Rajendra Nagar Terminal and Patliputra Junction, he said. Thirteen out of 452 passengers reaching Patliputra Junction from Mumbai, 7 out of 222 passengers of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus Mumbai-Patna Junction special (03260) and two out of 402 passengers of Mumbai Lokmanya Tilak Terminus-Patna special train (03032) at Patna Junction tested positive, the DRM said. Likewise, 5 out of 214 passengers of Lokmanya Tilak Terminus–Bhagalpur superfast special passenger (02336) also tested positive for Covid-19. According to Danapur DRM, Covid-19 detection centres are functioning round-the-clock on railway platforms at Buxar, Ara, Danapur, Patliputra Junction, Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Jhajha, Jamui and other major stations under the division, he said. Meanwhile, women welfare organization (WWO) of Danapur headed by its president Supriya donated 20 steam vaporizers to Danapur railway hospital for the indoor Covid-19 patients on Tuesday. They have also given Rs50,000 to the Danapur railway hospital to arrange oxygen cylinders for the Covid-19 patients, the DRM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/27-more-passengers-from-maha-test-ve/articleshow/82167354.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Trichy||2-month break in service for guest faculty members: BDU||TRICHY: Bharathidasan University has decided to give a break in service to guest faculty members working in university departments and PG extension centres for May and June. There are 80-odd guest faculty members working on consolidated pay and hourly basis who will not be getting their salaries for these two months according to the orders issued by university registrar in-charge G Gopinath on Monday. Though this is a usual practice every year due to college vacation, they were given an exemption last year in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. What has set off panic this year is the registrar’s order asking principals of 10 constituent colleges to take a decision on retaining them for these two months and give extension based on necessity. Since 2012, guest faculty members in constituent colleges were not given break in service during May-June. There are over 600 guest faculty members working in erstwhile constituent colleges under BDU that were recently converted into government colleges. “The decision to give break in service this year when we are in the throes of a second wave is unfortunate,” said an affected guest faculty member at the university. While they are paid a minimum of Rs 15,000 a month, it will be difficult to manage without that salary too for two months during the pandemic, said the faculty member. However, many are optimistic of being retained considering the fact that semester examination is beginning from May first week and staff are required for subsequent months for evaluation of answer scripts, said a guest lecturer at a constituent college. BDU registrar in-charge G Gopinath told TOI that the decision to give break in service was according to university norms and last year was an exception. “The heads of departments can retain some of the staff based on requirement and same is the case with constituent college principals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bdu-gives-two-month-break-in-service-to-guest-faculty-members/articleshow/82169284.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Visakhapatnam||Vizag: Experts advocate holistic approach to health||VISAKHAPATNAM: As the country reels under the impact of the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak, medical experts point out that to tide over the grim situation, people need to stay physically and mentally fit and work towards minimising the risk of infection by boosting immunity and following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. As per experts, the most important step towards safety lies in staying at home unless it is an emergency. Dr Rekha Dutt, consultant psychiatrist at Shantiniketan Mental Health Centre, said, “Staying and working from home and following Covid-19 protocols will cut down Covid-19 risk by around 70-80%, which will automatically bring down stress. To battle boredom and stay positive, one should socialise, chat or sing over Zoom and video calls with friends and family, engage in some activities like gardening and healthy cooking.” Nutrition consultant and guest faculty at the yoga department of Andhra University R Rekha said, “Daily physical activity inside the house, meditation to de-stress, breathing exercises or pranayama to improve lung capacity, exposure to sunlight for 15-20 minutes for vitamin D intake and eating a diet consisting of green leafy vegetables, lemon, fruits, vitamin C, zinc and calcium, Omega 3 and their supplements is essential.” Dr Priyalini Sarkar, AP state coordinator of Women’s Cell in Indian Association of Physiotherapy (IAP) pointed out that since work from home is the option now, ergonomics care is important. “One should sit, sleep and work in proper posture and not sit in the same position for hours together. Do not work in a lying posture and place the laptop on the belly. Every 20 minutes, get up and do simple stretches and rest the eyes from the gadgets,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/experts-advocate-holistic-approach-to-health/articleshow/82167794.cms||Sulogna Mehta

The accused were identified as Mangali Srinu (38) and Nutheti Jayakrishna from Anantapur. Addressing the media, Krishna district additional SP Malika Garg said Srinu was held at Three Pillar Centre in Machilipatnam taluk police station limits. Cops said Srinu was accused in a recent case in which he extorted a government official caught in a trap case. Cops said the two have conned officials to the tune of Rs 20 lakh by claiming to help them walk free from cases filed against them. Garg said Srinu also committed other petty crimes in the Rayalaseema region and served jail terms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/two-conmen-held-for-extortion/articleshow/82167829.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Health experts hail decision to vaccinate all above 18 years||PATNA: The health experts have hailed the Centre’s decision to make anti-Covid vaccines available for all citizens above the age of 18 years from May 1. They say a large population of the state would be covered in this inoculation drive. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Coivid-19 at AIIMS-Patna, welcomed the Centre’s decision and said it would boost the vaccination drive and guard vaccinated people against the Covid-19. “In the second wave, it has been noticed that more people in young age group are getting infected. The mortality rate among young people has also increased this time. When more people are vaccinated, it would help in fighting the disease,” he told this newspaper. Associate professor of paediatrics department at NMCH, Dr BP Jaiswal said when maximum people develop antibody against the Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the disease, it will help in developing herd immunity. “Through the mass vaccination, the state will be able to cover almost 65% of its population,” he said and added: “It is a god initiative as the vaccines are designed to mimic a natural infection without the full-blown disease and helps generate protective immunity.” The experts have also opined that before allowing mass vaccination, the state government should take steps to provide the facilities, so that there should be no mismanagement at the vaccine sites. Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, former president of Indian Medical Association, said, “It is a welcome step as most productive and precious population will be safeguarded against the disease. It should have been started earlier, but I appreciate that the government has taken this decision. The government needs to do a massive vaccination campaign, because there is still lack of awareness among the masses,” he said. “The government needs to bring a policy to give vaccine to below poverty line (BPL) people on priority basis. The corporate houses, non-government organisations and charitable houses or societies need to run a sponsored campaign for the vaccine. The immunisation should be done on a war footing as the vaccines would protect people from the virus for six months to one year. We are expecting more stable vaccines in future,” Dr Rajiv said. PMCH superintendent Dr IS Thakur said those infected after taking two doses of the vaccine, have suffered minor symptoms as the severity of the disease has slowed down. “Thanks to the vaccine, at least there would be no mortality. If most of the population is covered, it will benefit the people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/health-experts-hail-decision-to-vaccinate-all-above-18-yrs/articleshow/82167521.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Bihar: Amid Covid spike, 26 ventilators at Bettiah govt hospital gather dust||BETTIAH: Four months ago, the Government Medical College (GMC) hospital at Bettiah received a consignment of 26 brand new ventilators under the PM CARES fund. When Sanjay Jaiswal, himself a doctor, the local MP and Bihar BJP chief visited the hospital, barely a one minute walk from his house, on Tuesday, he was aghast to find the consignment of ventilators yet to be unpacked. “We will not allow any laxity in treatment of Covid patients,” Jaiswal told this reporter later in the evening, adding, “I shall personally visit the hospital daily while at home to ensure that citizens do not suffer.” “Doctors are constrained not only here but also in other government medical colleges in the state for want of interns and junior residents (JR),” he said. TOI, it may be recalled, had reported this earlier when a private compounder was caught proxying for a doctor in the emergency during Holi. “The interns and JRs completed their terms at the end of March and fresh (entrance) exams have been delayed due to Covid,” Jaiswal sympathised with the doctors’ constraint. He called up health minister Mangal Pandey to solve the problem. “The principal secretary of health has been directed to draft those who have completed their internships recently as JRs for six months,” the MP told this newspaper. The new beds and ventilators were showcased during the first Covid surge last year. A 45-year-old patient, gasping for breath in the Covid ward, had gone live on FB with ‘Please Save me cries’ hours before succumbing. A BJP leader’s death in the same ward had also triggered anger. But were any lessons learnt? Not, given the case of the PM CARES- ventilators which the MP found still unpacked on Tuesday. “Fortunately it is still not a crisis here,” the MP said, “But We must ramp up our facilities.” During the first Covid surge last year, the GMC had 17 ventilators. Six were later returned to the Narkatiaganj sub-divisional hospital. The BJP chief, on Tuesday, was shocked to learn that only three of the (earlier) eleven ventilators are in working condition. “The company (which supplied them) has said that their bio-medical engineer has tested positive. A visit to repair and service the ventilators may take a fortnight,” superintendent Pramod K Tiwary told TOI. “As of now, apart from the earlier 11 ventilators and the 26 We received under PM-CARES, we have got another 25 ventilators from the DRDO Covid care facility in Patahi, Muzaffarpur,” Tiwary said, disclosing another problem. “There is a mismatch between the connectors of these 51 ventilators and the sockets installed by L&T who built this new hospital”, he said, adding, “We have luckily found a local vendor with five adaptors to immediately install five ventilators that are in working condition." “Ventilators, even if lying unused, need regular servicing. We have asked the vendor ( Bharat Electronics) to immediately send their bio-medical engineer to get these machines in working order,” Narendra Kumar, HOD-anaesthesia at the GMC said while also bemoaning being understaffed. “Given the crisis at hand, I have requested that a dozen technicians and nurses who have ICU experience be deployed.” The MP, meanwhile, took solace in the availability of oxygen. “ A plant at Harsiddhi produces 400 cylinders of oxygen per day that takes care of both East and West Champaran government hospitals,” he said, adding, “But complacency may cost us dear. So, We will ensure that the captive oxygen plant at the GMC goes operational in four days.” Meanwhile, three patients succumbed at the GMC, raising the second wave Covid toll to 14 in 11 days. But despite 6,345 patients’ recovery, the detection of 230 fresh cases on Tuesday pushed the number of active cases to 1441 in the district.

The gang of 12 dacoits brutally assaulted the trader, Md Sirazul (60), and three other members of the family, including two women, when they resisted the robbery. The injured have been rushed to the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital where the condition of two is stated to be critical. The incident took place around 1am when the family members were asleep in their house located near Bhagwati Sthan. The dacoits barged into the house after scaling the boundary wall and held the inmates captive at gunpoint. Sirazul told the police that the dacoits confined them in a room and collected Rs 18.5 lakh in cash, Nepali currency worth Rs.6 lakh, 10 ‘tola’ gold jewellery, 400 grams of silver after breaking open the almirah. Sirazul’s two sons — Md Haider Ali (32) and Md Jamil Akhter (40) — and their wives Sazila Khatoon and Zarina Khatoon were also assaulted with revolver butts. The dacoits opened fire and hurled bombs while fleeing with the cash and valuables. A police team led by SHO Gaya Singh reached the spot and inquired about the incident. Sirazul revealed to the police that they had kept the cash in the almirah after selling off a plot of land. Circle inspector Rajesh Kumar said forensic experts have collected samples from the house. “A sniffer dog was also pressed into service to trace the exit point of the criminals. The criminals will be arrested soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cash-valuables-worth-rs20l-looted-from-traders-house/articleshow/82167195.cms||Ramashankar

Police said that a group of four youths had arrived at the ghat to offer prayers at the famous Kada Dham temple on the eighth day of the ongoing Navratra. Before visiting the temple, they decided to take a dip in the Ganga, and reached Kaleshwar ghat. While taking dip, the youths went deep into the river and started drowning. Hearing their cries, the swimmers, Ravi and Bhola, jumped into the river and managed to take two youths, Amit and Rohit, out of river but failed to trace Ganesh. Ganesh was 35-year-old and a resident of Phulpur. On being alerted, a team of police, along with the swimmers, also rushed to the spot but failed to spot Ganesh’s body despite repeated efforts. Police said that efforts are underway to fish out the body of the missing youth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/man-fear-drowns-in-ganga-two-rescued/articleshow/82168427.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: In current wave, average time in hospital up from six to nine days||AHMEDABAD/ SURAT: Ravindra Sathe, a resident of Gota, developed respiratory issues on Monday night. While EMRI 108 took about 12 hours to take him from his residence to an AMC-run hospital, much to the family’s horror, the hospital was full. The same ambulance took him to two nearby hospitals which were also full to capacity. “It took us about five hours to secure a bed with oxygen,” said a family member. With 76,500 active cases on Tuesday evening, the state scaled another high in Covid cases. According to the government figures, the state has 78,000 government and private hospital beds for Covid-19 patients, giving a 98% occupancy ratio if every positive patient is hospitalized. It results in longer queues of ambulances outside hospitals. In cities like Ahmedabad, the occupancy is close to that figure – out of 5,587 beds available in 161 private hospitals, 97% were occupied with only nine beds available for ICU and ventilator. At MediCity – consisting of the hospitals in the Civil Hospital campus – the occupancy rate hovered around 96% with 2,388 patients. Why Amdavadis find it difficult to secure a bed? “The hospitalization period this surge is at least one-and-a-half times higher hospitalization period,” said Dr Hardik Shah, director of Vastrapur-based DHS Hospital. It had zero beds available out of 42 on Tuesday. “In the last surge, the average hospitalization period was about six days. This time, it has increased to nine.” The reason is higher oxygen dependency, said Dr Saurabh Shah, director of Aartham Hospital. “The patients cannot be discharged till they get stabilized and can breath on their own. Majority of the patients reaching the medical setting require oxygen right at the admission,” he said. The hospital had no bed available out of 108 beds available. As a thumb rule, those on nasal cannula require six to seven days, BiPAP ten to 12 days and those on ventilators may need anything from 10 days to one month, said a senior pulmonologist at Civil Hospital. “The low turnaround means that the bed doesn’t get empty quicker – on Tuesday, against 4,631 new patients in Ahmedabad city, only 876 got discharged, adding 3,755 new patients. Even if we consider 50% of them requiring hospitalization, about 1,880 persons would be scurrying for the beds today,” said the expert. Surat also is recording a similar phenomenon. “This time around, we are seeing that lung infection has increased compared to last year due to which patients must be given external oxygen and if necessary, also have to be kept in ICU. On average, patients are discharged only after 10 to 11 days,” said Dr Samir Gami, a chest physician in Surat. Those with higher chest involvement need observation and hospitalization of up to two weeks, said Dr Dhanesh Vaidya, a Surat-based nephrologist. ““We are seeing patients coming with more complications this time who have to be kept on ICU or on ventilators,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-current-wave-average-time-in-hospital-up-from-6-to-9-days/articleshow/82169212.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Business||India Inc steps on gas to boost oxygen supply||MUMBAI: India’s large manufacturers such as Reliance Industries (RIL) are ramping up production of liquid medical oxygen to help battle the coronavirus outbreak that has crippled the economy. Tata Group, the country’s largest conglomerate, is also doing its part by importing cryogenic containers to support the nation’s healthcare system, which is under tremendous strain because of the pandemic. Liquid medical oxygen is a crucial ingredient used for treating certain health conditions, including those brought on by the coronavirus. RIL, India’s largest company by market value, is looking to raise oxygen capacity to 1,000 tons a day. According to PTI, it installed equipment and established processes at its Jamnagar refinery to produce oxygen in the wake of Covid’s rampant spread. It now supplies 700 tons to states badly affected by the coronavirus. Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have the highest infections. Coronavirus: Live updates“The entire supply of oxygen by RIL, including transportation in special tankers at minus 183 degrees Celsius, is made at no cost to the state governments,” reported PTI, quoting sources. The Centre has allowed oxygen supplies to certain sectors only, including pharmaceuticals, steel and petroleum refineries. But some states like Maharashtra have directed manufacturers to divert all their supplies to save the lives of Covid-stricken patients. JSW Steel too plans to double oxygen supplies to 400 tons and is making every effort to boost production across its steel plants in the country. Currently, it supplies over 185 tons in response to the crisis. Tata Group, through an image posted on its Twitter handle, said, to supplement the critical supply of liquid medical oxygen to various states, “we are importing 24 cryogenic containers” via special chartered flights. Cryogenic containers are tankers used for storing liquid medical oxygen at very low temperatures. Group company Tata Steel has already been supplying 300 tons of oxygen to various hospitals in the country. ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel has been supplying 200 tons from its Hazira plant in Gujarat to health facilities in the state. Vedanta said it would like to offer its locked Tuticorin plant (housed under Sterlite Copper), which has two oxygen manufacturing facilities with a combined capacity of producing 1,000 tons, to states to fight the pandemic. “The oxygen plant is currently lying shut owing to the orders passed by the (Tamil Nadu government). This is a humble request to grant us the necessary permission and allow us to run the oxygen plant, which will be instrumental in supporting state governments in these critical times,” said Sterlite Copper CEO Pankaj Kumar in his letter to the Tamil Nadu chief minister.

Andhra Pradesh had accumulated about 9.7 lakh cases as of Tuesday. The state could map about 37 lakh primary contacts and 48 lakh secondary contacts of these 9.7 lakh Covid-19 patients. This translates into an average of four primary contacts and five secondary contacts for each coronavirus case unearthed in the state. Timely contact tracing plays a key role in breaking the chain of transmissions. Educating the close contacts about their possible exposure to the virus, assessing their risk and symptoms, testing, and guiding them on the next steps constitute the basic principles of the contact tracing mechanism. The major focus of the containment strategy of Andhra Pradesh is on mapping of cases and contacts, and their geographical dispersion. Speaking to TOI, AP Covid-19 nodal officer Dr K Rambabu said that those who come into close contact or live in the same household as the Covid-19 patient are considered as primary or high-risk contacts. “In the initial months of the outbreak, the Covid-19 tests were conducted on both primary and secondary contacts. Later on, the testing focus has been mostly laid on primary contacts, while the secondary contacts have been kept under observation for two weeks for any suspected symptoms. The AP health department has given utmost priority to contact tracing as it essential to prevent the spread of the disease,” said Dr Rambabu. Andhra Pradesh has been implementing community surveillance and the sentinel surveillance system. It conducted five rounds of door-to-door survey during the first wave in 2020 with different objectives—first, to identify foreign returnees, the second for migrants and subsequent surveys to single out high-risk and vulnerable populations. For the same, the state took advantage of its nearly three-lakh strong village/ward volunteer system. The state has already captured data on those with comorbidities and elderly people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-maps-99-9-of-all-covid-patient-contacts/articleshow/82167757.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

But the number of passengers flying to Patna has increased by 36.7%. As per the data shared by Airports Authority of India-Patna, the city airport had 9,133 footfalls on Monday, of which 6,777 arrived and 2,356 departed to other states. Almost two weeks ago on April 5, 11,762 passengers travelled to and from Patna airport, including 6,451 departures and 5,311 arrivals. Patna airport also witnessed a slight 12-15% decline in daily passenger footfall, which is around 9,000-10,000, as against 12,000-13,000 about a fortnight ago. The number of flights has also come down to 43 on Monday against 47 a couple of weeks ago. Occupancy of seats has come down from earlier 90% to less than 45-50% in outgoing flights while incoming flights were almost full. The executives of different airlines claimed that only migrants are returning home amid lockdown and restrictions in different states, while business travelling has hit the bottom. An IndiGo’s executive at Patna airport told this newspaper that people having some urgent work only were moving out of the city because of which the occupancy in outgoing flights has dropped by 50%. “People are more conscious and travelling only if it is necessary. No business travel and tours have taken place in the last one week. Only migrants who work in other states are returning to Bihar,” he said and added that the airline has temporarily withdrawn three flights owing to decline in passenger footfall. A GoAir executive said like last time, they are witnessing reverse migration this year also. “People are travelling back home amid new restrictions in different states. People want to stay with their families at this time of pandemic. The incoming flights remain full while occupancy in outgoing flights has reduced to half since April 7,” he said. An executive of SpiceJet said the passenger footfall has drastically dropped on different routes where the number of Covid-19 cases was higher, especially Maharashtra and Punjab. He said the occupancy was affected in the flights coming from such states where the flyers have to produce RT-PCR negative test report before boarding the flights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/number-of-incoming-flyers-up-by-36-outgoing-down-by-63-at-patna-airport/articleshow/82167839.cms||Faryal Rumi

Maintaining their age-old tradition, the sex workers, referred to as ‘nagar vadhoos’, performed dance before Maha Shamshan Nath, the lord of cremation ground, on the seventh night of Chaitra Navratra on Monday, when the three-day ‘shringar’ of the deity concluded. For an outsider it may be a harrowing experience to see women singing and dancing amid burning funeral pyres, but for a hardcore Banarasi, it is an age-old tradition, and they enjoy the dance unmindful of the smoke and smell from the burning pyres. The Manikarnika Ghat has been witnessing an increased rush of dead bodies for cremation, say locals. “Normally, 100 bodies arrived here per day for cremation in this season, but these days the number has gone up by almost three times, possibly due to more corona deaths,” said Gopal Yadav, who sells pyre wood, adding that bodies come in such big numbers only at the peak of summer and winter. “Since it is corona time, there was no public to witness the dance of ‘nagar vadhoos’ (courtesans) after the evening aarti in the temple. Only select people of temple management were present,” said Gulshan Kapoor, the organizer. In pre-Covid times, a large crowd of locals and foreigners gathers to watch the unique event, undeterred by the smoke of the pyres and crackling sounds of the burning wood and bodies. For foreigners, it is a unique spectacle and an enigma of Varanasi, where dying means attaining moksha. As per tradition, sex workers offer prayers to the deity on the seventh night of Chaitra Navratra annually. After prayers and rituals, they dance and sing on a makeshift stage amid burning pyres. “It is a tradition in Varanasi that the nagar vadhoos perform for the deity on the seventh night of Chaitra Navratra,” said Kapoor. The tradition began in the 16th Century, when the king of Amber, Raja Man Singh restored a temple at the Manikarnika Ghat. The king wanted to organise a music concert to celebrate the occasion, but none of the artists turned up to perform at the cremation ghat. The sex workers then offered their services and performed at the cremation ground. The tradition has been continuing since then, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kashis-nagar-vadhoos-dance-to-propitiate-baba-shamshan-nath/articleshow/82168673.cms||---

---||Business||Marriage of dharma with artha is the key to growth: CEA K V Subramanian||Chennai: India is perhaps the only large economy to use the pandemic crisis to herald a change in the country’s economic thinking, the country's chief economic advisor K V Subramanian said on Tuesday. “The country has worked to convert this challenge (Covid-19) into an opportunity with the concept of AtmaNirbhar Bharat,” he said.Subramanian said the impact of the pandemic on Indian economy “should not be very large” in the long run, but added that he would prefer to make another assessment after the current wave.Subramanian estimated that the peak of India’s second wave may be during mid-May. “This must be taken with a caveat that I am not an epidemiologist,” he said. “My only worry is about loss of production capacity and that is why we are focusing on helping smaller businesses to reduce damage,” Subramanian saidHe was virtually addressing students of the Great Lakes Institute of Management in a Thought Leadership talk session.Subramanian stressed that India is slowly but surely moving towards a pro-market scenario where “opportunity is equalized” for every idea. “I believe the services sector will grow well even after the pandemic… the concept of the ‘next 100 unicorns’ gets us closer to the pro-market concept,” he said. ‘Dharmic capitalism’ is key to India’s economic growth and the marriage of dharma (ethics) with artha (wealth) is the key to growth, the CEA said. “India’s current economic vision rests on three major legs- the combination of growth with efficient welfare, ethical wealth creation and a virtuous cycle,” Subramanian said, explaining that we must focus on growth to create resources for welfare, the country must see wealth as a ‘boon not bane’, and supply-side reforms are essential to accelerate private investment. He pointed out that the governments in the past rarely used the term privatisation and only ‘disinvestment’ was used frequently. The entry of private banks is the best instance of significance of privatization, he said, paying homage to former RBI Governor M Narasimham who passed away on Tuesday.The CEA said that India's economic thinking has historically emphasized enabling market activity and since 1991, ethical wealth creation by entrepreneurs has benefitted all stakeholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/marriage-of-dharma-with-artha-is-the-key-to-growth-cea-k-v-subramanian/articleshow/82169217.cms||---

---||Business||Cos must adapt to post-Covid normal to remain in the race||By Raj BowenWhat is the role of the CEO? This question, when asked in some forums, gets pretty easy answers that are readily available in “job descriptions” and include rather predictable items like agreed business results, stakeholder management — external and internal, profitability & growth of market share, governance & compliance, etc. In 2004, Peter Drucker said, “The CEO is the link between the inside that is ‘the organisation’, and the outside of society, economy, technology, markets and customers. Inside there are only costs. Results are only on the outside.” Coming from arguably the greatest management thinker of all time, this still holds good. In my professional work with many CEOs over the past two decades and personal relationships with several CXOs across sectors, I have found immense value in flipping the question around to ‘What is NOT the role of the CEO?’ Now the answers start becoming rather challenging, of status quo, as I’ve often found CEOs getting rather sheepish when they realise that more than 75% of what they admit is keeping them busy everyday shows up on this list. Sitting right on top of the list (and for this one, the killer lies in the historical legacy that comes with the title) is ‘execution’. And it is not surprising at all as the title expands to chief executive officer — they are just living up to the literal meaning of the designation. As the business world continues to wobble on its pivot during the pandemic, the jury remains undecided on what the future holds. This, despite the plethora of predictive webinars over the future of work, etc, mostly by folks who will have no accountability for their actual correctness. One thing is very clear: There was a way of business before Covid, and there will be a way of business after Covid. The organisations that are blind to this reality are on the road to decline and extinction, irrespective of their current form and results, among other factors. A shift is very clear too: All organisations in the post-Covid world and all employees will now have choices and will exercise them, regarding what and how they want to live and grow. No longer will an employee be dependent on an organisation for building his life and, similarly, no organisation will remain bound to doing things that have worked for their industry and sector. This, when we think of it deeply, is a huge shift from the past and has massive ramifications for how organisations will now be both — managed and led — and these are very different in their own meanings. The next huge reality is that now all organisations will have an equal opportunity to innovate, to build an intentional future for themselves. They will have the opportunity to stop building ahead based on what they have done till now, and move to building ahead based on what they want to build — two very different realities. At the helm of this challenge, the reins are with the CEO in his new avatar. Now, cutting through the clutter of the complicated job description that he will draft for the role, he actually has only one single lever that he can deploy, which will largely separate the men from the boys. The new expansion of CEO now becomes chief enthusiasm officer. There is a clear reason for this overnight change and it derives its logic from the old Ralph Waldo Emerson maxim that, “Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.” When tasked with leading a team into a future that is hugely promising but also hugely unknown, the only secret sauce to make it happen is sheer enthusiasm — vision, strategy, capability, etc, will follow. There will now clearly be two types of CEOs — those who can do this and will infect the entire organisation with this new fuel, and those who don’t or choose not to. When investing in organisations that will give handsome returns in the years ahead, the balance sheet health and business projections suddenly become very unreliable yardsticks. The money will now be put on the organisation that has a CEO committed to this single deliverable sitting at the top of his personal accountability list. Here’s the good news: This is a unique skill, and it is learnable. Let’s see how many CEOs decide to take the call.

---||Ahmedabad||Now, all hospitals, clinics in Gujarat can treat Covid patients: Govt||GANDHINAGAR: In wake of acute shortage of hospital beds and ever growing queues outside designated hospitals following a record spike in Covid-19 cases, Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani announced on Tuesday night that all hospitals, private clinics and nursing homes can now admit and treat Covid-19 patients without obtaining any prior nod from the government. The hospitals, clinics and nursing homes will only have to inform the respective district or municipal corporation authority. This decision was taken at the core committee meeting chaired by the CM, who said that although more than 78,000 beds have been made available for Covid-19 patients, spiralling cases are stretching available resources. Meanwhile, state government officials will hold meetings with officials of the armed forces on Wednesday to use military hospitals of Kutch, Jamnagar, Ahmedabad and Vadodara for treating Covid-19 patients. Rupani said the Centre has extended support for using facilities of these military hospitals to admit Covid-19 patients and thereby address the issue of shortage of beds. In a bid to further encourage medical doctors and paramedical staff to join Covid-19 duties, the chief minister also announced an increase in their wages. The new pay scales will be applicable for all doctors and paramedical staff till July 30. The pay scale for doctors has been fixed at Rs 2.50 lakh per month. Medical officers will get Rs 1.25 lakh a month, dental doctors will get Rs 40,000, Ayush and homeopathy doctors will be paid Rs 35,000 per month. Junior pharmacists, lab and X-ray technicians will get Rs 18,000 every month. The CM announced that all class IV workers will get Rs 15,000 per month. The CM also said that the monthly pay of all additional and outsourcing staff working as nurses will be increased from Rs 13,000 per month to Rs 20,000 per month until July 30. Dr Devendra Patel, president of Gujarat chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA), said the decision would hopefully lead to more bed availability for Covid-19 patients. “Today the biggest fear the citizens have is to secure a bed for their near and dear ones. The move would encourage even the smaller hospitals to cater to Covid patients,” he said. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that the smaller hospitals and nursing homes can take care of mild to moderate patients, reducing the burden on the existing hospitals. “It would be more beneficial in the smaller centres from where the patients have to come to centres such as Ahmedabad,” he said. Experts, however, also pointed at pitfalls including lack of trained staff, lack of oxygen supply system and lack of infrastructure. “If the patients would have to be transferred to bigger hospitals eventually, the system might not work. How many hospitals can add pulmonologists or critical care specialists at this juncture?” asked an expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/now-all-hospitals-clinics-in-guj-can-treat-covid-patients-govt/articleshow/82169182.cms||---

With the government hospitals facing a rise in day-to-day oxygen consumption, the district administration in Udaipur has sought assistance from Hindustan Zinc Ltd to ensure uninterrupted supply of it. Collector Chetan Ram Deora said the company has agreed to provide 5 kilolitre of liquid oxygen daily from its Dariba plant. Deora said, so far, the situation has been under control and there are enough beds with oxygen supply in the hospitals as well as private Covid-dedicated centres. However, looking at the soaring cases, anticipatory measures are being taken to make sure there is uninterrupted supply of ox ygen for critical patients. The first tanker carrying liquid oxygen arrived from Dariba plant to Udaipur on Tuesday. Deora said the government is sending uninterrupted supply of oxygen through the state cell from Bhiwadi plant which is being used with the help of a private gas agency and at the oxygen plant at MB Hospital. Another private agency is manufacturing oxygen in a separator machine and supplying 1,500 cylinders daily to hospitals. Besides them, Udaipur is receiving 200 cylinders from Nathdwara in Rajsamand and 300 cylinders each from Azoliya ka Kheda and Nimbaheda, Chittorgarh daily. Committee to check hoarding, adulteration Looking at the probability of hoarding and adulteration of edible items during the ‘self-discipline fortnight’ imposed by the state government, the administration has formed a committee for effective monitoring. Collector Deora said the committee would take stringent action on getting complaints of hoarding essential items and adulteration. DSO Jyoti Kakwani with selected members will inspect stockists and supply outlets under PDS as well as private entrepreneurs. A control room with a helpline number 8852653399 has been established where people can inform them of any anomalies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/to-fulfill-o2-needs-udaipur-pleads-for-5k-litres-from-hzl/articleshow/82169257.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Reactive arthritis afflicts Covid patients: Study||GUNTUR: A recent study has shown that Covid-19 is causing multiple health disorders among patients apart from lung problems. A study carried out by rheumatologist Dr Manukonda Muralikrishna has found that the number of patients suffering from reactive rrthritis (ReA) is rapidly increasing along with the rise in Covid-19 cases. ReA belongs to a group of disease called spondyloarthropathies which usually affects bones in the spine and joints located near it. It can cause severe pain and sometimes damage joints, including the backbone, shoulders and hips. Surprisingly, joint pain related to ReA has been noticed even among youngsters who tested positive for Covid-19 during the second wave. Doctors cautioned people not to neglect joint pain as a routine minor illness and instead consult a physician for advice. Doctors also recommended that people get tested for Covid-19 if the pain persists. “Monoarthritis or oligoarthritis that usually involves lower limbs (ankles and knees) causing severe knee and joint pain is a new manifestation of the Covid-19 virus,” said Dr Muralikrishna. Dr Muralikrishna added that sometimes it can take between one to four weeks for ReA to occur after an infection. ReA is triggered by an extra-articular infection not present in the synovial fluid of the joint. The Covid-19 virus is now known to cause a host of complications that are extra-pulmonary in nature, including cardiovascular, neurologic and skin manifestations. The gastrointestinal tract may serve as a secondary site for Covid-19 infection in relation to the expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 in the gastrointestinal tract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/reactive-arthritis-afflicts-covid-patients-study/articleshow/82167770.cms||Samdani MN
---||Ahmedabad||First Covid patient of Gujarat turns water Samaritan||RAJKOT: Smiles reappear on weary faces of Covid-19 patients and their relatives seeing a young man driving into the sprawling Chaudhary high school ground every morning. He carries hundreds of bottles of chilled water on his scooter and starts distributing them to people, providing the much-needed respite from the blistering heat and frustrating wait for hours to get admission into the Rajkot Civil Hospital. For 33-year-old Nadeem Sevangiya, who has a rather forgettable tag of being Gujarat’s first Covid-19 patient, the gratitude expressed by these hapless people is gratifying. Sevangia, a resident of Jangleshwar area, had tested positive for the novel coronavirus on March 19, 2020, after returning from a foreign tour. He recovered after a fortnight of hospitalization. “This second wave of Covid has been really cruel. People are painfully waiting in long queues and water is the basic requirement in this blistering heat. I have been distributing 600-700 bottles every day,” said Sevangiya, who has a factory making sewing machines in Kothariyanagar. He has been running this free service with this partner Jayprakash Khushwah. On an average, 50-60 vehicles including private vehicles and ambulances are lined up for three to four hours at any given time with patients awaiting hospitalization, some even seen with oxygen cylinders. The school is located right behind the hospital. Sevangiya now plans to start distributing tea at night. “The administration is now making arrangements for drinking water but I got a request that patients and their relatives don’t get tea during the night. I will soon start distributing tea at night to all people who are camping on the ground while their near and dear ones are under treatment in the hospital,” he added. Tea stalls close due to night curfew after 8pm and Sevangiya will start making tea at his house for people. Sevangiya lives in a joint family with parents, brother, wife and two children. In the last wave, Jangleshwar was the hotspot but this time there are very few cases in the area. Sevangiya also donated plasma after recovering and helped the police and municipal corporation teams manage the situation in Jangleshwar area when it was a hotspot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/first-covid-patient-of-guj-turns-water-samaritan/articleshow/82169095.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Altogether 600 boys from Scouts and 350 girls from Guides have launched a massive campaign in railway colonies to provide medical assistance to Covid-19 infected family members of railway employees during their home isolations, said Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar. According to Kumar, these young boys and girls have voluntarily come forward to serve the Covid patients and their families. Dressed in their uniform, they set out on their mission early morning every day and collect prescribed medicines from railway hospitals and deliver at the house of patients on priority, he said. They are also delivering free homeopath medicines to each house in railway colonies in Khagaul to take precautionary measures against the Covid-19 pandemic. Lauding the indomitable courage and spirits of these young boys and girls, the DRM said they are in touch with Covid- infected and needy people through WhatsApp and cellphones. Senior divisional personnel officer (DPO) of Danapur, Surjit Singh, who is in-charge of these scouts and guides, said these boys and girls have decided to perform the last rites of the Covid-19 victims henceforth. Amid the alarming spike in the coronavirus cases and deaths, these scouts and guides, who are dependents of railway employees, regularly visit the houses of distraught families to provide succour to them in time, he said. According to Singh, scouts and guides are also delivering health kit, which includes two soaps, one sanitiser and two masks, to each house in the railway colony areas in Patna and Khagaul. “They will now move to other railway colonies between Sakaldiha and Jhajha to help railway employees and their families,” he said. Last year, they had prepared 10,000 masks and distributed them free of cost to the needy people. This time they have decided to raise a ‘mask bank’ to fulfil the needs of common people at a time when human life continues to be in peril, Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/danapur-scouts-guides-turn-covid-19-saviours/articleshow/82167467.cms||Kumod Verma

---||Jaipur||Showcause notice and FIR against school for violation of virus SOPs||Jaipur: In a matter related to allegedly holding practical examinations of class XII despite strict curbs in the state, city’s Maharani Gaytari Devi (MGD) School has come under scanner. District collector Antar Singh Nehra on Tuesday sent a show-cause notice to the school authorities for violating Covid-19 guidelines. Meanwhile, parents’ association has filed an FIR against the school for not following Covid protocol. On Monday, a team of district education officer went to the school premises after receiving a complaint that practical examination of class XII was being conducted despite Covid-related restrictions in the state. The issue was found to be true and the school was asked to close immediately. Some media organisations reported that the school had received a permission letter from the collector, on which collector Antar Singh Nehra said that this is a false statement and that he has sent a show-cause notice to the school authorities. “I received a written request from the school principal but I didn’t give them any permission. When the education department team went for inspection they didn’t let the team enter for three hours. I have sent a show-cause notice under Disaster Management Act 2005, to the school as this action is putting lives of students in danger,” said Nehra. While talking to TOI, principal of the school Archana Mankotia said that they had sent a permission letter to the collector. “The order for lockdown came late in the night and in the morning, many of our hostellers were supposed to return home. We sent a request permission letter to the collector. Students’ parents were coming to school and only two practical examinations were remaining that are important for class XII board examination. Hence, with proper distancing, we conducted the practical for their benefit so they don’t have to return for just that,” said Mankotia. She even alleged that the officer of district education department entered the school premises without permission and took photographs of girl students in the laboratory. School authorities said that officials should have informed them beforehand. Reacting to this, district education officer Ram Chandra Pilaniya said that a surprise inspection is done without informing the school or else the purpose is lost. “We received information that the school was conducting the exam and we sent our official there to check. The school authorities misbehaved with the officer. We have written to the collector and higher authorities to take required action against the school.” Meanwhile, an FIR was also filed against MGD School by Sanyukt Abhibhavak Sangh for violating the Covid norms and putting lives of students in danger. Spokesperson of parents’ association Abhishek Jain Bittu said, “This is utter violation of Covid norms. We want strict action against school authorities for pressurizing parents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/showcause-notice-and-fir-against-school-for-violation-of-virus-sops/articleshow/82169286.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jaipur||Students continue stir against closing of Rajasthan University hostels||JAIPUR: Male students of Rajasthan University, continued their protest the hostel shutdown on Tuesday and asked the authorities to let them stay. Rajasthan University administration, however, did not accept their demands but gave them one more day to get their reservations for their respective native places done. Looking at the rising Covid-19 cases in the state and state-wide lockdown, university administration decided to close the hostels on Monday. The students objected to this saying they already deposited the fees and hence should be allowed to stay in the hostels. ABVP state president Hushyaar Meena said, “We have paid the fees and in most of the hostels students are staying in single rooms with proper social distancing. University administration should understand the plight of those who cannot stay in the hostel despite paying full fees.” Meanwhile, university administration said that Covid situation is serious, hence they have taken the decision, keeping in mind everyone’s well-being. Chief proctor HS Palsaniya said, “It is not possible to maintain social distancing as hostels have common mess, halls and washrooms. If even one student gets infected there are chances that others will also be infected, and it can turn into Covid hotspot. So, it is better for students to vacate the premise. We have given them relaxation to get their reservations done and leave.” There are 19 hostels on the campus and its constituent colleges in which more than 700 students are staying. While many students chose to return home during the weekend lockdown, others have now started the process of vacating. The hostel authorities have ordered sanitisation of the hostels after the students leave. It is assumed that guest students who have been living in the hostels without permission are involved in this protest, as they know re-entering hostels will be difficult for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/students-continue-stir-against-closing-of-raj-univ-hostels/articleshow/82169287.cms||---

These complimenary sessions will help guests boost their immunity and de-stress. We have also collaborated with Ayurveda practitioners, who have worked on immunity boosting food made with local produce, which we have put on our menu. To avoid crowding at the restaurant, we are encouraging guests to order these meals to their rooms,” Deepak Harne, the regional manager (Pune) of MTDC, said. The properties will also provide guests with immunity boosting ‘kadha,’ approved by the state government as well as vitamin C and D tablets. Products such as bottles of sanitiser, masks, face shield, gloves will also be available at all properties. The management will also cater to the wellbeing of the mind and arrange for guided meditation sessions to be held either in the guests’ rooms or on the lawns amid the greenery. “People are stressed because of the pandemic. Taking care of one’s mental health is as important as taking care of their physical fitness. Even as tighter restrictions were implemented, some guests had still booked the resorts for the weekends. They wanted to escape the rush of the city, the panic of television news channels and just get away to be surrounded by nature,” Harne said. He said the guests follow protocols such as not gathering with other guests in common areas. “Our resort in Mahabaleshwar has 120 rooms spread over 40 acre. The rooms are 40 to 50 feet apart, so social distancing can easily be maintained. Our resort in Malshej ghat also makes for a perfect weekend getaway due to its refreshing windy weather on the hilltop. Even though the property in Panshet does not have such greenery, it has a swimming pool for recreation and we have converted the conference room into a meditation hall,” Harane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mtdc-to-focus-on-wellness-tourism/articleshow/82169293.cms||---

Schools, which are yet to begin admissions to Class XI, have been asked by the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) to start the process immediately. Others have been requested to start classes at the earliest, definitely by the month-end. “We have been asked to prepare a schedule for online classes on the ISC 2023 syllabus for Class XI students as soon as possible,” said a school head. Unlike in 2020-21, when the Plus-II syllabus was curtailed by 30%, the council is keen on the entire curriculum. Several ICSE candidates rued the fact that they missed the opportunity to take the Class-X boards exams, for which they had prepared well. “This was to be our first public examination and would have helped us assess ourselves. Now, we have to wait for 2023 for the ISC exams. We were told on Saturday the exam had been postponed. On Tuesday night, I saw on TV that the exam had been cancelled. Now we have to focus on Class XI,” said Anushka Konar, a Class-X student at La Martiniere for Girls. Like many others, Konar is worried that her pre-boards scores, which is not quite satisfied with, will be reflected on the ICSE report card and she also regrets that she did not get a chance to improve on it. Students will now have to depend on the board for their final scores. “CISCE did not want to keep the Class-X students’ future hanging in balance. The safety and well-being of students and the teaching faculty are of topmost priority and paramount interest. Thus the exams were called off,” said another principal. The status of ISC (Class XII) 2021 exams remained the same, the council said. “CISCE is committed to devising ‘a fair and an unbiased criterion’. The criterion, based on which the results will be declared for ICSE, and the date of the result will be announced by CISCE,” said council chief executive & secretary Gerry Arathoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/start-class-xi-e-lessons-by-end-of-month-cisce/articleshow/82173115.cms||Somdatta Basu

Policemen were seen moderating traffic at checkposts while keeping tabs on shops and vegetable markets so that people did not gather at one place. Senior officials claimed to have set up 81 checkposts in the city, randomly asking citizens the reason to be out on roads. TOI did a reality check from Imli Phatak to 200 Feet Road, Vidhyadhar Nagar to MI Road and Tonk Road to Shaheed Smarak to see the checkposts at all intersections and major red lights, with both police and traffic cops moderating the traffic. Police officers were seen making gestures to those not wearing mask in the cars and penalised many who could not explain the reason for moving out, in the random search. The barricading was causing traffic to run at a snail pace at places like Sodala, MI Road and Shaheed Smarak. The police patrolling vehicles started making rounds at all markets to ensure the essential services’ shops to close down by 5pm. Throughout the day, no major action was taken by the police and different police stations have reported a smaller number of fines on not following social distancing and not wearing masks, than non-curfew days. Rahul Prakash, additional commissioner of police, Jaipur police commissionerate, said, the police are acting swiftly and allowing only those who are permitted under the rules. “Since it is neither lockdown nor curfew (zero mobility), several areas/sectors have been exempted in Self Discipline Fortnight, which is being followed by the police,” said Prakash, who said police have ensured that markets (permitted) shouldn’t be crowded. “Any individual who is out on the road has to have a purpose else police will deal with them strictly,” said Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-set-up-81-checkposts-in-city-to-stop-crowding-in-mkts/articleshow/82169315.cms||---

On Tuesday, representatives of Jaipur Vyapaar Mandal and All Rajasthan Agriculture Trade and Industry Association met the district collector Antar Singh Nehra and gave him memorandum of their demands to allow them to open the shops till 5pm. Ravi Naiyyar, president of Jaipur Vyapaar Mandal said, “We accept that Covid-19 cases are rising but some relaxations should be given to traders.” Collector Antar Singh Nehra said that he had received the memorandum from traders and will forward it to the state government. Suresh Aggarwal, chairman of FORTI, said that as per guidelines permission has been given for industries and agricultural mandis, similarly, markets should also be allowed to remain open. He said, “The state government should talk to representatives of the business organisations and decide their responsibility, under which the protocol could be implemented. This does not cause loss of direct employment to businessmen.” Other businessmen said that due to lockdown last year, traders have suffered losses in crores. Many traders are still to recover their losses. Business was on track since December and in the next three months we expected to do well due to wedding season. But complete lockdown by the government is a big shock for businessmen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/biz-assns-object-to-complete-lockdown/articleshow/82169297.cms||---
---||Delhi||Can we ask patients needing oxygen to hold on till April 22?: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: With several major Delhi hospitals just hours from exhausting their oxygen supplies, Delhi High Court ordered the central government on Tuesday to immediately stop industries from using oxygen and divert the gas to Covid-19 patients. “Industries can wait, need for oxygen in hospitals is now and any delay will lead to loss of precious lives. We, therefore, direct the central government to implement decisions to bar industries from using oxygen forthwith. We see no justification for implementing the order from 22nd of April,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli noted in an order passed after a marathon hearing of over three hours. The court underlined that economic interests could not override human lives and advised the government to consider reducing production in steel and petroleum production to divert oxygen to hospitals. “Shortage is now. You have to ban now. Look into taking some oxygen from steel and petroleum industries. They have big pockets and big lobbies, but tell them if they have to cut production, then they can cut production. Lives have to be saved,” the bench said wondering why the Centre is waiting till April 22 to ban industrial use of oxygen. “Can we ask patients needing oxygen to hold on till April 22?” the high court remarked, adding that if nothing was done, then “we are heading for a bigger disaster as we might end up losing nearly a crore of people. Are we willing to accept that?” During the hearing, the court also asked the Centre to ensure allocation or diversion of resources and medicines, such as Remdesivir, is based on the needs and situation of each state, cautioning that otherwise “people will have blood on their hands”. The bench was unhappy with the non-application of mind in allocation and diversion of resources and medicines, after examining the government’s affidavit. “We will be doomed,” it told additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma. “The long and short of it is that Remdesivir is in short supply,” the bench said, while hearing a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking to revive court monitoring of the issue. The observations by the bench came after perusing the Centre's affidavit which said there was presently no gap in oxygen supply to Delhi and that industrial use of oxygen was banned with effect from April 22. The health ministry submitted that there had been an inordinate increase of 133% in the projected medical oxygen required as on April 20, between the initial estimate of 300 metric tonnes and revised estimate of 700 metric tonnes submitted by Delhi. The court also grilled the Centre on allowing wastage of vaccines. “Wastage of vaccines, which is life-saving, is a criminal waste. We direct the government to look into the situation to permit full utilisation of vaccines,” the justices said, citing news reports that 44 lakh of 10 crore vaccines were wasted. “We are now losing young people. Why can’t the vaccine not be given to those below 45 in these 10 days till May 1? If vials are opened and those registered don’t turn up, let others take it, why is there wastage of even one dosage?” It asked the Centre to consider updating its vaccine registration app to accommodate those in the 18-45 years category. “This update will ensure that all doses are fully utilised. Such flexibility is available in other countries such as the United States of America,” the high court noted. Referring to shortage of important drugs, the court said the Centre or the drug controller should not hesitate to invoke their power under the Patent Act to go for generic medicines since the lives of the people are being lost at a very fast pace and the lives of people should be taken on 'priority' over everything else.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-can-we-ask-patients-needing-oxygen-to-hold-on-till-april-22/articleshow/82169301.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Delhi||After manic Monday, some order: Trickle of migrants at Delhi border||NEW DELHI: At 3.28pm on Tuesday, several migrant workers were at Anand Vihar railway station and bus terminal waiting to return to their home villages. But the scenario was nothing like what was seen on Monday. The pedestrian bridge wasn’t as chaotically crowded and several officials deployed there were able to facilitate the movement of those wanting to leave Delhi. TOI spoke to the people waiting to board the trains and buses. Some claimed they were travelling home for a break or a wedding, while others said they wanted to reach their villages before all means of transportation were curtailed, as happened last year. Raju Ranjan, a Patna resident, said, “During the lockdown in 2020, I had to walk for so many kilometres. I can’t go through that again. I have saved Rs 1,500 and will take a private bus back to my city. We are trying to come to terms with what happened last year, but do not want to beg for food again.” Unlike Monday when thousands of people milled around disregarding the physical distancing norms, there were fewer people on Tuesday. Besides the migrant labourers, there were also others who were leaving Delhi for family events. Raju, who worked in Haryana along with his mother, was walking towards the bus stand to go back to his village in Shahjahanpur. When asked if he was returning home to the weeklong lockdown, he had a curt “No”. Just metres ahead of the reticent Raju was Rajesh with his family of five. They were waiting for a bus to Fatehpur in UP. “I don’t want to stay here during the lockdown,” he said, before quickly adding, “Moreover, relatives back home are unwell. My brother-in-law has been sick and it is time to visit him. The uncertainty here is a major issue and we want to be home with our loved ones.” Only people holding valid tickets were allowed to enter other railway stations in Delhi. “No one who does not have a reservation ticket will be allowed to board the train,” declared Harendra Singh, DCP (Railways). Many people are going to their home districts to attend marriages and other functions, but they are buying tickets days in advance.” On Tuesday afternoon, when TOI visited Anand Vihar railway and bus terminal, things appeared smoother than the day earlier. There was a heavy presence of police personnel and Civil Defence Volunteers, all of whom were directing the movement of the travellers. An official was also deployed on the pedestrian bridge to prevent crowding. Dr Punit Sethi, estate manager, Anand Vihar bus terminal, noted, “Compared with Monday, there were only around 6,000 people who left for their hometowns in 50-60 buses. We have set up 12 helpdesks that work round the clock to guide the migrant workers. Apart from this, we have also boosted the deployment of sanitation and cleaning staff so that the toilets are cleaned regularly. We are also providing drinking water to the travellers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-manic-monday-some-order-trickle-of-migrants-at-border/articleshow/82169336.cms||---

To allay public concern, the NMMC has started the Covid Bill Complaint Centre Helpline to check overcharging at hospitals. “For any bill related complaints in private hospitals for Covid patients, the citizens can contact on helplines 022-27567389 and 7208490010 (Whatsapp). The civic body will then check and inquire into the complaints so that the matter can be resolved,” said a civic official. The affected parties can also email the NMMC on cbcc@nmmconline.com with complaints of overcharging. Some activists have also suggested that the gross overcharging by private ambulances to ferry Covid patients must also be included in the CBCC facility||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-now-nmmc-starts-helpline-to-check-hosps-overcharging/articleshow/82169371.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Allahabad||Officials continue efforts to meet Covid challenges||Times News Network Varanasi: The senior officials, on Tuesday, remained busy in efforts to enhance medical facilities, number of beds, availability of oxygen and injections for Covid patients. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said that 10 newly purchased high flow nasal cannula machines were installed at Trauma Centre of BHU and Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital after starting Covid facilities at 90 and 60 beds there, respectively. Except Remdeshivir injection, sufficient availability of all medicines for Covid are available, he said. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said that 1,296 Remdeshivir injection have been made available at the government and private hospitals on Monday and 269 on Sunday. Efforts are on to procure more stock. The officials added that the helpline numbers- 1077, 1800-180- 5567, 0542-2221937, 2221939, 2221941, 2221942, 2221944 and 2720005 of Kashi Covid Command Centre have been made operational. The DM and other officials continued surprise checking of Covid facilities even after midnight on Monday. However, people could be seen struggling for Covid test at sample collection points while many also alleged laxity of medical teams and lack of treatment responsible for deaths of patients. TOI reached urban primary health centre in Madhopur and found that people from nearby areas like Nirala Nagar coming for RTPCR test were asked to go to UPHC Cantt about 4 km away from their areas. The reason for denial to collect their samples was given that the centre was collecting samples from Sonia, and Lullapura areas, which are over two km away. Similar problems were being faced at other PHCs also. Chief medical officer Dr VB Singh could not be contacted regarding the issue. Photo of body of a youth Vineet Singh lying on the feet of his helpless mother Chandrakala Singh of Madiyahi in Jaunpur on an e-rickshaw at SSL hospital BHU went viral on social media. Vineet’s uncle Vinay Singh said that the youth suffered kidney problem and had been taking treatment at BHU hospital in past few weeks. On Monday he reached the hospital after sharp deterioration in his health but died on Monday after he failed to get treatment. In another incident, a veteran freedom fighter and retired forest officer Babu Parshuram Rai (94), a native of Ballia, died at a private hospital in Pahadia area on Tuesday. He lived in Sarnath with his family. His family alleged that Rai was admitted to DDU district hospital on April 8 after having respiratory problem but due to lack of proper treatment he was shifted to private hospital. He was given guard of honour by police before his body was taken for cremation at Harishchandra Ghat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/officials-continue-efforts-to-meet-covid-challenges/articleshow/82168713.cms||---

Four-time MP and senior BJP leader Shyam Bihari Misra (82) and his nephew Hanuman Misra (55), who held a cabinet minister’s rank, got infected a few days ago. While Shyam Bihari died in a private hospital of the city on Tuesday evening, his nephew Hanuman died at Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow in the morning hours of Tuesday. According to family members of Shyam Bihari, he suffered mild cardiac arrest a couple of days ago. “Subsequently, he was admitted to LPS Cardiology institute where he experienced mild fever. His test report, however, came Covid positive. He was shifted to a private nursing home for Covid -19 treatment, where his test report came negative on Monday. The condition of the former MP did not improve despite medication and he succumbed on Tuesday evening,” said his family members. Hanuman, chairman of cooperative union, was admitted to the SGPGI hospital in Lucknow following his Covid-19 diagnosis a few days ago. “His condition deteriorated and he succumbed on Tuesday morning. He was also suffering from kidney related ailment,” informed his brother Kishan. A pall of gloom descended at the minister’s Acharya nagar house in the city. The political fraternity was shocked to learn about the demise of two senior BJP leaders. “Despite the age factor, four-time MP from Billhaur Shyam Bihari ji was still quite active, and was holding post of the president of Bhartiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal,” said city president of BJP Sunil Bajaj. He was elected as an MP from Bilhaur Lok Sabha constituency in 1991. He held the post of chairman, Committee on Food, Civil Supplies and Public Distribution from 1993 to 1996. He was re-elected to the 11th Lok Sabha in 1996. From 1996 to 97, he remained as member, Consultative Committee, Ministry of Food. Again from 1997 to 98 he remained as member, Committee on Food, Civil Supplies and Public Distribution. In 1998, he was re-elected to the 12th Lok Sabha. From 1998 to 99, he became chairman, Joint Committee on the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/2-political-figures-of-one-family-die-of-covid/articleshow/82169567.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The app will tell the user the location of the crematorium, its distance from the hospital and availability of ambulance. Due to the rise in the number of deaths due to Covid-19, the PMC allowed cremation of the victims at all PMC crematoriums. Prior to that, cremation was done only at the Kailash crematorium. One out of two electrical cremation facilities at the Kailash crematorium has stopped functioning due to overload. PMC has 21 cremation facilities and 150 bodies are cremated every day. “The app will be launched soon. People will be able to locate the crematorium near the deceased patient’s home. Information about waiting period and likely time needed to cremate the body, cremation pass, death certificates will be given on this app,” said senior PMC official Shrinivas Kandul. Kandul said, “As per the Covid-19 protocol, the patients are cremated in the jurisdiction of the local self-government body, where the patient dies. Even if a Covid positive person residing in rural areas or other districts, comes to Pune for treatment and dies here, s/he gets cremated in PMC limits. This is also increasing the number of deaths in civic areas.” The PMC officials said that the cremation of Covid-19 bodies has gone up nearly 8 to 10 times in the last fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-develops-cellphone-app-for-crematoriums/articleshow/82169346.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

He also said that on April 22 evening, Congress will decide “how to go ahead”. “It is unfortunate that Patnekar does not know that the speaker’s post is a constitutional post. All super chief minister people sit next to the speaker and they dictate to him,” said Chodankar, while adding that the “speaker has committed forgery by allowing the merger which was illegal”. “The merger cannot take place as he accepted forged documents,” he said. Chodankar said Congress will not spare its 10 former MLAs who joined BJP, while adding that as long as he is GPCC president he will not give tickets to the defectors.  He said the party’s legal team will assess all the options - whether to challenge the speaker’s order in the high court or whether to mention it when the matter comes up in the Supreme Court. Chodankar said the speaker had purposely fixed April 29 as the date for judgment, while taking into account the dates of the courts’ summer vacation. Meanwhile, opposition leader Digamber Kamat called the order an ‘expected judgement which will never be respected by the people of Goa’. “Truth always prevails. It is just a matter of few more days and justice will be done.

The institutes, which opened for physical classes in November, saw around 30,000 students arriving from other states. The surge in cases led to the suspension of physical classes in March. Postponement of JEE-Advanced and Class XII CBSE board exams has further put the students in a fix. The extended curfew has left no option for them but to start packing their bags and head home. “Migration of coaching students has started. In the current situation, they don’t have many options than to get back home for a month or two,” said Pramod Maheshwari, director of Career Point Coaching Institute, who has advanced the summer vacation in his coaching centres and helping students in transportation and food. The number of students heading daily is not so huge, said a government official, who is monitoring the situation. The local administration doesn’t have the exact figures of the number of students staying here and those who had left in the last few days. “I don’t see any hope of physical classes to resume for at least two months. I and my friends are heading home together to Bhopal and nearby cities,” said Raj Bhardwaj from Kota. Kota is among the worst-hit districts and is experiencing an average of 400 cases daily. It has recorded 1,382 positive cases on Tuesday and has an active caseload of over 7,000 cases. Recently, several coaching students have been infected by the virus making the parents worried.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/coaching-students-in-kota-begin-to-go-back/articleshow/82169344.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi supplied entire quota of oxygen on Tuesday: Centre||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday said Delhi was supplied almost its entire quota of medical oxygen with stocks also available with the government and suppliers, which was over one-and-a-half times the day’s allocation. Supplies on Tuesday are estimated to have been stepped up by around 47% from Monday’s level of 241 metric tonnes to nearly 355 MT till 3pm on Tuesday. The dispatches came against the allocated quantity of 378 metric tonnes for Tuesday, data available with the Centre showed. In addition, stocks with the hospitals were estimated at around 508 MT, with another 102 MT available with the oxygen suppliers which could be deployed for use, sources told TOI. Sources in the central government said that there are some logistical and operational issues, including the tankers taking longer to cross the borders to enter Delhi. Besides, hospitals such as AIIMS have sufficient stocks while some of the smaller ones are facing difficulties. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, however said, “241 MT and 355 MT are the oxygen supplies provided to Delhi against a daily requirement of 700 MT. The figure of 508 MT is wrong, as right now, the stock position in most of the hospitals, public or private, is not more than 10 to 12 hours. This is when each hospital is required to maintain minimum of three days of stock of oxygen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-supplied-entire-quota-of-oxygen-on-tuesday-centre/articleshow/82169330.cms||---

---||Dehradun||‘Double mutant’ SARS-CoV-2 was spreading in Uttarakhand even before Kumbh began||DEHRADUN: Days before the Kumbh Mela began in Haridwar, the highly transmissible “double mutant” variant of SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, had been circulating in Uttarakhand. A report from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) confirmed this on Monday. Every lab in the country testing for Covid-19 has to send 5% of its samples, randomly chosen, for genome sequencing to the NCDC. The Viral Research and Diagnostics Laboratory (VRDL), an ICMR-funded lab at the Government Doon Medical College in Dehradun, is the nodal lab for the state capital, which received reports of six samples. Of those, three samples from the last week of March, it turned out, were of the B.1.167 “double mutant” variety, which had been first reported in India on March 24. Experts believe it spreads faster and can infect those who are immunised. “The mutation in this variant is in the spike protein of the virus (which attaches itself to a receptor in the body). Most vaccines that have been developed so far target the spike protein. That is probably why those who have been vaccinated are also getting infected,” Dr Deepak Juyal, co-investigator at VRDL, told TOI. “Such mutations are worrisome and could affect the vaccination drive, but it is still too early to say for sure.” Right around the time this variant had started spreading, the Kumbh Mela began, on April 1. In the 20 days since, Covid-19 cases in Haridwar — which covers 80% of the Kumbh area — shot up from over 15,000 on March 31 to about 22,600 on Tuesday. The active ratio (number of active cases compared to total confirmed cases) went up seven times from 3.4% to 24.5% in the same period — which means of all cases Haridwar has had, a quarter are active now. In Dehradun, under which part of the Kumbh area comes, cases went up from about 31,000 on March 31 to about 43,000 now. The active ratio, too, went up seven-and-a-half times from 2.4% to 18%. Since Kumbh began, Haridwar and Dehradun alone have contributed over half of all cases in Uttarakhand. On Tuesday, the two accounted for 67.3% of all cases in the state. Another highly contagious variety, the UK variant, or B.1.351, had also been detected in two samples from VRDL, as had another variety which is still “under investigation”. Dr Shekhar Pal, principal investigator at VRDL, told TOI, “We have also sent 26 samples from the first week of April to the NCDC. We are waiting for those results.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/double-mutant-sars-cov-2-was-spreading-in-ukhand-even-before-kumbh-began/articleshow/82167587.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Stretched local civic war rooms to add 120 staffers||MUMBAI: The BMC will add 120 staffers to its Covid-19 war rooms this week to handle the overwhelming surge in daily calls. The BMC receives around 8,000 calls a day on its 1916 helpline and the 24 ward war rooms from Covid patients and their relatives looking for beds, ambulances and RT-PCR tests. BMC officials said they have begun to deploy more Class III staffers to help patients get beds and ICU beds, contacts of testing laboratories, ambulances and other Covid queries. Times ViewThe BMC’s local ward-level war rooms had helped lakhs of Covid patients since they were set up last year. Now as there is a surge in cases, they are overwhelmed with calls and there are several complaints that they do not respond on time. As mayor Kishori Pednekar said, all calls must be attended immediately and patients and kin must be given a response. The ward war room is a most critical mechanism in the Covid battle. It must be strengthened.“We are adding around 120 staffers who will work in three shifts. The war room operates 24x7 and so people have to be deployed for all shifts. We are deploying clerical staff who are experienced since they respond better and guide patients and their relatives,” said a civic official. The 24 ward war rooms already have a mix of BMC school teachers, doctors, engineers and local staff from the ward who take calls and help patients get a bed at a nearest hospital. Out of the 8,000 calls per day, the 1916 helpline gets around 5,000 calls and war rooms 3,000-odd. The BMC’s local ward-level war rooms had helped lakhs of Covid patients last year, said civic officials. In the initial days of the pandemic, there were several complaints that Covid patients were not getting beds. BMC chief I S Chahal then created a war room in each of the 24 wards and said any admission to a hospital will happen only through the war room which had to ensure asymptomatic patients don’t occupy beds and stay in quarantine. BMC officials said they resolved the bed crisis, thanks to the war rooms. “We are already operating at maximum capacity. Around 120 staffers will be added and they will join soon. Our staff responds to people and then directs them to hospitals. Many calls are for ambulances and RT-PCR tests. Regardless of the reasons, we respond to all,” said Mahesh Narvekar of the BMC’s disaster management unit. Mayor Kishori Pednekar visited the ward war room at Dahisar on Monday and asked the staffers to answer every call. “These ward war rooms are for Mumbaikars and you must pick up every call and respond to them. I called the Dahisar ward war room but I got a response after two-three calls. People should get a response in the first call. Action will be taken if there is any delay,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-stretched-local-civic-war-rooms-to-add-120-staffers/articleshow/82167585.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Delhi||Backs to the wall: Lack of oxygen, hospital beds drives people to desperation never seen before||New Delhi: In west Delhi’s Tagore Garden, the granddaughter of 74-year-old Veena Kumari was in a fix. The elderly patient with heart problems had oxygen levels hovering at an alarming 79-80%, but no hospital offered a bed since Monday night. “They kept her at a private hospital for half an hour and then discharged her,” the granddaughter said bitterly. “We tried several hospitals with no result.” When TOI talked to her, she was feverishly trying the helplines of Covid-designated hospitals. The lack of hospital beds and oxygen are driving families to a desperation they had never experienced before. Medical helplines are constantly engaged or unresponsive and even as bed availability is added on the Covid dashboard and flagged on social media platforms, they are gone within seconds.“My dad’s condition took a turn for the worse by early Tuesday. We have been desperately looking for a bed but haven’t got any till now,” fretted Akansha. Rajat Bansal is in a similar predicament. “We have been trying really hard for a bed for my uncle,” he said. “His oxygen saturation level is very low, but there is neither a hospital bed nor oxygen available anywhere.”Senior citizen Neeru Bajwa bewailed the day when she had to run around the city simply to locate a hospital bed for her son. “Eventually, after not getting a bed, we returned home and somehow managed an oxygen cylinder. My son’s condition is stable now, but the oxygen saturation sometimes dips to 91,” Bajwa said nervously.Among the thousands of Delhiites who have their backs to the wall is Stutee Ghosh. She needs an ICU bed with ventilator for her Covid-positive father who has developed shortness of breath with his oxygen levels dropping to 78-80. “I am desperately looking for an ICU bed for my father He has diabetes and his kidneys are affected He needs immediate hospitalization,” Ghosh stammered. “We tried many numbers, but the hospitals and Covid facilities are not answering the calls. The number of the DRDO facility is also switched off.”According to the Delhi Corona app, only 11 Covid ventilator beds were available at 12.30pm on Tuesday as the health infrastructure has been swamped by the intensity of the infection. Exasperated and helpless, people are going from hospital to hospital with their patients in tow, pleading for admission.S Sunder Rajan, 63, in this context, was fortunate. The family of the veteran journalist, resident of Mayur Vihar, searched high and low for a hospital bed for him and his wife, also Covid-positive. His fluctuating oxygen level, at one point, was at 86%. Ultimately, after a daylong effort, Rajan was admitted to a private hospital in Noida. Not everyone has been so lucky.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/backs-to-the-wall-lack-of-oxygen-hospital-beds-drives-people-to-desperation-never-seen-before/articleshow/82169381.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

On an average 5,000 passengers are arriving as well as departing from here with around 5-6 flights getting cancelled daily. The footfall had touched approximately 9,000 passengers last month. On Friday, a total of 31 flights arrived at the airport in which there were 2,736 passengers while 30 flights departed the same day plying 1,772 passengers. Similarly, the total number of flights which arrived and departed on April 17 which was the first day of the weekend curfew was 62 plying 5,437 passengers. This number of passengers increased only marginally on the second day of the weekend curfew with a combined figure of 5,788 passengers arriving and departing from the airport. On Monday the passengers decreased to 4,796 which came down to 3,310 passengers on Tuesday. J S Balhara, director, Jaipur International Airport, talking about the trend said, “In the first quarter of the year we had touched approximately 9,000 passengers which has now decreased owing to the Covid situation. Now most of the travellers are those who are probably residents of the state. There are few tourists, especially since curfew is in place.” Airlines operating are Air India, Indigo, Air Asia, GoAir and SpiceJet which are also cancelling flights. “The load of passengers is less from Mumbai because of which on an average 5-6 flights are cancelled daily,” added the director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/footfall-at-jaipur-airport-goes-down/articleshow/82169394.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Inmates with comorbidities have been transferred to separate cells, while new inmates are made to spend 14 days in isolation. Yoga and consuming ‘kaada’ have been made compulsory for inmates and jail staff to enhance their immunity. The second wave has already infected 107 inmates in the prisons till April 19. The prisons have 22,000 inmates. Many of these had become hotspots in the first wave. “Visitors are completely banned here till further orders,” said Rajeev Dasot, DG Prison. He added that they are undergoing a vaccination program for inmates of 45 years and above. “Almost 45% of such inmates have been covered and remaining will be covered on priority basis,” said Dasot. However, the department has made alternate arrangements for inmates to connect with their families. The department has made special arrangement for video conferencing and inmates can make phone calls for a limited period. Dasot has also directed jail officials to carry out RT-PCR of inmates who have Covid-19 symptoms. “Even if their report is negative, they should be kept in isolation for 7-10 days,” said Dasot. Zinc, vitamin C and multivitamin tablets will be given to staff and inmates for 10 consecutive days. To meet additional requirements, the prison department has allocated additional budget. The prison department has made elaborate health arrangements for inmates — from X-ray machines to doctors and nursing staff — to meet any medical emergency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-guidelines-for-jail-inmates/articleshow/82169362.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Rs 5,000 each to help migrants stay put||NEW DELHI: In a move to help prevent a migrant exodus from Delhi following the announcement of a weeklong lockdown, Delhi government will give each registered construction worker Rs 5,000, food, medications, shelter and other necessities. On Tuesday, the government formed a committee to oversee the relief work. Migrant labourers are crowding railway stations and bus terminals disregarding social distancing norms and Covid guidelines in a bid to return to their villages. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal appealed to the migrant workers on Tuesday not to leave the city and assured them that the state government would provide all assistance. CM Arvind Kejriwal has already made a similar appeal. Times ViewThe government’s decision to provide food and shelter to the migrants who have opted to stay back is a move in the right direction. In a crisis like this, governments must be proactive in helping those most vulnerable not just to the disease, but to its indirect fallout.“We propose to give Rs 5,000 to the registered construction workers as Covid relief due to lockdown with effect from April 20. The registration and renewal are being kept open and newly registered workers will also be covered,” announced Delhi Disaster Management Authority. Currently, Delhi has 1.71 lakh registered construction workers. In the last one year, the government conducted special camps to register the workers. Last year, the state twice provided an ex-gratia relief of Rs 5,000 to the 55,000 registered construction workers during the lockdown. The health department has been asked to link all major construction sites with dispensaries to provide medical care, while the area district authorities will deploy adequate manpower at the construction sites for the arrangement of food packets/ration provision. A 24x7 functional helpline number will also be set up for grievance management and all distress calls will be promptly attended to. The seven-member committee comprising senior Delhi government officials has been tasked to ensure the welfare of daily wagers, migrant workers, labourers and construction workers in compliance with the Delhi High Court directions, the DDMA order stated. The committee is headed by the principal secretary (home) and includes principal secretary (labour), director education, special secretary (finance), among others. “The committee will ensure that all basic amenities such as food and water, shelter, clothing and medication and other necessities are made available to daily wagers and migrant labourers during the Covid-19 pandemic,” the DDMA order states. It adds that the committee will ensure all such necessities are provided to the construction workers at the work site itself. The services of contractors providing mid-day meals to school children in government and municipal schools will be utilised to provide meals under this relief exercise. The finance department has been asked to arrange adequate funds, if required, in addition to the funds available with the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board for ensuring overall welfare. There are apprehensions that the crowding at the railway stations and bus terminals could aggravate the already high positivity rate of Covid infection. To facilitate travel for migrant workers, DDMA has appointed two nodal officers, Bhupinder Singh Bhalla, principal secretary (home), and Rajesh Khurana, special commissioner of police. They will be nodal officers to ensure smooth movement as well as welfare of the migrant labour force. All district magistrates have also been instructed to take necessary measures to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs5k-each-to-help-migrants-stay-put/articleshow/82169411.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||India||Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj forced to dial Uddhav, Yogi, Gehlot to ‘free’ oxygen tankers||BHOPAL: At a time when Madhya Pradesh is crying out for oxygen, there have been instances of tankers carrying oxygen to the state being stopped by officials in other states, like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Maharashtra. In some cases, it took calls from the CMO to get them released, say sources. In the last two days, officials in Gujarat and Maharashtra held up oxygen supply at the source points, where they were being filled up for delivery to MP. Chief minister Shivraj Singh spoke with the chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan over phone about the incidents, say sources in the government. The CMO said that the tankers were not held up by the governments of these states but by some local officials, either at source or when they were about to cross over to MP. “The issue has been resolved,” the CMO said. The Shivraj government has given ambulance status to oxygen tankers in MP. A green channel is created for them and they are escorted by police to ensure there are no hold-ups. “Every minute is crucial these days. Hospitals are swamped with Covid patients. Liquid oxygen systems and cylinders have to be refilled on a war footing as lives depend on it,” an official said, pointing out the Shahdol tragedy where at least six critically ill patients died as oxygen pressure dipped. On Monday, there were allegations that lack of oxygen led to deaths at a Bhopal hospital. All around, there is a desperation for oxygen. It’s common to see people carrying home oxygen cylinders on two-wheelers. Outside hospitals, patients’ kin wait in cars with oxygen cylinders. CM Chouhan has spoken with PM Narendra Modi, Union ministers and CMs of many states to ensure uninterrupted supply to Madhya Pradesh. MP has no oxygen plant, and is dependent on other states and private firms. The CMO said that 414 metric tonnes of oxygen is available in Madhya Pradesh now. On April 18, 390 MT of oxygen was available against a consumption of 347 MT. The government hopes to increase oxygen availability to 565 MT by April 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/madhya-pradesh-cm-shivraj-forced-to-dial-uddhav-yogi-gehlot-to-free-oxygen-tankers/articleshow/82171291.cms||---
---||Rajkot||First Covid patient of Guj turns water Samaritan||Rajkot: Smiles reappear on weary faces of Covid-19 patients and their relatives seeing a young man driving into the sprawling Chaudhary high school ground every morning. He carries hundreds of bottles of chilled water on his scooter and starts distributing them to people, providing the much-needed respite from the blistering heat and frustrating wait for hours to get admission into the Rajkot Civil Hospital. For 33-year-old Nadeem Sevangiya, who has a rather forgettable tag of being Gujarat’s first Covid-19 patient, the gratitude expressed by these hapless people is gratifying. Sevangia, a resident of Jangleshwar area, had tested positive for the novel coronavirus on March 19, 2020, after returning from a foreign tour. He recovered after a fortnight of hospitalization. “This second wave of Covid has been really cruel. People are painfully waiting in long queues and water is the basic requirement in this blistering heat. I have been distributing 600-700 bottles every day,” said Sevangiya, who has a factory making sewing machines in Kothariyanagar.He has been running this free service with this partner Jayprakash Khushwah. On an average, 50-60 vehicles including private vehicles and ambulances are lined up for three to four hours at any given time with patients awaiting hospitalization, some even seen with oxygen cylinders.The school is located right behind the hospital.Sevangiya now plans to start distributing tea at night. “The administration is now making arrangements for drinking water but I got a request that patients and their relatives don’t get tea during the night. I will soon start distributing tea at night to all people who are camping on the ground while their near and dear ones are under treatment in the hospital,” he added.Tea stalls close due to night curfew after 8pm and Sevangiya will start making tea at his house for people.Sevangiya lives in a joint family with parents, brother, wife and two children. In the last wave, Jangleshwar was the hotspot but this time there are very few cases in the area.Sevangiya also donated plasma after recovering and helped the police and municipal corporation teams manage the situation in Jangleshwar area when it was a hotspot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/first-covid-patient-of-guj-turns-water-samaritan/articleshow/82168362.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

As there is no clear directive from the Trichy Corporation, it is being dumped in the routine waste collection vehicle.Last year, the corporation had collected such waste through a separate mechanism including setting up a team and vehicles. The quarantined people were provided with yellow bags and told to dispose of their waste separately, which shall be treated as biomedical waste. However, with a lack of a separate mechanism now, the civic body is collecting such waste together. This has put sanitary workers at risk as they collect the waste from quarantined flats and segregate it before disposal.“We kept the waste generated by the isolated flats separately. As there was no separate collection, we dumped with the routine waste,” T Sudhakar, in charge of a gated community in Cantonment, said. A section of people under isolation who waited in vain for the separate waste collection was forced to dispose of their waste on their own. Corporation’s sanitary workers added that they are collecting the waste from houses of positive cases together. “Isolated people are mostly using cloth masks which they are not dumping in the waste. The risk of spread through the food waste of a Covid positive person is low. There was a separate waste collection process last year, we will consider a solution,” a senior health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/no-separate-waste-collection-from-those-in-home-isolation/articleshow/82169395.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Delhi||2,700 additional beds in next 5 days: Delhi deputy CM||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said the daily Covid-19 cases in the city might go into the 28,000-30,000 range and 2,700 beds would be added in hospitals in the next five days. Sisodia, who has been appointed nodal minister for Covid-19, said, “Delhi government is working on a war footing to increase the number of beds in the city hospitals.” Between April 3 and 20, the number of beds has been increased three times — from 6,071 to 19,101, Sisodia said, appealing to people not to rush to hospital in panic if they test positive. “If you are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, the most effective way to fight Covid-19 is through home isolation,” he said, urging people to religiously follow the weeklong restrictions. The Burari hospital has 320 beds, which will be increased to 800, and the capacity at Ambedkar Nagar Hospital will be made 600 from the current 200, and at Deen Dayal Upadyay Hospital, it will become 750 from 250. Acharya Shree Bhikshu and DRDO’s Covid care centres will get 250 beds each, while Satyawadi Raja Harishchandra Hospital of Narela will have 400 beds instead of the current 200. A Delhi government school, with 125 beds, will be connected to LNJP Hospital and the Commonwealth Games Village centre in east Delhi will have 500 Covid-19 beds. All these beds will be ready in the next four-five days. Around 2,500 beds are still vacant in Delhi, Sisodia said. He urged people to check the status of beds on the Delhi Corona app before going to a hospital as it would save time. Sisodia reiterated that the hospitals feeding inaccurate information into the app or refusing patients despite having beds would be dealt with strictly. Several patients are finding it difficult to get beds and some hospitals are also turning away patients citing non-availability of beds. He appealed to people not to rush to hospital unless necessary and to adopt home isolation as an effective model. The minister said, “Home isolation is the most effective way to fight Covid-19. During home isolation, doctors regularly keep in touch with people over the phone. Go to hospital only if you have high fever or severe symptoms.” During his visits to various hospitals, patients complained that doctors were not coming to see them. As doctors come in PPE kits, Sisodia said, patients often fail to recognise them. Earlier in the day, Sisodia, along with health minister Satyendar Jain, visited Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital in Rohini to take stock of arrangements and instructed the authorities to add 400 Covid beds. He also directed them to provide better service to patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-7k-additional-beds-in-next-5-days-sisodia/articleshow/82169403.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Pune||Wave of relief as batch of 1 lakh Covishield doses lands in district||Pune: District officials on Tuesday heaved a sigh of relief following the arrival of 1.1 lakh new Covishield doses. The consignment arrived just in time to replenish the region’s fast-depleting vaccine stockpile. The district was left with just over 19,000 doses of the vaccine. From Tuesday’s batch, Pune rural administration was allotted 55,000 doses. Pune city was given 35,000 doses and 20,000 shots were set aside for vaccination sites in Pimpri Chinchwad. Officials from the health department said they only got Covishield and not Covaxin. Limited vaccine availability was cited as the key reason for the sharp drop in coverage on Tuesday. Only 37,115 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the district, compared to the 58,228 people who got their jabs on Monday. Sanjog Kadam, deputy director of health services, Pune circle, said the latest batch of Covishield doses was distributed among civic bodies on Tuesday afternoon. The supply, he said, should be enough for the next two to three days. An official from the PMC said the civic body got its share of 35,000 doses by about 5.30pm. Distribution to sites began an hour later. The official said the hospital sites that could not collect the vaccines on Tuesday can pick them on Wednesday — distribution centres will be open from 10am to 1pm. Ayush Prasad, the chief executive officer of the Pune Zilla Parishad, said, “The current stock will last us three more days. Some sites will be shut on Wednesday for Ram Navami.”Jitendra Oswal, deputy director of Bharati Hospital in the city, said their site had completely run out of Covishield. He said they would stay shut on Wednesday. “If we’re able to get new doses, we will create a session for Thursday,” he added.Oswal said vaccine distribution has to be streamlined. “On Tuesday, we could vaccinate only 200 beneficiaries due to the limited availability of doses.”A report prepared by the public health department of Pune circle said in the first 20 days of April, over a million people have been given at least one dose of the vaccine. Prasad said nearly 7.77 lakh beneficiaries have been vaccinated in the rural areas. “We could’ve vaccinate more if there were enough doses available,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wave-of-relief-as-batch-of-1-lakh-covishield-doses-lands-in-district/articleshow/82169435.cms||Piyush Bhusari

In letters to the member secretary Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA), Taleigao panchayat, director tourism, and citizens under the banner of Vainguinim Valley Residents’ Association have stated that they have witnessed digging up of the beach with a earth moving machinery, building of a platform of 10m from and along the boundary and retaining wall of a resort and dumping of rubble along the beach. “This activity is in total disregard of the CRZ regulations laid down and the law. It shows encroachment of the beach which is public property and calls for immediate demolishing the same with restoration of the beach to its original natural state,” they stated in their letter. “This illegal activity should be immediately and severely dealt with in accordance with the rules and regulations and the laws laid down,” president of the association, Collin Curry, stated. The group also attached photographs showing the illegal construction and development on the beach within the CRZ zone.

Thaneer secretary K Sathish Kumar said this is the first time they have tied up with an educational institution for organised field visits and interaction. The students interacted with experts and innovators in organic farming. R Rincy Jaslin, a final year BSc agriculture student, said that visiting Vanagam — founded by green revolutionist G Nammalvar in Karur district — was a unique experience. She had read in books about permaculture, which is based on regenerative agriculture techniques, rewilding and community resilience. But Nammalvar had set an example by proving that a barren land can be brought to life with sustainable techniques, she added. K Santhanam, an organic farmer from Trichy, explained that agriculture will flourish only through organic farming techniques, which support microorganisms in the soil. “Inspects and microorganism will be good for the soil only if we coexist by allowing them to thrive in the soil by avoiding chemical fertilizers and insecticides,” he said. Students also visited the integrated vegetable market complex at Kallikudi, where they learned how the complex helps farmers ensure their produce reaches consumers without middlemen.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/students-interact-with-organic-farming-experts/articleshow/82169420.cms||---

North Delhi Municipal Corporation has now issued orders to keep all the six CNG furnaces in the crematorium operational 24x7 till the present situation continues. “Considering the emergency situation due to increase in Covid-19 deaths, the cremation capacity has been enhanced. All six CNG furnaces at Nigambodh Ghat will be functional for 24 hours on all days of the week till further orders,” an order issued by the public health department on Monday stated. Data available shows that out of the 192 bodies that were cremated at Nigambodh on Monday, 100 bodies were of Covid victims. As many as 160 cremations were held on Sunday, 126 on Saturday and 124 on Friday. In comparison, just 30 to 40 cremations were being held between April 1 and 4. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said to reduce the load on the biggest cremation ground of the city, the Inderpuri facility would now also cater to Covid patients’ bodies coming from Lok Nayak Hospital. “While Hindu rituals do not allow night cremations, but these are unprecedented times of a calamity and we have to accommodate these changes. If a family comes late around 8-9pm, we should not be returning them. All CNG furnaces will be available 24 hours a day,” he added. Officials from the public health department estimate that under normal conditions, Nigambodh Ghat can process 174 bodies a day — 120 wood-based traditional funerals and 54 CNG furnace-based cremations. East Delhi Municipal Corporation has also decided to keep its Karkardooma and Ghazipur facilities operational 24x7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cremations-at-night-to-tackle-record-death-surge/articleshow/82169432.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||Most Covid patients don’t need admission or steroids: Doctors||NEW DELHI: At least 85% of people recover from Covid-19 without any specific treatment in the form of Remdesivir, steroids or any other drugs, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said on Wednesday. Addressing issues related to Covid-19 along with Dr Devi Shetty, chairman of Narayana Health; and Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman of Medanta; through a video conference, Dr Guleria said most patients had features like a common cold, body aches, fever, sore throat, and some might have gastritis, over five to seven days. “They will recover with just symptomatic treatment, which means just taking paracetamol, keeping yourself hydrated during your regular exercise, taking your vitamins, and just being positive about your health,” he said. “Only 15% of the people who may go on to what we call moderate disease where your oxygen saturation may fall or you may have high-grade fever require close monitoring and care.” Follow TOI's live blog for latest updates on CoronavirusDr Shetty said that if anyone had symptoms like bod ache, fever, cold, cough, indigestion, diarrhoea or vomiting, he should get tested for Covid-19. “If you’re not able to get the test done on the same day, please isolate yourself. If you turn out to be positive, you don’t want to end up infecting all your family members.” Every household now has at least one or two pulse oximeters, which are not expensive, he said. “Oximeters are very reliable. Check your oxygen saturation at least once in six hours. Then walk for six minutes, and again check it. If your oxygen saturation is staying about 94%, no problem. But if it is falling after the exercise, you need to call your doctor. It’s very, very important that you get the right treatment at the right time.” Dr Trehan said it was important for a patient to let the treating doctor understand her or his symptoms and severity, and age and abilities before giving his advice. After a patient is assessed, “the treatment can be started at home right away. If there is a significant drop in oxygen, and the doctor advises admission, you may do so”, he said. Very few patients will require hospitalisation, Dr Trehan said, adding that people shouldn’t use or reserve oxygen just for a security blanket. “It should be used judiciously, and any patient who needs it should get it,” he stressed. The AIIMS director said Covid-19 vaccines prevented people from getting severe illness though it might not prevent the infection.

To help their relatives, North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Tuesday decided to create a mechanism for real-time monitoring of the availability of funeral pyres. Mayor Jai Prakash said a central control room would also be set up to give people real-time data about the status of funeral pyre availability. “All cremation and burial grounds and cemeteries will be integrated with the system. We have already issued helpline numbers for biomedical waste lifting, vaccination and disinfection,” he added. Delhi government already runs a real-time hospital bed availability app. The data from the civic bodies states that 357 Covid-protocol funerals were held on Monday alone while the number reached 410 till 7pm on Tuesday, further stretching the already burdened facilities.The north corporation has also started to set up a 10-acre funeral facility in Rohini Sector 26 where a crematorium, burial ground and a cemetery are being developed. The land has been allocated by Delhi Development Authority, said the mayor, who will visit the site on Wednesday. The civic body has allocated three acres each for three sections. More cremation pyres will be created along the Yamuna ghats, Jai Prakash added. The Covid funeral report of the municipal corporations states that out of the 357 Covid-protocol funerals on Monday, 100 were carried out in Nigambodh Ghat and 53 bodies were cremated in Punjabi Bagh, the two main creamtion grounds that are bearing the bulk of such funerals in city. The Nigambodh Ghat facility alone caters to the bodies of Covid patients coming from LNJP, GB Pant, Hindu Rao, St Stephen’s, Aruna Asaf Ali and Sant Parmanand hospitals and Sushrut Trauma Centre. The north corporation mayor said the capacities of all major cremation facilities under the civic body were being enhanced. “The Nigambodh Ghat facility is creating new funeral pyres. If we include the Panchkuiyan, Beri Wala Bagh, Inderpuri, Wazirpur and the Mangolpuri crematoria, the north corporation will be able to administer 308 funerals in a day,” he added. A senior east corporation official said 39 bodies of Covid victims were received till 5pm on Tuesday at its five Covid-designated centres. “Twenty-four bodies were received at the Seemapuri, six at Karkardooma, seven at Ghazipur and two at the Shastri Park facilities,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/277-deaths-in-a-day-central-control-room-and-real-time-monitoring-to-tackle-funeral-rush/articleshow/82169448.cms||Paras Singh

While some restaurants are trying to salvage the situation by offering home delivery, many have shuttered their businesses. “I have closed down my restaurant because I cannot provide home delivery. The dine-in experience we offer is our USP. We are into premium segment and the home delivery model does not fit into our kind of services,” said Ashish Sharma, a restaurant owner. Sharma said out of his 28 employees, 10 have gone home and he has been providing food and accommodation for the rest for the 15 days curfew period. “But if the curfew is extended, I cannot do much for the staff that I currently have. I have to pay rent and electricity charges (fixed) even though the restaurant is closed. There are other costs as well,” added Sharma. It’s not a happy situation for those offering home delivery through Zomato and Swiggy or through their channels. They sell only 15-20% of what they did before the curfew was clamped. The government’s 8pm deadline is not helping their cause. “The daily business has been reduced to 15-20% of our earlier transactions. The 8pm deadline should be extended to 11pm. The sun does not set properly by 8pm and people don’t even think of what they want to eat by that time,” said Varun Behl, owner of a leading restaurant chain in the city. Behl said that home delivery requires a skeletal staff, but as of now they have made arrangements for accommodation and food for all their employees. The situation will be difficult if the curfew is extended further, he added. Abid Nagra, another restaurant owner, who has shut down his outlet following the curfew said that home delivery is not an option if there are not enough orders. “We have to pay the salary of the staff, electricity charges and there are other expenses. So, home delivery does not suit everyone. For home delivery, one needs to have a certain price range above which there would not be much demand,” added Nagra. Even if the curfew is not extended, the business will not be back to normal immediately, feels the industry. “It will take at least over a month for the customers to feel comfortable to visit restaurants. So, the road ahead is not easy,” added Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/eateries-want-home-delivery-up-to-11pm-as-biz-crumbles/articleshow/82169438.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Delhi||Curfew gives drugs smugglers a high||NEW DELHI: In a span of 24 hours, the Crime Branch intercepted two huge consignments containing around 1,945kg of marijuana brought to Delhi from areas on the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha border. This is the biggest recovery of marijuana by Delhi Police in recent times. According to DCP (Crime Branch) Bhisham Singh, the first consignment contained around 445kg of marijuana, while the second had around 1,500kg. The recovered cannabis is worth around Rs 10 crore in international market. “In the first operation, we have arrested two smugglers Mosim from Okhla and Sabir Ali from Meerut. A truck, in which 12 plastic bags having the marijuana were hidden behind bananas, was seized,” Singh said. The arrests were made by a team comprising ACP Pankaj Singh and others on a tip-off that a Odisha-based gang will come to Dera village to supply the cannabis. A trap was laid on the intervening night of April 18 and 19 and their vehicle was intercepted. The arrested duo are UP-based carriers who were paid for every trip that they made to the capital for a successful delivery. “In the second operation, a smuggler named Aas Mohammad was arrested and 1,500kg marijuana in 43 sacks was seized. The Marijuana was procured from Odisha and Andhra Pradesh border forest area. The contraband was to be supplied to Delhi NCR,” the DCP added This arrest was also made by ACP Singh and others who laid a trap in the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday from Mathura Road. Sources said these large consignments were sent to the capital in the wake of a massive spurt in demand by city peddlers amid the ongoing lockdown, which has also led to a surge in the price of good quality weed. A large chunk of the seized consignment is the Seelavathi variant, which is in high demand due to a mellow high it gives. Police suspect more consignments may be pumped into the capital and are scanning any possible movements among the cartel members. The identity of the receivers is also being ascertained and a crackdown on the peddlers associated with the cartel is expected in the coming days, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/curfew-gives-drugs-smugglers-a-high/articleshow/82169480.cms||---

The Dehu Road police have registered a case against the kin for beating up hospital staff and damaging the pharmacy store. The hospital is the only Covid care centre (CCC) in the cantonment limits. The police have identified six suspects for beating up the hospital staff. Sub-inspector S Gobale said, "We have so far managed to identify six suspects from the CCTV footages. There were 15-20 people involved in the crime. We are identifying other suspects. We are yet to make any arrest in the case." R Harital, chief executive officer, Dehu Road Cantonment Board, said, "The patient had come to the hospital on April 16. His oxygen saturation level was less. So, our doctors had advised the patient's family members to admit him at another hospital since our hospital doesn't have ventilator beds." "On April 19, the patient again came to the hospital with his brother and other family members at 10.30am. Upon checking his health condition, doctors found that his oxygen saturation level was 37, which was very low. He passed away before we could shift him to another hospital," Harital added. "The family members of the patient clearly told us that that they could not admit him at another hospital. Meanwhile, a group of 15 -20 people came to the hospital, assaulted our guard and ward boy and misbehaved with the doctors. We have submitted CCTV footages and documents of the patient to the police for further investigation," said Harital. The loss of the hospital's property is being assessed by cantonment authorities, said officials. Gobale said, "We are verifying the documents of the deceased patient. We will also record statement of the relatives."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/irate-kin-assault-dehu-road-cantt-hospital-staff-damage-pharma-store-after-ncov-patients-death/articleshow/82169451.cms||---

The temple management did not allow devotees to participate in the procession. While the temple management had live-streamed the festival, poor efforts in publicising it left many devotees unaware.The temple car circumnavigated the inner corridors of the temple, with a limited number of people including temple priests, workers and officials attending it. Between 10am and 12pm, when the temple car procession was underway inside the temple, devotees were stopped at the entrances and allowed into the shrine only after the procession. Usually, one lakh people visit the temple during the car festival, but the footfall this time was around 30,000, officials said. Last year, the event was suspended due to the lockdown. The Chithirai festival is scheduled to conclude with the float festival on the night of April 23. Special prayers will be offered for the deity at Vasantha Mandapam. Devotees are likely to be prohibited from attending the special prayers as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/chithirai-car-festival-held-in-samayapuram-sans-devotees/articleshow/82169449.cms||---

Trials on some taxis are already going on, he said. With the backhand services of the device being handled by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), efforts are also in place to upgrade the digital meters to an app-based taxi service. “In Goa, there is a need for transparent, reliable and cheap transport services as far as taxis are concerned. It is not necessary that we do it only through app-based aggregators, it can be done through digital meters as well,” he said. Godinho said that the installation of these devices will ensure point to point monitoring, no scope for overcharging, transparent operations while the backhand services by the NIC will give all the required data. “There is also a panic button on the device,” he said. Godinho further said that he has “asked the NIC to tweak their service to Goa in such a way that any person can book the taxi from their phone,” with the help of the installed app. Despite already having app-based operations, the digital meter is mandatory for GoaMiles as well, he said. The taxi operators will be reimbursed for the digital meters with its cost being borne by the government. After fitment, the taxi operators will be reimbursed with 50% of the total amount and a year later when they recharge the device, the remaining 50% will be released. “Almost 80% problems will be solved if these devices are installedWe will soon revise fares as well.” Godinho said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/digi-meters-from-may-1-likely-to-be-app-based/articleshow/82169475.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The state government pointed out that if number of beds are increased, they will require more oxygen for treatment. As the Centre has taken the distribution under its own control, the state has asked the Union government to increase supply for Covid treatment.“The current requirement of oxygen in Rajasthan is 136 metric tonnes, but the state is getting 65 metric tonnes. The Centre is sending 35 metric tonnes from Jamnagar but the supply has not reached yet,” said Raghu Sharma, health minister. “For saving life of people of the state, there is requirement of oxygen, but oxygen plants are under the Centre now. From Bhiwadi’s oxygen plant, which is generating 120 metric tonnes, Rajasthan is getting only 65 metric tonnes,” said Sharma. The health department is keeping an eye on the rising demand of oxygen in hospitals for Covid patients’ treatment. Orders have been issued to all the collectors to form committees at their respective districts. The chairperson of the district will be an RAS officer, nominated by the collector, the other two members are assistant drug controller and one district-level officer nominated by the district collector. The committee will analyse and assess the availability of oxygen, its demand, consumption not only in government hospitals, but also in private facilities. The committee will ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen to ospitals. For the purpose, a round-the-clock control room will be set up. The panel will remain in touch with the state-level control room and when needed senior officers (IAS), deployed by the state government, will resolve the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-hospitals-gasp-for-oxygen-as-supply-dives/articleshow/82169462.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Is Bhopal health infra ready for Covid surge?||Bhopal: With active cases in the state capital getting closer to 10,000-mark, health department is anticipating that 70% of the patients would only require home isolation. There are an estimated 6000 Covid-19 beds for medical treatment. The number of ICU and high dependency units with oxygen flow are running to capacity in Bhopal. Contingencies are in place, but for average patient, getting critical care hospitalisation is increasingly hard to come by. “70% cases will require home isolation. For the rest, there are sufficient beds available,” said Bhopal chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Prabhakar Tiwari. Health department gives the impression that public health infrastructure can handle the surge in Covid cases. For instance, there are more than 1,000 ICU beds in Bhopal. Nearly all of ICU beds are occupied. District administration is looking at expansion of Covid-19 care beds in two private hospitals. Around 1000 beds have been added. However, given the unprecedented demand for oxygen supply and Covid-19 drugs, there is a lot of apprehension. Dashboard that shows the availability of ICU and Covid-19 beds in the state capital has not been updated. Observers also point to the lack of transparency on the part of some hospitals on availability of ICU beds. Instances of people being refused treatment as a result have been cited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/is-bhopal-health-infra-ready-for-covid-surge/articleshow/82168380.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Hearing Covid PIL, livid CJ says ‘we know what politicians do’||MUMBAI: Chief Justice Dipankar Datta of the Bombay high court made an indignant remark against the political class on Tuesday while hearing a PIL on Covid-19. The court also sought the BMC and the government's response to the PIL, which was on the shortage of Covid beds, oxygen and the drug Remdesivir. The PIL highlighted difficulties faced by Covid-19 patients and their relatives. The bench, comprising the chief justice and Justice Girish Kulkarni, expressed displeasure at a politician’s comments in exhibits to the PIL; the reference was to BJP leader Kirit Somaiya’s Tweets. "Why do you include politician’s comments? Are you interested in the poor, underprivileged and needy or you want to highlight political issues?” the CJ asked. Advocate Arshil Shah, for the petitioner advocate Sneha Marjadi, said he will omit the relevant pages. The judges said the PIL should have been confined to the people concerned and the petitioner being an advocate should have been careful. “What politicians do we very well know…We are not influenced by political comments," the CJ remarked. Marjadi cited her personal experience after testing positive for Covid: delay in rapid antigen test results, her husband being asked by a nursing home to bring a doctor’s prescription to take the test, and her aunt being hospitalised and the family asked to arrange six vials of Remdesivir. Marjadi urged the HC to monitor the drug's supply at a consistent price to stop black marketing and panic buying. “People are losing lives waiting for beds. Even after that the ordeal never ends,” Shah said, pointing to a picture of a woman receiving oxygen in a rickshaw. The court told the state’s advocate, "Take complete instructions. The PIL has raised serious concerns about the control and spread of the pandemic." It posted hearing for Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hearing-covid-pil-livid-cj-says-we-know-what-politicians-do/articleshow/82169531.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Trichy||One-way violation causes chaos near MGMGH||Trichy: One-way violation by vehicles where the stormwater drain reconstruction is underway on EVR Road causes frequent traffic chaos. People depend on the road to access several hospitals including Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Medical College Hospital. Ambulances rushing to hospitals with critically ill patients were often struck in the snarl-ups on the Allithurai Road abutting the MGMGH. Trichy Corporation is reconstructing the stormwater drains from Bharathidasan Road till Puthur covering EVR Road, to convert the existing drains into smart drains with provisions for ducts to transmit cables. As part of the project, a portion of the Allithurai Road that branches off from EVR Road was dug for constructing the drain. Only one-way traffic is allowed on the road with the exception for vehicles going to Bishop Heber College, Vayalur Road and Bharathi Nagar. But, all sorts of vehicles are plying on the road violating the one-way rule, leading to frequent traffic bottlenecks. While vehicles from Vayalur Road are supposed to use only the Puthur High Road and Puthur signal, several vehicles including autorickshaws are approaching the EVR Road through the half-dug Allithurai Road violating the one-way rule. “The one-way rule was not followed strictly by people at the wheels. As a result, vehicles often get piled up near the MGMGH. Peak hours are a menace,” Dr Sri Hari, a frequent commuter, said. While traffic police frequently check vehicles near the Bishop Heber College, they seldom punish the violators. For those who frequent the government hospital for Covid-19 tests, traffic snarls on the EVR Road have become a frustration. Meanwhile, traffic police personnel said that steps will be taken to decongest the EVR Road where drain reconstruction work is going on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/one-way-violation-causes-chaos-near-mgmgh/articleshow/82169474.cms||Deepak Karthik

He asked for at least a month’s time to come up with a solution and requested the protesting tourist taxi operators to call off their strike. “We have asked them to call off the agitation for one month. If the problem is not solved within a month’s time, then they can go on strike again,” Godinho said. A delegation of the taxi operators met with the minister at the secretariat in Porvorim on Tuesday to have a dialogue on the taxi issue. TOI had earlier reported that they have been demanding the scrapping of Goa Miles, and have kept their vehicles off road for over a week in protest. Godinho said that the talks were very cordial and meaningful and that “any problem can be resolved through discussion across the table”. He said that the taxi association was not taken into confidence when the GoaMiles started operations. “It is due to this lack of confidence that the taxi operators are not able to accept GoaMiles. Therefore, though a section of society is welcoming the app, the entire taxi fraternity is against it,” he said. Godinho said that the taxi counters are in the process of being transferred from the tourism department to the transport department. One of the counters will be given to the united taxi union and the other to Kadamba Transport Corporation limited (KTC), he said. “Within a week the counter will be transferred to us and a week after that, there will be a lot of changes happening. Following which, we will have another round of talks with them and arrive at a good solution,” he said. “We have assured them that we will come out with our own app to operate .” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/transport-minister-asks-for-a-months-time-for-solution/articleshow/82169459.cms||---

The police said two more persons, who were preparing such fake reports, were on the run. “The gang was operating for about four-six weeks, ever since several states made it mandatory for travellers from Maharashtra to carry a RT-PCR negative. We suspect that the gang has prepared more than 500 such fake reports,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. A police team, led by senior inspector Balkrishna Sawant, arrested Rakeshkumar Vaishnav (25) of Dhankawdi and Pattaram Devasi (33) of Wakad on a tip-off from assistant inspector Sagar Kate. “Based on Kate’s information, we sent a decoy customer near the bus stop along the bypass. The decoy gave money to one of the two. He returned in 15 minutes with the PDF file of the Covid-19 negative report in the decoy’s name on his smartphone,” Krishna Prakash said. “The police then swung into action and arrested Devasi and Vaishnav. The duo admitted that they used to get the fake report from their two accomplices.” he said. The commissioner said the suspects were using reports from a lab each in Bavdhan and Shivajinagar. “We verified with the labs and no one from there was involved in the racket. The signatures on the fake reports were scanned,” he said. The Modus The arrested suspects are travel agents. They would promise negative RT-PCR report to passengers travelling to Gujarat and Rajasthan at Rs 600 per report. After getting the travellers’ Aadhaar card number, they would generate a fake negative RT-PCR report within 15 minutes. “The police have recovered 28 such fake reports from the duo’s cellphone. The duo and other two on the run would equally split the money,” Krishna Prakash said. The police commissioner also held the travellers equally responsible. “Although the passengers did not know whether the reports were fake or genuine, they certainly know that this is not the procedure to obtain RT-PCR report,” he said. They have been arrested under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Maharashtra Covid-19 Rule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-bust-fake-rt-pcr-test-reports-racket-2-travel-agents-held/articleshow/82169502.cms||Mihir Tanksale

However, these vehicles are compelled to pay a toll at the rate of Rs 250. He submitted that appropriate adjustment should be made so that the road users are charged according to the distance travelled by them and not for the full distance.A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that from the counter affidavit filed by the NHAI, they find that the concessional rate of toll is available for different categories of road users who are frequent users in the toll road. The judges observed that they are of the view that the blanket relief sought for by the petitioner cannot be entertained and hence dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-to-exempt-certain-vehicles-from-toll-at-chittampatti-plaza/articleshow/82169477.cms||---
---||Delhi||Amid Covid surge, corporations to suspend OPD at 3 major hospitals in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Amid a surge in demand for Covid beds in Delhi, municipal corporations have decided to suspend outpatient departments and surgeries in a majority of departments at Hindu Rao, Swami Dayanand and Tilak Nagar hospitals. The aim is to create space for Covid patients, divert staff to corona wards and minimise chances of transmission of the virus. After East Delhi Municipal commissioner Vikas Anand visited Swami Dayanand Hospital on Monday, a decision was taken to allowOPDs only for gynaecology and paediatrics departments, senior citizens and MCD pensioners at the hospital. “Most of the OPDs at Swami Dayanand have been closed, including orthopaedics and ENT departments. We will be using staff from these departments for Covid services. There is a plan to increase the number of beds to 50 by Wednesday and 30-35 more beds will be added on Friday. Total 80-85 beds will be readied by the end of this week. For gynae and paediatric patients, senior citizens and MCD pensioners, visiting hours for surgeries will remain the same,” said Dr Gladbin Tyagi, nodal officer for Covid programme in the hospital. “We will take some time to discharge the patients already admitted in the hospital. The vaccination exercise will continue without any break,” said another EDMC official. At Hindu Rao, a decision has been taken to increase the bed capacity from existing 210 to 350 by Thursday evening/Friday for Covid patients. “When the number of beds will increase, there won’t be any scope for allowing patients in other departments. All patients as well as surgeries in gynae department have been diverted to Kasturba Hospital and it will take a few more days to discharge or shift the people who are already admitted in different wards,” said North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash. He added that services for vaccination, Covid testing and thalassemia would continue. On Tuesday, South Delhi Municipal Corporation started its 20-bed Covid ward on the second floor of Tilak Nagar Hospital. There is no provision for surgeries at the hospital and the health department aims to close all OPDs here in a phased manner. “The centre will have a total of 100 beds for Covid patients in the next 2-3 days. Patients with mild symptoms referred by the Delhi government’s nodal officer are being admitted here. SDMC is bearing all the cost of upkeep and maintenance and has deployed a team of doctors, nurses, sanitation workers and other required staff. For doctors, healthcare workers and other SDMC staff deployed at this centre, SDMC has arranged accommodation facilities at nearby hotels like Piccadily, Surya, etc,” the leader of the House Narender Chawla said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/amid-covid-surge-corporations-to-suspend-opd-at-3-major-hosps/articleshow/82169466.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||Shutters down, roads deserted as Delhi cooperates to ward off Covid||NEW DELHI: On the first day of the weeklong lockdown, Delhiites largely followed the rules, though roads were not as deserted as they were during the weekend curfew. Due to exempted activities like government offices and essential services, some crowd was seen on key roads. However, the markets, crowded till last week, were largely deserted. Delhi Police personnel were seen monitoring the movement to ensure that people do not violate the lockdown guidelines. Domestic servants are not allowed during this period and liquor shops are closed. The weeklong restrictions have been imposed as a last resort because the hospitals are under extreme stress. The move is aimed at breaking the chain of novel coronavirus infection. This lockdown is less restrictive as compared to the one imposed last year. Public transport services are allowed and people can go to catch a flight, train or a bus — not running during the last lockdown — if they have a valid ticket. Home delivery from restaurants are also permitted. Government officials and those of autonomous bodies, PSUs and municipal corporations and people engaged in police, emergency services, electricity, water and sanitation, public transport and other essential services have been expempted to ensure uninterrupted delivery of public services. People moving for getting healthcare services along with an attendant, Covid tests and vaccination are also exempted. An official said most people were out on the road for essential purposes and were allowed. “Almost all shops in the markets were closed except those dealing in essential services like milk booths, chemist shops. In residential areas, some people were seen moving around for essential supplies,” said Devinder Jain, general secretary of Federation of All India Vyapar Mandal. Delhi Metro, public buses and other modes of public transport were operating but carrying only exempted people. Public parks, private offices dealing in non-essential items, shopping centres, malls, weekly markets, manufacturing units, educational & coaching institutes, cinema & theatres, restaurant & bars , auditoriums, entertainment parks, gyms, spas, barber shops and beauty parlours were shut as per the Delhi Disaster Management Authority order. Teams of the district administration also kept a watch at sensitive places to ensure that the guidelines are not violated. Those found indulging in non-essential movements were fined and in some cases some people were also booked. The lockdown is likely to affect the vaccination coverage because many people feel discouraged to venture out for the jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shutters-down-roads-deserted-as-city-cooperates-to-ward-off-covid/articleshow/82169525.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Kolkata||ATC places 20% force on standby to fight Cov crisis||Kolkata: The crucial air traffic navigation wing at Kolkata airport, which oversees safe movement of aircraft in the entire eastern region, Northeast and over the Bay of Bengal, held an emergency meeting on Tuesday to draft a roster with a reserve force to ensure services were not disrupted due to the spread of the novel coronavirus among air traffic control officers (ATCO)s. Seven ATCOs have till now tested positive for Covid-19, while four more are suspected to have also contracted the virus. “We have decided to keep 20% of the force in reserve to meet exigencies. In each shift, around 10 people will be on reserve to step in if others have to be quarantined,” an official said. The ATC strength in Kolkata is around 310, with 52 people deployed in each shift. Together, they are responsible for the safe movement of nearly 1,000 flights a day. The area control, which guides flights heading into and out of the region as well as those passing over Kolkata, either on domestic or international routes, currently operates from the fourth floor of the ATC building. In addition, there is a tower control on the eighth floor that guides planes that land and take off from the city. The reserve force will be on standby at their home, ready to be deputed at short notice in an emergency. “This contingency is to ensure that the ATC in Kolkata remains functional even if one member of the team on duty develops Covid-19 symptoms and requires everyone on the shift to be put in home isolation. The reserve force will then take over the surveillance and navigation of flights from a sanitized and sealed contingency room on the third floor of the ATC building,” the official said. Last year, too, such extraordinary measures were taken during the lockdown, when the fear factor was high but cases were fewer. Though the reserve force did not have to be deployed, the situation is different this year. with the scale of contamination posing a challenge to maintain regular operations. In other sections of the airport, like terminal management, airside operations and the administrative office, a dozen employees have been infected and quarantined so far. Here, too, around 20% of the workforce has been kept reserve on a rotational basis to ensure that operations are not affected. In the administrative section, human resource and finance department are the worst hit, with multiple cases being reported there. Half the staff in the administrative building have been asked to work from home to lower the risk of infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/atc-places-20-force-on-standby-to-fight-cov-crisis/articleshow/82168401.cms||Subhro Niyogi

A few routes such as Madurai-Trichy witnessed a decent patronage of 50% while private buses too had fewer passengers. A TNSTC official in Madurai said more buses were operated on routes which had good demand. Only about 65% of the usual services were operated till Tuesday evening while city buses had far lesser crowds. However, they did not bring down the number of city services and operated even air-conditioned ones, he said. “Around 850 vehicles are used for mofussil services from Madurai region consisting of Madurai, Virudhunagar and Dindigul districts on a usual day. On Tuesday, around 550 buses were operated till evening,” said the official. SETC officials said buses were not operated in the afternoon as they cannot reach their destination before 10 pm, the time prescribed by the government to wind up. With passenger footfall drastically down, taxi and autorickshaw drivers suffered. Hotels located on the bus terminal premises and next to them saw far less sales. Only those who had urgent work and job-related activities took up travel. P Sivasakthi, a resident of Melamadai, said, “I was planning to visit Chennai this week but put it off. What if the government intensified the lockdown because of the fast spreading infection? We do not want to get struck in Chennai,” he said. The Tasmac management planned to distribute tokens expecting a good crowd in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/only-65-inter-district-buses-run-in-madurai/articleshow/82169492.cms||V Devanathan

And we have to keep up this work even in the coming days. This is the need of the hour,” the former chief minister said in a statement to Congress party workers. “Use your connections and get people oxygen, injections, medicines and other daily necessities. Humanity is looking towards you with hopeful eyes. Embrace the path of service, ignore the criticism and work for humanity,” Nath said. The senior Congress leader asked party workers to be alert, stay safe and follow Covid guidelines. He said that Mahatma Gandhi taught Congress the principles of dedication and service to the nation. “We need to follow that path today. Congress’ history is based on service, dedication and building the nation. We are again seeing that time when Congress will have to play the same role for which the party is committed,” Nath said. Nath appealed to Congress workers not to pay attention to those who question their ideology, level allegations and question their intention to serve the people. “Take personal care of your safety and go ahead to serve and help those in need,” he said. Nath said, “Those who are running the government seem to have totally failed at this crucial hour. They are only making false claims. When we question them, they forget to take account of the people’s condition and start a blame game against us. The state’s deteriorating health system has been entirely demolished.

It will become an issue later that the state failed to vaccinate the above 18 population,” health minister Raghu Sharma said on Tuesday. The Centre has empowered states to procure additional vaccine doses directly from the manufacturers, as well as open up vaccination to any category of people above the age of 18 for the same. “The success of vaccination of above 18 depends on the availability of the vaccines equal to the number of beneficiaries. It will be the responsibility of the Centre to ensure availability of the vaccines for above 18,” said Sharma. The state government had demanded from the Centre to allow vaccination for people above 18 years. Concerned over limited supply of vaccines from the Centre,the state claimed that the Union government had taken the responsibility of vaccinating people aged 45 years and above, but majority of them have still not received the doses. “There was a time when we put boards mentioning unavailability of vaccines. We had done preparations and prepared storage facilities. We have a capacity of vaccinating 7 lakh doses per day, but we have only 14 lakh doses available. The 14 lakh doses were sent after we wrote letters at different levels to the Centre,” said Sharma. While the state is witnessing sudden spurt in Covid cases, the health department has issued directions to the officials to scale up vaccination drive (above 45) in areas which are worst affected for preventing moratalities. Also, collectors have been asked to ensure vaccination of staff of police department, revenue department, public health and engineering department, power department, bank employees, labourers, grocers, vegetable vendors, medical stores, street vendors, milk sellers, journalists and hawkers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-questions-centre-on-vax-availability/articleshow/82169500.cms||---

While a delayed nesting season for Olive Ridley turtles would otherwise continue till June, with rain-soaked eggs rotting in pits, this year has been different as the last batch of hatchlings from 24 nests crawled out to sea recently. Climate change and other factors have tweaked the October-March nesting schedule in recent years. From the late arrivals in January, the turtles continue surfacing till May. “There were 24 nests at Morjim and 2,496 eggs, of which 1670 hatchlings were released into the sea. As many as 628 eggs were spoilt and 149 hatchlings were found dead, possibly due to higher temperatures,” a forest department source said. The flippered visitors that started arriving in January this year, dug 20 nests in less than two months at Morjim. The shorter period and frenetic egg-laying activity surprised forest department officials managing the conservation programme. “Two to three nests were even laid within a day or two,” a source said. Goa’s coast has been visited by Olive Ridleys for nesting since hoary times — it is believed those born on the coast always return to breed — and used to be entirely accessible to them. After tourism became one of the mainstays of the state’s economy, four sites, two each in north and south Goa, had to be designated under Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) 2011 as nesting sites. Two nests from the tourism hotspots of Baga and Candolim were relocated to Morjim and one from Mandrem — the lesser visited protected site. After a modest turtle conservation effort was started in Morjim in the late 1990s, the idyllic site was a paradise for turtles till shacks, bright lights and tourism impacted nesting activity. “We are, however, not sure if the season has indeed ended as turtles may turn up during full moon shortly,” an official said. At South Goa’s Agonda and Galgibaga nesting sites, the incubation period is not yet complete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hatchlings-from-24-turtle-pits-in-morjim-make-dash-for-the-sea/articleshow/82169495.cms||Paul Fernandes

Neelachal Apartment has set up a four-bedded quarantine facility for residents on the ground floor with the provision for oxygen cylinders, pulse oximeters, online doctors for consultation, separate entry, washrooms, kitchen, PPE kits, medicines, etc. Akash Attre, a resident of Neelachal Apartment in Sector-4, said a similar facility was created during the first wave of Covid-19 in April last year. “After the district administration emphasised upon developing isolation facilities in gated societies recently, we decided to set up the quarantine ward again to tackle the scarcity of beds in hospitals. It has been developed to offer immediate help to the needy residents from the apartment. We have kept four oxygen cylinders,” explained Attre. “We have tied up with the doctors of nearby hospitals who will provide consultation and also recommend hospitals in case a patient’s situation deteriorates,” he said further. Unlike Neelachal Apartment, Delhi Journalists’ Apartments, Sector-13 doesn’t have a suitable space where quarantine facilities can be set up. But the society members have kept some medicines, oxygen cylinders and PPE kits to tackle emergencies. “We have made arrangements for oxygen cylinders and concentrators for emergency use of Covid patients. Oxygen supply can be provided at home for at least 24 hours till a patient gets a room in a hospital. We have even arranged for medicines, masks, saline bottles, life-saving drugs, PPE kits and gloves. In-house doctors trained a team of residents to help them in emergency situations,” said Jai Kumar Sharma, president, managing committee, DJA Apartments. Residents of Vasundhara Apartments, Sector-6 have sought help from the DM office for establishing a 6-8-bedded isolation centre. “Our society currently has 15 Covid patients and the numbers may rise. We desperately need some facility,” said Rajiv Arora, secretary, Vasundhara Apartments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dwarka-societies-gear-up-to-tackle-emergencies/articleshow/82169486.cms||Vibha Sharma

A senior Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said similar plan was afoot for more private companies that are currently under approval. PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal told TOI, “Around 40 companies have been approached and the process of site verification/line list of their employees aged 45 years and above is on. We recently vaccinated around 400 employees of Cummins Technologies India Private Limited in Pune. More private companies, such as Bharat Forge, Bajaj Finance and Hyatt Hotel, are under approval. Government departments, including the women and child development, income tax, Pune Agriculture Produce Market Committee and forest, have also been approached.” Another PMC official said 100 CDAC employees were vaccinated on Sunday as part of the drive. Asked if the shortage of vaccine doses was likely to affect the workplace inoculation drive, he replied, “The shortage is unlikely to impact the programme, as the number of employees eligible for inoculation per company is limited.” Agarwal said a request or proposal has to be first sent by a company, after which the PMC sends a consent form. Based on the consent form filled by the organization, a site inspection is done by the PMC medical team. Nurses and a team of doctors visit the temporary vaccination site on the company premises for inoculating. “The (district) health authorities deploy the vaccination team at government workplaces. The private Covid vaccination centres have to deploy the inoculation teams at the private workplaces,” district immunization officer Dr Sachin Edake told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-gears-up-to-inoculate-5000-employees-at-40-organizations/articleshow/82169512.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Goa||As Covid cases, deaths hit record high in Goa, show goes on in packed night clubs||PANAJI: In the thick of the night, far from the "watchful" eyes of the state’s authorities, sweaty clubbers are crammed onto a dance floor, jumping and swaying to thumping techno notes or Punjabi beats as North Goa’s nightlife revels in its groove, Covid be damned. Amid the dim lighting, strobe lights reveal barely a mask, and revellers appear to believe that the electronic beats have forced the novel coronavirus pandemic to beat an early retreat in Anjuna, Vagator and Morjim. The state government has restricted gathering of people in the wake of the surge in Covid-19 cases, with gatherings of more than 50 persons not allowed in North Goa without prior permission. Surprisingly, this does not apply to the tourism sector. “The restrictions on events apply to those events such as zatras, rallies, weddings and parties, and don’t apply to restaurants, bars and clubs who have a license to organise events regularly,” said north Goa collector Ajit Roy. “Naturally, we are worried about the increase in cases,” he said. Anyone with the right contacts can find all kinds of gigs on offer, from Tollywood night and karaoke to rock-n-roll and electronica. On Facebook, a post screams “Biggest season closing gig on April 30 and May 1” as it invites everyone for “a rejuvenating lifetime experience” at a resort in Morjim. Ma Faiza, a notable artist in the electronic dance music space, will be playing at what is touted as “India’s first hot air balloon party and yacht party” at Morjim. On Monday, health minister Vishwajit Rane expressed alarm over social distancing norms being thrown to the wind at clubs and restaurants. Rane urged youngsters to stop partying. “I have seen that many restaurants are crowded,” Rane said. “Parties are happening on weekends in Morjim and elsewhere. It is a free-for-all. People are seen dancing in clubs without masks. Action has to be taken against such clubs.” This is not the first time the health minister has urged his own government to take stronger measures to curtail the spread of the pandemic. And this is not the first time that chief minister Pramod Sawant has ignored Rane. On Sunday, the North Goa coastal belt remained abuzz even though the number of domestic tourists have declined over the last few days. “The dance floors are still full. There are clubs which still have crowds, but perhaps they are not aware of how bad the situation is,” said a DJ who performed at a club over the weekend. Several clubs have advertised themed parties for Tuesday and Wednesday. “Sing your hearts out with strangers who will leave as friends. We want you to have a great time and forget your woes,” said Hopping Frog in an advertisement. The bar in Anjuna has “moved” and directions have to be obtained through a phone call. Social media is replete with instances where domestic tourists came to Goa, partied hard, and took back memories and Covid-19. The medical fraternity is aghast over the continued violation of social distancing norms and Covid protocols. On Tuesday, Goa hit a record with 1,160 new cases of Covid-19, taking the state’s count of active cases to 8,240. The state also lost 26 people within a span of 24 hours. “If this rate goes up, our facilities and infrastructure will fail,” said Dr Samuel Arawattigi, past president of the Indian Medical Association’s Goa unit. “For the last one and half year we have been struggling with Covid. In this scenario, having parties, weddings and celebrations is detrimental, and then the lockdown will be the only solution,” he said. Not all clubs have put money over health. Some have hit the pause button for the coming days. “As concerns about the current Covi-19 outbreak grows, Team LPK has monitored the situation closely and decided to remain shut until further notice. We have always prioritised the safety of our customers and staff in this uncertain time,” said Nandan Kudchadkar, a nightclub owner. Some of Goa’s DJs, too, have also cancelled their gigs, and in the bargain, have not just taken a financial cut but also attracted the ire of industry stakeholders. “Breaking the chain is the best way to fight this virus, and to do my part in my personal capacity, I cancelled all my gigs for the next three weeks,” said DJ Mackenzie Pereira. “This is done in the interest of Goa and Goa’s tourism and nightlife. If we break the chain now, we will have a better season tomorrow.” A few other individuals, restaurants, pubs and event organisers have taken similar steps, but for the rest, the show goes on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-covid-cases-deaths-hit-record-high-in-goa-show-goes-on-in-packed-nightclubs/articleshow/82170347.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Delhi||As deaths mount, cremation capacity upped||New Delhi: The daily Covid-protocol cremation capacity in the city has been increased to 655 bodies from 500 after 410 bodies reached Delhi’s crematoria and burial grounds on Tuesday. Three crematoria — Lodhi Road, Dwarka Sector 24 and Subhash Nagar CNG facilities, will now operate as the Covid-exclusive facilities. On Tuesday, multiple crematoria were so crowded that waiting hours for grieving families got extended by several hours while pyres continued to burn till late in the night at the Punjabi Bagh and Nigambodh Ghat facilities. The pace of increase in such funerals has been so rapid that the capacities are being revised for the third time in the past week, said an official after a joint meeting of the civic public health departments, which oversee these operations, on Wednesday. The funeral sites also cater to non-Covid bodies, he pointed out. On Tuesday, the eight Covid-designated funeral sites under North Delhi Municipal Corporation received 177 bodies, South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (SDMC) nine facilities 193 and East Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (EDMC) six facilities 40 bodies. Multiple centres actually cremated more bodies than their capacities to manage the rush. While 12 funeral pyres are reserved for Covid-protocol funerals at the Beri Wala Bagh facility, it conducted 14 cremations. Similarly, the Panchkuiyan Road crematorium catered to 24 victims as against a capacity of 15 cremations and the Dwarka Sector 24 centre cremated 27 bodies as against its capacity of 23. “Seeing the situation on Tuesday, it was necessary to raise the daily quota for Covid-protocol funerals. It has been raised to 295 at the north corporation facilities, 289 at SDMC’s units and 71 at the EDMC centres,” a senior official said. With more than 80-90% of the pyres already reserved for Covid funerals in major crematoria in the city, they may soon face a shortage of space for non-Covid cremations if the corona body load continues to rise. During the first wave last year, only the Punjabi Bagh cremation ground was made a Covid-exclusive facility, though the load of bodies had often forced the authorities to reserve all 23 funeral platforms at the Dwarka Sector 24 facility. Along with the Dwarka facility, the electric furnaces and 24 wooden pyres at the Lodhi Road crematorium and the Subhash Nagar CNG facility will now cater to only Covid needs. An SDMC official said that instead of taking non-Covid bodies to bigger cremation grounds, relatives should go to smaller facilities in the neighbouring areas so that the load on the key facilities would be less. “Wherever empty space is available inside a crematorium, we are creating additional platforms so that the overall capacity can be enhanced,” the official added. The north corporation is also setting up a 10-acre funeral centre in Rohini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-deaths-mount-cremation-capacity-upped/articleshow/82187127.cms||Paras Singh

The scheme expired on March 24. Expressing shock over not renewing it for 27 days, the MP asked the government to renew it without delay. The MP stated that the scheme had covered public healthcare providers who may have to be in direct contact and care of Covid-19 cases and who may be at risk of being impacted by this. It also covered private hospital staffs, volunteers, workers of local bodies, contract and daily wage workers, ad hoc and outsourced staff requisitioned by state and central hospitals and autonomous hospitals of central and state governments and UTs drafted for Covid 19 related responsibilities. “These frontline workers deserve more empathy from the government,” the MP said. He said a letter from secretary, department of health and family welfare, Rajesh Bhushan dated March 24 stated that only 287 claims had been approved and settled by the insurer. He expressed concern that many eligible claims had not been processed in a proper manner and urged the ministry to issue clear cut guidelines to the insurer and to the respective governments for effective implementation of the scheme. The MP quoted the letter as stating that claims under the scheme were eligible for coverage only till midnight on March 24 and that the last date of filing such claims is April 24. “It raises the question over the fate of frontline workers who lost their precious lives after March 24 till renewal of the insurance scheme ,” he said. Venkatesan said expiry of the scheme and delay in renewing the policy or bring a new scheme has caused much concern among frontline workers. “This laxity on the part of the government is unfortunate. Such inaction has dented the morale of frontline workers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mp-urges-centre-to-renew-health-cover-for-warriors/articleshow/82169526.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Char Dham yatra can’t turn into ‘another Kumbh’, says HC, asks Uttarakhand govt for SOPs||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Tuesday asked the state government whether any SOPs had been prepared for the Char Dham Yatra, which is scheduled to start from May 14.  The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma, while hearing a bunch of PILs concerning the state’s handling of the pandemic, made an oral observation that the pilgrimage “cannot be allowed to turn into another Kumbh”. The government in its response said it will soon release Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the yatra. Chief secretary Om Prakash, who was present at the hearing through video conferencing, said that the SOPs would be decided at the cabinet meeting scheduled on Thursday. He said that at the meeting issues like curfews, lockdown and functioning of colleges will also be discussed and a policy formulated on how to handle the current situation (of surging coronavirus cases). State tourism minister Satpal Maharaj had said that Covid-negative certificates would be mandatory for Char Dham pilgrims from outside the state but no government order was released to the effect. The court has also directed the state government to inform them, by the next date of hearing on May 12, about the availability of vaccines and Remdesivir in the state. A drug widely prescribed to Covid-19 patients, Remdesivir has been in short supply in Uttarakhand in the past few weeks. “The court further directed the state to seriously consider sending mobile testing vans to interior regions so people in remote areas can be tested. It said that the number of Covid-dedicated hospitals should be increased, as it currently has only five such hospitals and that is not enough to tackle the pandemic. The government has also been told to increase the number of ICU beds, provide oxygen cylinders and ensure and increase the provision of PPE kits,” said Dushyant Mainali, a counsel appearing for one of the petitioners. Another advocate present at the hearing, Shiv Bhatt, said that the government has also been directed to inform what actions have been taken against hospitals that are not earmarking 25% of available beds for patients from poor backgrounds. Bhatt said the state has also been asked to publish information of all hospitals and vaccination centres online so it can be easily accessed. The HC has directed secretary (health and finance) Amit Negi to file a detailed report on all these issues by May 12 and be personally present at the next date of hearing before court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/char-dham-yatra-cant-turn-into-another-kumbh-says-hc-asks-ukhand-govt-for-sops/articleshow/82167645.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Delhi||Delhi: Over 20,000 guest teachers left without job till end of summer vacation||NEW DELHI: Over 20,000 guest teachers working in different Delhi government schools have been left high and dry yet again. In an order, the Directorate of Education (DoE) has asked schools to suspend the services of guest teachers from April 20 till the summer vacation ends. On Monday, Delhi government had announced that in view of the rising Covid-19 cases, the summer vacation would now begin from April 20 and end on June 9. The DoE order stated, “All heads of schools are hereby directed to discontinue the services of all guest teachers engaged in their school wef from April 20. However, during the vacation period, heads of schools are hereby authorised to call guest teachers as per requirement for any school-related work while maintaining Covid-appropriate behavior and following the standard operating procedure. The guest teachers who shall be called during the summer vacation will be paid as per norms.” Last year too, guest teachers had faced a similar situation during the lockdown. Many of them had to resort to selling vegetables and working in a tyre shop to eke out a living. All India Guest Teachers’ Association member Shoaib Rana said, “As the summer vacation has been advanced, we are likely to lose out on our salaries. With Covid cases surging, we will not be able to do other jobs as well. In a bid to save some money, the government is not realising that there are several families that are dependent on the earnings of the guest teachers.” Guest teachers working in Delhi government schools on average get paid over Rs 30,000 per month. They get paid on the basis of the number of days they have worked. Another guest teacher said, “Before Covid, there used to be camps and remedial classes during summers where we used to get work. Now, when permanent teachers are also there, why would any school head call the guest teachers? At this time of crisis, the government should not have taken this decision.” All India Parents’ Association has also appealed to the government to reconsider the decision. “The state has to work for the welfare of the people, but Delhi government has instead put the guest teachers in a precarious situation,” said Ashok Agarwal, president of AIPA. Government officials did not respond to TOI’s queries in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fresh-blow-over-20k-guest-teachers-left-without-job-till-end-of-summer-vacation/articleshow/82169545.cms||---
---||Goa||Selaulim, Ganjem water augments Khandepar river||Ponda: With the water level in Khandepar river dipping due to the summer heat, the water resources department (WRD) has been augmenting it with water sourced from Selaulim dam and Ganjem water scheme. However, the scenario is better than last summer, with the river’s level at Opa basin currently at 3.9m on April 19 as compared to 3.6m to the corresponding date last year. While WRD fetches 35MLD water from the Mhadai river at Bolcornem Bandhara which is poured into the Ganjem river which flows into the Khandepar, the Selaulim treatment plant pours 48MLD water in the Kaley river that flows down to the river basin from where the Opa water treatment plant draws water for treatment. The Opa Water Works, that has a total of five water treatment plants (WTP) at Opa ward in Khandepar village of Ponda taluka, enables supply of potable water to over 95% of Ponda and Tiswadi talukas. This includes Panaji, Bambolim, Taleigao, Ribandar and the entire taluka of Ponda. Earlier, the Opa Water Works with four WTPs used to draw 125 MLD water, and following the commissioning of the new 27MLD plant, the Opa Water Works now draws over 160 MLD water from the river basin regularly. During peak summer, i.e April and May, the water level reduces due to evaporation and ground seepage, and hence the river basin needs to be rejuvenated by augmenting water from other sources. “Sometimes the water quantity at the drawing point goes below the required level and to maintain the level, continuous augmentation of the river is needed,” Pramod Badami, WRD superintending engineer said. He also said that there are a total 18 bandharas over Khandepar and Kalay rivers, with a capacity of 21.8 lakh CuM of storage water in 12 bandharas over Khandepar River and a total 4.5 lakh CuM storage water spread in six bandharas over the Kalay river.  “But this year, so far no bandhara has been opened till now,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/selaulim-ganjem-water-augments-khandepar-river/articleshow/82182449.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Goa||Meet with Godinho fails to break standoff with cabbies||Panaji: The taxi operators’ meeting on Tuesday with transport minister Mauvin Godinho failed to break the ongoing standoff between the private taxi operators and the state government. After the meeting, taxi operators said their vehicles will continue to remain off the road till the state government comes out with a legally valid order scrapping app-based taxi services offered by GoaMiles in the state currently. “We are returning to the strike venue at Azad Maidan in Panaji, where our strike will continue. The government can arrest us or take whatever action they wish, but we will remain off the road till the time it is put into writing in black and white that app-based taxi services are scrapped,” said Laximan ‘Bappa’ Korgaonkar, a private taxi operator, who was part of the delegation of 15 to attend the meeting with Godinho. Korgaonkar said the transport minister asked taxi operators to give the state government at least a month to come out with a solution to the private taxi operators’ demand. “He can take a month or two to take action, but we will continue our strike till then. The minister was going round and round and had nothing new to offer us. We had gone to him with a single-point demand that we want the app-based taxi services scrapped in the state. He did not even have a short-term solution to satisfy us,” said Korgaonkar. Another taxi operator Sunil Naik said they will be getting their family members to the strike venue at Azad Maidan. “They can arrest our women and children too, we are ready to face the consequences,” said Naik. Earlier, the taxi operators got into heated arguments with transport officials. The private taxi operators were waiting outside the ministers’ block at the Secretariat Complex to be summoned inside, but they received no call to attend the meeting well past the scheduled meeting time of 4.30pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/meet-with-godinho-fails-to-break-standoff-with-cabbies/articleshow/82169534.cms||---

The MSEDCL said consumers could send their metre reading photograph on MSEDCL app to get a bill based on actual consumption. MSEDCL’s Pune zone’s public relations officer Nishikant Raut said with the rise in micro-containment zones in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, entry for metre readers in many societies remained barred, forcing them to send an average bill. Wakad resident Sachin Londhe said his society, which was declared a micro-containment zone a month ago, has already received average bills. Underground cables in Sangvi were damaged on 405 occasions last year due to road digging for civic works, an MSEDCL statement said. On March 26, damage was so extensive a 50 MVA transformer of the transmission firm broke down, affecting 1.9 lakh consumers in Sangvi. The power utility urged the civic body to consult its officials before allowing road digging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/avg-power-bills-for-sealed-areas/articleshow/82169518.cms||Piyush Bhusari

According to S Gandhimathi, an agricultural labourer and native of Sengapaduthankadu village near Pattukottai, her son S Dinesh, 25, and the company he was working with had been ordered by a Saudi Arabian court to pay Rs 29 lakh each as compensation to the family of the deceased. Since both had not remitted the penalty, her son was still in jail. Gandhimathi said Dinesh’s father Singaravelu and elder brother passed away a few years ago. Thereafter, he was forced to quit college and join a driving school where he became a trainer. He subsequently joined a company in Saudi Arabia as labourer on August 3, 2019. Dinesh did not have a driving licence provided by the Saudi Arabian government, but his company was forced to operate a truck and wanted him to drive it. Though Dinesh refused initially, the company promised to get him a new driving licence soon.Meanwhile, on October 26, 2019, the truck driven by him met with an accident resulting in the death of a Saudi man. Dinesh was arrested and jailed. Though Gandhimathi petitioned the then Thanjavur district collector, DMK MP S S Palanimanickam and MDMK leader Vaiko for help to free her son from jail, no action was taken, she stated in the petition handed over to collector Govinda Rao. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/mother-of-man-jailed-in-saudi-seeks-govt-help-for-his-release/articleshow/82169529.cms||---
---||Goa||Another grim record for Goa with 26 deaths, 1,000+ new cases||PANAJI: Goa reported record highs in fresh Covid-19 infections and fatalities on Tuesday, with 1,160 new cases and 26 deaths being logged over the past 24 hours as the coronavirus rages through the length and breadth of India’s tiniest state. As many as 54 people have lost their lives to the virus over the past three days itself, pushing the toll to 927. The count of active cases now stands at a staggering 8,240. In terms of both, new cases and mortalities, Tuesday witnessed the highest single-day rise since the pandemic began in March last year. While the positivity rate dropped to 32%, the recovery rate also decreased to 87% with 440 patients declared cured. Of the total casualties over the last 24 hours, 16 were reported from the Goa Medical College (GMC), eight from the South Goa district hospital, and one each from the Betki primary health centre in South Goa and a private hospital in North Goa. Six of the victims were less than 50 years old, with the youngest being a 34-year-old man from Thane in Sattari. Also, many who succumbed to the virus on Tuesday did not have any comorbidities. The 72-year-old man from St Estevam who died at the Betki primary health centre was in home isolation. Two women — a 69-year-old from Bicholim and a 53-year-old from Quepem — and a 75-year-old man from Salcete died within hours after being rushed to hospital. The caseload of the Margao urban health centre inched closer to the 1,000-mark, while Vasco’s increased to 507. Porvorim primary health centre’s caseload shot past 700 and Panaji, Mapusa and Ponda reported over 500 active cases each. Sakhali, Bicholim, Valpoi, Colvale, Siolim, Curchorem, Navelim and Shiroda have been reporting a high number of cases too. Health minister Vishwajit Rane, who recently admitted that the administration had not expected that the requirement of oxygen would rise exponentially, visited the GMC on Tuesday to review arrangements for its supply to Covid-19 patients. He also said regular out-patient departments (OPD) would continue to function but that staff should be given protective gear. Rane interacted with health officials along with health secretary Ravi Dhawan, during which it was decided that auxiliary nurses and midwives (ANM) would call up Covid-19 patients who were under home isolation, reminding them to monitor their oxygen saturation levels and training them to use their kits. Mobile testing vehicles will also be made operational for rapid detection of cases. “We have instructed the directorate of health services to ensure that all the requirements are projected in advance to ensure that we are equipped to face any challenge,” Rane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/another-grim-record-for-goa-with-26-deaths-1k-new-cases/articleshow/82170350.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: District gets 3,000 new remdesivir vials, shortage set to ease||PUNE: The district on Tuesday received 3,000 new vials of remdesivir. Officials said daily supply to the region will now increase from Wednesday (April 21). "The shortage of remdesivir will start fading out as supply slowly improves. The daily allocation is expected to increase," said Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune branch. Pune district has received a total of 85,000 vials of the antiviral injection since April 1. But supply has been very irregular. "There were days in between when we didn't get a single vial and had to face the public's anger. We're hoping the drug's supply improves from Wednesday as quite a few pharmaceutical companies are now ready with their supplies," Pratapwar said. There are now more than one lakh active cases of Covid-19 in the district. More than 25,000 patients are admitted at various hospitals, including those in institutional quarantine. The daily requirement of the remdesivir has gone up to 15,000 vials. Doctors have urged families not to consider remdesivir as the sole drug against Covid-19. It is to be used only in hypoxic Covid patients or those with inducible hypoxia, they said. The district administration had also decided to allot remdesivir vials only to those Covid hospitals whose names are on the district administration's dashboard. But a discrepancy in the list (of hospitals treating Covid patients in Pune city) provided by the PMC and district health officials has led to confusion in allotment. "Officials should, at least, ensure that daily allocation to listed hospitals is replenished on a regular basis," said BL Deshmukh, president of the city chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-gets-3000-new-remdesivir-vials-shortage-set-to-ease/articleshow/82169532.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Fire in Kailasot green belt, activist alleges foul play||BHOPAL: Environmental activists have alleged foul play after a major fire broke out at Kaliasot area here on Tuesday. Similar loss of green cover was alleged during the lockdown last year in the green belt. Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) rushed in multiple rounds of fire tenders till afternoon. “We do not investigate into the cause of fire. Fire has been doused,” said BMC commissioner, KVS Chaudary. The fire began at around 8am in the area, where tiger movement has been significant. “Mapping is to yet take place in the area, after a National Green Tribunal (NGT) order of February 2020. The NGT order came after a report by Union government and the area was a declared a deemed forest,” said green activist Rashid Khan. He sent emails to the top echelons of the state government and ministry of environment as soon as he reached the spot. “We have found that where fire took place, many of the trees were already chopped,” he alleged with pictures to back his allegation. During the last lockdown, similar chopping of trees took place, he also alleged. Khan expressed apprehension that when mapping takes place of the area, significant area would not be counted as green belt. Around 2500 trees have been lost in the past year, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/fire-in-kailasot-green-belt-activist-alleges-foul-play/articleshow/82168394.cms||---

The government will identify buildings that can be converted into Covid care centres where patients with mild to moderate symptoms can be admitted for treatment. Currently, the state has 42,886 beds in isolation wards, 8,532 oxygen beds and 2,326 ICU beds. The number of active cases is more than 70,000. The government has issued directions to the CMHOs to ensure that hospitals give priority to Covid treatment. More and more beds should be reserved for Covid patients in hospitals. Spaces in hospitals lying vacant should be utilised for accommodating more beds. At district levels, a committee has been set up under collectors having an RAS nominated officer as chairperson, deputy chief medical officer and one district administration officer nominated by collector. The committee will also ensure that treatment of Covid patients should be provided at their own district’s dedicated hospitals. The committee will prevent unnecessary referrals of patients from one district to another.

Within a week of the policemen, including a DSP, being killed by the gangster and his men using sophisticated firearms, there was a spate of encounters in which Dubey and his five associates were killed by UP police teams. As many as six PILs were filed in the SC, which on July 22 last year had approved the UP government’s decision to institute an inquiry commission headed by former SC judge Chauhan and comprising former Allahabad HC judge Sashi Kant Agrawal and former DGP K L Gupta. The commission submitted its report to the UP government on Monday after eight months of intense yet futile search for independent witnesses who could give a version that was different from the police narrative about the encounter killings. The report is in the process of being filed in the SC. While the armed assault on the police raid party happened in the dead of the night on July 3, the encounter killings of Dubey and his associates happened in broad daylight. “And yet, there was no independent witness who came forward to depose and give evidence that was at variance with the police version of the encounters,” a source, who went through the report, told TOI. “It is a case of no evidence against the police,” the source said. The commission gave repeated advertisements in newspapers requesting media personnel who reported on the encounters and termed it as fake to come forward to give evidence, but no one appeared before the panel. The commission had also distributed pamphlets in villages near the encounter sites requesting people to narrate the incidents. “There were independent witnesses who deposed supporting the police version,” the source said. The Justice Chauhan Commission lamented in its 130-odd page report — which is accompanied by 600 pages of documents relating to dummy enactment of encounters at all encounter sites, questioning of each policeman involved in the encounters and statement of witnesses — that no person from the media, citizenry or even the relatives of Dubey and his killed gang members came forward to testify before the panel despite summons to them. The commission had served summons on Dubey’s wife, relatives and residents of villages to which Dubey and his gang members belonged. “No one came forward,” the report said. Justice Chauhan has reportedly devoted an entire chapter to record the commission’s “total disappointment” with the media, which ramped up coverage of the alleged fake encounter, for not coming forward to give evidence or supply footage of the incidents.

However, the scenario is better than last summer, with the river’s level at Opa basin currently at 3.9m on April 19 as compared to 3.6m to the corresponding date last year. While WRD fetches 35MLD water from the Mhadai river at Bolcornem Bandhara which is poured into the Ganjem river which flows into the Khandepar, the Selaulim treatment plant pours 48MLD water in the Kaley river that flows down to the river basin from where the Opa water treatment plant draws water for treatment. The Opa Water Works, that has a total of five water treatment plants (WTP) at Opa ward in Khandepar village of Ponda taluka, enables supply of potable water to over 95% of Ponda and Tiswadi talukas. This includes Panaji, Bambolim, Taleigao, Ribandar and the entire taluka of Ponda. Earlier, the Opa Water Works with four WTPs used to draw 125 MLD water, and following the commissioning of the new 27MLD plant, the Opa Water Works now draws over 160 MLD water from the river basin regularly. During peak summer, i.e April and May, the water level reduces due to evaporation and ground seepage, and hence the river basin needs to be rejuvenated by augmenting water from other sources. “Sometimes the water quantity at the drawing point goes below the required level and to maintain the level, continuous augmentation of the river is needed,” Pramod Badami, WRD superintending engineer said. He also said that there are a total 18 bandharas over Khandepar and Kalay rivers, with a capacity of 21.8 lakh CuM of storage water in 12 bandharas over Khandepar River and a total 4.5 lakh CuM storage water spread in six bandharas over the Kalay river. “But this year, so far no bandhara has been opened till now,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wrd-sources-selaulim-ganjem-water-to-augment-khandepar-river/articleshow/82182447.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

As a result, garbage started piling up in streets and burning of it has become rampant in various parts of the city.City residents say that garbage piling for days together will lead to health hazards for people in close proximity. Burning of garbage will not only pollute the environment, but also create respiratory problems to elderly people residing nearby. Door-to-door collection of garbage is also not being carried out regularly, forcing the residents to dump it on roadsides. S Malaiarasan, a resident of Tamil Nagar in Anaiyur, said, “Garbage is being dumped at the street corner in our area due to the poor implementation of garbage collection. Instead of clearing the dumped garbage, corporation employees burn it there. Officials should watch out for such activities and take stringent action against those involved in burning waste,” he said.V Kalamegam, a social activist from Palanganatham, said that garbage clearing has taken a hit in the last couple of weeks. As a result, garbage is piling up in all streets in Palanganatham, which comes under Ward 76 of Madurai Corporation. “There are three dumper bins at Vanamaamalai Nagar. Garbage overflows from the bins and it is not being removed even once in two days posing health issues to the residents,” he said.Residents say that garbage is not being cleared properly in many parts of the city. The situation is worse in the newly-added and peripheral areas. Single-use plastic bags constitute the major portion of waste as traders have started using them recently, while the officials have turned a blind eye towards its usage. It clogs the channels often. Though the corporation strictly implemented waste segregation at source, it is not being followed at present, they said.A health official from Madurai Corporation said that adequate care will be given to the garbage collection and disposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/garbage-piles-up-as-madurai-corpn-diverts-staff-for-covid-works/articleshow/82169535.cms||V Devanathan

While TN had 79,808 active cases, Chennai had 28,005 such cases, including 3,711 fresh ones. The state’s total case tally was 10.13 lakh (10,13,378) and toll 13,205. By 3pm, the control room at the directorate of medical education that manages patient flow in state-run hospitals and covid care centres reported that just 25% beds were available at the five Covid facilities in the city four government medical college hospitals and government covid hospital in Guindy which together have 4,368 beds. Totally, there were 3,269 Covid patients at these facilities. “We direct patients with more than 50% lung involvement to medical college hospitals. Most of these patients require tertiary care with oxygen support,” said director of medical education Dr R Narayanababu. Patients with less than 50% lung involvement requiring intermittent oxygen support are sent to health care centres, he said. Of the 1,800 beds in 11 such centres across the city, 648 (36%) were occupied. Patients with mild symptoms are advised home isolation or sent to Covid care centres. On Tuesday, of the 11,645 beds in 14 covid care centres, 5,559 were occupied. Among the 114 private hospitals in Chennai providing Covid Care, 108 of them had updated their status on the state webpage(https://stopcorona.tn.gov.in/). Of these, 32 hospitals had 100% occupancy or more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/25-beds-available-in-5-govt-facilities-in-city/articleshow/82169544.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune civic authorities can get 400 more beds ‘if they activate two key facilities’||PUNE: The city can get at least 400 more Covid beds if civic facilities currently lying unused are reactivated to treat patients. The PMC had started a Covid care centre, complete with oxygen-supported beds, at a sports complex in Kharadi. It has a capacity of more than 300 beds capacity, including 100 oxygen-supported cots. But it hasn’t been used in three months. Another such unit is the ESIC hospital on Satara Road. Only 30 of its 100 beds are currently being used. Occupancy at the unit can be raised if oxygen supply is boosted. Both the Aam Adami Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have now urged the PMC to increase capacity at the two facilities. AAP members said the facility at the Vithoba Maruti Pathare sports complex in Kharadi was started with 400 beds. They claimed that the unit has not been put to its full use despite having infrastructure such as oxygen pipes and a supply system. “Keeping such a big facility unused is a waste of public funds,” said AAP member Abhijit More. Madhuri Misal, the BJP MLA from Parvati constituency, said, “The PMC should ensure the ESIC hospital has a supply of medical oxygen.” She said at least 10 ventilator-supported and 90 oxygen-supported beds would be available at this facility. “The PMC is running the hospital at reduced capacity. If oxygen is supplied to the unit, 70 more beds can be set up. The hospital already has doctors and other paramedical personnel in place,” Misal said. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said the PMC has approached the state government to boost its number of beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-civic-authorities-can-get-400-more-beds-if-they-activate-two-key-facilities/articleshow/82169538.cms||Prasad Kulkarni
---||Goa||Goa: Patients left in lurch as Covid test results reach late or never||PANAJI: Even as the Centre has directed states to test, track and treat to tackle the surging pandemic, the Goa government is still struggling with something far more basic — letting citizens know the results of their RT-PCR tests. The unfortunate consequence of these delays is that patients unaware of their Covid-positive status are turning serious and spreading the infection to others. Several citizens who got Covid and recovered told TOI that they haven’t received their test result SMS till date, and had to rely on “contacts” and “favours” within the health department to know their status. A Panaji resident, Aldrin Monteiro, who did an RT-PCR test at the Panaji urban health centre on April 1, was promised the results in 24 hours. He got to know that he tested positive only on April 3 evening, after persistently calling up the health centre. He received an SMS stating that his sample was sent to Mapusa district hospital for testing, but nothing after that. The delay took a toll on his health, and on April 5, he was told he had moderate pneumonia and needed hospitalisation. “When I kept calling the health centre, they told me I would get a call back only if I tested positive,” he said. “Whether the result is positive or negative, I have a right to know. There has to be a system in place because the deterioration levels in Covid are very quick in some patients. Medical authorities don’t begin treatment unless you have the positive results or unless you’re already serious. They just give you vitamins in the meantime.” He added that if he had got his results on time, he would have begun treatment sooner and perhaps skipped hospitalisation. Timely results will also avoid the spread of the infection during the unrelenting second wave, he said. This is the only drawback in the system that needs to be fixed, he says. “The services at South Goa district hospital, where I underwent treatment, were above average and shockingly good,” he said. “I had no contacts in the hospital or in the government, but I received excellent treatment. Cleanliness was on another level.” In a more recent case, a Porvorim resident got tested at the Panaji urban health centre on Saturday and received no SMS informing him of his results. If it weren’t for his friend who had “contacts” in the directorate of health services, he wouldn’t have found out in time that he had in fact tested positive. “It was very stressful waiting for the results,” he said. “They should have informed me immediately so that I could get the home isolation kit and start checking my oxygen levels.” “The government is talking about the three Ts, but how will they track and treat patients if their reports are delayed by four to five days,” he asked. “This is how Covid is spreading in Goa. This procedural delay needs to be sorted out. I understand the DHS has to follow procedure and upload results and inform the Centre, but how can they keep citizens in the dark about their own results?” In yet another instance, this one from few weeks ago, a young woman from Porvorim had to make multiple trips to the Mapusa district hospital to find out her status, and was sent back each time telling her that she would receive an SMS, which she never did. “My daughter couldn’t self-isolate until she got her results, as there was no one she could send to Asilo hospital to find out her results,” Lalitha Shenoy told TOI. “She lives with all high risk people like me and we were very anxious to know the results. I put everyone at risk. What have they been doing for one year if they don’t have this basic mechanism in place to send an SMS. This is a pandemic and not a joke.” Director of health services Dr Jose D’Sa didn’t respond to calls or messages. State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said that messages are sent by Goa Electronics Ltd, whose CEO, Revati Mazumdar, denied any delay. “The health department would be the right department to ask. We send whatever information is given to GEL,” she said. “People with Do Not Disturb service activated will not receive the message as per GEL,” said Betodkar. “Also, in case the number is wrong or the person is out of network for long, the person won’t receive the message.” He added that “in case anyone doesn’t receive their report by SMS, they should dial 104, and the operator will note down their details and sent it to GEL to trigger a new SMS.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/patients-left-in-lurch-as-covid-test-results-reach-late-or-never/articleshow/82170358.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The infection is more contagious and symptoms are few, with many landing in hospitals in a critical stage. “It is a very grave situation. We fear that the double mutant viral variant in Maharashtra is now present in Kerala too. We are waiting for confirmation,” said health expert Dr K P Aravindan, who is part of the state government’s medical advisory panel on Covid management. "In the first wave, from the time the first case was reported in a state, it took nearly six to eight months for the cases to peak and the spread was limited. But the second wave started from early March and within six-seven weeks, the numbers have surged manifold. It is not just people’s irresponsible behaviour that led to the surge, I believe the double mutant strain might be behind the current situation. There has been no restriction on domestic travel all these months," said Dr Santosh Kumar S S, deputy medical superintendent, Thiruvananthapuram medical college. The B.1.617 strain, popularly referred to as the "double mutation" strain, was first detected in India on October 5, 2020 with two mutations--- E484Q and L452R. Initially, found in a large number of samples in Maharashtra it started showing up more frequently since January 2021. Kerala has sent samples for genome sequencing to CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi. Besides Kozhikode medical college and Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, is also trying to study the gene variants in Kerala using the spike protein sequencing. However, results are yet to come, due to which chief secretary VP Joy in the meeting of the core group for Covid-19 management has directed the health department to take immediate steps to ascertain if the double mutant variant is driving the disease transmission in Kerala. The health experts are worried that even those who have been vaccinated may be infected. “We are hopeful that the infection maybe mild,” added Dr Aravindan. “Many who have taken two doses of the vaccine have tested positive and are admitted in the hospital. However, no one needed ICU care," said Dr Santhosh Kumar, chairman of the state medical board that decides on the treatment protocol for Covid. “In the second wave, the virus has been behaving differently. The infection is more contagious and symptoms are few. After a single exposure, people are testing positive, suggesting that the incubation period is shorter. We need to study how the virus behaves and accordingly rewrite our protocols,” said Dr Jayakrishnan AV, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) committee for vaccination promotion and coordination. "Indians who travelled to Hong Kong were found infected with the Indian double mutant variant on day 12. We will need to study the spread of the variant in Kerala and accordingly modify our quarantine guidelines to 14 days based on further data and studies. All over the world, based on CDC guidelines, quarantine has been reduced to 8 days," said Dr Anoop Kumar, member, state government’s medical advisory panel on Covid management and critical care physician at Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/double-mutant-strain-driving-second-surge/articleshow/82168406.cms||Preetu Nair

The forum has offered another 297 rooms for self-operation for quarantine and asymptomatic patients, which would not be linked directly with a hospital. Besides, over 50 rooms were offered for accommodation of doctors and nurses. A task force, which was formed after a meeting with state chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, held a long meeting on Tuesday with representatives of hospitals and hotels. The task force is headed by state tourism secretary Nandini Chakraborty. “The government has also asked for available hotel rooms beyond Kolkata in different districts. We shall write to our members in this regard immediately,” HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar told TOI. The association has over 800 members in West Bengal and has 60,000 beds under its members.  Hotels like Regenta Orkos Kolkata, Indismart Hotel, Sapphire Suites, Hotel Arya Regency, Hotel Narayani Enclave, Ratnakar Inn, Hotel Ivory Inn have offered rooms for satellite centres “We (AMRI) have already tied up with four hotels and have 70 satelite beds now. Next week we shall add 50 more beds.We have also requested the state government for an awareness campaign for satellite centre,” said president of Association of Hospitals in Eastern India and CEO of AMRI Group, Rupak Barua.

Our association has ensured that 90% of our members who are above 45 years of age are vaccinated against the communicable disease,” he said, adding that they are going to conduct vaccination camps as part of their social responsibility programme.This year, they were expecting a good season between April and July, but now, the second wave has toppled their hopes. Marriage hall owners say that until 2019, they had one year advance bookings. This year, the bookings had come late and they had decided to tell their clients that advances would not be returned if the events are cancelled at the last moment.Thangapandian (name changed), a marriage hall owner, says that they had huge losses last year due to the lockdown. “Most of the halls are constructed on bank loans, and monthly installments are even Rs one lakh or more for many, so returning advances is difficult,” he said, adding that people have already started negotiating for low rentals, as the demand has come down.K Sivasundaram of Melur said that he had planned to book a hall with a capacity of just 300 people and decided to make an advance payment for his son’s wedding scheduled for June 3. “When they said that advance money could not be returned, I returned home with the Rs 50,000 and have decided for a simple ceremony at home,” he said.C Karthikeyan (name changed) has not printed invitation cards for his daughter’s wedding scheduled to be held on May 24. “The groom’s parents have booked a hotel for the ceremony, now if it is going to be just 100 people, I have decided to send out invitations through Whatsapp,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/second-wave-sends-gala-wedding-plans-crashing-again/articleshow/82169548.cms||---

The NHAI official stated that they have targeted planting 583 trees for every one kilometre to improve the green cover along the national highway. But this is subject to the availability of vacant places. There is no plan to plant trees on the median. The replies were in response to the RTI filed by activist R Pandiaraja. Pandiaraja said the NHAI and the contractors concerned for the maintenance of the sections between Virudhunagar and Kanyakumari should make use of the night curfew and other restrictions on movement of vehicles to expedite and complete relaying work at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/nh-relaying-work-to-begin-by-may-on-4-lane-stretch/articleshow/82169541.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Private hospitals add 250 more beds to treat Covid||PANAJI: After a meeting with health minister Vishwajit Rane on Tuesday private hospitals have agreed to an additional 250 beds for Covid patients. On Monday, Rane had warned that private hospitals can’t escape their responsibility of pitching in when the state has been witnessing the worst crises brought on by the pandemic. Currently, less than 100 beds are available for Covid patients in four corporate hospitals in the state. It is estimated that the state will need an average of 40 additional beds daily if the present pace of infections continues for another two weeks. “The representatives have voluntarily decided to increase their bed capacity to manage the increasing number of patients by reserving 250 additional beds in their respective facilities. My sincere gratitude to them for this gesture. A nodal officer will be appointed to ensure seamless coordination with private hospitals,” Rane said. Goa Medical College (GMC) which is primarily treating critically ill patients has been adding extra beds every day even as some patients continue to be on trolleys. With the massive rise in infections reported in the last few days, the daily average hospital admissions have been over 100 and the government has been struggling to increase bed capacity in both GMC and the South Goa district hospital. Rane also had a virtual meeting with all the heads of departments of GMC to review the level of preparedness. “I have instructed them to maintain sufficient stock of medicines and ensure that the staff posted on Covid and non-Covid duties are equipped with protective gears,” he said. Ward 121 has been set up as a Covid ward with five beds reserved to treat doctors who test positive. It has also been instructed that not more than one person be allowed as a patient attendant in the ward. The health minister directed that all planned surgeries in the tertiary care hospital be cancelled till May 15 but chemotherapy and dialysis units remain operational. Elective surgeries will continue after mid-May but after a review is held, he said.

South Delhi Municipal Corporation is planning to shift the vaccination centre at Tilak Nagar Multi-Speciality Hospital to a neighbouring municipal healthcare centre to avoid crowding. “The final decision would be taken based on the turnout at the vaccine centre on May 1,” said a senior South Delhi Municipal Corporation official. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash, however, said that the vaccination centre at Hindu Rao would not be shifted. The campus is quite big and the distance between the Covid ward and the vaccination site is nearly 500 metres. “But yes, we have to keep ourselves prepared to meet the demand if the turnout at vaccination centres, polyclinics or dispensaries increases,” the mayor said. East Delhi Municipal Corporation has started an exercise to hire additional contractual healthcare workers to meet the requirement at all its 20 centres. “We have two vaccination stations at Swami Dayanand Hospital where 400 people on average were coming for inoculation till Friday. However, the sudden rise in Covid-19 cases and the lockdown have affected the turnout here. On Wednesday, only 150 people visited the place for vaccination. We are expecting that after May 1, the turnout will surge and the number of staff will also increase,” said Dr Galdbin Tyagi, nodal officer at Swami Dayanand Hospital. In EDMC, 65-70 auxiliary nurse midwives are likely to be hired on contract basis within 10 days. “Regarding the increase in the number of sites for vaccination, a decision will be taken by Delhi government,” said a senior EDMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-gear-up-to-vaccinate-18/articleshow/82187130.cms||Vibha Sharma

Just within the last three days, 22 Covid-19 deaths have been reported in south TN. Doctors are stressing the need for early identification of Covid-19 and urged the public to not delay treatment. While only 45 Covid-19 deaths were reported overall in the southern region between January and March, in April, alone 57 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded as on April 20. Nearly 70% of the deaths in April were reported in Madurai, Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli. The three districts are also among the highest number of active Covid-19 cases with over 1000 each. Madurai recorded the most number of deaths in April in south TN with 16 Covid-19 deaths, followed by Kanyakumari (13) and Tirunelveli (10). The rest of the districts reported five or less deaths in April. Out of the 57 Covid-19 deaths so far in April, more than 90% of the deaths are of those with co-morbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension while five deaths were of those without any co-morbid conditions. “We are seeing some younger patients without any co-morbid conditions also develop severe forms of Covid-19. Many patients are also requiring oxygen support,” said Dr P Prem Ananth, a consultant interventional pulmonologist. The doctor added that Covid-19 symptoms are also varying among patients. “In some cases, we found patients only had one or two days of fever but then only had body pain unlike previously when patients continuously had fever for several days,” he explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/22-dead-in-3-days-in-southern-districts/articleshow/82169557.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Talking to TOI, additional chief medical officer (ACMO) of Haridwar Dr HD Shakya said that the seer was initially admitted at a Covid Care Centre set up in the Bairagai akhada camp. He was then referred to Baba Barfani Covid Care Centre. After his condition turned critical, he had to be referred to a specialised centre. According to sources, on Sunday, an ambulance took him to AIIMS Rishikesh but the hospital said its ICU beds were full. The same ambulance took him to GDMC and there, too, he was turned away. “He was admitted back to the Covid Care Centre, where he breathed his last on Monday afternoon,” said Dr Shakya. He added that no one came to claim the body and it is not clear which akhada he belonged to. Health department officials cremated him in accordance with Hindu rituals. When queried about the matter, Dr UB Mishra from AIIMS Rishikesh said, “The 180 ICU beds at AIIMS are occupied and patients are waiting at the emergency section to be admitted to the critical care unit. We have shut our OPD to only cater to Covid-19 patients. The influx of patients is so high that the 200 isolation beds we have here are also almost full.” A GDMC PRO who did not wish to be named said that the hospital has 50 ICU and 50 ventilator beds and all are full since Sunday. The situation is the same at most private hospitals too. Pawan Sharma of Kailash Hospital told TOI that all 50 ICU beds and 28 ventilator beds in his hospital are full. Dr Rahul Prasad, medical superintendent, Max Hospital said that all 74 ICU and 37 ventilator beds in the hospital were taken. Bhupendra Raturi, PRO, Mahant Indiresh hospital, also confirmed that all 33 ICU and ventilator beds are occupied at their institution.

Continuous feedback about the system will be taken from these patients. Chief minister Chouhan said that by making effective the system of home isolation and Covid care centre, the burden of hospitals will be reduced. It is necessary to develop trust in the public regarding the arrangement of Covid Care Centres. This will help reduce the increasing burden on hospitals. Proper arrangements will be ensured in hospitals to control the growing infection of corona and to treat very serious patients.

---||Kochi||150 & counting: Faizy ensures Covid burial for dead||Kozhikode: It was a highly disturbing video of workers dumping bodies of Covid victims into a pit using an earth mover in some other state which he saw on social media in the early days of the pandemic last year that made 33-year-old Anvar Faizy decide to take up the task of ensuring the deceased their right for a decent funeral. Now, 11 months through the ups and downs of the Covid curve, Faizy, who is from Pathaikara in Malappuram, has so far personally conducted funerals of over 150 Covid-19 victims cutting across religious lines. The latest funeral was the one he conducted near Perinthalmanna on Tuesday morning. With his telephone number going around in social media, Faizy, who is the vice-president of Samastha Kerala Sunni Students Federation in Perinthalmanna region, mostly gets a call seeking help whenever there is a Covid death in Malappuram and sometimes even from neighbouring districts of Palakkad and Thrissur. He and his team of volunteers would reach the hospitals with ambulance to receive the body of the deceased and take it to funeral locations in ambulance, conduct the funeral rites and burial of bodies as per the Covid norms by wearing PPE kits, gloves and meeting other guidelines. "Each death is a matter of great pain for the families involved. But the pandemic has made death care and grief even more complex. Many grieving families were shattered over not even able to see the faces of their dear ones for one last time during the initial days of the pandemic. Also, society had viewed funerals of Covid victims with fear. It was then that I along with my colleagues who were part of SYS Amila Task team started offering our free services for conducting funerals when we felt that there was shortage of hands to conduct the last rites," Anvar Faizy said. He said though the relatives are now allowed to have a glimpse of the face of the deceased, the kin of as many as 60 Covid victims the funeral of whom he had conducted earlier didn’t get that opportunity. Faizy said that there have been instances of having had to conduct as many as four funerals during a day in January. “As a person who has seen Covid deaths and sorrows of the grieving families from close quarters, I would request all the people to meticulously follow the guidelines stipulated by the government. I have conducted even funerals of people aged as young as 26 years and it shows that the pandemic should not to be taken lightly," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/150-counting-faizy-ensures-covid-burial-for-dead/articleshow/82168412.cms||---

---||Patna||Loan agents lynch Dalit woman in Bihar's Supaul||PATNA: A 71-year-old Dalit woman was beaten to death by a group of men working as loan recovery agents for a private finance company in Supaul on Tuesday. As the news about the death spread, the victim's neighbours rushed to her help and detained seven of the group and thrashed them before handing them over to the police. The incident has exposed how people in rural areas are falling prey to private finance companies that provide loans at an exorbitant rate and then hire 'muscle men' as loan recovery agents. The incident took place around 10 am at Ramnagar ward number 5 (known as Mahadalit Tola) under Pipra police station. Police said seven people came to Dulari Devi's house and demanded interest for the loan. Dulari's daughter-in-law Punia Devi had taken a Rs.25,000 loan from a micro-finance company having its office at Supaul. The agents reportedly indulged in an altercation with Punia when she sought some more time for repayment. The agents turned on Dulari when she intervened and tried to save her daughter-in-law from the agents. She was thrashed by the agents leading to her death, which prompted residents to detain them. They remained in confinement for several hours. The SHO of Pipra police station Nagendra Kumar said an FIR has been lodged against the finance company and its agents for beating the woman to death. DSP (Sadar) Indra Prakash, however, described the situation at the village as peaceful and within control. The sources, on the other hand, claimed that the members of the Dalit community were not in a mood to relent. The DM and SP of Supaul couldn't be contacted for their comments despite repeated attempts. Reliable sources said sub-divisional officer (Sadar) Manish Kumar has been asked to submit a detailed report on the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/loan-agents-lynch-dalit-woman-in-supaul/articleshow/82167669.cms||Ramashankar

If the applicant is released on bail at this stage, the possibility of him threatening or intimidating them cannot be ruled out,” said additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav. Javed Ali’s counsel sought bail on the ground that he had been framed in the case, besides other cases. He said the eyewitnesses had been planted by police to create false evidence against Ali only to tarnish his reputation and social status.  The public prosecutor contended that Ali could be clearly seen in the CCTV footage carrying a stick and brick and trying to damage the CCTV camera. His body language, the prosecutor added, appeared to be “aggressive”. According to the court, Ali’s phone location had been found to be near the scene of crime on the date of incident. “It is a matter of record that initially the applicant had absconded and his presence in the matter could be secured only after the investigating agency adopted coercive measures against him,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-accused-of-murder-denied-bail-in-riot-case/articleshow/82187132.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This time they are not walking down or cycling thousand kms to reach home. The labourers are contributing and hiring buses to reach home safely. Overloaded buses starting from Delhi and also from different cities of Gujarat and Maharashtra have been reaching different villages of Bundelkhand. Trains reaching Chhatarpur and Khajuraho railway stations are overloaded with passengers. Bundelkhand, among other places, is witnessing another wave of migration of labourers after the second deadly wave of corona in India.Most of the buses are not stopping at the bus stands. They are directly proceeding to distant villages of Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh, Damoh or Panna districts. Most of these buses are overloaded.Labourers said that they were hiring buses as and when they were available. Ramkesh Kodi, a labourer who was working in Bhavnagar in Gujarat said, “We were 70 labourers from Khaddi, Pahara, Kitpura, Hanukheda in Chhatarpur district and were all working in factories . We contributed and hired a bus to reach home.” They reached home two days ago. Veeru Ahirwar, one of the labourers, who had also returned, said, “large number of labourers have returned while many more are waiting for their turn.” Ghasiram Ahirwar said that he had returned with his family. Last year he had faced hunger for five days while he was walking down with family from Gurugram to Chhatarpur. Every day 30 to 35 buses are reaching villages of Bundelkhand. Many of them also carried villagers from bordering UP districts of Mahoba and Banda. On Tuesday morning, hundreds of labourers returned by trains at Khajuraho and Harpalpur railway stations of Chhatarpur district.This time the state government is under tremendous pressure over the rising number of cases and deaths due to pandemic , officials of district administration and police were also engaged in controlling the spread of coronavirus. In the meantime, the arrival of the migrant labourers began quietly. However, the sub divisional magistrate Luvkush Nagar said, the administration was keeping an eye on these labourers.Panchayat secretaries and employment assistants have been deputed in villages. They have been keeping an eye on the arrival of the migrant labourers. Besides, local health workers have also been keeping an eye on these labourers .

---||India||Supreme Court gives life to Art 224A to bring back retired judges||NEW DELHI: Activating Article 224A of the Constitution that had been dormant for 58 years, the Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed high court chief justices to start appointing retired HC judges as ad hoc judges for two to five years if the HC faced pendency of a large number of cases. Clarifying that appointment of ad hoc judges would not be against vacancies in the sanctioned strength of judges in an HC, a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices S K Kaul and Surya Kant took the historic step to chart out structured implementation of Article 224A, which was there in the original Constitution adopted in 1949 but was deleted in 1956 only to be reintroduced in 1963. In the last 58 years, only three retired judges have been appointed as ad hoc judges to HCs for a period of one year each — Justice Suraj Bhan to Madhya Pradesh HC in 1972, Justice P Venugopal to Madras HC in 1982, and Justice O P Srivastava to Allahabad HC in 2007 for the Ayodhya case. The CJI-led bench said the trigger point for activating Article 224A by an HC chief justice could be many — (a) if vacancies are more than 20% of the sanctioned strength, (b) cases in a particular category are pending for over five years, (c) more than 10% of the backlog of pending cases are over five years old, (d) the percentage of rate of disposal is lower than the institution of cases either in a particular subject matter or generally in the court, and, (e) even if there are not many old cases pending, but depending on the jurisdiction, a situation of mounting arrears is likely to arise if the rate of disposal is consistently lower than the rate of filing over a period of a year or more Times ViewExtreme situations necessitate unprecedented measures. Given the mountain of cases pending before the courts and the shortage of judges, this is a welcome step.The bench, however, said, "The recourse to Article 224A is not an alternative to regular appointments. In order to emphasise this aspect, we clarify that if recommendations have not been made for more than 20% of regular vacancies, then the trigger for recourse to Article 224A would not arise. "We have little doubt that the challenge of mounting arrears and existing vacancies requires recourse to Article 224A of the Constitution to appoint ad hoc judges which is a ready pool of talent, (of course subject to their concurrence) as a methodology especially for clearing old cases. The existing strength of permanent and additional judges can be utilised for current and not so old cases. The ad hoc judges are absolved even from administrative responsibilities. They can concentrate on old cases which are stuck in the system and may require greater experience." The government, through the attorney general, had conveyed to the SC that it had no objection to HC CJs resorting to Article 224A, but first the HC collegiums must fill the existing vacancies before relying on the dormant provision for appointing ad hoc judges. The bench rejected the argument and said, "In our view, this would be a self-defeating argument because the very reason why Article 224A has been resorted to is non-filling up of vacancies and mounting arrears. We may, however, hasten to add that the objective is not to appoint ad hoc judges instead of judges to be appointed to the regular strength of the HC." The SC was clear in its view that appointment of ad hoc judges through Article 224A was not a panacea for inaction in making recommendations for regular appointments. It said the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) showed that 56.4% of pending cases were filed within the past five years whereas 40% of pending cases were filed between five and 20 years ago. The primary purpose of appointing ad hoc judges was to deal with the latter group of cases that have been pending for over five years, it said. As per NJDG data, five HCs — Allahabad, Punjab & Haryana, Madras, Bombay, and Rajasthan — are responsible for 54% of pendency of over 57,51,312 cases. Madras HC has among the highest arrears in the country of 5.8 lakh cases despite having fewer vacancies than most other HCs (7%). "This does not take away from the requirement of appointing ad hoc judges but supports the view that even if the existing vacancies are few, a situation may arise requiring the expertise of experienced judges to be appointed as ad hoc judges. On the other hand, Calcutta HC has one of the highest vacancies of regular appointments (44%) but less than half the arrears as compared to Madras (2.7 lakh cases)," the bench said. "We have a docket explosion in our country and that it is difficult for adjudication to take place within a reasonable period of time. This crisis situation must be tackled. Some innovation is always the rule of the game. In the present context, maybe a slightly different view has to be taken in respect of the avowed purpose of Article 224A providing for ad hoc judges. We say so as we are faced with the ground reality of almost 40% vacancies remaining in regular appointments (both permanent and additional judges) over the last two years, as we have already mentioned. A number of vacancies arising every year are barely filled by fresh appointments. Thus, it remains an unfulfilled challenge to bring the appointment process to such numbers as would be able to cover the vacancies existing and arising. Without endeavouring to blame anyone, a ground reality remains that there are manifold reasons for the same," the bench added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-gives-life-to-art-224a-to-bring-back-retired-judges/articleshow/82171641.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Chennai||High yarn prices may unravel famed Tirupur garment sector||Coimbatore: After a harrowing 2020 which left the Tirupur garment sector reeling under the global lockdown and exodus of guest workers, 2021 isn’t quite the relief that the multi-billion dollar sector hoped for. In addition to manpower shortage, Covid restrictions and threat of a drop in orders, the industry is battling skyrocketing prices of a crucial material — yarn. The price of yarn has shot up by 60% to 70 % over the past five months to Rs 345 per kg. The price of rubber yarn has almost doubled from Rs 420 to Rs 800. Textile manufacturers complained that yarn prices change about five times a month, leaving their cost calculations in tatters. Tirupur Exporters Association president Raja Shanmugam says yarn price had a cascading effect on the entire value chain, ultimately affecting the profit margin of exporters. Profit margins have dropped from 15% to 30% to 5% to 10%. While Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are chugging on with zero profit or at times after bearing huge losses, others, including exporters, are left with no option but to reduce their profit percentage to less than 5%. Tirupur has more than 7,000 industries involved in the garment sector, upon which up to 12 lakh workers depend. Most industries in this sector are dependent on each other like knitting, printing, dying, sewing and elastic industries. Tirupur accounts for 52% of India’s total exports of knitted garments. “Yarn price, which dropped by Rs 10/ kg after May 2020, started to increase gradually in September. In the last three to four months, a kilogram of organic cotton yarn has increased by Rs 200 and 40 count yarn has increased to Rs 145,” said exporter R Sakthivel of Daffodil fashion. The key reason for the price rise and surge in demand is the sudden increase in export of yarn to countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Cambodia, he said. “Usually, yarn price increases proportionately with cotton, its raw material, and price goes up by Rs 2 to Rs 5 a kilogram at a time. This time, price of yarn has been on a continuous rise and it is disproportionate with the cotton price,” Sakthivel said. Another exporter on condition of anonymity said most yarn mills are located in northern India and export a significant share of yarn. These mills have been operating with 50% to 60% of their total workforce since lockdown. So, their orders were shifted to mills in the southern states, the exporter said, adding that yarn supply has not increased accordingly. “The mills prefer to export yarn as they make better profit in the global market than in local market. The demand, in turn, has triggered panic buying,” he added. G R Senthilvel, secretary of Tirupur exporters and manufacturers association (TEAMA), has been in the business for 30 years and said he had never seen such an acute shortage before. About 90% of orders we process are not delivered on time and we bore a huge loss, he said. He said they had lost many customers due to delivery delays and price revisions. Once a customer exits, it is very difficult to bring them back or find a new customer given the highly competitive global market, Senthilvel said, adding that countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam have an advantage over Triupur units due to free trade agreements. Many of us are still operating only on the hope that things will get better as we have loans looming over us, he said. Price of rubber yarn has almost doubled in the past few months and many industrialists have taken to importing it given the surge in demand. “Even if I place an order to import it, it would take at least three months to reach me,” said R P Govindasamy, president of Tirupur elastic manufacturer and traders association. He said units had reduced production by half and increased price of elastics by 30%. “Some buyers understand our situation and accept the revised prices, but many do not agree,” he added. Tirupur MP K Subbarayan wrote to Union textile minister Smriti Irani last month urging the Centre to intervene. He pointed out that seven mills of National Textile Corporation (NTC) have been functioning only partially after last year’s lockdown. The government can tap the full potential of these mills and increase yarn production. “By doing so, the textile units could get yarn at a reasonable price without any interruption in supply and NTC would be able to provide work to all its employees,” Subbarayan added. He also requested the state government to encourage cotton cultivation in Tamil Nadu to meet the rising requirement as industries currently purchase cotton from other states. Industrialists say that it is high time the Centre stepped in to control yarn prices, warning that the garment sector would plunge into a deeper crisis if ignored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/high-yarn-prices-may-unravel-famed-tirupur-garment-sector/articleshow/82168464.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Sources said that a couple of cases were reported in the jail last week. After this a series of tests were conducted in the jail to identify any more cases there. Officials in the health department said that around 20 inmates were found positive after this. They were taken to the Santrampur State Hospital for treatment. An official said that most inmates who tested positive were either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. “They had to be taken to the hospital to ensure the infection did not spread,” he said adding that the exact details of the number of cases and persons tested at the hospital were being obtained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/20-inmates-test-ve-insantrampur/articleshow/82167416.cms||---

The 40-line inscription speaks of an individual who dug the tank more than 370 years ago and donated it to the village.Pattamangalam resident Kamraj alerted Ramanathapuram Archaeological Research Foundation of the stone pillar, measuring 4ft in length and 1ft in width.According to the foundation’s president V Rajaguru, the lines were inscribed in the Tamil year of Sarvathari on the 14th day of the month of Aani. This timeframe, he says, can be compared to AD 1648. As is the case with many inscriptions, the name of a king is not mentioned in this one.The inscription reads ‘Arumpoor Kootram, Kaliyaneri Thugavoorutaiyan Ponni Ataippar Udaiya Nayan’ donated the tank to the village. It goes on to say that a curse would befall on he who destroys this tank, whereas one who protects this tank would attract the same blessing that would accrue to those who protect women, as long as the Sun and Moon exist. It is called the donation of Ayiraveli. A village of the same name exists near Pattamangalam. The other village mentioned in the inscription, Kaliyaneri, is no longer in existence but is said to have been located about 2km from Pattamangalam.‘Thugavoorutaiyan Ponni Ataippar Udaiya Nayan’ may refer to the name of a royal representative of the Sethupathi kings from Kaliyaneri. Koothan Sethupathi and Thalavai Sethupathi were also known by the adjective `Udaiya Nayan’, Rajaguru said citing evidence from certain stone inscriptions.The Shiva temple, in front of which this tank exists, was constructed around the 13th century in late Pandiya period architecture. It has since been demolished and reconstructed. Medieval period potsherds have been found near this site, Rajaguru added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/villagers-find-17thc-stone-inscription-in-ramnad-tank/articleshow/82169598.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Nizamabad turning into hotspot, opens new front in Telangana virus war||HYDERABAD: Authorities in Telangana may have declared Greater Hyderabad as the epicentre of Covid-19 cases in the second wave, but Nizamabad town is emerging as the new hotspot. While Greater Hyderabad, which has a population of 1.2 crore, reported around 700 cases in the last 24 hours, Nizamabad with a population of just 3.33 lakh topped 500 cases in the same period. The trend has been continuing for the past one week, officials said. The surge in the positive cases had never gone below 200 daily for a small district such as Nizamabad in the last fortnight. Nizamabad is about 175 km from Hyderabad. The district, which shares borders with Maharashtra, is giving jitters to officials with a positivity rate of 8% as against the state’s positivity rate of 2.5%. “We have declared 16 containment zones in the district. More number of positive cases are reported from municipalities and villages bordering Maharashtra,” collector C Narayan Reddy told TOI. Worried over increasing in-patient case load, the district administration has given permission to 20 more private hospitals to offer Covid-19 treatment in the last three days. Now, the bed capacity in the private hospitals has gone up to 400 from just about 20 in the last few days. In the government sector, there is a provision for 270 Covid-19 beds and 330 have been accommodated. Officials said the bed capacity in the government hospitals is being increased by another 200. “Among the in-patients, 22% are below 40 years. The youth should not take the virus lightly and must follow Covid-19 guidelines of maintaining social distancing and wearing mask,” Dr Kiran Madala, associate professor in Government General Hospital (GGH) and ICU in-charge, Nizamabad, said. District authorities said there have been several instances of large gatherings of people in recent times and attributed the spurt in cases to super-spreaders infecting several others. In Varni, a marriage function led to 86 positive cases and a shopping hall had reported 30 cases. Though officials closed 18 checkpoints in the district, Salura and Salabatpur checkposts with Maharashtra are still kept open. Officials said Covid-19 case load is high from these areas. “The positivity rate from the surrounding areas is more than 15%,” a senior official said. Fearing more outbreaks, several villages in the district are opting for lockdowns. Three mandals of Bhimgal, Erugatla and Balkonda declared self-lockdown a few days ago. Areas around Salur, Renjal, Navipet and Bodhan, which are adjacent to Maharashtra, also imposed lockdown. “The situation in our village is worrisome. We do not have proper medical facilities. Hence, we have decided that lockdown is the only option to curb the spread of the virus,” K Viresh Reddy of Navipet said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nizamabad-turning-into-hotspot-opens-new-front-in-t-virus-war/articleshow/82170412.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Noida||Noida: Oxygen plant told to work in multiple shifts||NOIDA: To match the increasing demand for oxygen and ensure uninterrupted supply to hospitals, the district administration on Monday formed a five-member team to monitor the process. The district’s only oxygen plant at Surajpur has been asked to work in multiple shifts to cater to patients. The team includes four administrative officials and a senior doctor from the district health department who is the nodal officer responsible for coordinating with more than a dozen Covid hospitals across Noida and Greater Noida. “Manpower requirements and demand for oxygen on Monday and Tuesday was double of what it was till last week. At this rate, we will soon run out of beds here and we might have to turn down requests of admissions,” said a senior doctor at a private Covid hospital in Greater Noida. The sub-divisional magistrate of Sadar area, Prasun Dwivedi, has been asked to visit the Surajpur plant and see to it that hospitals get regular supply from the unit.  “The patient count in our city is going up and many of them need immediate medical attention. The ICUs are overburdened and demand for oxygen is going up every day. The Surajpur plant has been asked to work in shifts to cater to the patients and a dedicated nodal team was formed on Monday to monitor the supply,” said district magistrate Suhas LY. Over the past 48 hours, the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) and Sharda Hospital have requested for oxygen at least five times, an official said. Currently, the district needs at least 40 tonnes of oxygen per day and the Surajpur plant has a capacity to produce about 50 tonnes daily. But most of the oxygen produced at the unit would be diverted to facilities elsewhere. In another development, a 60-member team has been formed to coordinate testing and hospitalisation process for Covid patients. Work related to Covid has been divided into 22 broad categories and a team has been appointed to tackle each aspect. A similar arrangement was made last year. But this time, officials have been appointed even for managing the official portal, reporting cases, planning and distributing resources and addressing grievances of residents. Residents, however, said that most phone calls made to the control room are not answered on time. “There is no point appointing more and more officers and teams if they don’t take phone calls. The control room had been set up to streamline the entire process. But it seems that we are left to fend for ourselves,” said Sector 78 resident Brajesh Sharma, who said he has been trying to get an acquaintance admitted to a hospital for the past 48 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/oxygen-plant-told-to-work-in-multiple-shifts/articleshow/82170376.cms||Shalabh
---||Mumbai||Anyone 45+ and arrested must be vaccinated in Mumbai: HC||Mumbai: Bombay high court on Tuesday passed directions to decongest barracks and tackle a surge of Covid cases in state prisons and directed that “henceforth, immediately on arrest of an individual’’, the police officer shall arrange for his or her rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests, and also any accused aged over 45 when arrested, “shall be sent for vaccination to the nearest vaccination centre without fail’’. It also restricted the personal presence of undertrials in courts. There are 188 active Covid-19 cases in prisons, the state said. The HC directed implementation of a March 2020 order of Supreme Court, by which it had stopped physical presence of undertrials to rule out “outside transmission’’ of Covid, and directed their presence via video-conferencing “for all purposes’’. The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni passed orders in a suo motu PIL to tackle concerns over “alarming” rise in Covid-19 cases in March and April. Unless there is a negative report, the inmate is not to be lodged in jail, and “if arrested accused tests positive, he shall be lodged in temporary prisons/Covid care centres’’, said the high court. State advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni and IPS officer Chhering Dorje, who was in court, said inmates were allowed last year to interact telephonically once a week with family. Senior counsel Mihir Desai, appearing for intervenor, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), sought more phone contact. HC increased it to twice a week now. Kumbhakoni said a proposal for creating new prisons is pending. Despite release of many inmates on emergency bail or parole last year, 35,124 prisoners are lodged across 47 jails in Maharashtra, as against a capacity of 23,217, said HC. HC will hear the matter again on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/anyone-45-and-arrested-must-be-vaccinated-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/82170405.cms||---
---||Ghaziabad||People with symptoms wait 3-4 hours for tests at Ghaziabad hospital||GHAZIABAD: People stood in queues and waited three to four hours to get themselves tested at MMG hospital on Tuesday. Officials admitted that shortage of a crucial accessory in the testing kit had led to the delay. Social distancing and other Covid protocols were thrown to the wind as people jostled in the queue and got impatient. The risk of contracting the infection was all the more because most people who stood in line had either developed symptoms or were in contact of a Covid patient recently. Ramesh Chandra said that although an hour had passed, the line had barely moved. “We are waiting for hours under the sun, but there is hardly any progress. The officials here are also not giving us any satisfactory reply,” said Chandra, a resident from Vivekananda Colony. Mohit Singh was worried about the lack of safety protocols in place. “Most of us have come here after developing symptoms. But the situation here is such that even if someone does not have the infection as yet, he or she will contract it standing in the queue,” he said. Sudhir Rana, who was also in the line, alleged there was a deliberate attempt to delay the testing. “I have come to know that an important accessory of the testing kit is not available. That is why they are delaying the process of collecting the samples,” he said. An official of MMG hospital insisted there was no shortage of RT-PCR testing kits, but admitted they had run out of Viral Transport Media, which is used to preserve the swab samples. “Both RT-PCR and antigen kits are available. But it is the VTM that we are short on. So, we were not able to conduct the tests the way we had wanted to. It is also the rush of people that contributed to the delay,” he added. Sources there were less than 100 vials of VTM left with MMG hospital as on Tuesday evening. Dr VB Jindal, a former IMA president, explained the importance of VTM. “It is a vital part of the testing kit. The sample is collected and preserved in a vial called VTM, which is then transported to laboratories. Even if you have sufficient testing kits, they are useless in the absence of VTMs,” he said. “The solution in the VTM helps preserve the virus for about 15 days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/people-with-symptoms-wait-3-4-hrs-for-tests-at-gzb-hosp/articleshow/82170390.cms||Abhijay Jha

According to a letter issued by Neha Verma, additional secretary, the committee will look into FIRs, rehabilitation, allegations of encroachment in forest and various government orders issued from time to time impacting the lives and livelihood of Van Gujjars. This came a month after the Uttarakhand high court directed the state government to reconstitute the committee formed to look into the problems faced by this tribal community living in the hill state. The panel will also speak to Arjun Kasana, the founder of NGO Think Act Rise Foundation (TARF), who had filed a PIL in high court against “atrocities” being done to the tribal community in Uttarakhand. The committee will meet once in a month and will furnish its reports both before the state government as well as with the HC every month for perusal. While issuing the orders, the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma noted that Uttarakhand has a large tribal population and it is the constitutional duty of the state to look after them as the state cannot “turn a Nelson’s eye” towards this population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-forms-panel-to-address-problems-faced-by-van-gujjar-community/articleshow/82167677.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Appeal to youths: Donate blood before taking the shot, help avert acute shortage||Kolkata: Project Life Force (PLF) is set to go all out to appeal to youths in the city, who just turned 18, to donate blood through its three days campaign beginning on Friday. The move by the voluntary organisations comes on the heels of acute blood crisis in the state. The long-drawn election battle in the state, the heat, the surging Covid cases and vaccination has taken a toll on the blood supply in blood banks. Through its campaign ‘Youth Citizenship Festival’, PLF hopes to help tide over the blood crisis to some extent. The vaccination to all above 18 years of age is expected to be rolled out from May 1. The organisation hopes to catch the young citizens before they get inoculated. “Post vaccination one can donate blood only after 28 days of taking the second dose. What PLF has planned is a good proposal on the face of the ongoing blood crisis,” said transfusion medicine specialist Suvro Datta. With the blood banks drying up some of the banks are unable even to provide common blood group units, forget about the negative and other rare groups. The calls to PLF volunteers by people in dire need of blood for their close ones have increased in the past one month. “Earlier we have had awareness camps and campaigns in schools and colleges where we got overwhelming responses. We hope the youths will respond this time to come forward and donate blood during the three- day long blood donation camp on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, across eight locations in the city,” said Ajay Mittal of PLF. Doctors as well as those in the blood donation movement apprehend the crisis to go on even after the elections are over. Even as local politicians will get time to organise camps after the election results they could find it difficult to mobilise donors because of the pandemic and the vaccination. “There would be always shortage of blood during summer months. But this time the election, the pandemic and vaccination has aggravated the crisis,” said Datta. “If we stock up our grocery apprehending lockdown we need to stock up our blood banks as well to ensure if anyone in need, could be you and me or someone close, gets blood on time,” said Mittal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/appeal-to-youths-donate-blood-before-taking-the-shot-help-avert-acute-shortage/articleshow/82168490.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Chandigarh||Many Delhi patients land up in Tricity hospitals||CHANDIGARH: Many patients who could not get beds for Covid treatment in Delhi have started coming to the Tricity, with most going to private hospitals — a movement that could put pressure on health infrastructure here. Sources in private hospitals said they have started getting calls from Delhi. “It is just a five-hour drive. People are willing to reach here instead of waiting to die without hospital care,” said a doctor in a private hospital in Panchkula. “We cannot refuse any patient coming to us as long as we have beds available. And we have to rely on triage system during such a crisis. These are desperate times,” said a doctor in a private hospital in Chandigarh. At the same time, to cope up with the crisis of oxygen for Covid critical patients, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and the Covid hospital in Sector 48 have started with Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plant. The plant will not require any replenishment of liquid oxygen or cylinders as the oxygen gas will be generated from air. It was installed in GMCH on Tuesday and will be commissioned in Sector 48 by Wednesday. The PSA oxygen generation plant will generate oxygen gas from air and will be delivering oxygen to patients through the medical gas pipeline systems. There will be no requirement of oxygen cylinders or liquid medical oxygen. The process of PSA oxygen generation plant process was started in November 2020.This PSA plant will be generating oxygen for at least 50% of the total oxygen demand at GMCH. The capacity of the plant is 1,000 litre per minute. “GMSH, Sector 16 also had commissioned the PSA on Tuesday. Trial run was started and by Wednesday it will be operational. It is funded by PM Cares,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, UT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/many-delhi-patients-check-into-tricity-hospitals/articleshow/82167685.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Delhi||All gynae and paediatric cases from Hindu Rao moved to Kasturba hosp||New Delhi: Hindu Rao Hospital started sending all gynae and paediatric cases to Kasturba Hospital from Wednesday. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said a board has been displayed at the entrance of Hindu Rao, which has been converted into a Covid care facility, asking people to visit Kasturba Hospital for such services. “While all other OPDs and surgeries are already suspended, we have now started sending cases of gynae and paediatrics to Kasturba Hospital officially. Since we are targeting to increase Covid beds up to 350 in the next one day, an order has also been issued to call senior doctors from all dispensaries, polyclinics and mother and child care centres for filling the gap at Hindu Rao,” the mayor said. The development has, meanwhile, increased the concerns of doctors/healthcare staff at Kasturba Hospital. They fear that the decision would increase the burden on existing staff and resources at the hospital. “As of now, there has been a minor increase in the footfall at gynae department and for caesarean surgeries. But it will increase gradually. Since there is already a staff shortage, it will be better if the department also sends some staff from Hindu Rao like last year to ensure the visitors get attention and treatment,” said Dr Sunil Prasad of Resident Doctors’ Association, Kasturba Hospital. “In comparison with 8-10 deliveries that are happening daily now, the number may go up to 15-20 per day if all patients from LNJP and Hindu Rao start coming here. Moreover after 4pm, there are only two doctors deputed in the caesarean section and they won’t be sufficient to meet the requirement,” he added. To this, Jai Prakash said,“Staff have been called from other dispensaries and polyclinics at Hindu Rao. Doctors and health workers at its gynae section can then be diverted to Kasturba or Mrs Girdhari Lal Maternity Hospital. In the coming days, we will depute staff in these hospitals based on requirement.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-gynae-and-paediatric-cases-from-hindu-rao-moved-to-kasturba-hosp/articleshow/82187159.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Noida||‘Don’t want to suffer again’: Thousands begin exodus||Ghaziabad/Noida: The exodus of migrant workers from Noida and Ghaziabad continued for the second day in a row on Tuesday amid the worsening Covid-19 situation, despite multiple assurances by authorities. Apart from migrant workers from the two neighbouring districts, those returning from Delhi too could be seen leaving NCR, citing uncertainty around the duration of the lockdown in the national capital.A senior officer of the Ghaziabad district administration said that over a lakh people from Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida and other areas have boarded buses from Ghaziabad and Kaushambi depots to reach their hometowns in the past two days — all fearing a rerun of last year’s Covid-19 lockdown. In Ghaziabad particularly, the ban on eating at roadside eateries has resulted in workers leaving the city.Ram Singh, who used to run a fast food stall in Indirapuram, said he was leaving for his home district of Gorakhpur, along with his 12-year-old son. “Banning the roadside eateries is unacceptable. I used to earn my livelihood from the food stall, but that’s gone now. Last year, we slept for almost 3-4 nights without food during the lockdown. So, we have decided to return to our hometown,” he said.Ajay Shankar Pandey, the district magistrate of Ghaziabad, said till Monday midnight, they managed to send 65,000 passengers in as many as 1,187 UP Roadways buses and over 15,000 people in 387 private buses. BP Aggarwal, assistant regional manager of Roadways, said that on Tuesday, a total of 902 buses left for different destinations with over 50,000 passengers. In neighbouring GB Nagar too, scores of migrants could be seen leaving for their home states of Bihar, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh via the Yamuna Expressway. “My company has asked me to leave because the construction work here is shut. We are looking for a bus to go to MP,” said Rakesh, a worker.“Last year, when the lockdown was announced, we had to suffer a lot and had to stay without money for months. We returned from our home state on April 9 itself but now again lockdown has been enforced in Delhi. What if the lockdown is extended, then what will happen,” said Parmal, another migrant worker, who used to sell ice cream in Karol Bagh.Scores of students who had been staying in hostels and paying guest facilities, could be seen leaving. Sayeed Ahmed, a BTech student of an engineering college in Knowledge Park, said he was going to Aligarh. “I have vacated the PG accommodation. Classes are being held online, so it is of no use to pay for rent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/dont-want-to-suffer-again-thousands-begin-exodus/articleshow/82170403.cms||Shikha Salaria

To ensure wild animals don’t go thirsty because of water scarcity in summer, the forest department has installed 40 solar-powered pumps at the reserve that will be used to replenish water in the tanks across the woods. Be it Rann Plateau Talai situated at a height of 450 metre or Khandoj water point, the department will provide sufficient water by replacing tanker points with piped water and installing solar pumps. There are many other plateaus including Indala, Nimli Daang and Mandook, where water will be provided seamlessly using green energy. DFO Mahendra Sharma said since the waterbodies dry up in summer and creates a challenging situation for the animals, efforts were put in to provide quality water in artificial waterholes, which are even situated at high points. “We are yielding successful results as tiger 105 is regularly camera trapped at Rann Talai. Earlier, no water was available in the 25 square km area. Now, we are lifting water upto 100 metre from Khemsya Kund to Ran using water pipeline and solar pump,” he said. Spread over an area of 1,334 sq km, the tiger reserve comprises 200 water points including 120 natural and 80 artificial. Earlier, the department used to transport water in tankers into the forest which was a time-consuming and costly affair. An official said, “The department would save approximately Rs 20-25 lakh per annum on tanker and diesel. Moreover, it will be quality water, which will be supplied without pollution and distribution, unlike tankers. By end of April 2021, the RPOT and Kundera range will be tanker-free.”The forest department is also planning to create additional 20 saucer pits in the forests at suitable locations and supply water by pipeline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/solar-pumps-to-quench-thirst-of-rbore-animals/articleshow/82169612.cms||---

The protesting students said that not only is it unsafe to travel right now, their projects will also be delayed if they leave. On Monday, 20 persons had tested positive at IIT Roorkee and in the last few days, 310 cases have been reported from the premises. An email signed by the dean of students’ welfare and sent to PhD scholars and project staff members on Monday evening said that since “medical services in the institute’s surroundings are limited and (they are) unable to cope with the emerging situation”, it would be in the best interest of students living in non-containment hostels to “leave for their homes within 48 hours”. Reacting to the email, a protesting research scholar who did not wish to be named, told TOI, “Our research work will suffer heavily if we return to our homes. We have talked to the authorities several times to let us remain but to no avail.” Meanwhile, Sonika Srivastava from IIT Roorkee’s media cell said, “Currently, there are approximately 2,600 students on the campus. In the last two days, approximately 575 students got their RT-PCR tests done to return to their home states. The institute has facilitated buses and taxis to Delhi and Dehradun and is also trying to arrange for transportation for other cities.” “Till now, a total of 310 students have been found Covid-positive, of which 219 are currently infected and undergoing treatment at a Covid care centre. There is one full containment zone (Rajeev Bhawan), and three partial containment zones (New hostel Vigyan Kunj, Cautley, Radhakrishnan Bhawan) on the campus,” she added. She further said that the institute has “asked the students and staff members to diligently adhere to precautionary guidelines.” “In all the bhawans, meals to students are being served in rooms, along with regular cleaning and sanitisation. A dedicated Covid Care centre has been opened and helpline numbers have been provided to the students for any medical emergency.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/phd-scholars-at-iit-roorkee-protest-after-institute-asks-them-to-vacate-campus-following-covid-spread/articleshow/82167692.cms||Tapan Susheel

"The hyacinth is the reason for breeding of mosquitoes. We are working to remove the hyacinth from water bodies since it keeps growing back due to discharge of sewage. To control the mosquito menace, a three-unit team is looking after fogging operations," said Dr Rambabu, chief entomologist, GHMC. According to locals, the issue of hyacinth covering the surface of the lake was persisting for several months before officials took the initiative to clean the entire space. "Despite complaints to the local civic authorities, the hyacinth was not cleared for several months. They started the work a few times earlier but stopped in between. With the number of Covid-19 cases increasing, it is very important that we keep our surroundings clean," said Kiran Satyendra, the citizen reporter who highlighted the problem. Another citizen from Bowenpally said that it was a recurring problem and officials must ensure that the sewage is not released into the water. "The sewage being released into the lake is the main reason why we have this hyacinth growing. Several other lakes in the city are also reeling from the same problem," said Nalini Prasad, an IT professional. Officials of GHMC also informed that they are undertaking special drives in the twin cities to control the mosquito menace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyacinth-at-hasmathpet-lake-finally-cleared/articleshow/82168492.cms||---

---||Noida||Tell them to stay back, workers’ union appeals to PMO, industries||NOIDA: Though there has been no lockdown in Gautam Budh Nagar yet, factory owners claim that most workers are leaving the district out of “fear psychosis” amid a surge in Covid-19 cases. Almost 20-25% of the MSME workforce have already left the district, fearing a 2020 rerun. Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh has also appealed to the Prime Minister’s Office and industry bodies to counsel migrant workers to stay back. Rajiv Bansal, national secretary of IIA, told TOI, “Migrant workers are increasingly leaving the district. We are trying to counsel people to stay back but there is a fear-psychosis that a lockdown can be imposed suddenly. As various places are already going into lockdown phases, migrant workers here too are choosing to make an exit, the workforce may now be down by 20-25%.” “It is still difficult to give an exact estimate, but workers have left and are still leaving. News pouring in from all corners about the spread of Covid-19 is leading to panic,” said Surender Nahata, the president of MSME Industrial Association. Meanwhile, Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh has urged the PMO and industrial bodies to come forward in support of the migrant workers at the earliest. “We have written to the PMO and to organisations like FICCI to come forward and make a supportive gesture towards the migrant workers who are among the worst sufferers of the pandemic,” said Pawan Kumar of Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh. “We are trying to counsel workers to stay back, but they also need support. Instead of asking them to wear masks, we appeal to industry bodies to distribute the face gear to the migrant workers and sanitisers that they can’t afford. Employers and industrial bodies should ensure their safety,” he added. Noida and Greater Noida together have over 10 lakh registered migrant workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/tell-them-to-stay-back-workers-union-appeals-to-pmo-industries/articleshow/82170414.cms||Sharmila Bhowmick
---||Delhi||Maulana Wahiduddin Khan, Padma awardee, dies at 97||Mumbai: Renowned Islamic scholar, spiritual leader and Padma Vibhushan awardee Maulana Wahiduddin Khan passed away of Covid-19 complications in Delhi on Wednesday night. He was 97 and is survived by two sons and two daughters. His son Saniyasnain Khan said that Maulana Khan was admitted to a private hospital last week after he had a chest infection and he had also tested positive for Covid-19. The prestigious Padma Vibhushan, India’s second highest civilian award, for his exceptional contribution in the field of spiritualism, was among several awards that he had won on the Republic Day this year.  A known peacenik who had advocated peaceful co-existence and had always counselled moderation in conduct, Maulana Khan wasis among the leading scholars of Islam in the world. Founder of the Islamic Centre in New Delhi, Maulana Wahiduddin Khan had hit the headlines when he gave his ‘peace formula’ for the Babri Masjid-Ramjanam Bhoomi dispute and asked Muslims to forego their claims on the disputed land in Ayodhya. His request was rejected from a huge section of the community. His counsel to his community to avoid confrontation has often been called “surrender” by the conservatives who saw him as a “tool” in the hands of the Sangh Parivar. Nevertheless, Maulana Khan had crusaded against extremism and orthodox interpretations of the holy texts. His dozens of books include a commentary and a translation of the Quran. His books have been translated into several languages of the world and his lectures, many of them available on YouTube, are immensely popular. He had always emphasized that those Muslims engaged in dawah or inviting people to religions should shun supremacism. Through his monthly magazine 'Al Risala' he has trained generations of readers and admirers to live a peaceful life despite encountering strife, strains and provocations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/maulana-wahiduddin-khan-padma-awardee-dies-at-97/articleshow/82187170.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Chandigarh||Demand up, drug stock depleting||Chandigarh: The stock of Covid-19 antiviral drug Remdesivir is fluctuating in the city as demand from adjoining states has started pouring in. “We have stocks, but patients from other states are also coming to procure the drug,” said an official in the UT health department. In the last week, the stock was ample. Sources said the sudden surge in cases and demand from other states have crippled the supply. “We are trying to tie up with other manufacturers,” said the official. PGI is procuring additional stock of critical medicines like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab. Doctors mentioned an alarming development, in which many patients were found to have been infected with Covid, even after the first vaccine. This is possibly due to negligence and non-following of Covid protocols. “There has been a high demand for these repurpose drugs which are mainly meant for rheumatic arthritis. It is known that most of the patients these days are showing sudden deterioration of lungs during Covid. These drugs are used in such patients,” said a faculty member in PGI. Dr Vipin Kaushal of PGI said they have 244 Covid cases in Nehru Extension block, out of which 90 belong to Chandigarh, 82 to Punjab, 42 to Haryana, 18 to Himachal Pradesh and 12 from other states. He said they have tested 4,588 Covid samples, out of which 1,360 were found positive. The positivity rate was 21%. Recently there have been cases of black-marketing of Remdesivir in the city. There was a case reported in Panchkula, where a Bahadurgarh resident was caught selling 18 vials of Remdesivir injection for more than the MRP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/demand-up-drug-stock-depleting/articleshow/82167703.cms||Shimona Kanwar

A day ago, the accused, Ranveer Pawar, was caught red-handed taking a bribe of Rs 20,000 from an Ayurvedic diploma holder in return for getting him registered with the council. Pawar had allegedly demanded Rs 80,000 from Vikas Kumar, a resident of Jhajra in Dehradun, for facilitating his registration with the council so that he could start his private practice. According to the complainant, he first met Ranveer Pawar at the council's office, located on Balbir Road. Thereafter, he was called by the accused official at a jeweller's shop with the papers required for registration. Subsequently, Pawar asked Kumar to pay Rs 80,000 for the work. On April 17, Vikas filed a complaint with the vigilance department. Following the complaint, a trap was laid to nab the accused official. On April 19, a team of vigilance sleuths nabbed the accused official from outside his office where he had called the complainant to pay the bribe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/registrar-caught-taking-bribe-by-vigilance-sleuths-sent-to-jail/articleshow/82167717.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Delhi||Court grants bail to man held a year after FIR in riots case||New Delhi: A man lodged in jail allegedly for rioting during the northeast Delhi violence has been granted bail by a city court, which observed that police had arrested him a year after lodging of the FIR. The court also noted that two other accused with similar alleged roles had been let off on bail earlier. “His arrest has been effected after about a year of the incident in question,” said additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav. “No recovery of any sort has been effected from him. Investigation in the matter is complete and chargesheet filed; even the copy(ies) of supplementary chargesheet stood supplied to the applicant; and as such, no useful purpose will be served by keeping him behind bars, as trial in the matter is likely to take a long time,” the order added. Advocate Salim Malik, appearing for the accused, Khalid, said the latter was arrested on January 6, 2021— one year from the date of the FIR — merely on disclosures made by the co-accused and an alleged viral video, where he was “seen pelting stones”. Malik argued that Khalid had been in judicial custody since. “The CCTV footage relied upon by the investigating agency is not related to the alleged incident,” he claimed. Special public prosecutor Rajeev Krishan Sharma, however, submitted that Khalid had been clearly spotted pelting stones on police and carrying a stick. “He could not be arrested earlier as he was not traceable. He was traced after efforts put in by the investigating agency with the help of the viral video,” he submitted. The court held that the prosecution was unable to distinguish Khalid’s alleged role of stone pelting from that of the co-accused. “It is further a matter of record that, based on somewhat similar material, another co-accused, Abdul Sattar, was granted bail by the court of the principal district and sessions judge (northeast) on January 11, 2021,” the order stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-grants-bail-to-man-held-a-year-after-fir-in-riots-case/articleshow/82169622.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Started my terrace garden, inspired others||By Ajay K I was just finishing my third year BSc (in agriculture) when lockdown hit. As classes moved online, my learning got limited to theoretical knowledge. My father, a private employee, who was born into a family of farmers, sensed that it wasn’t ideal and decided to do something about it. Initially, he suggested I travel to some nearby farm to get hands on experience. But when that seemed like an impossibility – commuting to a farm every day from the city was not feasible -- he came up with another idea: terrace gardening. He suggested we start growing fruits and vegetables on our own terrace. When I first heard about it, I laughed it off. "I will not work out daddy," was my first reaction. But he was adamant. He even explained how terrace gardens will become the future as more and more people start living in apartments and there is hardly any open space left around our homes. I reluctantly agreed. Since my father is a great champion of waste recycling, we decided to take 50 used curd buckets (each `40), a few broken buckets and five plastic trays to start our garden the organic way. We decided against using any chemical fertilizer or pesticide. So, we sourced cattle dung and poultry manure from local vendors and bought half a truck of red soil. We filled the buckets with well mixed soil and tended to them carefully for a few days after that. On the fourth or fifth day we saw some sprouts coming out from all the buckets, and later realised those were tomato seedlings coming out, as some cattle excreta contained tomato seeds in it. Slowly and steadily, thereafter, we started sowing chilly, brinjal, bitter gourd, ridge gourd, mustard, yellow cucumber (Dosakiah), palak, mint, coriander, colocasia and one water-melon plant in our 150 square yard terrace. Within a few weeks, we got a great yield of leafy vegetables, chilies, tomatoes etc. Soon, we were having our own vegetables for our meals -- and it only made the food more tasty and healthy as we were not using any chemicals. I cannot thank my father enough for floating this idea and helping me set up the garden. Today, the garden has inspired a lot of friends and neighbours who have been asking for my advice to start a similar thing in their homes. This lockdown has, clearly, made me become more innovative and creative. (The writer is a BSc, Agriculture, graduate) ........................................... Reading to photography: Lockdown days were filled with fun activities By Pravallika Manyoktha Initially, the lockdown was a lot of fun for me and my brother as we had plenty of time to play and binge-watch our favourite shows. As days progressed, we started missing school and our friends. Having parents working from home, had its own share of problems. We had to help Amma with the daily chores as the maid was not allowed to work. Nanna started gardening and we had to help him water the plants. Every day, my brother and I used to watch them grow. Finally, we were able to produce tomatoes and chillies from our garden. We usually go to my grandmother’s place every summer vacation, but the lockdown foiled all our travel plans. We were confined to our house. As I had interest in art, Amma got me enrolled in an online art class where I learnt a few interesting things -- 3D art being one of them. I made a 3D greeting card for my grandparents’ 50th wedding anniversary and it made them really happy. Apart from this, I used my time to complete my Harry Potter series, learn about Indian states with my brother -- their capitals, main crop, languages, rivers etc. It was a lot of fun. In class 7, we had the option of joining a student club, based on our interest. I opted for the photography club. We used to have online sessions with our seniors every day, who told us about the basics of photography. Nanna gave his phone so that I could practise taking shots with it. Initially I used to take photographs of trees, flowers, pigeons, food and so on. I got to understand the modes of photography too. One of the new things I learnt was the golden shot. Though I have tried it many times earlier, I never got it right. But then, one day I finally got the shot right when my brother held the flower for me patiently. I was so excited about the shot that I posted it in my family WhatsApp groups. Now, I am my family’s professional photographer!

---||Pune||Civic body relaxes norms to allow nursing homes in nCoV net||Pune: A sizeable number of small hospitals, struggling to procure remdesivir, have finally been included in the list of notified units treating Covid-19 patients in the city. Civic officials, acknowledging their vital role in the current fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, have relaxed the stringent structural norms and have granted them conditional permission. The move has paved the way for the inclusion of these small nursing homes’ names on the district administration’s dashboard — a dedicated online portal, where every designated healthcare unit treating Covid-19 patients updates information about bed strength and bed occupancy on a daily basis. “The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has included a sizeable number of small hospitals under the Covid care network by sanctioning oxygen beds at these units. The civic body has relaxed the stringent, structural norms and granted these hospitals permission to treat Covid-19 patients on priority. The move will bring in more oxygen beds under Covid care and reduce the burden on big- and medium-sized hospitals,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India (HBI), a medical body that works for small- and medium-sized hospitals in the city. Most of the small hospitals falter on stringent structural norms, including having separate stairways, elevators, and enough ambulance space. “The current situation is considered as a medical crisis and hence PMC has granted us permission under the Epidemic Act in view of the severe shortage of oxygen beds. Our hospital has got the permission from the civic body a week ago. We are now on the administration’s dashboard,” said medical expert Sachin Jadhav, who runs Shivam hospital, a 20-bed nursing home in Hadapsar. The civic body has sanctioned 12 oxygen beds at the hospital and the remaining eight beds are in the isolation ward. Medical expert Rajeev Chaudhary, who runs Rahi Healthcare on Pune-Satara Road, said, “I got the permission from the civic body to start 12 oxygen beds for Covid patients two days ago. Our nursing home is located on the third floor of a commercial complex and hence some commercial establishments might take some objection to the switch. In view of the current crisis situation, the civic body has allowed us the permission.” Despite repeated attempts, PMC’s health officer Manisha Naik could not be contacted for her comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-relaxes-norms-to-allow-nursing-homes-in-ncov-net/articleshow/82169632.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mom files domestic violence case against own daughter||Mumbai: In a relief to a daughter “caught in the crossfire” of matrimonial discord between her parents, the Bombay high court on Tuesday quashed the domestic violence (DV) case filed by her mother against her. The ruling by Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale came on a petition by the 23-year-old woman saying she is facing her mother’s ire for staying with her father. She is slated to go to Australia for pursuing masters in computer engineering course commencing in May, but the pendency of the case creates hurdles for her to get her visa, her advocate Kenny Thakkar submitted. The judges noted that the mother had filed a DV case against the father too. Although she arraigned the daughter, there was only one allegation against her. The mother’s reply said it is not necessary for the daughter to go abroad for further studies and she is using this as an excuse to avoid legal proceedings. She also made statements on the daughter’s character saying she has many boyfriends. “The petitioner is a young lady who has just graduated and her future depends upon how she is able to improve her educational qualifications and develop her personality…It is surprising that her own mother is hell-bent upon creating obstructions in her progress,” Justice Pitale wrote for the bench. It appears that the single allegation of assault against the daughter is an exaggeration, and a result of anger as she continued to stay with her father, the judges said. There is nothing to indicate the veracity or even genuineness of the photographs annexed. “But the tenor of the reply does show that the respondent (mother) is not positively disposed towards her own daughter and it is for this reason that she has levelled allegations against her daughter pertaining to her character. We do not wish to comment on the same. But, it is evident that the petitioner is caught in the crossfire of acrimony and matrimonial discord between the respondent and her husband, who is the father of the petitioner,” said the bench. The judges concluded that in the facts and circumstances of the case the allegation, borne out of marital discord, can be said to be improbable and fall under a category of SC’s judgment in Bhajan Lal case where it laid categories where HC can quash proceedings. They directed quashing of the DV case pending against the daughter before the magistrate’s court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mom-files-domestic-violence-case-against-own-daughter/articleshow/82169651.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Hyderabad||Bharat Bio to ramp up Covaxin output to 700m doses/year by July||HYDERABAD: Bharat Biotech, the developer of indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, on Tuesday said it has expanded capacities across multiple facilities in Hyderabad and Bengaluru to reach 700 million doses annually. This would be one of the largest production capacities for inactivated viral vaccines worldwide. While Bharat Biotech did not divulge any details on the schedule for the ramp-up, its chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella said on Tuesday that the company now has four production facilities in Hyderabad with two more slated to open up in Bengaluru. By July-August it will have the capacity to produce 700-800 million doses of Covaxin per year. He was speaking at an All India Management Association (AIMA) event on Tuesday. He said the company produced 15 million doses in March and in April it will produce 20 million doses followed by 30 million doses in May when the Bengaluru facilities start functioning. The company has facilities at Genome Valley in Hyderabad, while its related entity Biovet Pvt Ltd has an animal vaccine facility at Malur near Bengaluru which is being repurposed for Covaxin. The company also said it has not only successfully indigenised at commercial scale the synthesis and manufacture of the agonist IMDG, a key component of the proprietary adjuvant Algel-IMDG used to boost immune response in Covaxin recipients, it has also joined hands with Indian Immunologicals Ltd to manufacture the drug substance for Covaxin. “This is the first instance where a novel adjuvant has been commercialised in India, eliminating dependency on imports. Also, the technology transfer process is well underway and IIL has the capabilities and expertise to manufacture inactivated viral vaccines at commercial scale and under biosafety containment,” it said. Sources said the IIL facility will begin churning out the Covaxin drug substance for millions of doses from its new Genome Valley facility by July-August of this year. Bharat Biotech also said that raw materials, packing materials and single-use consumables for manufacturing of Covaxin have been secured to meet its capacity requirements. This even as the company is exploring manufacturing partnerships with its partners in other countries that have prior expertise in commercial scale manufacture of inactivated viral vaccines under biosafety containment. The company said it was able to expand Covaxin manufacturing capacities in a short timeline primarily due to the availability of new specially designed BSL-3 facilities that have been repurposed as well as pre-existing expertise and know-how to manufacture, test and release highly purified inactivated viral vaccines. The company also for the first time opened up about its pricing strategy, stating that for international markets and supplies to government under EUA (emergency use authorisation) it has been established between $15-20 per dose. However, it did not indicate any pricing for the Indian private market. Currently, under the government vaccination programme the pricing has been capped at Rs 150 per dose. However, at the AIMA session, Dr Ella said he would like to get the maximum price to recover all costs, including the Rs 350 crore spent on clinical trials in order to have money to work on vaccines for various infectious diseases. Covaxin has so far received EUA in Mexico, Philippines, Iran, Paraguay, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Guyana, Venezuela, Botswana, Zimbabwe, even as EUAs are under process in over 60 countries including US and Europe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bharat-bio-to-ramp-up-covaxin-output-to-700m-doses/yr-by-july/articleshow/82170452.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Ludhiana||Unrelenting hike in steel raw material prices, city bizmen want govt help||Ludhiana: City businessmen are furious over the rising rates of steel raw material in the recent past. They say though there has been an increase in the rates of other raw material too, like plastic, copper, polymer, yarn, among others, the hike in the prices of steel is the highest and the main reason is companies exporting it rather than giving priority to the domestic market. Businessmen say due to the price hike, the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are at the receiving end as their production costs have shot up and the government is overlooking the situation. Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), says, “Indian manufacturing sector has been hit very badly in the past few months due to the huge rise in commodity prices like plastic, polymer, copper and yarn. But the rates of steel are only increasing, badly hitting MSMEs of Ludhiana dealing with engineering goods. Steel is the major commodity used by us. Hot rolled coil (HRC) and cold rolled coil (CRC) trade prices are being recorded at an all-time high as all the major steel mills had a few days ago announced a second price hike for April deliveries.” Ahuja says, “Approximate price for HRC with 2-3mm thickness is Rs 63,000 to Rs 64,000 per tonne, while the rate of CRC is between Rs 74,000 and Rs 76,000 per tonne, which has been hiked by almost Rs 4,000 per tonne in both the segments (HRC and CRC) as compared with the prices in the first week of April. As far as the rates of flat steel products are concerned, the hike has been of Rs 3,000 per tonne. Large-scale steel makers are making huge profits by diverting their entire production to export markets and ignoring the domestic buyers, like MSMEs of Ludhiana. The government must intervene and ask companies to sell steel to domestic buyers on priority rather than exporting it.”Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Development Club, is also perplexed over the rates. “We fail to understand how the rates of steel are fluctuating that too in one direction. During the past 15 days alone, there has been a hike in the rates of different raw material in the range of Rs 2,000 to Rs 15,000 per tonne. Besides, be it HRC, CRC, pig iron or TMT bars, there is a shortage of raw material in the markets and the only reason is the government allowing steel manufacturers to have a free run by not restricting their massive exports that give higher profits,” he says.Narinder Bhamra, president of Fasteners’ Manufacturers’ Association of India, says, “The hike in the rates of steel raw material is unstoppable. In March, the rates shot up, but to our shock since March 31 till now these have been only increasing. There is no solution to this problem except the government putting a complete ban on the export of all types of steel raw material used by the MSMEs of the country. It is the only way to bring the situation under control.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/unrelenting-hike-in-steel-raw-material-prices-city-bizmen-want-govt-help/articleshow/82167733.cms||Mohit Behl

In addition, the government has declared Sambhunath Pandit Hospital as a Covid hospital. This will add 220 beds. Private hospitals in Kolkata have already increased 233 Covid beds in the last two days. These 753 beds are among the 3,500 beds, which the state is expected to add by this week, in addition to the existing 4,500 beds. “In the state, 8,000 beds will be made available for Covid treatment by the weekend,” said a state health department official. Several decisions were taken at a meeting presided over by the chief secretary, Alapan Bandyopadhyay, at state secretariat, where all the departmental heads, head of police force, DGPs, CPs and PSU heads were present. An additional 3,400 beds were secured out of the targeted 3,500 beds. “We have scaled up the bed count from 128 to 160 during the last two days and are committed to ramping up our facilities further. We are exploring all options to boost our infrastructure and provide quality treatment with a top-notch pulmonology unit in place,” said Dr Simmardeep Gill, COO, CK Birla Hospitals. “With 20 additional beds, we are now equipped with 63 beds, including 11 ITU beds,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO Peerless Hospital. While RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences is planning to add 51 more beds in the next two weeks, most private hospitals said they will be augmenting Covid beds in phased manner when they get the space. The 10 ESI hospitals across the state, which currently have 50 beds each for Covid care, will have 900 more beds by the weekend, raising the total count of beds to 1,400. The chief secretary also held meetings with the superintendents of all government hospitals on Tuesday to put the focus back on Covid management. In addition, 340 beds in 12 police hospitals have been earmarked for Covid treatment of cops and their kin. An importance is given on building robust regional setups in the districts so that patients do not get referred to Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/target-3-5k-more-cov-beds-in-a-week-state-reaches-753-mark/articleshow/82168583.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The 40-line inscription speaks of an individual who dug the tank more than 370 years ago and donated it to the village. Pattamangalam resident Kamraj alerted Ramanathapuram Archaeological Research Foundation of the stone pillar, measuring 4ft in length and 1ft in width. According to the foundation’s president V Rajaguru, the lines were inscribed in the Tamil year of Sarvathari on the 14th day of the month of Aani. This timeframe, he says, can be compared to AD 1648. As is the case with many inscriptions, the name of a king is not mentioned in this one. The inscription reads ‘Arumpoor Kootram, Kaliyaneri Thugavoorutaiyan Ponni Ataippar Udaiya Nayan’ donated the tank to the village. It goes on to say that a curse would befall on he who destroys this tank, whereas one who protects this tank would attract the same blessing that would accrue to those who protect women, as long as the Sun and Moon exist. It is called the donation of Ayiraveli. A village of the same name exists near Pattamangalam. The other village mentioned in the inscription, Kaliyaneri, is no longer in existence but is said to have been located about 2km from Pattamangalam. ‘Thugavoorutaiyan Ponni Ataippar Udaiya Nayan’ may refer to the name of a royal representative of the Sethupathi kings from Kaliyaneri. Koothan Sethupathi and Thalavai Sethupathi were also known by the adjective `Udaiya Nayan’, Rajaguru said citing evidence from certain stone inscriptions. The Shiva temple, in front of which this tank exists, was constructed around the 13th century in later Pandiya period architecture. It has since been demolished and reconstructed. Medieval period potsherds have been found near this site, Rajaguru added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/villagers-find-17thc-stone-inscription-in-ramnad-tank/articleshow/82168587.cms||---

Ahmed met Tiwari on Tuesday and said that during the time of crisis, it’s important that every possible infrastructure be put to use for benefit of people. Ahmed said, “I have also sent a request to minister Nawab Malik (minorities department) to ensure that elevators and other amenities at Haj House are made functional.” The former minister also sent a similar request to district collector and divisional commissioner. “During my tenure as minority affairs minister, I managed to get one acre land sanctioned to build the Haj House on 20,000 square feet. It was a result of a long struggle and nearly Rs16 crore was spent on construction. So in this pandemic time, no better utilization of Haj House could take place than setting up a Covid care centre,” said Ahmed. He added that apart from treating patients with mild symptoms, the centre can also provide a stopgap arrangement for patients needing oxygen till they got a hospital bed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/create-covid-care-centre-at-haj-house-anees-ahmed/articleshow/82183991.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Chennai||Centre diverts 45 metric tonnes of oxygen from Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh & Telangana; not consulted, TN says||CHENNAI: The Union health ministry has ordered diversion of nearly 45 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen manufactured by Chennai’s sole oxygen supplier, Inox in Sriperumbudur, to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, even as active cases in Tamil Nadu, particularly Chennai, are hitting record numbers every day. Tamil Nadu has 79,804 active cases, compared to 53,889 in Andhra Pradesh and 42,859 in Telangana. TN’s average oxygen requirement is 200 metric tonnes a day. State health minister C Vijayabaskar told TOI on Tuesday that the Centre has taken the decision ‘without consulting the state’ and the move has affected the state’s plan to ensure seamless supply of the lifesaving gas. “We are ready to help all our neighbours. We did so even during the peak of 2020 crisis. But the Centre should have taken the ground reality into account. We will be taking up this issue with the Union health minister soon,” he said. On April 18, National Health Mission joint director Nipun Vinayak wrote to 15 states about the revised supply plan for oxygen after a review meet of the empowered group on oxygen supply. Reallocation was made for Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi and Rajasthan superseding the allocations made on April 15. “According to earlier allocation by the Centre, Tamil Nadu’s supply would have increased from 200 metric tonnes on April 20 to 320 metric tonnes by April 25, and to 465 tonnes by end of April. But as per the revised order, AP and Telangana were allotted 360 metric tonnes of oxygen, while TN’s allotment is still at 200 metric tonnes,” Vijayabaskar said. “According to earlier allocation by the Centre, Tamil Nadu’s supply would have increased to 320 metric tonnes by April 25 and to 465 tonnes by the month-end. But, as per the revised order, each of these states has got 360 metric tonnes of oxygen compared to 200 tonnes for Tamil Nadu,” Vijayabaskar said. The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation, he said, has increased oxygen storage capacity by nearly three times at government hospitals. On Tuesday, state health officials also told health ministry during a video call that the only buffer at the worst-affected district, Chennai, was now being taken away. They also argued that Andhra Pradesh had the Vizag steel plant from where the state couold draw supplies. Last year, at the peak on July 31, Tamil Nadu had 57,968 active cases. For about two to three days around that time, the oxygen requirement jumped to 280 metric tonnes. “If we assume that active cases double compared to last year, the estimate for oxygen requirement, after including problems of delay in treatment, will go up to around 500 metric tonnes,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/centre-diverts-45-metric-tonnes-of-oxygen-from-tn-to-ap-tgana/articleshow/82169670.cms||---

School education minister Varsha Gaikwad told TOI the decision has been taken as “health of students is the priority”. For Std XII (HSC), the government has continued with its status as ‘postponed’ but no new dates have been announced. Gaikwad said, “There was unanimity in taking the decision about SSC cancellation. In the next few days, the state board will study how to allot marks to students. We will inform the public soon about the criteria and evaluation parameters.” Former chairman of Nagpur divisional board Ravikant Deshpande welcomed the decision. “I was at helm in 2020 when the virus struck. We finished our entire HSC schedule before things got worse and only one SSC paper (Geography) was cancelled. It was indeed a mammoth task to get the papers evaluated and collate marks data and declare results. I am happy the government took a student-friendly decision,” said Deshpande. Madhu Joseph, principal of Bengali High School, said this decision could have been made sooner. “I am relieved at this decision by the education minister. With the number of cases increasing everyday, it’s a wise decision. Health is wealth and Maharashtra government has taken the right step,” said Joseph. Mrunalini Dasture, principal of The South Public School, said, “I am extremely happy because students and parents were very worried. The virus strain we have is not sparing children either, so going ahead with the examinations would have spelt disaster.” Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh), said, “We were confident government will take this decision, sooner or later. Lot of parents were in touch with us and kept on asking whether or not the exams will be cancelled.” Shrikrishna Ramteke, principal of Bharat Vidyalaya, said the cancellation prevented mass infections. “Lakhs of students would have appeared for these exams and you can imagine the repercussions of that,” said Ramteke. On April 12, education minister Gaikwad had announced postponement of both SSC and HSC exams. Gaikwad also mentioned that she will contact other boards and ask them to reconsider their exam schedule since their schools were located in Maharashtra, where the Covid-19 cases are rising steadily. Two days later CBSE announced cancellation of Std X exams and postponement of XII. Within a few hours of this, Gaikwad announced state board is also looking into cancellation of SSC, which was finally announced on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-board-too-cancels-ssc-exam/articleshow/82169656.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The dip in prices at the wholesale market over the last few days has forced the retailers to start selling onions at Rs 25-30 per kg from the earlier Rs 35-40 per kg. Onions are now being sold at Rs 9-11 per kg at wholesale while last week it was Rs 13-20 per kg. Hundreds of truck loads of onion are arriving daily at the APMC which exceeds the current demand. A substantial jump in supply these days, say traders, has been due to surplus inflow than actual demand of the Mumbai market now. The prices are likely to fall further in the coming days, as the Nashik onion is expected to dominate the market yet again. APMC director Ashok Walunj said, “Customers are turning up in small numbers due to covid related restrictions. Supply is more than the demand these days.” Onions, a key kitchen staple, that came for Rs 15 to 24 per kg in January saw a price hike in early February due to scant supply from major producing areas of Nashik, Pune and Ahmednagar. Gujarat’s white onion, which has been far cheaper than Maharashtra’s red counterpart, had kept the market stable. Meanwhile, the government has lifted the ban on exports which too helped the domestic market stable||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/onion-prices-drop-as-supply-beats-demand-in-mumbai/articleshow/82170457.cms||---

A division bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee, which will hear the case again on April 22, said the EC would be “at liberty to utilise such government officials and police force as may be necessary” to ensure strict compliance with its guidelines. The high court also directed the state government to inform it on how “to meaningfully co-operate” with the EC to implement the Covid guidelines. State advocate general Kishore Datta told the court that the EC and the chief electoral officer are in control of the situation and “it is for them to do the needful”. CEO Aariz Aftab in his submission stated that in case of breach of strict observance of Covid protocols the commission would not hesitate in banning public meetings, rallies of the defaulting candidate/star campaigners/political leaders. Trinamool on Tuesday also moved before the EC on this issue again. A letter highlighted the HC order that directed the CEO to take urgent measures to avert a “deadly disaster”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-court-asks-poll-panel-to-strictly-enforce-covid-norms/articleshow/82168651.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||Tinsel town under the weather as second Covid wave crashes on Tollywood floor||Kolkata: Hours after Tollywood star Jeet announced being Covid-19 positive on his microblogging site, his ‘Dance Bangla Dance’ co-judge Subhashree Ganguly also posted a similar tweet. Both had shot together for four episodes of the reality show in the middle of April and are now in home isolation. Not only are many on this reality show set getting themselves tested, others elsewhere are taking precautions to deal with the second wave. Memories of Soumitra Chatterjee’s demise 40 days after being infected by Covid-19 last year are fresh in the mind of many in Tollywood. Veteran actors are cautious. Seventy nine-year-old Madhabi Mukherjee lives alone in her south Kolkata flat. Last year, she lost one of her cousins to Covid. Recently, she got a first-hand idea about the gravity of the situation when she found it tough to get her close Covid-positive relative admitted to a nursing home. “Adequate vaccines are not being sent by the Centre. Do we need to build a temple or a hospital now?” she asked. Except for her daughter and three domestic helps, no one is being allowed home. Few popular megaserial actors, who have recently recovered from Covid-19, including Bharat Kaul, Jayashree, Anushree Das and Shruti Das, have returned to shoot. Some veterans are opting out of shooting. Writer-director Leena Gangopadhyay, who has recently recovered from Covid-19, has always worn masks and avoided being on the sets of her ongoing serials. “But as the West Bengal Commission for Women chairperson, I had to go for hearings. Unless I removed my mask, most couldn’t follow what I was saying,” she said. Now, she is tweaking scripts for two of her serials owing to unavailability of some veteran actors. “Anasua Mazumdar and Ratna Ghoshal, who are part of ‘Desher Maati’ and ‘Khorkuto’ respectively, are not keen on shooting now. Besides, I need to make quick changes when people are suddenly falling sick,” she said. Director-turned-TMC’s Barrackpore candidate Raj Chakrabarty plans to get himself tested on April 23 once the election in his constituency gets over this Thursday. Subhashree had campaigned with him in Halisahar on April 13. “That was the last day I met her. I cancelled all her campaigns after that day. Dev too was supposed to campaign for me. But I cancelled all the big campaigns in the wake of the second wave. Subhashree had fever from April 18. Our domestic help was also not unwell before there. My niece also had Covid recently. It is difficult to say how she got infected,” Raj said. According to Subhashree, it’s most difficult to stay away from her son, Yuvaan, now. “Women are multi-taskers and I can manage my home while being isolated in one room. My heart breaks to be away from my baby. It would have been nice if Raj was here. But now, he needs all our support so that he can concentrate and do this work,” she said. Raj, who had lost his father to Covid-19 last year, is staying in Barrackpore while Subhashree is quarantining at home. “My elderly mother is there at home. Election is a big commitment and I can’t leave everything and go now. Even if I go to meet her now, I will not be able to return to my constituency. Subhashree has assured me that she will take care of everything. I have had Covid once and have taken my first shot of vaccine,” he said, admitting that wearing a mask and campaigning has been challenging. “People want to see the face. I would wear the mask and then open it if there were too many such requests. After Subhashree tested positive, I have decided not to remove my mask come what may,” he added. Actor Vikram Chatterjee, who along with Ankush Hazra is co-judging the same show, has already isolated himself. Govinda, who had recently tested Covid negative, was also part of this shooting schedule as a judge. “It is not possible to wear a mask and shoot. I have shot with both Jeet-da and Subhashree till April 16. Back then, they had no symptoms. When I saw Jeet-da’s tweet, I spoke to him. He said he has a running nose,” Vikram said. The actor had immediately wanted to get himself tested but could get a slot only on Wednesday. “Till my results are out, I will be in isolation at home,” he added. Ankush, who has tested negative five times over, will do the test the moment he feels “uneasy”. Priya, the iconic South Kolkata cinema, is temporarily suspending shows from Wednesday. Arijit Dutta, who owns Priya and the Bioscope plex at Axis Mall, Junction Mall (Durgapur) and City Centre (Haldia), "The situation is bad and I want to save as much as possible.” Ratan Saha, the chairman of the exhibitors' section of the Eastern India Motion Pictures Association, told TOI that most of the single screen cinemas of Kolkata are going to shut down from Friday. "The Covid situation is grim. Besides, there are no films available now," Saha said.  Navina had earlier announced suspension of shows from Friday. Menoka too is suspending shows from Friday. "We will reopen once the situation improves," said Menoka's owner Pranab Kumar Roy. SVF Cinemas too is suspending shows from Friday.  However, Suranjan Paul, the owner of Bijoli and Chhabighar, is keeping his halls open since he has to honour a commitment to release a film this week. "Health is a priority but we also need to keep our word. We will maintain all health protocol to ensure the safety of patrons and our staff," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tinsel-town-under-the-weather-as-second-covid-wave-crashes-on-tollywood-floor/articleshow/82168639.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Scindia also spoke to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and lauded efforts by the state government to fulfil the shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir injections. “Our main concern is treatment and proper supply of medicines to the Covid patients. Scindia ji discussed the increasing number of cases in the Gwalior-Chambal region and facilities needed to meet the crisis. We are hopeful to get Remdesivir injections in government as well as private hospitals in and around Gwalior where the demand is increasing in view of a surge in Covid cases,” Tomar told TOI. Tomar further said that Scindia also discussed with chief minister Chouhan about the availability of health equipment and facilities in the region. “Scindia ji lauded the efforts made by the chief minister to meet the demand of medical oxygen and antiviral drug Remdesivir. Chouhan has assured that supply of emergency medicines will be made continuously in the region, including the life-saving drugs so that fatalities could be controlled,” he said. Tomar has also launched a public awareness campaign in the region to caution people about the Covid-19 pandemic. A continuous vigil is being kept in all hospitals to ensure proper supply of oxygen, injections, availability of beds and meals for the families of patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/scindia-takes-stock-of-covid-treatment/articleshow/82168586.cms||---

Petitioner advocate Nipun Singhvi has filed the PIL and sought quashing of RERA’s notification issued on Monday in which it said that proceedings would be conducted through physical hearing and not through virtual mode. His advocate Vishal Dave submitted that numerous representations were made to the authority to conduct the hearings through video conferencing in light of increased Covid-19 cases. It was argued that the high court has ordered all subordinate courts across the state to switch over to the virtual mode of hearing from Monday. The lawyer also submitted that earlier also RERA had violated the high court circulars asking all courts for conducting matter through virtual mode only, and it conducted proceedings through physical hearing by calling litigants and advocates which has posed a great threat to life and liberty to all. The petitioner has requested the HC to direct RERA not to take coercive step against people for their inability to attend proceedings until the online mode of hearing is streamlined. The HC has sought reply in this matter by April 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-to-rera-over-pil/articleshow/82171955.cms||---

The woman was found dead the next morning from the spot where the crime was committed. All three accused have been arrested and further investigation is on. According to Danilimda police, the woman was abducted at about 5pm when she had gone out of her house for some work in Behrampura area. “She was taken to the house of one Raju Solanki in the area where she was drugged and gang-raped by the three accused,” said a police officer. The police said the accused muffled her screams and committed the crime repeatedly even as she struggled in vain to get out of their clutches. The accused — Raju Solanki, Imran and Shakil — made a video of the sordid act and ran away from the spot, leaving the woman in a semi-nude condition, police said. The woman was so brutally assaulted that she died after the incident. The family members of the victim, who were frantically searching for her, later filed a complaint with the police. On a tip-off, the cops questioned Solanki, who is a police informer, about the incident. Solanki then confessed to the crime before the cops and told the police about the involvement of other two accused who were later arrested by the cops. Solanki told police that they abducted the woman and took her to his house where she was repeatedly raped. “The accused stuffed a handkerchief in her mouth fearing that neighbours would hear her call for help and that they would be caught,” said a police official. The official said that the girl was taken to Solanki’s place as the accused thought that police would not suspect any wrongdoing as he was an informer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-drugged-gang-raped-killed/articleshow/82171966.cms||---
---||Chennai||Build elevated bridge across Adyar, says NGT||Chennai: A proposal by the Officers’ Training Academy (OTA) to build a ‘temporary bridge’ across Adyar river so as to connect its two campuses was shot down by National Green Tribunal (NGT). However, the tribunal upheld the state public work department’s insistence that the OTA build a high-level permanent bridge, as it is an safe, appropriate and a cost-effective option. It was during the Chennai floods in 2015 that an existing bridge – Baileys Bridge – across the river collapsed. Noting that this, along with another bridge named Irish had obstructed water flow in Adyar, thereby inundating the whole of Manappakkam, a retired IAS officer, C K Sreedharan, whose house was also damaged, moved the NGT in May 2016 seeking to stop the restoration of Bailey’s Bridge. OTA told the tribunal that Baileys Bridge had hume pipes to clear excess water flow during adverse conditions and that it got damaged due to sudden release of water from Chembarambakkam reservoir. The academy also claimed that there was nothing illegal about its construction, as they obtained necessary permission from Tamil Nadu Public Works Department (PWD), Without the bridge, movement of training materials and personnel was severely hampered, OTA added. However, in 2017 the PWD denied permission for OTA to construct a ‘temporary bridge’ as a replacement. The department, however, said it was not against the idea of having a permanent concrete bridge across the river. NGT told the state agencies to consider the possibility of constructing a hanging bridge or suspension bridge without pillars on river plain, as it would minimise the impact on free flow of river water and river ecology. PWD responded that it was not feasible to have such hanging bridges since their construction on a plain terrain like Chennai city was complicated. So, it recommended a high-level permanent bridge as an appropriate and cost-effective option. Since there was no reply from OTA even after notice, NGT told OTA to accept PWD's recommendation and disposed of the case on April 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/build-elevated-bridge-across-adyar-says-ngt/articleshow/82168661.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After 6 years, man acquitted as survivor fails to depose||Mumbai: Six-and-a-half years after a now 29-year-old man was accused of repeatedly sexually assaulting his minor friend, a special Pocso court recently acquitted him after the survivor did not depose in court despite a bailable warrant. The minor’s father told court the 14-year-old had married and moved to another city 15 days after the incident in September 2014, and he did not know her whereabouts. Looking at medical evidence, the court pointed out that the “finger test” by a medical officer on the minor had been condemned by Supreme Court. In 2013, the SC observed that two-finger test and its interpretation violated the right of rape survivors to privacy, physical and mental integrity and dignity. The test was banned by government in May 2014. The court said it was acquitting the man, a driver, as the prosecution failed to examine the minor, and there were no other eye-witnesses to the case. “...since medical officer deposed that the prosecutrix (minor) did not have fresh rupture of hymen and there was no bleeding, further, since the prosecution failed to prove the referring of clothes of accused and her to the Forensic Science Laboratory, it is difficult to hold that offences are proved beyond reasonable doubt of the accused.” An FIR lodged on September 22, 2014, said two days earlier, when the girl went to a public toilet near her house, the accused called her home. It said that when she went, he repeatedly raped her. Since her mouth and hands were allegedly tied, she could not shout for help. The FIR said he showed a knife and threatened her. It said at 3am he took her to another spot on a bike and dropped her near the house at 7am. Her family found her there. The minor then told them about the incident. The accused denied the allegations in court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-6-years-man-acquitted-as-survivor-fails-to-depose/articleshow/82169701.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kochi||KMRL pulls down bund across Chilavannoor backwaters||Kochi: The Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) has completed demolition of the bund, which was constructed across the Chilavannoor backwaters for facilitating work on a viaduct as part of the Padmasarovaram project. TOI had carried a series of articles demanding demolition of the bund, which was causing waterlogging in Elamkulam, Kadavanthra and Ponnurunni areas. “We have removed coconut tree trunks piled into the riverbed for constructing the bund,” a KMRL official said. While hearing a petition in this regard in November 2020, the Kerala high court had ordered the Kochi corporation and KMRL to demolish the bund. But, the authorities hadn’t taken any move to dismantle the bund till recently. It was in 2005 that the Kochi corporation authorities designed Padmasarovaram project, which consists of a park and other recreational facilities on the banks of Chilavannoor backwaters near Elamkulam. Later, the corporation authorities changed the design and decided to construct a viaduct across the backwaters and set up a cycle track and walkway on it. They entrusted the implementation of the project with KMRL. The work was started in 2017 without securing key approvals, including the permission from Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA). Elamkulam village officer had then issued a memo to KMRL and the corporation to stop the work citing that the project didn’t have necessary clearances. The then village officer S Usha gave a report to the government that the illegal construction had been causing waterlogging in the area. Within a couple of days, she was transferred, a move the environmentalist terms as vengeance at the behest of land mafia. Revenue vigilance also reported that the bund should be demolished. According the environmentalists, the corporation and KMRL constructed the bund for helping the big sharks who own land on either side of the backwaters.  “Once the bund is constructed, the salinity of the water near the shores will decrease and the high tide line (HTL), on the basis of which CRZ limits are fixed, will move further into the backwaters. So, the holdings owned by big sharks on either side of the backwaters will get exempted from CRZ limits,” said K T Cheshire, a RTI activist. “Many other agencies have already constructed bridges across the backwaters. They never constructed bunds across the backwaters for facilitating the work. But the KMRL and the corporation had constructed the bund with an objective to help the land sharks,” said Cheshire, who had filed a petition before the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau alleging corruption behind the execution of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kmrl-pulls-down-bund-across-chilavannoor-backwaters/articleshow/82167759.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Started my terrace garden, inspired others||By Ajay K I was just finishing my third year BSc (in agriculture) when lockdown hit. As classes moved online, my learning got limited to theoretical knowledge. My father, a private employee, who was born into a family of farmers, sensed that it wasn’t ideal and decided to do something about it. Initially, he suggested I travel to some nearby farm to get hands on experience. But when that seemed like an impossibility – commuting to a farm every day from the city was not feasible -- he came up with another idea: terrace gardening. He suggested we start growing fruits and vegetables on our own terrace. When I first heard about it, I laughed it off. "I will not work out daddy," was my first reaction. But he was adamant. He even explained how terrace gardens will become the future as more and more people start living in apartments and there is hardly any open space left around our homes. I reluctantly agreed. Since my father is a great champion of waste recycling, we decided to take 50 used curd buckets (each `40), a few broken buckets and five plastic trays to start our garden the organic way. We decided against using any chemical fertilizer or pesticide. So, we sourced cattle dung and poultry manure from local vendors and bought half a truck of red soil. We filled the buckets with well mixed soil and tended to them carefully for a few days after that. On the fourth or fifth day we saw some sprouts coming out from all the buckets, and later realised those were tomato seedlings coming out, as some cattle excreta contained tomato seeds in it. Slowly and steadily, thereafter, we started sowing chilly, brinjal, bitter gourd, ridge gourd, mustard, yellow cucumber (Dosakiah), palak, mint, coriander, colocasia and one water-melon plant in our 150 square yard terrace. Within a few weeks, we got a great yield of leafy vegetables, chilies, tomatoes etc. Soon, we were having our own vegetables for our meals -- and it only made the food more tasty and healthy as we were not using any chemicals. I cannot thank my father enough for floating this idea and helping me set up the garden. Today, the garden has inspired a lot of friends and neighbours who have been asking for my advice to start a similar thing in their homes. This lockdown has, clearly, made me become more innovative and creative. (The writer is a BSc, Agriculture, graduate) ........................................... Reading to photography: Lockdown days were filled with fun activities By Pravallika Manyoktha Initially, the lockdown was a lot of fun for me and my brother as we had plenty of time to play and binge-watch our favourite shows. As days progressed, we started missing school and our friends. Having parents working from home, had its own share of problems. We had to help Amma with the daily chores as the maid was not allowed to work. Nanna started gardening and we had to help him water the plants. Every day, my brother and I used to watch them grow. Finally, we were able to produce tomatoes and chillies from our garden. We usually go to my grandmother’s place every summer vacation, but the lockdown foiled all our travel plans. We were confined to our house. As I had interest in art, Amma got me enrolled in an online art class where I learnt a few interesting things -- 3D art being one of them. I made a 3D greeting card for my grandparents’ 50th wedding anniversary and it made them really happy. Apart from this, I used my time to complete my Harry Potter series, learn about Indian states with my brother -- their capitals, main crop, languages, rivers etc. It was a lot of fun. In class 7, we had the option of joining a student club, based on our interest. I opted for the photography club. We used to have online sessions with our seniors every day, who told us about the basics of photography. Nanna gave his phone so that I could practise taking shots with it. Initially I used to take photographs of trees, flowers, pigeons, food and so on. I got to understand the modes of photography too. One of the new things I learnt was the golden shot. Though I have tried it many times earlier, I never got it right. But then, one day I finally got the shot right when my brother held the flower for me patiently. I was so excited about the shot that I posted it in my family WhatsApp groups. Now, I am my family’s professional photographer!

---||Hyderabad||DA case: GST official Bollineni Srinivasa Gandhi held by CBI||HYDERABAD: Two years after a disproportionate assets (DA) case was registered and Rs 4 crore worth assets were unearthed, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday arrested suspended GST assistant commissioner Bollineni Srinivasa Gandhi. Sources in the CBI said Gandhi was arrested as he failed to cooperate with the investigation. Despite several notices issued by the investigating agency, Gandhi had refused to cooperate. Gandhi had earlier served in the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for more than seven years and handled high-profile money laundering cases. Gandhi is also facing a CBI probe in another scandal. He along with suspended GST deputy commissioner (services tax anti-evasion) Chilaka Sudha Rani were named as accused in Rs 5 crore bribery scandal. The CBI, in July 2019, conducted searches on Gandhi’s properties in Hyderabad and Vijayawada and unearthed Rs 4 crore worth of assets. Bribe giver Satya Sridhar Reddy Jagan Nagari, director of Bharani Commodities Private Ltd, an accused in the GST tax evasion case, was also booked by the CBI in the FIR issued on September 11, 2019. Gandhi and Sudha Rani led investigation in March 2019 and detected a fake invoice fraud where Rs 1,289 crore was raised and found Rs 224 crore illegal input tax credit involving eight companies linked to Sridhar Reddy and others. The two officials were later accused of demanding Rs 5 crore bribe from Bharani Commodities. The duo accepted Rs 10 lakh cash in advance on April 15, 2019. Sridhar Reddy allegedly paid Rs 10 lakh to the officials to prevent the arrest of his wife in the case. Gandhi had initially worked in the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence between 2002 and 2012 and later in the ED from 2012 to 2019. He later was made a superintendent in GST commissionerate and promoted, on an ad hoc basis, as assistant commissioner. He, however, was suspended from GST wing after the DA case was filed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/da-case-gst-official-gandhi-held-by-cbi/articleshow/82170454.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Chennai||AICTE insists on new rule to sanction new courses||Chennai: Much to the chagrin of private engineering colleges who could not fill at least 50% of their seats last year, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has decided to contest a Madras high court order permitting such colleges to apply for new courses this year. At least 258 engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu were able to apply for new courses following an interim order of the high court. However, AICTE has now clarified that it has not relaxed the minimum 50% admission norm, and that it would contest the interim orders of the high court. "AICTE has allowed the colleges only to apply for new courses. We are contesting the interim order. The norm was introduced to improve the quality of engineering programmes," an AICTE official said. It all began with the AICTE’s approval process handbook for 2021-22, where it had stated that new courses would be allowed only in case of more than 50% overall enrolment last year. Assailing the new norms, Consortium of Self-Financing Professional, Arts and Science Colleges in Tamil Nadu moved the high court and obtained an interim stay against the regulation. The consortium also sent a representation to the AICTE to give relaxation based on the court order. Meanwhile, the court extended the interim stay till April 26. Pursuant to the court order, AICTE allowed 258 engineering members of the consortium to apply for new courses on its web portal. A representative from the consortium said more than 100 engineering colleges were interested to apply for new courses. "The council is not opening the portal for the colleges, which had already submitted their application, for approval. New courses will be the lifeline for the engineering courses which are facing the survival test," he said. Colleges said students were not preferring traditional engineering courses like civil, electrical and electronics and mechanical engineering, resulting in poor admissions last year. "We need to be allowed to start a new course in emerging areas, including artificial intelligence and data science, cyber security, among others. It would ensure the survival of these colleges," the representative said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aicte-insists-on-new-rule-to-sanction-new-courses/articleshow/82168665.cms||---
---||Pune||Assessment must be fair to all, say parents of CICSE board students||PUNE: The decision by Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) to cancel class X exams has brought relief to students and parents but many are concerned about the assessment process. CISCE does not have many schools offering Std XI in the city which means there is a tough competition to get into both CISCE board schools and the other schools. This makes the ICSE marks crucial for making the cut in First Year Junior College (FYJC) admissions. Parents are worried that even if the board chooses to go by the internal examination marks, there is a lack of transparency about how honestly the students wrote the examinations. A circular dated April 19 tells all schools to begin the admission for Std XI and prepare a schedule for online classes for class XI. “The CISCE is committed to devising ‘a fair and an unbiased criterion’. The criterion for preparing the results will be declared for the ICSE students and the date of the result will be announced by the CISCE later,” it said. Tina Saigal, parent of a Std X student, said, “Students have been preparing for over a year now and any delay would have meant they would have kept preparing which would have led to a burnout. However, now we need the board to quickly make a decision on what formula would be used for result calculation because that would decide admissions for Std XI.” Another parent who did not wish to be named said it was going to be hard to work out a completely fair formula. “There are parents who have been very strict with their wards while they attempted the online and preliminary board exams. Even if the student was not completely prepared, they were not allowed to refer to the notes or the textbook. Then, there are parents who have let the students use the textbook and then those who did not check whether the child was using fair or unfair means to write the exams. Now, if the board decides to use the internal assessment marks, it may be unfair. Maybe they can use the marks scored by students in annual exams of the previous years and then arrive at a formula,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/assessment-must-be-fair-to-all-say-parents-of-cicse-board-students/articleshow/82168672.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Nagpur||Hidden toll: Over 1,300 more deaths after Covid, routine fatalities in March||NAGPUR: In March, the city witnessed 1,307 more deaths than usual, after accounting for Covid-19 victims and the average monthly fatalities before the pandemic. This hidden toll, which is three times the registered Covid fatalities, is also a result of the pandemic, say doctors and activists. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has compiled data of cremations performed in March at 23 ghats, 10 Muslim cemeteries and two Christian cemeteries in the city. This shows 3,351 funerals were performed in the city in March. The district started to witness second wave of the pandemic from third week of February. Cases and deaths rose from beginning of March. The district registered 763 Covid-19 deaths in March, of which 446 were residents of the city, 224 from rural parts of the district, and 93 from other districts who succumbed during treatment in hospitals in the city. Funeral of all deceased from city was done here. As per norms, 93 deceased from other districts were also cremated here. Around 40% (90) of 224 deceased from rural parts of the district were also cremated here. Thus, 183 deceased from rural and other districts were cremated here. So, of the total 3,351 funerals, 3,168 funerals done in city were of native residents. In March last year, there had been 1,415 funerals in the city, which can be considered the routine number of deaths. Adding the city’s official Covid toll of 446 in March, we would expect total 1,861 fatalities. However, since there were 3,168 funerals, the city witnessed 1,307 excess deaths in March. If one considers data of last 12 months of the pandemic, the city registered 3,286 excess deaths, which is almost at par with the official Covid toll of 3,248. Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) Dr Anup Marar told TOI, “The statistics are alarming. This can surely be linked to the pandemic as there was no other obvious cause for fatalities. Many patients are testing negative in RT-PCR but positive in CT scan and other clinical parameters in second wave. Deaths of swab negative patients were obviously not counted in Covid toll.” He also said the health infrastructure is unable to handle the load, and many seniors with comorbidities did not get hospital beds, and their home deaths may have been certified without RT-PCR test. Anyway, RT-PCR test of dead body has become practically impossible as home visits from laboratories have stopped due to high case load. Also, relatives do not wish to wait for RT-PCR results in 24-36 hours before going for the funeral. “The city does not have enough mortuaries even if people waited for RT-PCR reports of all such deaths,” he said. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “There is high possibility of Covid deaths due to lack of access to medical care or delayed care. With almost all hospitals turned into Covid, getting bed for non-Covid patients has become difficult. Also, many patients are not willing to go to hospital due to Covid scare. If healthcare system has collapsed, all deaths should be counted as Covid fatalities in direct or indirect manner.” Activist Narayan Ahuja said, “Many senior citizens and comorbid died at homes with symptoms, but without tests being done in March. The number is higher in April, which will become clear after NMC’s data is here next month. NMC should investigate all home deaths to find exact impact of the pandemic. These deaths are due to improper management of disaster and lack of awareness by authorities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hidden-toll-over-1300-more-deaths-after-covid-routine-fatalities-in-mar/articleshow/82169686.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Delhi||AAP and BJP spar over lifting of waste from Covid patients’ homes||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party has alleged that municipal corporations are not clearing the garbage from the households having Covid-19 patients under home isolation. Durgesh Pathak, the party’s MCD incharge, said that over 37,000 people in Delhi were under home isolation, and due to mismanagement of cleaning the garbage of these patients, there was a massive risk of spread of the virus. The AAP’s functionary requested Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta to form a team and ensure timely collection of waste generated in homes of the Covid-19 patients. During a health emergency, corporations should streamline garbage clearance and stay away from doing dirty politics, Pathak said. Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said it was sad that Pathak was playing the blame game during the pandemic. “All three corporations are, for the past one year, regularly working to collect biogarbage from homes of all Covid patients under isolation. Last week, the corporations had even issued centralised helpline numbers for people to call Covid garbage collection service. The blame game is an insult to the hard-working sanitary workers who are risking their own safety moving from home to home of Covid patients to collect garbage,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-and-bjp-spar-over-lifting-of-waste-from-covid-patients-homes/articleshow/82169698.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The officials went into quarantine after four councillors who attended the council meeting last Saturday tested Covid positive. As those who attended election campaign were asked to undergo Covid test, antigen tests were conducted among the councillors in the municipality on Saturday morning. Some councillors gave samples and attended the council meeting held after that. As the meeting was going on inside the air conditioned hall, results of two councillors came positive forcing rest of the members in the hall to undergo quarantine. RT-CR tests of two more councillors were also tested positive on Tuesday. Chairman Antony Asanparambil said despite shortage of officials, daily works of the municipality has not been affected as officials and councillors who are under quarantine are coordinating the works over phone. Meanwhile on Tuesday, the revenue team along with police assistance reached Nettoor international market on Tuesday morning to seal shops that failed to pay tax and refused to take licence. As the merchants and union workers objected the move, a meeting was held under Panagad circle inspector. It has been decided to give seven days to the merchants to take licence and pay tax. Around 140 shops function in the 20-year-old market, without licence and paying tax. When the local body tried to close the shops in 2016, the merchants approached the Kerala high court against the move. The court gave a favourable order to the local body in November last year to close and seal illegal shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/daily-works-not-hit-despite-staff-going-under-quarantine/articleshow/82167774.cms||---

Most of the critical patients are aged below 50 years. “Almost 70%-90% of the patients, who are admitted to critical care units, have not yet had a single dose of the Covid vaccine. Those, who contracted Covid after getting a single dose, have less severe symptoms and are being managed in the general ward,” said a doctor. Out of the 13 patients under ECMO support at Medica Superspecialty Hospital at present, only one 57-year-old patient had been administered the first dose. Of the rest, aged between 19 years and 55 years, some are not yet eligible for the vaccination, while some others contracted the infection before they could take the vaccine. A 68-year-old patient had fallen ill a day before he was scheduled to get the first dose. “So far, we have not noted severe infection among those who completed both the doses of the vaccination,” said ECMO specialist Arpan Chakraborty of Media Superspecialty Hospital. At Ruby General Hospital, too, 80% of patients under critical care have not taken a single dose. “Most of them are aged below 50 years,” said Rimita Dey, critical care specialist at the hospital. “No vaccine provides 100% protection from contracting the virus. It takes at least 15 days for the body to develop antibodies after the inoculation,” said clinical trial specialist Santanu Tripathi, former head of clinical and experimental pharmacology at School of Tropical Medicine. “Only two out of nine, who had got their first doses, are requiring ITU care, while the remaining seven and the two fully vaccinated patients are recuperating well in the general ward,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. “Two doses of the vaccine are going to provide enough protection to a patient so that he or she will not have to land up in the ICU. Even if one gets the infection, it could be mild in most cases. So, we need to speed up the inoculation pace,” said immunologist, Dipyaman Ganguly, scientist at Indian Institute of Chemical Biology Kolkata. About 80% of the positive patients at CMRI Hospital have not yet been inoculated, said sources. “When we talk about vaccination, we look at reduction in infections and the severity of the disease,” said pulmonologist Raja Dhar of the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/most-critical-patients-are-below-50-not-inoculated/articleshow/82168664.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The decision to set up this facility was taken following the second wave.  Metropolitan commissioner R A Rajeev has inspected the site near Mindspace. The land had been identified by the BMC. A senior MMRDA official said, “Nearly 70% of the beds installed will have an oxygen facility. Also, there will be 200 intensive care unit (ICU) beds to treat critical patients.” Sources said work on the site will begin soon and the facility is expected to come up by mid-May. MMRDA is expected to spend around Rs 65 crore to set up this facility. Rajeev said, “MMRDA is also financially helping urban local bodies in MMR such as Thane Municipal Corporation, Ulhasnagar Municpal Corporation, Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation (MBMC), and Ambernath and Badlapur bodies for setting up temporary dedicated Covid healthcare centres and an oxygen plant.” At BKC, MMRDA set up a Covid care facility in two phases in June 2020. In Phase I, a 1,059-bed hospital was set up while in Phase 2, there were an equal number of beds with some notified as ICU beds. Over 20,000 people have been discharged after treatment from this facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mmrda-to-set-up-2000-bed-covid-facility-in-malad-in-may/articleshow/82167788.cms||Manthank Mehta

Unlike last year when families of Covid victims were left with little option to choose a crematorium for their near and dear ones, the civic body now is looking to help them by earmarking some as Covid-designated ones and facilitating the funeral arrangements. “We are in the process of making the cremation process more rational and humane. Instead of taking the victim’s body to an undisclosed place, we are planning to offer a family the option to go for a crematorium which is located closer to the victim’s neighbourhood,” said a KMC official. “We will follow the same rules in case of burial grounds too,” said a KMC official. According to a KMC health department official, the civic body was developing an integrated information app based on the availability of space in the Covid-designate crematoriums and burial grounds which will help family of a victim to choose between crematoriums and burial grounds. “Once we integrate our Covid-designate crematoriums we will have the latest information on the status of cremation in each of these crematoriums. Accordingly, we will pass on the information to the families of victims giving them an option to choose between crematoriums,” said a civic official. Once the app is developed, the KMC will provide a helpline for the citizens. Acting on a state government advisory, nodal officers have been identified to ensure seamless funeral arrangements for the departed. “Last year at the beginning of the pandemic, we had to face problems because of lack of coordination among the Covid-designate crematoriums. While Dhapa crematorium was over-burdened, Nimtala and Birjunala in Garden Reach had fewer victims for cremation. This year we need to bridge the gap,” a senior KMC official said. Apart from offering the option for choosing crematoriums, the KMC health department will also arrange for priests for enabling the families to perform the last rites. “We are getting flooded with requests from across the city to consider arranging last rites for a Covid victim at the designated crematoriums. After holding talks with our officials posted at the crematoriums, we have decided that families of Covid victims will be allowed to perform the last rites if they wish. But no one will be allowed to go near the body or the pyre,” said a KMC health department official. “We have planned to engage extra manpower at such Covid-designate crematoriums and augment facilities this time to give relief to the families,” a civic official said. However, the number of family members will be restricted both at the crematoriums and burial grounds, according to a guideline issued by Nabanna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-to-streamline-cov-victims-funeral-process/articleshow/82168685.cms||Saikat Ray

The school education department has distributed bridge course material and work books to all government and government-aided students in the past two days. Video lessons have also been prepared for both bridge course and workbooks. “The video lessons for bridge courses will be telecast from April 22 to May 10 on Kalvi TV. For each class, two lessons a day (each lesson for 30 minutes) will be telecast on the channel,” a circular from the school education department to chief educational officers said. As per the schedule released by the school education department, the bridge courses will be telecast from 12 noon to 4.30 pm The video lessons for workbook will be telecast from May 11. The course, along with work sheets, will fill the gap in learning for these students, say officials, adding it will help them refresh what they had learnt in the previous academic year. The course material has been prepared in two volumes - one for Tamil and English and another volume for science, social science subjects. Maths, which has been split into two parts, has been included in two volumes. "A subject teacher can take a bridge course in 10 days. It was prepared in both English and Tamil," a teacher said. Workbooks have been prepared for individual subjects. "After watching a lesson, students can do exercises and learn topics on their own through worksheets for each lesson," another teacher said. Teachers have been asked to ensure that the students are watching these bridge courses and complete the evaluation work the same day. "The core concepts will be presented in a simplified version through video lessons. It is more like a revision in the classroom. Students will learn some of the key concepts they missed due to the pandemic," an official said. The school education department produced more than 5,500 video lessons which were telecast in Kalvi TV and 10 other private TV channels to help the government school students to learn during Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/class-i-to-ix-students-to-do-bridge-courses-to-make-up-for-lost-time/articleshow/82168670.cms||---

On Monday night, in Outer Delhi’s Paschim Vihar, the cops provided a green corridor to facilitate movement of two oxygen tankers to Balaji Action Hospital after its stock reached critical levels. At risk were 235 Covid patients and the tankers were stuck on the Delhi borders amid Covid restrictions. Around 11.30pm, they got the information that the tankers carrying 19,500 litre liquid oxygen were stuck at a border point in a traffic jam. “A dedicated corridor was provided by the outer district police and the tankers were escorted by Delhi Police vehicles to the hopsital,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (outer) Sudhanshu Dhama. The cops arranged another 25 oxygen cylinders through cooperation of the medical superintendents of Sanjay Gandhi, Bhagwan Mahavir, Maharaja Agrasen and Jaipur Golden hospitals for Balaji Action Hospital, he said. Delhi Police officials also managed to arrange oxygen cylinders for a hospital in Nangloi when its supplies started running out. The director of Mansaram Hospital, Ravinder Dabas, said they had 33 Covid-positive patients. “I was trying at multiple places but nothing was available. Delhi Police arranged the oxygen cylinders in an hour,” Dabas said. In north Delhi, it was a race against time for the cops after they received an SOS call from NKS Super Specialty Hospital around 4.37pm on Tuesday. Out of its 130 patients, 102 were suffering from Covid and the hospital ran out of oxygen. “The hospital authorities had tried to overcome the shortage, but cylinders were not available,” the DCP said. As agitated relatives of the patients started gathering at the hospital, a senior official assured them that all efforts would be made to replenish the supply at the earliest. The cops reached a dealer in Mayapuri where 53 cylinders were sent by the NKS hospital for refilling around 5pm. On reaching there at 5.37pm, the cops got the cyliners filled up and were back in the hospital around 6.08pm through a green corridor. In the meantime, they also arranged 15 cylinders from Moti Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/short-on-oxygen-370-covid-19-patients-find-saviours-in-cops/articleshow/82169704.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Doctors’ body proposes lockdown||AHMEDABAD: Even as the state government representatives have been reiterating there will be no lockdown in Gujarat, the state branch of Indian Medical Association has suggested in its submission to Gujarat high court, seeking to impose a two-week lockdown in the state. “If the state government is not in favour of a lockdown, then it should think of restricting various activities to control people's movement outside their homes,” Dr Devendra Patel, president, IMA, Gujarat chapter, told the High Court. Patel made suggestions before a division bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia during an online hearing on a PIL taken up suo motu on overall coronavirus situation in the state. “The government should completely ban all kind of gatherings, be it social, political or religious. If possible, the government should impose a total lockdown for 14 days. If it is not possible, then put severe restrictions on activities," Patel informed the bench. Responding to the suggestions, government pleader Manisha Shah said taking a decision about imposing a lockdown is akin to "walking on the edge of sword". Isolated initiatives of observing a partial or a self-lockdown are being taken by various trade associations, with some announcing curtailing of working hours..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/doctors-body-proposes-lockdown/articleshow/82168674.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Good samaritans reach out to poor with ration for Ramzan||Mumbai: As new curbs to control Covid-19 cases hit poor families, some good samaritans and philanthropists have reached out to the needy with ration packets. A section of the beneficiaries are the the poor and daily wage-earners. Bandra senior activist Shadaab Patel, along with father Shabbir, began distributing ration packets among the poor a week back. So far, they have distributed over 1,200 packets, each weighing a 24kg ration containing rice, flour, pulses, sugar, ghee, edible oil, spices and other things that are needed in Ramzan. “The poor are finding it difficult to make two ends meet. Due to the restrictions, shops and businesses are shut and daily wagers have been rendered jobless. They need ration to survive,” said Shadaab. City Congress vice-chairman (minority cell) Mudassr Patel has begun distributing Ramzan ration among the needy. “Last year’s lockdown had made the poor poorer. Now many families desperately need help. We are initially trying to reach out to those families which desperately need ration.,” said Mudassar Patel. He added that the new restrictions could not have come at a worse time for many Muslim families. “This is the holy month of Ramzan, when Muslims are fasting. Many poor families don’t have enough resources to prepare one nutritious meal. We are reaching out to some of those families with our ration kits which will help them prepare good food in the night during Ramzan,” said Mudassar Patel. Both Shadaab and Mudassar had carried out massive relief work for the needy migrants and other poor and needy during last year’s lockdown. They felt if the restrictions stretch, the condition of the poor will worsen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-good-samaritans-reach-out-to-poor-with-ration-for-ramzan/articleshow/82170463.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Pune||Maharashtra: No cakewalk in choice of faculty for FYJC this year||PUNE: Now that the central education boards and the state board have cancelled the Standard X examinations and announced that all students will be given a general promotion, there is a frisson of worry surrounding the basis of subject selection for first-year junior college (FYJC, Std XI). Students are worried about getting the subject of their choice. The general basis of choosing the stream among students largely depends on the marks. However, the cancellation of exams has put students in a quandary about the basis of marks and how the admission process will be conducted thereafter. Educator Smita Atre said, “Although students can opt for any stream irrespective of their marks, the problem arises when a majority of them want to apply for popular colleges in the city. That is when the merit list comes into play. How fairly the board measures and marks students remains to be seen.” Students who have joined coaching for entrance exams like IIT, NEET among others will surely go for the science stream but those who are undecided about the stream will have to wait and watch for the marking system. A parent of a Std X student, Rahul Kulkarni, said, “My child has not decided yet about the stream and was largely dependent on the marks he scores because he has some choices of colleges in the city where he wants to take admissions. He is still not sure between commerce and arts. This decision by the government to cancel the exam has added to the confusion.” Reyansh Kakde, a state board student in std X, said, “The merit list plays an important role at the time of admissions and the marks scored by the students are at par with all other boards when it comes to calculations as per best of five subjects. I am going to go for the science stream but how they are going to ensure that the marking is equal and fair within all the boards is not known.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-cakewalk-in-choice-of-faculty-for-fyjc-this-year/articleshow/82173390.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Bed capacity up, not manpower||CHANDIGARH: A total of 1,659 beds have been dedicated for Covid-19 patients across the Tricity. The Mohali administration has tied up with private hospitals that have reserved 50% of their beds for treating the infected. Similarly, 30% of beds in private hospitals are reserved in Panchkula. In Chandigarh, UT administrator V P Singh Badnore on Tuesday directed PGI to convert Infosys Sarai into a temporary hospital for moderate patients and suggested some technical health staff be deputed from PGI to GMCH, Sector 32, or GMSH, Sector 16, facing staff shortage. PGI — having 253 dedicated Covid beds —has increased the strength by 30 more beds. A total of 80% of the beds are occupied. “What is worrying us is the manpower, although. For instance, for a 10-bed ICU, there is a requirement of around 45 health care workers, including doctors, nurses and other support staff. The recruitments are slow and until that time, we have to manage with the existing staff,” said a faculty member at PGI. “Why can’t Chandigarh also tie up with private hospitals?” he asked. Data from the Mohali deputy commissioner’s office has stated that within this week, there will be an enhancement of almost 23% of the bed capacity from the existing 713 to 922 beds at L2 and L3 levels (for complicated and critical care). Seven private hospitals have been asked for 50% beds to be reserved. A total of 88% of beds are occupied in Mohali’s hospitals. “We have 60 beds for L2 level care and 20 beds are reserved in Dhakoli for the same level. As many as 100 operational beds are for L1 in Chandigarh University, Gharuan. For critical care, we send patients to Rajindra hospital, Patiala, as we have no such facility here,” said Dr Adarshpal Kaur, chief medical officer, Mohali. She said, “We have a shortage of manpower. We have sent requirements for 20 doctors and 20 staff nurses. Till now, we have received six doctors and six nurses. The others are in the process of recruitment and deputation from other districts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bed-capacity-up-not-manpower/articleshow/82167796.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Shivraj forced to dial Uddhav, Yogi, Gehlot||BHOPAL: At a time when Madhya Pradesh is crying out for oxygen, there have been instances of tankers carrying oxygen to the state being stopped by officials in other states, like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Maharashtra. In some cases, it took calls from the CMO to get them released, say sources. In the last two days, officials in Gujarat and Maharashtra held up oxygen supply at the source points, where they were being filled up for delivery to MP. Chief minister Shivraj Singh spoke with the chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan over phone about the incidents, say sources in the government. The CMO said that the tankers were not held up by the governments of these states but by some local officials, either at source or when they were about to cross over to MP. “The issue has been resolved,” the CMO said. The Shivraj government has given ambulance status to oxygen tankers in MP. A green channel is created for them and they are escorted by police to ensure there are no hold-ups. “Every minute is crucial these days. Hospitals are swamped with Covid patients. Liquid oxygen systems and cylinders have to be refilled on a war footing as lives depend on it,” an official said, pointing out the Shahdol tragedy where at least six critically ill patients died as oxygen pressure dipped. On Monday, there were allegations that lack of oxygen led to deaths at a Bhopal hospital. All around, there is a desperation for oxygen. It’s common to see people carrying home oxygen cylinders on two-wheelers. Outside hospitals, patients’ kin wait in cars with oxygen cylinders. CM Chouhan has spoken with PM Narendra Modi, Union ministers and CMs of many states to ensure uninterrupted supply to Madhya Pradesh. MP has no oxygen plant, and is dependent on other states and private firms. The CMO said that 414 metric tonnes of oxygen is available in Madhya Pradesh now. On April 18, 390 MT of oxygen was available against a consumption of 347 MT. The government hopes to increase oxygen availability to 565 MT by April 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cmo-steps-in-to-free-oxy-tankers-held-up-in-other-states/articleshow/82168687.cms||---

A Covid patient, Soni, 50, had breathing troubles and since he had comorbidities he was advised hospitalization by his physician. But an eight-hour wait for the ambulance followed by five more hours outside the hospital cost him his life, his family says. Within 90 minutes of getting admitted to Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad at 9pm, Soni succumbed. His kin alleged that the delay in treatment led to his death. “My uncle received his Covid report on Monday itself. But since he has comorbidities and was facing breathing troubles, the physician advised him to seek hospital admission,” said Meet Shelat, Soni’s nephew. “Even though we called the ambulance early in the morning, by the time it arrived, it was around 4pm.” Soni was taken to Civil Hospital but was compelled to wait in queue. “We reached around 5pm and his condition was worsening. We informed the hospital authorities, but we were in the queue of ambulances outside the hospital,” said Shelat. “We managed to get him in around 9pm but by then his condition was already poor. At around 10.30pm, he was pronounced dead.” Shelat alleged that proper treatment was unavailable even when the patient was admitted. The family’s ordeal didn’t end there because it took over 12 hours to get Soni’s body. “Around 2.30am, we were asked to wait near the morgue. When we reached I was aghast to see a queue there as well,” Shelat said. “We were 35th in the queue and it was around 10.30am when we got the body.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/8-hr-wait-for-ambulance-5-hrs-for-admission-claims-life/articleshow/82168898.cms||---

After 19 days of a new high every day, MP’s daily Covid count dropped for the first time on Wednesday. The rate of rise in infections has also slowed down somewhat. Wednesday’s Covid count of 12,727 was a drop of 160 over Tuesday’s. Also, there were fewer deaths (75) than the previous day. The positivity rate also dripped from 25.3% to 24.7%, but it’s still alarmingly high. Active cases have shot up to 78,271, and government officials fear it will touch 1 lakh before the month is out. The government extended Corona curfew till April 30. It had earlier been extended till April 26. Coupled with the weekend lockdown, Corona curfew is effectively in force till 6am on May 3. Announcing the extended shutdown, CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan said: “Effective implementation of janata curfew is necessary in every city, street, locality and village to break the chain of Corona infection. The CM said he would personally speak with Corona patients in home isolation to know how their treatment was going, whether they got medical kits in time, and their level of satisfaction with the Covid management system. Indore’s positivity rate has started stabilizing since last week, and hovers around 20%, officials said at the review meeting with the CM. MP got 414 metric tonnes of oxygen on Tuesday while consumption was 375 MT.

---||Jaipur||Install bird diverters until cables go underground: SC||Jaisalmer: The Supreme Court on Monday ordered to install bird diverters until the conversion of the overhead cables into underground power lines and to put the overhead cables into underground power lines wherever feasible, within a period of one year in Rajasthan and Gujarat. It has also ordered to hang bird diverters till that time from the existing power lines. A 3-member committee has also been constituted to assess the feasibility of laying the overhead high-tension electricity wires underground. The apex court gave this decision on the PIL filed by retired IAS MK Ranjit Singh to protect two species of birds namely the Great Indian Bustard and Lesser Florican, which are on the verge of extinction. These birds collide with the high-tension electric wires passing through their habitat and get killed. The bench of Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, Justice AS Bopanna and Justice V Ramasubramanian gave this decision hearing the PIL. The Supreme Court in its order has mentioned to install bird diverters on 21 power lines in Rajasthan and on 11 power lines in Kutch. There are four power lines in Rajasthan and 36 in Kutch that are to be converted to underground, subject to feasibility, if not, to immediately install bird diverters, the order mentioned. The apex court, in its decision, said that while considering the laying of underground power lines, steps should be taken for the safety of GIBs in the said habitat. ASG (Additional Solicitor General) Aishwarya Bhati on behalf of the energy ministry had mentioned the technical problems faced on laying the high voltage line underground, on which the bench formed a committee of experts for assessing the feasibility of laying high voltage underground power lines. The committee will include following members: Dr Rahul Rawat, scientist, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, New Delhi; Dr Sutirtha Dutta, scientist, Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun and Dr Devesh Gadhavi, deputy director, the Corbett Foundation. The said committee may also obtain technical reports, if required from the experts in the field of electricity supply to arrive at their decision. The Government of India shall provide all assistance to the committee, the court said in its decision. It is to be mentioned that steps are already being taken for conservation of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) in Rajasthan. In 1980-81, Desert National Park was set up on a 3,162 sqkm area and state’s maximum GIBs are in this area. The DNP is also called the refuge of GIB. These birds are found mainly in the border areas of Rajasthan and Pakistan and it is a state bird of Rajasthan. GIB is one of the heaviest flying birds in the world, about a meter in height and wing span of around seven feet. The Wildlife Institute of India in its report ‘Power Line Mitigation, 2018’ has stated that every year 1 lakh birds die due to collision with power lines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/install-bird-diverters-until-cables-go-underground-sc/articleshow/82169715.cms||---

One group of people is unhappy with the police’s failure of not being able to arrest the key accused who stabbed two youths following which the violence occurred. However, the police claimed to have arrested over 50 people of both the groups allegedly involved in violence that left over 75 business establishments severely damaged on April 11.“At least 20 key identified accused and the two others accused of stabbing two Hindu youths on April 10 are still at large,” Chhabra Kirana Vyapar Sangh president Jainendra Kumar Jain said. He alleged that the police have CCTV footage of the accused and reports of their current location, however, nothing has been done to arrest them. Jain said that if this continuous then traders would be forced to continue to shut down their establishments till the key accused are not arrested.Baran SP Vineet Kumar Bansal told TOI that attempts are underway to trace the other accused in the matter. Chhabra is now peaceful and curfew has been relaxed for six hours, from 11am to 5pm, he added.Three of the five accused who stabbed the youths were arrested on the very first day, ASP Baran, Vijay Swarnkar said.Despite relaxation in the curfew hours the locals are still facing difficulties in accessing commodities and services for their routine life. ‘We don’t get newspapers as vehicles that carry them are not allowed to enter,” said a local.Meanwhile, BJP leaders alleged the state government and local MLA Pramod Jain Bhaya of protecting the accused.“The state government should sell the accused’s properties to compensate the traders and prosecute against them strictly rather than protect them, said BJP MLA from Ramganjmandi, Madan Dilawar, who visited Chhabra on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/uneasy-calm-in-chhabra-as-key-accused-in-violence-still-at-large/articleshow/82169718.cms||---

The beat cops took it upon themselves to get all garbage, scrapped vehicles and heaps of building material removed to beautify the area. Before the clean-up, the area was inhabited by anti-social elements who hid there at night or consumed drugs, forcing residents to avoid it after the sunset. A constable is now posted in the area, which is now patrolled regularly to ensure that it is not encroached upon again. The high court said the cops had shown commendable creativity in bringing about a change. The initiative was taken after constables Hem Raj and Rahul, along with head constable Amar Singh, came up with the idea. Inspector Anil Sharma, SHO of Rajouri Garden, along with civic agencies, took it upon himself to complete the project. The land was to be cleared by the civic bodies after a high court order, but it had not happened. The cops, along with residents, cleared up the ground. Recently a badminton and sports competition was also organised for girls. “It was not just about making it a playground but we also wanted to clear the garbage since the slums were just next to it and the dump could pose a serious health hazard,” said an officer. “Earlier the area was used by the anti-social elements who would sit here and people would fear stepping out.” To make the area secure, police have also shut two entries to the slum clusters and installed CCTV cameras, said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-praise-for-cops-who-turned-dump-into-playfield-for-girls/articleshow/82169734.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: In death too, it’s a long wait for Covid victims||HYDERABAD: Rising Covid-19 deaths, especially over the last two weeks, has led to an unprecedented rush across Hyderabad’s crematoriums and burial grounds. Groups assisting families of the deceased say the numbers have more than doubled this time around often forcing them to wait for hours to perform a funeral. Given the situation, even the police have reactivated their control room numbers to facilitate last rites of the Covid-infected. “In 2020, we used to get about 15 to 20 calls for help every week. Since the beginning of April 2021, that number has touched about 40 to 50. So, getting slots at any of the crematoriums – be it Amberpet, Erragadda or Bansilalpet – has become very difficult,” said Syed Jalaluddin Zafar, president of Youth Welfare Telangana, that has stepped in to help families of the deceased with the last rites – all free of cost and irrespective of their religion. According to him, at burial grounds in Balapur, Falaknuma and other areas too, they are facing a similar issue. “Unfortunately, we are not being able to attend to all of them because of limited manpower,” added Zafar, who works with a 60-member team in the city. Staff manning the Rachakonda police number that was started on April 17, said they have received about 25 calls so far. “About five of these were attended to by our last rites service, free of cost. For the rest, we arranged alternate services as they were willing to pay about Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 for it,” said the official. When TOI called the crematorium at Erragadda, it was told that the wait could stretch up to six or seven hours. “The numbers are definitely much higher this time. Every day, we get about five calls, on an average, and often end up waiting for five hours to complete the funeral. And this is only one organisation. There are so many others offering similar services,” said Sai Teja, member, Feed the Needy. The group’s last rites services arm, launched last year, has tied up with the police for the work. Between July and December 2020, the team conducted 210 cremations and burials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/even-in-death-its-a-long-wait-for-covid-patients/articleshow/82168734.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects Jackie Shroff’s ex-business partner’s plea in $3.5mn row||MUMBAI: In another legal relief to actor Jackie Shroff, Bombay high court on Tuesday dismissed an appeal filed by his former business partner in a $3.5 million dispute in arbitration. Last year, Justice S C Gupte of HC set aside a November 2014 arbitral award requiring Shroff to give $3.5 million in liquidated damages to former business partner R S Iyer, a citizen and resident of Singapore. The award against Shroff was because the arbitrator held that a letter by his wife, Ayesha, was in breach of a dispute settlement agreement of 2011 to not complain again of allegations made in a criminal complaint by him. Iyer then filed an appeal against Justice Gupte’s order. The appeal bench of Justices R D Dhanuka and V G Bisht held that Justice Gupte had “rightly interfered with such perverse and patently illegal award…’’ The division bench directed that Iyer should not be allowed to withdraw $2 million deposited with a Mumbai bank, for eight weeks, while Shroff can take appropriate legal steps to withdraw it. Shroff and Iyer, shareholders of an Indian company, had in 1995 entered into a JV with Sony group to set up a TV channel. Following disputes, in 2010 Shroff filed a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing. In 2011, a settlement deed was executed between them to withdraw the complaint, and on its withdrawal, $1.5 million would be released to Shroff from an escrow account and an additional $2 million was also to be kept in an escrow account to be released later. Shroff’s counsel Arif Bookwalla and Shyam Dewani argued that the appeal be dismissed, while Iyer’s counsel Ankita Singhania and Vishal Gandhi argued that the single judge had “totally overlooked’’ that the settlement deed provided that its violation would disentitle Shroff from receiving $2 million and would need to return $1.5 million. The HC on Tuesday held that the arbitrator overlooked vital evidence led by Shroff. It added, “the arbitrator has rewritten the contract while rendering the finding that the clauses of the deed of settlement provided for recovery of liquidated damages.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-rejects-jackies-ex-biz-partners-plea-in-3-5mn-row/articleshow/82169744.cms||Swati Deshpande

Despite the spurt in cases, citizens have shown a marked reluctance to get themselves vaccinated.District vaccination officer Dr RN Singh said, “We have a capacity of vaccinating 29,560 people and were expecting to achieve a target of 12,500 but till Tuesday, only 5,776 people had turned up for vaccination, which is 46.21% of the target.” Bareilly’s chief medical officer Dr Sudheer Kumar Garg told TOI, “Patients from nearby districts and Uttarakhand come to Bareilly for treatment. It is true that the cases have increased significantly but we have sufficient beds for patients. The stock of medicines and oxygen is sufficient as many medical colleges like SRMS, Rohilkhand have their own oxygen plant. We are coordinating with all the seven Covid centres in the district to ensure proper treatment of patients.” On Tuesday, Budaun’s chief judicial magistrate Rajeev Kumar Singh, who was recently promoted as additional district and sessions judge (ADJ), died while undergoing Covid treatment at a government hospital in Delhi. Singh was a native of Mirzapur and had joined the judicial service in 2009. He fell ill in Budaun a few days ago and was admitted at Budaun Medical College, where he was found to be Covid-19 positive and was shifted to Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/bareilly-records-903-covid-cases-in-24-hours-but-people-shy-away-from-vaccination/articleshow/82167822.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Imported Sputnik doses may be sold in India at global rate: Dr Reddy’s chief||HYDERABAD: Even as the Centre announced a liberalised and accelerated Covid-19 vaccination strategy, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories co-chairman and managing director GV Prasad told TOI in an exclusive interaction on Tuesday that the pricing of imported doses of Russian vaccine Sputnik V was expected to be $10 per dose. This was in line with the uniform global pricing. Indicating that the pricing of the locally manufactured Sputnik V doses would be below $10, he said: “Even the imported one we are trying to see that it does not exceed $10 per dose. It (pricing) will be crystalised very soon. For the Indian manufactured one, we have to talk to the government as there is public procurement and there is a private market and all that.” Prasad also said that while the company had internally set a target to roll out Sputnik V in India in June, efforts are underway to speed up imports and target May.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); “We will try for May, but June is when it is likely to happen as we have to agree on the supply schedule with RDIF (Russian Direct Investment Fund) as well as the pricing. We have already tied up the cold chain and logistics. We are also talking to the Central Research Institute at Kasauli to do the testing (of vaccine batches) fast so that there won’t be a bottleneck,” he explained. On the number of doses to be imported from Russia, the Dr Reddy's top honcho said the agreement with RDIF was for 125 million people equivalent doses. He indicated that over and above the tie-ups with six Indian manufacturers, other manufacturers too may be roped in to ramp up Sputnik V capacities further. While RDIF has tied up with Gland Pharma (252 m), Hetero Biopharma (100 million), Virchow Biotech (200 m), Panacea Biotech (100 m) and Stelis Biopharma (200 m) , which translates into 426 million people equivalent doses, Dr Reddy’s has a tie-up with Shilpa Medicare for an undisclosed number of doses.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); When asked whether those opting for Sputnik V will need to go for booster shots, he said extensive research is underway to ascertain not just how long the immune response evoked by the Russian vaccine lasts, but also the possibility of a single shot version in addition to the nasal variant. “The longevity (of the immune response) has not yet been finalised. They are doing a lot of research. They are working on a one single shot kind of possibility or a third booster shot every year possibility. But speculation is that we will need a booster shot every year,” he said. On Remdesivir, he said like all other companies Dr Reddy’s Laboratories too is ramping up production and the situation should start easing up in a week’s time. “This month I think we should have a lakh vials out. Next month, five lakh vials and we can even cross 5 lakh vials per month,” he said, adding that the company now has three plants activated on Remdesivir production. On the government’s decision to open up vaccination to all above 18 years of age from May 1 as well as allow sale of vaccines in the private market he said the move was “bold and well thought out” and would give flexibility to leverage the power of the private sector market forces to scale up the vaccination efforts. “I think it was absolutely the right thing to do. It’s going to make a difference to the country very fast. It’s a big move to open it up (vaccination) and leverage the power of the private sector. Decentralisation is very good and state governments and private companies will now see the power of decentralisation working,” Prasad said, adding that the move to extend financial support to players like SII and Bharat Biotech to ramp up was also very good.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/imported-sputnik-doses-may-be-sold-in-india-at-global-rate-dr-reddys-chief/articleshow/82168737.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The observers, though, said the overall impact would be softer than last year’s following the total lockdown. Estimates from the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MCCIA) stated Pune region, the state’s main manufacturing base and information technology hub, was losing around Rs 5,600 crore in gross value addition (GVA)—value of goods and services, minus input costs— a week during the restrictions. For the state, a two-week period of restrictions entails an about 0.5% impact on the gross state domestic product (GSDP); more restrictions or lengthening of the period of restrictions to the middle of May could increase that impact by up to 1.5%, MCCIA stated.

Needy patients are given life-saving artificial respiration through a ventilator. But, this system is very expensive and not suitable for use in rural and remote areas. Recognizing this problem, an engineer from Yavatmal has developed a versatile low-cost ventilator. It is also accredited by Government of India’s nodal agencies. Akash Gaddamwar from Yavatmal and his friend Eshan Dhar from Jammu and Kashmir were working on this design even before the pandemic struck. “After completing our engineering from IISc Bangalore, we formed a start-up Gyrodrive Machineries Ltd. We launched several innovations and won Rs 2 crore funding prize from Government of India,” said Akash. Their start-up was approached by Dr Rajeev Chauhan, assistant professor in the anaesthesiology department in the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, with the concept. They accepted the challenge and developed a handy ventilator. The concept is simple. AMBU bag is the most common handheld tool used to deliver positive pressure ventilation to any person with insufficient or ineffective breathing. It’s common sight in medical colleges and rural hospitals across the country to see attendants or patients’ relatives operating the manual AMBU bags to save life. The device provides mechanical support with battery back-up to this system. The device is operated by a small motor that automatically pressurizes the AMBU bag at the required rate. It ensures controlled pressure and exact amount of O2 to the patient. The device has been patented and Akash’s start up has all approvals from necessary nodal agencies. The prototypes are in use at PGIMER Chandigarh. Now, the duo is seeking investments to start mass production of the device. “It is handy, weighs just 6 kgs and can be transported even on a bicycle. As Covid-19 cases are now growing in rural areas, it will prove a big boon for our country,” said Akash. “I have seen patients often relying on the manually operated AMBU bags in rural hospitals. These provide only short-term solution. Our machine has 6, 12 and 24 hours back-up options. The battery keeps charging itself if we plug the device in common household socket,” said Akash. According to him, the machine, can be fixed in small ambulances being used to carry Covid-19 patients. It can be attached with O2 cylinder or simply can get oxygen from air and provide it to the patient. Respiratory Control Device * Low-cost solution for effective ventilator support * Allows easy setting of parameters like respiration rate and tidal volume * Inbuilt lung parameter monitoring system ensures patient safety * Battery supported; 6, 12 and 24 hour back-up prototypes ready * Weighs just 6 kgs, can be transported on two-wheelers, even bicycles * Cost effective too, mass production will reduce cost * Also approved by government’s nodal agencies * Can be fixed in makeshift ambulances, carried to remote places||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/yavatmal-techie-makes-handy-ventilator-aims-at-mass-production/articleshow/82169720.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Hyderabad||Wrong to term salary as crime proceeds: Bharathi Cement dir||Hyderabad: Bharathi Cement Corporation Private Ltd whole-time director Jella Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday questioned the Enforcement Directorate (ED) as to why it is branding even salary and perks he drew from the company as proceeds of crime and has not even spared his Hyderabad residential flat from attachment. Arguing his case before the high court, his counsel CV Mohan Reddy told a bench of Justice A Rajashekher Reddy and Justice Shameem Akther that similarly placed directors like N Srinivasan and Gurunath in India Cements company were drawing anywhere between Rs 1.5 crore and Rs 2 crore and there was no point why JJ Reddy’s earnings alone were stamped as crime proceeds. The ED attached his Manikonda flat in Hyderabad and a 27-acre land in Kadapa district. As per records, JJ Reddy drew Rs 7.2 crore from Bharathi Cement between 2009 and 2015. The ED’s appellate tribunal, however, disagreed with the understanding of ED and said salary cannot be described as proceeds of crime. Aggrieved by this finding, the ED preferred an appeal in the high court. Appearing for the ED, additional solicitor general T Surya Karan Reddy told the court that JJ Reddy had been associated with Bharathi Cement and several firms related to AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy from 2004 onwards.ED counsel Anjali Agarwal said that 8,000 more shares of Bharati Cement too stood transferred under JJ Reddy’s name. JJ Reddy’s association with Bharathi Cement began when he had applied for a mining lease for the company. His counsel said the court had earlier stayed the attachment on a condition that he would pay Rs 25,000 every month to ED and allowed him to stay in the flat. “We will not sell it away... but we want relief from this monthly payment burden,” the counsel said. The bench, which reserved its orders last week on a similar application filed in respect of attachment of Rs 150 crore fixed deposits pertaining to Bharathi Cement, reserved its judgment in the current case too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wrong-to-term-salary-as-crime-proceeds-bharathi-cement-dir/articleshow/82170046.cms||---

As many as 12 camps have been planned in April and May to buy the land directly from the farmers. The authority will pay Rs 3,500 per sqm to the farmers. To avoid the tedious process of taking over land through the Land Acquisition Act, the authority will try to convince a maximum number of farmers to hand over their land parcels directly. The authority has already identified a private agency, which will help in facilitating the acquisition work. During the special camps, announcements will be made within the village for people to come forward with relevant documents and sell the land directly to the authority. The villages, which have been identified, include Ladpura, Dhoom Manikpur, Bhanauta, Muradpur, Imaliyaka. The camps to begin the acquisition work will commence from April 22 and will go up to the last week of May. The list of the acquired land chunks will be submitted to the revenue department officials and the district administration to get the mutation and title changed into the authority’s name. The Authority officials said the acquisition work was briefly hit due to the pandemic. “But we will need to take over the land and develop it by June. Unless we offer new schemes, investments in the region will get diverted to Noida or the Yamuna region,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gnida-will-set-up-camps-to-buy-land-directly-for-industry/articleshow/82169754.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This, after receiving a complaint from a parent that the school was in violation of government order (GO) 46. The Lokayukta also directed special chief secretary for education, Chitra Ramachandran, to submit a report on the issue byApril 26.  “Authorities of HPS...are directed not to collect any further fee from students until further orders. They are further directed to provide the link for online study to all students of their institution,” read an interim order by Telangana Lokayukta, CV Ramulu. The complainant, G Mahender, claimed that the special chief secretary had not initiated any action against HPS for not reducing fee and violating the government order. As per the GO, schools have to charge only tuition fee and not include any other expenditure. The complainant said students had already paid 80% of the fee. Speaking to TOI, Mahender said HPS Kadapa, run by the same society as the Ramanthapur school, had reduced fee by 30% for the academic year 2020-21 as per orders issued by Andhra Pradesh government.

The thunderstorm activity has been attributed to a north-south trough from Vidarbha to south Tamil Nadu along Telangana. “Under its influence, light to moderate showers occurred at many places,” said Naga Ratna, in-charge director, India Meteorological Department, Hyderabad. Gusty winds also led to falling of trees in few places such as Gachibowli and Charminar.

---||Hyderabad||Centre okays Telangana’s new zonal system||HYDERABAD: Clearing decks for recruitment and transfer of state government employees, the Centre has approved amendments for the new zonal system in Telangana. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) issued a gazette notification on Monday night incorporating two newly-formed districts Mulugu and Narayanpet and including Vikarabad district in the Charminar zone instead of Jogulamba. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had announced that the state government would fill up 50,000 vacancies in various departments and also announced the government would allow transfers soon. The notification would pave way for recruitment and transfers within zones and also between multi-zones, depending upon cadre of employees. The MHA said the amendments were made to clauses (l) and (2) of Article 371-D of the Constitution to amend the Telangana Public Employment (Organisation of Local Cadres and Regulation of Direct Recruitment) Order, 2018. President Ram Nath Kovind had earlier given approval for the amendments. According to the Presidential Order, seven zones and two multi-zones (I & II) were created for government departments except police department. Seven zones and two multi-zones were created separately for police. For instance, Hyderabad police commissionerate, Cyberabad police commissionerate, Sangareddy, Vikarabad were brought under zone VI of Charminar, while for other departments Medchal-Malkajgiri, Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Sangareddy and Vikarabad districts were put under Charminar zone. The Telangana government had approved new zonal system by creating seven zones for recruitment and transfer of government employees three years ago. Prior to the bifurcation of the state, there were only two zones.  But creation of new districts from 10 erstwhile districts to 31 (later two new districts were created) has necessitated more zones for administrative and recruitment zones. The government had also reserved 95% posts in government departments for locals and rest for non-locals. The zone-rule would be applicable to all posts except posts at secretariat level, heads of departments and offices set up for a special purpose. “Though there has been a demand from unemployed youth for taking up recruitment drive, the government could not start it as many district, zonal and multi-zonal cadre posts need to be filled based on the zonal system,” a senior government official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-okays-ts-new-zonal-system/articleshow/82169682.cms||Koride Mahesh

The ex-minister was charged with allegedly morphing a video in which Jagan is heard saying no person is willing to live in Tirupati. A notice was issued to Uma to appear before CID, which conducted searches at his residence in Gollapudi, Vijayawada. A case was registered under criminal conspiracy, forgery and other IPC sections. The first notice was served on April 14 and Uma replied that he cannot appear before the CID as he was campaigning for Tirupati Lok Sabha bypolls. Investigating officer served another notice on April 16, asking the TDP leader to appear before him on April 19. As he failed to appear again, a CID team went to Uma’s residence at Saipuram Colony but he was not available. Narra Vasu, a TDP leader, told sleuths that he has no clue about Uma’s whereabouts. CID said video of Jagan pertained to 2014 wherein he was referring to the availability of cardiology services in Hyderabad, Mumbai, Tirupati and Bihar. However, the video was edited and released by Uma on April 7 in order to create confusion among voters in the bypolls, the CID charged.

Health authorities fear that the district is moving towards a worst situation as cases of patients with breathing issues have doubled when compared to the first wave. Meanwhile, the district surveillance unit has submitted a list of 30 high-risk local bodies, including Thrikkakara and Kalamassery municipalities, to the district administration to take further steps like implementation of a lockdown or declaration of containment zones. A separate team has been constituted to look into Covid cases in the Kochi corporation limit, where density of cases is less compared to adjacent local bodies. “Currently, there are more than 18,000 active cases. Even if one percent of them develops any breathing problems, then 160 patients need oxygen support. We expect that 5% patients may develop breathing problems calling for oxygen support for 800 patients. In the first wave, most of the patients were elderly. Now, it has changed to people below 60 years as most of the elderly got vaccinated. There will be shift in the age group of patients depending on the vaccination. Half of the total Covid patients who are in serious condition at the hospitals are below 60 years,” said IMA past Ernakulam president Dr Junaid Rahman. “Around 200 patients are currently in oxygen support in government sector and 150 in private hospitals. We need 1,000 oxygen beds for the next two weeks in both the government and private sector. We already have 500 with us, besides 300 in medical college, 100 in super-specialty block at general hospital and 60 in Fort Kochi taluk hospital,” Raman added. “There is a concern on the treatment of non-Covid patients, if we convert all the hospitals for Covid treatment. It is up to the government to take a decision on whether the medical college should be fully converted into a Covid centre,” added Rahman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/active-caseload-in-ekm-crosses-18000/articleshow/82167860.cms||T C Sreemol

---||Jaipur||Experts oppose proposed new road between Chandpole & Brahmapole||Udaipur: Experts have raised environmental and heritage value concerns to a proposal that aims to construct an alternate road from Chandpole to Brahmapole inside the Walled City area of Udaipur.In a letter to the joint secretary and mission director Smart Cities, GP Soni, a member of the committee constituted by the high court for Udaipur lakes said that the alignment of the proposed work is completely in the submerged areas of Kumhariaya Talab, which is a part of the famous Pichola-Swaroopsagar Lake. He added that it will involve demolishing the city wall at two locations which has a high heritage value. In order to provide entry from the existing road, this city wall will have to be demolished at the entry and exit point. As the junction is in a slanting position, the width of demolishing the wall will certainly be far more than the proposed width of the road. This will have adverse effect on the scenic beauty of this area.The tender documents reveal that for laying pillar foundations in the submerged area, the estimated quantity of excavation work is 13,395 cubic meters which is not desirable as it is in close vicinity to the old city wall. Soni said, the Jodhpur High Court, Rajasthan had issued orders in 2007 while deciding a civil writ, for not permitting any sort of construction and to ensure no human activities are undertaken in the submerged area of Udaipur lakes.The proposed construction named as Alternate Road from Chand-pole to Amba-pole with alignment in the submerged area of Lake Pichola under Smart City Mission violates building by-laws.As this historical Pichola Lake is a drinking water source for the residents, protection of quality of water is necessary and accordingly its submerged area has been declared as ‘No construction zone’ under Building By-Laws, 2013. According to these by-laws, no construction is permissible in the submerged area except essential repairs and desilting, that also with the specific permission of the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/experts-oppose-proposed-new-road-between-chandpole-brahmapole/articleshow/82169751.cms||---

Noting that scores of industries moved out of the areas after HC intervention, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy directed the authorities to cleanse the areas vacated by pollutants. When GHMC was trying to raze them down, they approached the HC. All such pleas will be looked into in June.

---||Hyderabad||Parents, teachers welcome ICSE board move||Hyderabad: Parents and teachers from the city welcomed the decision of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) to cancel the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) examinations as they said that the students can now move on to the next academic year. They said that in the current circumstances where almost everyone is going through tension and financial problems, the decision has come as a relief. “Earlier, when the board said that the students can appear for exams at a later stage, students and their parents had many doubts. But now they are relieved as students can move on to class 11 or intermediate,” said Mir Hafeezuddin Ahmed, principal, Nasr Boys School. He said that it would have been much harder for students to concentrate in class 11 if they had to keep going back to prepare for ICSE exams. Parents said that they were apprehensive about sending their children to the examination center amid the Covid-19 pandemic and that they are happy with the board’s decision. “Although my daughter was eager to appear for the exam, as a parent I am very happy with the decision. Right now, the health of the child is very important and I feel the board took the right decision,” said Sapna Tharad, whose daughter Keerti was supposed to appear for the ICSE exam this year. They said that conducting online exams instead of cancelling exams is also not an ideal solution as many would indulge in malpractices. The CISCE board, which had earlier announced that ICSE students will be given an option to appear for exams at a later stage, has now withdrawn that option. The board directed the schools to start the class 11 admissions process and prepare a schedule to start online classes for students at the earliest. “Given the present worsening situation of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, the CISCE has decided to cancel the ICSE 2021examination. The option given in the earlier circular dated April 16, 2021 now stands withdrawn,” read a circular from the CISCE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parents-teachers-welcome-icse-board-move/articleshow/82168763.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

BEST, however, incurred a loss of over Rs 5 crore so far due to the ‘Break the chain’ directives. BEST spokesperson Satyawan Ithape said, “Rridership, which had fallen to 13 lakh daily, went up to over 16 lakh on Monday.” In the first week of curbs, ridership fell by 20% from the average daily commuters of 25 lakh to around 20 lakh. This was observed from April 6, when the new directives came into effect. The government SOP mentioned that there should be no standees in buses. Ridership was also hit as there was a drop in commuters as private offices and non-essential shops were closed. As the government tightened rules and allowed only essential workers, ridership fell from April 15. Daily commuters on April 15 was around 14 lakh, and it dipped to 13 lakh on April 17, Ithape said. Now, daily commuters have gone up by three lakh on Monday as more workers from unorganised sectors, such as maids, cooks, drivers and construction workers, were allowed to board buses, another official said.

To ensure that they do not carry the coronavirus home, local authorities have started screening each of them at bus and railway stations before allowing them to proceed to their native places. Those found symptomatic are being quarantined and tested for Covid. In Bijnor, health authorities claimed that since the second wave of the pandemic began, they have screened some 3,000 migrant labourers by making them undergo thermal scanning and other Covid-19 protocols. Screening centres have come up on the borders of Bulandshahr district, where all commuters are being tested for symptoms before being allowed to head home. After their return to the village, the ‘nigraani’ (watch) committee have been entrusted with the task to monitor them. Satish Kumar, Bijnor district panchayat raj officer, said, “We are maintaining data of migrant labourers in the district. Now, amid the surge in Covid 19 cases, weekend lockdown has been imposed in UP, while Delhi, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have imposed complete lockdown. Other states are also mulling over complete lockdown. In such desperate times, migrant labourers are returning to their native villages in droves. So far, 3,000 migrant labourers have come back home in Bijnor. Many of them had come to cast their vote in the panchayat polls but have chosen to remain here.” Yameen Ahmed, a migrant labourer, told TOI, “My native village is Mandawali which falls under Bijnor city police station limits. I run a bakery in Mumbai. I came to vote but will not go back to Mumbai right now.” In Amroha, around 2,000 migrant labourers have returned to their native places. District magistrate Umesh Mishra said, “This time, we have directed all officials to keep a close watch on the situation. As of now, things are in place. The migrants labourers returning home will be provided work under MGNREGA and other government schemes.” He added that the administration had appealed to the labourers to self-quarantine at home for 14 days. If anyone is found symptomatic, he will be admitted in hospital,” said DM Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-screens-migrant-labourers-as-covid-surge-drives-them-home/articleshow/82167863.cms||Harveer Dabas

The decision was taken to de-congest autopsy rooms because of increased infection cases and casualties. In an order on Tuesday, ADGP (crime) Ravi Prakash Meharda asked investigation officers to do away with post mortem in accident cases. “I said if the investigation officer finds no foul play and the case appears to be a clear accident case, there is no need for post mortem. If an investigating officer is satisfied and believes that the death took place because of an accident, he should take a call to avoid post mortem. Unnecessary autopsy is creating extra burden and delays the process of getting bodies,” Meharda said. He added the move was aimed at saving people from infection and delays in cremating bodies. “It is also expected in Covid times, people who usually get involved in blame game on cause of death and those who start sit on dharnas with bodies should avoid such practices and go for funerals without delay,” said a senior officer. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-need-for-autopsy-in-mishap-cases-say-police/articleshow/82169801.cms||---
---||Business||Provisional attachment power under GST law draconian: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday termed the power of commissioners under the GST law to provisionally attach properties and bank accounts of assessees as “draconian” and ordered that they have to follow the rule book and pass reasoned orders while exercising such power. "The power to order provisional attachment of property of the taxable person, including a bank account, is draconian in nature and the conditions which are prescribed by the statute for a valid exercise of the power must be strictly fulfilled," a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said while quashing the provisional attachment order passed against Radhakrishnan Industries located in Himachal Pradesh. Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Chandrachud said legitimate concerns of citizens over arbitrary exercise of power have to be protected while ensuring that the legislative purpose in entrusting the authority to order provisional attachment is fulfilled. "Exercise of the power for ordering a provisional attachment must be preceded by the formation of an opinion by the commissioner that it is necessary so to do for the purpose of protecting the interest of government revenue. Before ordering a provisional attachment, the commissioner must form an opinion on the basis of tangible material that the assessee is likely to defeat the demand, if any, and that, therefore, it is necessary so to do for the purpose of protecting the interest of government revenue," the bench said. "The expression ‘necessary so to do for protecting government revenue’ implicates that the interests of government revenue cannot be protected without ordering a provisional attachment; The formation of an opinion by the commissioner under Section 83(1) must be based on tangible material bearing on the necessity of ordering a provisional attachment for the purpose of protecting the interest of government revenue," the court added. It said under GST rules, a person whose property is attached is entitled to dual procedural safeguards — (a) an entitlement to submit objections on the ground that the property was or is not liable to attachment, and (b) an opportunity of being heard. "There has been a breach of the mandatory requirement of Rule 159(5) and the commissioner was clearly misconceived in law in coming into conclusion that he had a discretion on whether or not to grant an opportunity of being heard," the bench said while quashing the attachment order. The bench said the commissioner was duty bound to deal with objections to the attachment by passing a reasoned order which must be communicated to the taxable person whose property is attached and also ruled that an aggrieved person had the option of approaching the HC against an inappropriate attachment order. In the case in hand, the SC said, "The joint commissioner, while ordering a provisional attachment under Section 83, was acting as a delegate of the commissioner in pursuance of the delegation effected under Section 5(3) and an appeal against the order of provisional attachment was not available under Section 107(1). Therefore, the writ petition before the high court under Article 226 of the Constitution challenging the order of provisional attachment was maintainable."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/provisional-attachment-power-under-gst-law-draconian-sc/articleshow/82171856.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The order stated that the money will be transferred only after the block education officers concerned provide the details of each student from Prerna portal to each school principal – who will further investigate the details before transferring the money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-govt-schools-closed-but-1-5-cr-beneficiaries-to-get-grains-funds/articleshow/82167868.cms||Ishita Bhatia
---||Dehradun||Army mulls easing out inner-line permit in border districts of Uttarakhand: CDS Rawat||DEHRADUN: Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Tuesday said that the Army is planning to ease out inner-line restrictions in Uttarakhand to boost tourism in the border areas. Gen Rawat made the statement during his interaction with the top brass of state police department on the “Role of Uttarakhand in tackling national security challenges” at police headquarters in Dehradun. "The law and order situation in Uttarakhand is good, which makes it ideal for the growing industry and tourism sector in the state. The Army is planning to ease out inner-line restrictions in the state to boost tourism in border districts," said Gen Rawat. Notably, there are numerous scenic areas dotting the India-China border in Uttarkashi and Chamoli districts. There have been demands for relaxation of inner-line permit even in the tribal areas of Kumaon. In Uttarakhand, tourists have to obtain an inner-line permit to visit locations near China border in three districts — Uttarkashi, Pithoragarh and Chamoli. The state shares a 350km border with China and a 275km boundary with Nepal. While speaking about reverse migration, Gen Rawat said that migration in districts having international borders is not good for national security and efforts need to be made to develop these areas to ensure reverse migration. “Roads, health and education facilities will have to be increased in border areas. There is a need for more police posts on the border, which can only come with the help of the Army and ITBP," he added. During the event, Uttarakhand DGP Ashok Kumar highlighted the issues like left-wing extremism and Sikhs for Justice in some pockets of Kumaon, especially in Udham Singh Nagar district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/army-mulls-easing-out-inner-line-permit-in-border-districts-of-ukhand-cds-rawat/articleshow/82167883.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Meanwhile, Naresh Tikait, the chief of Balyan khap, was called in to sort out the matter, while police launched an investigation into the matter following a complaint filed by the soldier. Balyan was also encouraging them for a truce as both groups had supported him in the elections, said village sources. Shahpur police station SHO Sanjeev Kumar said, “Nobody was thrashed. There was an argument between supporters of two groups. An investigation is on. Meanwhile, enough police force was deployed in the village to tackle law and order situation, if arises.” Sudheer Kumar, posted in the technical wing of the Indian Army in Assam, who is supporting Krishan Pal Singh for the village pradhan post, said, “Several supporters of Jitender Singh, also a pradhan post candidate, alighted from a car and attacked me because we were very active on the election day (Monday) and did not allow them to do wrong. I have lodged a complaint with police.” “The entire village is like a family and every election leaves behind small and big issues upon completion. There was a small dispute that was resolved to the satisfaction of everyone,” Balyan told mediapersons. Tikait said, “There was a chance of violence in the village on the election day, but police had controlled the situation very well. But today (Tuesday) morning, tension erupted after an incident of thrashing. A panchayat was called and the minister was also invited. The matter was solved amicably. No case was filed from any party.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/minister-balyans-village-tense-after-soldier-supporting-pradhan-candidate-thrashed/articleshow/82167878.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Movie halls can’t charge extra for 3D glasses: Consumer panel||Thiruvananthapuram: Movie theatres are not at liberty to levy extra money on spectators of 3D movies that require special spectacles to enjoy the movie. If at all such spectacles are a must, the cinema management should provide them free of cost to the audience, on condition that it should be returned after the show, ruled the state consumer disputes redressal commission. A division bench chaired by justice K Surendra Mohan has also upheld an order passed by the Thiruvananthapuram district consumer forum declaring compensation to a person who approached the forum against the arbitrary collection of Rs 30 by Remya Theatre here, as rent for a pair of glasses given to him for watching an English 3D movie, ‘Gravity’, in 2013. It was alleged in the original complaint that the complainant, Adv Ravikrishnan, had gone to the theatre to watch the 3D movie with a paid or 3D glasses which he had purchased to watch another movie — ‘Avatar’ — on an earlier occasion. However, the theatre management demanded Rs 80, including Rs 30 as rent for the glasses, if he wanted to watch the new movie. Though he said that he was not in need of the glasses, he had to finally give in and pay for the glasses too. The complainant later approached the district forum and argued that the mandatory collection of more than half of the ticket charges as rent for a pair of glasses amounted to fleecing. Moreover, when 3D films like ‘My Dear Kuttichathan’ were screened, the glasses were given to the audience free of cost, he held. The forum ordered an amount of Rs 5,000 as compensation, a further amount of Rs 5,000 as punitive damages and an amount of Rs 2,000 as legal costs. However, both the complainant and respondent approached the higher forum as both were not satisfied by different aspects of the order of the district forum. The theatre management argued they were not guilty of unfair and restrictive trade practices and challenged the compensation part. The complainant said the district forum’s directive that theatre management may give the spectacles on rent only to those who are in need of the same would be misused to continue the wrong practice. Ruling in favour of the complainant’s plea, the commission said: “We find that the action of the opposite party in charging rent of Rs 30 per 3D glasses made available for viewing a 3D movie amounts to a serious violation of the rights of the consumer. If 3D glasses are necessary for better viewing of 3D movies, it is imperative that the said glasses are supplied free of cost to viewers. Extraction of such amounts by individual theatre owners at their whims and fancies would only give room for exploitation of the consumers.” The commission also refused to strike down the theatre management’s plea against compensation ordered by the district forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/movie-halls-cant-charge-extra-for-3d-glasses-consumer-panel/articleshow/82168771.cms||B S Anilkumar

Tthe SPPU has now started working on the laboratory operation on war footing and according to vice-chancellor, Nitin Karmalkar, the testing will begin in 10 days. The university has revamped an existing laboratory facility and converted it to the BSL III lab requirements. It is now waiting for the experts’ committee to see the mandatory compliance. Karmalkar said, “We have been coordinating with the Armed Forces Medical College which is the nodal agency of the Indian Council of Medical Research to set up labs. In two days, we will have the checklist as mandated for the laboratory ready and the AFMC would do a review and send the report to ICMR. Post this procedure, the addition of the SPPU laboratory will be published officially on the ICMR website too when we can begin operational.” In the initial days, the laboratory will have capacity of about 100 tests per day but testing will be scaled up. The laboratory will be used for molecular diagnostic and research too, making it the first such lab among state universities. Currently, National Institute of Virology (NIV) has a BSL III and BSL IV lab. The laboratory had received funding of Rs 15 crore. The lab can test nearly 400 to 500 samples daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-test-lab-at-sppu-may-start-operations-in-10-days/articleshow/82168770.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Reshma was immediately taken to the district hospital and after administering treatment she was discharged. The incident was captured by a CCTV camera. In the footage, the girl walking down the street could be seen brutally attacked by a pack of dogs. Though she tried to dispel the canines, a few locals rescued her. Terming it a “common problem”, local area councillor from Ward 57 Shahid Malik said he had lodged several complaints with the authorities concerned, but nothing was done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/girl-7-attacked-by-stray-dogs-in-aligarh/articleshow/82167894.cms||---
---||Meerut||GPS-based tech for error-free alignment makes debut in rail project in India||MEERUT: Building stations and laying rail tracks can pose a challenge because of two reasons — the stations that are to be connected may not end up being aligned on the same path, and, work on one segment of the corridor often has to wait for the completion of another so that the tracks do line up. For the first time in India, a technology to fix this is being used in a rail project — the Continuously Operating Reference System (CORS) for the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS). “In implementing the country’s first RRTS project, NCRTC (National Capital Region Transport Corporation) has … taken several pioneering steps for the public transport sector in the country,” Puneet Vats, chief public relations officer of NCRTC, which is implementing the project, said. He added that the technology will help “simultaneous work at multiple sites, seamless coordination among numerous vendors” and “ensure high accuracy levels and efficiency of operations.” The RRTS corridor, designed to have trains running at 180 km per hour, would need precise alignments. Besides, the tracks are being made on viaducts (a kind of bridge with a series of arches, piers or columns supporting elevated railway or roads) or through tunnels. The switch to CORS means work can begin on segments far away from one another without the possibility of misalignment later. Existing systems also rely on GPS coordinates. But satellite data can be slightly off the mark. Atmospheric bias also has to be accounted for. So, correct alignment of tracks and stations can pose a problem. In the conventional system, geographical data is collected sporadically. CORS, on the other hand, keeps picking that data up through the entire day. So, the amount of data a conventional system would pick up over 72 hours can be collected by CORS in 5-7 seconds. It also means that if, for instance, a conventional system would triangulate a location with 40-cm accuracy in a given amount of time, CORS can do so up to 5-10mm in that same time. For CORS, a network of “reference stations” every 10-15km along the path is set up. These reference stations keep collecting real time geographic data in an automated manner. The reference station data is constantly related to a control centre, which is then conveyed to “field rovers” which are on the ground. If, for instance, tracks had to connect Dohai and Modi Nagar, 10 km apart, those laying the tracks and building the stations on both ends would get a constant update on where exactly they should be working. Alignment wouldn’t be a worry. The only possible challenge that could arise is network coverage — CORS is entirely dependent on internet connectivity. Upon completion, the RRTS, a Rs 30,000-crore project, will connect 24 stations along an 82-km corridor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/gps-based-tech-for-error-free-alignment-makes-debut-in-rail-project-in-india/articleshow/82167898.cms||Sandeep Rai

He had resigned on April 13 while the court was hearing the petition.A division bench of Justices P B Suresh Kumar and K Babu held that the Lok Ayukta was acting within the scope of its powers while arriving at the conclusion. The petitioner has not made out any ground for interference in the final opinion formulated by the Lok Ayukta, the court held.The judgment pointed out that the Lok Ayukta Act was introduced as it was felt that the mechanism provided for in the Kerala Public Men’s Corruption (Investigation and Inquiries) Act, which was in force then, was not sufficient to prevent corruption among public servants effectively. The Lok Ayukta has the power to investigate various acts of omissions and commissions of public servants and the intention of the legislature was that the decision of the Lok Ayukta should be final and that is why no appeal is provided under the Act. Only a judicial review by a constitutional court in a limited manner is permissible, it said.A judicial review is possible only when the decision-making authority exceeded its power, committed an error in law, committed breach of the rules of natural justice, reached an unreasonable decision, or abused its powers, the high court said, citing a 2012 Supreme Court judgment (Bhubaneswar Development Authority Vs. Adikanda Biswal).The court also rejected Jaleel’s contentions that the complaint before the Lok Ayukta was not maintainable, that a preliminary enquiry was not conducted, that there was no investigation into the complaint, and that the findings of the Lok Ayukta are perverse. It dismissed the petition in limine by holding that it had no merit.Pointing out that all public servants from the chief minister to panchayat members are brought under the Lok Ayukta Act, the court said, “In spite of a vigilant media, it is a fact that abuse of public resources and position in public life for private gain is rampant in our state... The scope of corruption would increase when control on the public administrators is weak.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-ground-for-interference-hc-junks-jaleels-plea-against-lok-ayukta-report/articleshow/82168781.cms||---

Shamli’s district magistrate (DM) Jasjeet Kaur admitted to “breakdown in the water supply in the hospital premises” due to defunct RO machine and claimed that temporary arrangements have been made. “I spoke to the chief medical superintendent about it. Water campers have now been kept in the premises. We will now deploy additional staff including attendants, ward boys and sanitation workers for cleanliness and hygiene to meet with the rush of patients,” she said. Last year, several such videos of mismanagement and appalling condition of Covid-19 hospitals across the state had emerged during the first wave of pandemic. Sources claimed that most of these Covid-19 facilities were abandoned after the first wave waned, and no one took care of their maintenance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/covid-19-patients-found-drinking-water-from-hospitals-washroom-tap-in-ups-shamli/articleshow/82167903.cms||Piyush Rai

Though, no official data on who visited Kumbh is available, checking will be conducted on the premise that a majority of people who visited Kumbh were from the rural belt. “In villages we have ‘nigraani’ (watch) committees who know who all have visited the Kumbh. It is not easy to hide that in a rural area,” said the commissioner. “According to our observation, most of the visitors at Kumbh were from the rural areas." At the same time, commissioner Singh said, “Percentage of Covid infections in the rural-dominated areas is very less as compared to urban areas. The basic reason is that people do not meet in closed spaces but in open environment. Besides, those living in closed spaces have lower immunity as compared to villagers. No wonder, Baghpat, Bulandshahr and Hapur (which are rural-dominated districts) have lesser number of cases as compared to Meerut and Ghaziabad, which are highly urbanized.” Interestingly, both Meerut and Bulandshahr have almost the same population of 34 lakh but on Tuesday, the former registered 1,287 cases and the latter 199. Meanwhile Hapur district magistrate Anuj Singh said, "Unfortunately we don’t have a database of people who have returned from Kumbh.

The concern is that already there is 4-5 months delay in conduct of exams and any further delay would hamper the prospects of MBBS students in the state and there would be shortage of house surgeons in hospitals during the pandemic. On Sunday, the governor had written to the universities asking them to postpone examinations that were scheduled to begin this week. This was after the governor received representations from various sections of the public requesting to postpone the examinations in the wake of the increasing Covid-19 caseload in the state. Following this, all the universities, including Kerala University of Health Sciences postponed the examinations. Students admitted during the academic year 2019-20 were having their last phase of the practical examinations that was scheduled to conclude this weekend. The exams were already delayed by 4-5 months. The final year MBBS degree exams that were originally scheduled in February 2021 have been revised and will be conducted in May 2021. “Students belonging to various batches of MBBS course had taken the RT-PCR tests and only those who are negative are admitted to the hostel and are continuing their studies. Majority of students have also taken Covid vaccination,” said Kerala Private Medical College Management Association secretary V Anil Kumar in a letter to the governor. National Medical Commission (NMC) too has maintained that exams should be conducted as per schedule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/medical-colleges-urge-guv-not-to-postpone-exams/articleshow/82168809.cms||---

With minimum six to eight hours of waiting on an average for each patient, many a patient are seen making their own arrangements for bed even in the queue itself. One such patient, Jenti Ramavat, who was waiting in the queue since 9pm on Monday had to get himself a bedstead when till midnight his turn did not come. His relatives told media persons that Ramamvat was feeling uncomfortable inside the vehicle and wanted to sleep outside and so they fetched him a bedstead. He finally got admission after 12 hours of waiting. Quoting sources, about 100 vehicles were in the queue since early morning on Tuesday in the ground of Chaudhary high school on the back side of civil hospital from where Covid patients are being admitted. Rajkot district has a total of 30 ambulances which have all been pressed into managing Covid patients. Seriously ill patients are also arriving in private vehicles, autorickshaws and any vehicle they are managing to get and waiting in the serpentine queues. Hapless kins are seen trying to ease their patients’ distress and beat the heat with bamboo handfans even as the district administration has created a pavilion in the ground for the vehicles. The 108 ambulance team has, meanwhile, parked a van with two extra oxygen cylinders to replace on the ground. One such cylinder lasts for two hours. Expressing its inability to provide early bed owing to the heavy rush of patients, the district administration in a statement said that they are providing ‘treatment on wheels’. “The hospital staff is providing treatment in 108 and private ambulances as well as passengers in auto rickshaw and cars. They also provide oxygen cylinders in the vehicles standing outside,” the statement reads. On the other hand, Rajkot patients’ alternate option to sek succour, Jamnagar’s G G hospital has stopped admitting patients after the queue on Tuesday rose to 100 vehicles from average 60. The admission process A patient is first taken to the OPD where he or she is examined before admission.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mulund centre patients get own fans as AC’s erratic||MUMBAI: With summer heat hitting the city, patients at Mulund’s Richardson and Cruddas jumbo Covid centre have complained its air-conditioning is not working properly, making afternoons unbearable for them. Several patients have now got their own table or stand fans to beat the heat during the day. Hundreds of Covid patients are currently admitted at the jumbo centre that was constructed by Cidco last June. The centre was to have 1,850 beds, including 215 ICU beds and 75 beds for dialysis patients. “Both my parents, Nilesh and Jagruti Vasa, were admitted on April 15. The air-conditioning is not working properly. It becomes unbearable between 11am and 5pm due to the heat. My father’s oxygen levels were dropping so he was shifted to Somaiya Hospital on April 16 itself but my mother is still there,” said Kinnari Vasa on Monday. Vasa then requested the centre’s authorities to allow a stand fan or a table fan for her mother. “Thankfully, they allowed us. Most patients at the Mulund jumbo centre now have their own stand fans or table fans to beat the heat. But with so many patients, it is very difficult because of the heat. The air-conditioning issue must be resolved,” Vasa said. “However, the other facilities are good and my parents had no issues with the sanitation,” she said. Mihir Kotecha, BJP MLA from Mulund, said he had received several complaints from patients and their relatives about the heat but the treatment by the doctors has been good. “They had installed exhibition toilets, which have suffered a lot of wear and tear in the past 10 months. Most toilet doors have no latches now and there is water leakage every day. I have asked the BMC to resolve this. The air-conditioning is not working,” Kotecha said. Videos of leaking toilets and water in passages from the centre had gone viral over the weekend, prompting civic officials to review the various problems that had cropped up. Kotecha said action should be taken against the contractor who constructed the jumbo centre. “The contractor is taking a rent of Rs 4 crore per month and not maintaining the facility at all. I have already written to the BMC about this but they have not taken any action. There have been no complaints about the food or the treatment at all, which have been very good,” said Kotecha. “We have already directed the technical team to inspect the centre and resolve the issues with the air-conditioning. We have also asked the contractor to get the other maintenance issues resolved as it is the agency’s responsibility. We will ensure that the air-cooling issue is resolved immediately. Action will be taken against the contractor for non-maintenance if there is any further delay,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mulund-centre-patients-get-own-fans-as-acs-erratic/articleshow/82167928.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The locals saythat despite filing complaints, the leakage has not been fixed in the last several months. Sanjay Dhoundial, a resident of Balbir road, told TOI, “The water leakage is visible to everyone passing by and also to the officials, but they still have not fixed the leakage.” The residents said that they filed a complaint on the Jal Sansthan helpline but only received a message claiming the issue was resolved. Aarti Sinha, a resident of Dalanwala area said, “I see water getting wasted every day. The summers have arrived and the people across the city are in dire need of clean drinking water.” Residents at Circular road also said that the leakage has even been enclosed with a low-brick wall but it hasn’t stopped. Meanwhile, the officials from Jal Sansthan said that they are fixing the leakages in several parts of the city and the repair work at Circular road and Balbir road will also be completed soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/water-leakage-in-city-roads-a-menace/articleshow/82167940.cms||---

A 56-year-old woman, who had tested Covid-19 positive on Monday, jumped off the fifth floor of Samras Hostel in the university campus early on Tuesday. According to police, the deceased was identified as Niru Bhalgama, a resident of Tirupati Society on Morbi Road. After testing positive, Bhalgama was shifted to the Covid care centre set at Samras Hostel. She also had other co-morbid conditions including diabetes.

His two vans were lying idle for the entire year as schools remained closed. Tanna was unemployed till he got an opportunity earlier this month, as one of his school vans was hired for the ‘Sanjivani Van Seva’. This has brought him some relief. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) project for treating Covid-19 patients at their doorsteps by deploying Sanjivani vans has come as a relief for the practically unemployed school van owners and drivers. As the civic body needed a fleet of cars to carry doctors, paramedics and medicines to Covid patients, it hired cars by inviting various travel agencies. Among those who got lucky are some school van owners, though not most of them, because the models of most school vans do not fit the requirement. Tanna said one of his vans, a Maruti Suzuki Eeco was hired for the medical service, but another model ‘Omni’ has not been in great demand for the service. Earlier, Tanna’s vehicles ferried students of three schools. Like Tanna, Bhavin Patel’s van was engaged at Madhav International School. His vehicle was also engaged for Sanjivani Van Seva and he considered this an opportunity. According to the Ahmedabad School Van Owners’ Association president Dharmendra Brahmbhatt, there are some 1,000 school vans which fit the requirement and many of the owners got employment opportunities. “There are more than 7,000 school vans which are the old Omni model. We had to persuade the authorities for a year to consider using them. They have agreed lately and since last week, some of the vans of this model have been engaged,” he told TOI. School van drivers said that due to the requirement and rules that the old model could accommodate 15 kids, most owners retained the Omni model. “The Eeco was not a favourite a vehicle for school vans. Many had even sold that vehicle and continued with the Omni. Now, since the Omni has also been accepted for service, it is good for the owners though they pay only Rs 600 for an Omni against Rs 750 fixed for an Eeco,” Tanna said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/school-van-owners-get-relief-in-sanjivani-duty/articleshow/82168882.cms||---

The seized gold, worth Rs.7.2 crore, were concealed in the form of biscuits inside a refrigerator. According to DRI sources, for the first time in several years gold was seized from the cargo that arrived by sea route. Moreover, it was the biggest gold seizure made by DRI this year; 120 gold biscuits were hidden in the refrigerator. The cargo belonged to a Malappuram native who booked its shipping from Dubai. He has been taken into custody by DRI and the agency has carried out searches in various parts of Malappuram and Kozhikode following the seizure to get more details. “Gold seizures from seaport are uncommon in Kochi. The person who shipped the cargo reached Kochi by air a few days ago. The ship carrying the cargo arrived at Cochin Port last week and the person came to get clearance for the cargo on Tuesday. We are interrogating the person and are conducting searches at his residence and other places named by him during questioning,” DRI sources said. It is also suspected that the accused has smuggled gold via sea route earlier and DRI is checking his travel history and the details of the cargo shipped or received by him in the past. DRI officials said that he might have selected a sea route following the increased surveillance at airports after the seizure of gold that was smuggled through diplomatic channels at Thiruvananthapuram airport last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dri-seizes-gold-worth-rs-7-2-crore-at-cochin-port/articleshow/82168885.cms||---

---||Pune||Housing societies peeved about ‘impractical’ PPE kit order||PUNE: Housing societies have called out the “impracticality” of providing personal protection equipment (PPE) kits to private security guards in micro-containment zones, considering their shrinking coffers and rising heat. They have also demanded their proper representation in the state government orders concerning them. As per the recent state orders, any co-operative housing society with more than five Covid cases will be declared as a micro-containment zone. Such housing societies will have to provide PPE kits to their private security guards to allow their movement, failure of which will attract “exemplary fines”. “With an increasing number of housing societies coming under the micro-containment zones, it is practically impossible to have private security guards work in PPE kits in this heat... How are such orders issued? They are clearly impossible to follow,” said Suhas Patwardhan, chairman, Pune District Cooperative Housing Federation. The state chapter of the federation has over 1 lakh housing societies as its members, including 20,000 in Pune. Federation members have sent a letter to the state government, urging officials to involve them while issuing orders concerning them. The order also demands video recording of the movement of people within and outside the sealed societies by private security guards, which has also failed to find any favour with the federation. On the penalty part, Patwardhan asked if the local authorities would provide the PPE kits. Ravindra Sinha of the Baner, Balewadi and Pashan Residents’ Association too questioned the state move ans said how would the security guards work in such summer heat wearing PPE kits. “Adequate measures like masks, sanitisers, physical distancing, temperature and oxygen checks are already in place. Then why do we need such impractical rules, which only stress out the society members,” he said. Nitin Jain, director of the Wagholi Housing Societies’ Association, said it was not feasible to expect society members to follow such orders. “I don’t think such rules can be practically implemented,” he said. Members of a sealed society said their security guards were already wanting to go back to their native places and such rules would only add to their problems. The federation members also raised the de-notification issue of containment zone, which often takes time. “Some of the housing societies have been in containment zone for weeks as there are new cases. To be de-notified, there should be no new cases till 10 days after de-notification,” a member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hsg-societies-peeved-about-impractical-ppe-kit-order/articleshow/82168889.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: As patients gasp for breath, families scramble for oxygen||LUCKNOW: After two days of continuous efforts, a septuagenarian Covid-19 patient finally received referral from the CMO office for admission to a private hospital on Tuesday. This was a big relief for the entire family as everyone was tested positive. However, the oxygen saturation level of 76-year-old patient dropped below 70 and he required immediate medical attention. But to everyone’s surprise, when the patient reached the hospital for admission in an L3 hospital, he was denied admission. Initially, the staff asked for referral update from the CMO office but later they informed the patient’s kin about the non-availability of oxygen. The patient returned home with an uncertain fate. Similarly, a 59-year-old patient from Rajajipuram, who received referral for private as well as government hospital found himself helpless, when hospitals denied him admission as their oxygen supply had dried up. Left with no other option, he returned home. In a similar case, a 50-year-old Covid-19 patient from Indiranagar was discharged from a non-Covid hospital after the facility ran out of oxygen. “I contacted Covid helpline, government officials, doctors and even oxygen cylinder suppliers but received no help. His oxygen saturation level has now dropped to 70 from 92,” said the younger brother of the patient. According to officials, hospitals are admitting only those covid patients whose relatives were able to arrange oxygen. “I’m standing in the queue since morning for two cylinders of 50 litres each for my father who is admitted to a private Covid hospital. The hospital has only 10% oxygen supply left and I need to reach the hospital as soon as possible,” said a 38-year-old man waiting outside a Talkatora-based oxygen plant. A senior doctor, affiliated to IMA, said: “We have come to know that oxygen supply will increase by the end of the week as the government has made some arrangements from other states. I hope that the supply resumes soon, otherwise many more will die.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/as-patients-gasp-for-breath-families-scramble-for-oxygen/articleshow/82169866.cms||---
---||Mumbai||As Mumbai’s graph dips, Maharashtra still seeing big rise||MUMBAI: After the detection of 11,200 Covid cases on April 4, the daily caseload in Mumbai has been steadily dipping, and, on Tuesday, 7,192 cases were registered. The city’s Covid graph has clearly begun showing a ‘plateau’ or a dip that is apparent from the weekly growth of cases: as against 67,795 cases detected between April 5 and 11, 58,988 cases were found between April 12 and 18 (testing numbers in both the weeks were around 45,000 on most days except Sundays). However, the second Covid wave in Maharashtra hasn’t been running parallel to that in its capital city: in fact, the fall in cases in Mumbai has been accompanied by a rise across Maharashtra. As against 3.9 lakh cases registered between April 5 and 11 across Maharashtra, 4.3 lakh cases were found the subsequent week. “Mumbai appears to have peaked, but cases are increasing in multiple districts,” said a senior health department doctor.   While none of the districts have the number of cases that say, Mumbai, Pune or Nagpur see on a daily basis, there is a sharp rise in terms of percentages. For instance, districts such as Solapur, Kolhapur and Chandrapur are witnessing a surge. “Cases in Gadchiroli have more than tripled in a week, but it has a smaller caseload than most cities,” he added.     In Sangli, for instance, the weekly graph in April shows an increase from 279 to 806. , which was a spot of concern during the first wave as well, has increased from 1,752 to 2,582 in the same period. In other words, there is no new hotspot to replace Mumbai, but a simultaneous rise across many districts.     Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said the second wave started in clusters across the state. “The cluster spread faster in cities and spread over to rural areas. While Mumbai seems to have passed the peak or is on the peak, so are Pune and Nanded, but the rest of Maharashtra is still showing a growth,” he said. A senior state official said the surge in smaller cities and towns may be smaller compared to bigger cities, but it is equally concerning as the infrastructure cannot cope. “We are also seeing a surge in deaths from smaller cities as patients are reporting late,” said an official. In Yavatmal, where daily detections are up from 243 to 931 in a week, most cases are coming from rural areas of the district. Officials said the number of tests has been kept constant for the last 3 weeks, still cases are increasing rapidly. Rural spread is one of the major reasons, said civil surgeon Dr Tarangtushar Ware. “Cases are coming from across the district, but cases from rural areas are more in the last one week,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/as-mumbais-graph-dips-maharashtra-still-seeing-big-rise/articleshow/82170660.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Pune||Pune: Retailers rue heavy losses after early closure of shops by police||PUNE: Groceries, vegetable and fruit vendors and all types of food sellers in the city were forced to shut their shops at 11am by police on Tuesday even before the state government issued an official order restricting business hours for such outlets to four hours from 7am, retailers said. Most of the retailers said the police on patrolling duty began forcibly shutting the outlets, including grocery stores, sweet shops, vegetable and fruit vendors, from 11am in several areas of the city, though the revised operation timings were to be enforced from 6pm. The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) order issued on Tuesday afternoon stated that all groceries, vegetables shops, fruit vendors, dairies, bakeries, confectionaries, all types of food outlets (including that of chicken, mutton, poultry, fish and egg) and stores related to agricultural implements and farm produce, pet food and material for the coming rainy season could open from 7am to 11am. The order was to come into force after 6pm on Tuesday. The PMC orders on fresh guidelines are mostly on the lines of the state’s directives, but the only difference is about the home delivery timings. Home delivery of essentials in civic areas will be allowed up to 6pm, two hours less than that in the state’s order Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta clarified that the essential commodities’ outlets were technically allowed to operate till 6pm on Tuesday. “The 7am-11am business hours for grocery and vegetable shops, fruit vendors, dairies, bakeries, confectionaries and all types of food shops, among others, will be implemented from Wednesday,” he said. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar confirmed that the grocery and essential items’ shops could function in the city till 6pm on Tuesday, as both the state and civic body’s orders were to be implemented after 6pm. Sachin Nivangune, president, Pune District Retail Traders’ Association, said, “The premature closure of the shops, without prior warning, caused massive losses to groceries, vegetable and chicken shops — around Rs15,000 per establishment. Perishables were at a risk of going to waste. The restricted timing will create more chaos, as it will cause crowding during morning hours.” Viren Shah, president of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association, said, “It will be difficult to control crowds for local authorities. Another hurdle is how the grocery stores will ensure home delivery after 11am keeping the shutters down?” Arvind Motilal Budhani, who runs Budhani Brothers Waferwala, said, “With the new operation hours to be implemented from Wednesday, we will have to drastically reduce stock of perishable items for sale on a particular day. Business is likely to take a big hit.” A fruit seller at Chinchwagaon was upset to shut her business after being told by the Chinchwad police and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation workers. “I purchased bananas worth Rs3,000 in the morning, considering devotees need the fruit for breaking Roza in evening. People will not buy these bananas tomorrow. They prefer fresh ones,” she said. Another fruit vendor said, “We are 40 vendors in the Chinchwagaon near Chapekar Chowk. The corporation has allowed only 20 vendors following the rise in Covid cases. We now do business on alternate days. On Tuesday, we had to shut our stalls at 11am. We will have to wait for our turn till Thursday.” The Pimpri Chinchwad police on Tuesday morning closed Krishnanagar vegetables market at Sane Chowk in Chikhali. Dutta Patil, who runs a vegetables store in the Charholi area, said, “We had purchased vegetables and fruits in large quantities anfd don’t know what to do with it now.” Ismail Bhagwan, a fruit vendor from Bhosari market, said, “How can police make such a move without giving prior notice and enforce a premature shutdown of shops?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/retailers-rue-heavy-losses-after-early-closure-of-shops-by-police/articleshow/82168873.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: HC refuses to restrain SII from using Covishield name for vax||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Tuesday declined to restrain Serum Institute of India (SII) from using the name ‘Covishield’ for its vaccine in a trademark dispute and dismissed the appeal filed by pharma company Cutis Biotech. “There is adequate and convincing material on record to demonstrate the prior adoption of the mark (Covishield) by Serum Institute,” said the bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and C V Bhadang. Cutis Biotech had moved the HC after a Pune district court refused its plea to restrain SII from using the trademark ‘Covishield’ for its vaccine. The HC noted that “Covishield is a vaccine to counter coronavirus is now widely known” and “a temporary injunction (restraining order) directing SII to discontinue the use of the trademark will cause confusion and disruption in the state’s vaccination programme”. Neither Cutis nor Serum have a registration for the trademark ‘Covishield’, but under the Trademark Act ‘passing off’ of an unregistered trademark can be protected on principles of equity, goodwill and fairplay. Cutis Biotech had sought to invoke the ‘passing-off’ action citing “goodwill” and prior adoption of the name. On April 29, 2020, Cutis had applied for registration of the trademark ‘Covishield’ for vitamins and dietary food supplement for humans and animals, while SII had applied on June 6, 2020. On July 24, 2020, SII sought Drugs Controller General nod to conduct clinical trials in India for Covishield vaccine. On August 2, 2002, the Directorate General of Health Services granted SII permission to manufacture test batches of the vaccine for clinical trials. On December 10, 2020, the Centre, in its Covid-19 vaccine procedure, referred to SII’s Covishield in collaboration with AstraZeneca for PhaseII/III stage. A day later Cutis filed a trademark suit in a Nanded court and on December 12, it applied for registering ‘Covishield’ as a trademark for vaccine. In January, Cutis moved the Pune court, whose interim order the HC upheld. CutisBiotech though its counsel Abhinav Chandrachud and Aditya Soni cited a number of case law to back its plea for a temporary injunction under 'passing off' and to seek an order for Serum Institute to maintain its accounts. The company said it had from May 30, 2020 sold disinfectants and hand sanitisers under the ‘Covishield’ brand “received” from its manufacturers and its turnover was Rs 16 lakh till end of 2020. After seeing the documents produced, HC said it did not find adequate details to establish prior use. “According tous, the conduct of Cutis Biotech does not appear to be bona fide,’’ observed the HC in its order. Cutis Also argued loss of future sale of its products, but the HC found that no force in it.The HC order also said, "Since there is no prima facie case in favour of Cutis Biotech, its prayer to direct the Serum Institute to maintain accounts cannot be granted.'' Serum Institute through its counsel Birendra Saraf and Hitesh Jain informed the HC that it “produced 60 million doses of the Covishield' vaccine per month and has supplied 48 million doses to theGovernment of India.” The HC also said it would be “too far fetched to hold that there will be confusion in the average consumers' minds between the use of a trademark in a Government administered vaccine at designated places and over the counter sanitizer products.’’ "Covishield vaccine of Serum Institute has been supplied through the States and Union Territories. As of 16 March 2021, sixty-six million doses of 'Covishield' have been supplied to the Government of India. Also, around fifty-nine million doses have been supplied to over seventy-two different countries,'' the HC order noted. The HC noted that Serum Institute has so far made sales amounting to Rs 375 crore through sale of Covishield vaccine and spent Rs 28 crore on development and research and plans to spend Rs 20 crore more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-hc-refuses-to-restrain-sii-from-using-covishield-name-for-vax/articleshow/82169891.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Goa||Princeton returns to the field after Covid-19 scare||Margao: Princeton Rebello couldn’t believe his ears when he was told that he had tested positive for Covid-19. The FC Goa midfielder had missed the crucial second-leg semifinal against Mumbai City FC with a fracture toe and now he was in danger of missing out on the all-important AFC Champions League. Princeton was cautious all along. Inside the team bubble, he had not stepped out anywhere. Yet when the test results arrived on Sunday (April 11), he had little to celebrate. “We knew there were cases of false positives (among footballers), so another test was done two days later,” said one team source. That turned out to be negative. Two more tests were done as per the SOPs for the AFC Champions League and those too were negative, allowing Princeton to return to the field after five days in isolation. “When you have tested positive for Covid-19, the immediate protocol is to isolate yourself,” a team official told TOI on Wednesday. “If your CT (cycle threshold) value is high around 30, then your body has already fought the infection and a negative report can happen soon enough. Princeton’s CT value was high and it turned out to be a case of a false positive.” Princeton’s roommate, Saviour Gama, had to also remain isolated for a couple of days before the test results were out. He tested negative, but having missed out on training sessions, coach Juan Ferrando opted to start with Sanson Pereira at left-back in the opener against Al Rayyan. Princeton missed the first two games against Al Rayyan and Al Wahda, but made it to the bench against Persepolis FC on Tuesday. The midfielder got his chance in the 58th minute when he stepped into the boots of Brandon Fernandes. With captain Edu Bedia suspended for the next clash against the Iranian champions on Friday, Princeton is likely to step into his boots, playing alongside Glan Martins.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/princeton-returns-to-the-field-after-covid-19-scare/articleshow/82186516.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Mother, sibling in custody for murdering youth||Kollam: Eroor police under the Kollam rural district on Tuesday booked a woman, her son and daughter-in-law and took them into custody for murdering her elder son and burying him on their own house premises three years ago. Police could solve the case following the revelation by one of the relatives of the deceased youth to the police about the incident. According to police, Shaji Peter, 44, of Pallimelathil House, Pazhayerror Thottamukku, Bharatheepuram, was missing since 2018. Shaji’s brother Sajin Peter, 40, and his wife Arya, 35, who were residing at Kottarakkara, visited Shaji and mother Ponnamma at Bharatheepuram in 2018. While boozing together with the brother, Shaji allegedly misbehaved with Arya and Sajin questioned it and a fight ensued. During the fight, Shaji sustained a serious blow on his head and died. Realising that Shaji was dead, Ponnamma, Sajin Peter and Arya buried the body on the premises of their house and decided to keep the matter a secret. As Shaji’s friends and relatives inquired about Shaji, they told them that Shaji had left the home and he could be staying at Malappuram. Ponnamma tried to convince everyone by spreading this story. Last week, when one of their relatives, Roy from Pathanamthitta, visited Ponnamma she divulged the secret to him. She told him that they buried him near the well. When Roy, who was wanted in theft cases, was booked by Pathanamthitta police, he revealed this incident too. Following this, the SP office, Pathanamthitta, passed on the message to the Eroor police.

Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao told TOI that the situation was “very difficult” and supply was being sought from Visakhapatnam or Coimbatore by rail route. “We are in an extreme state of fire fighting and exploring all options,” he said, adding that the administration was considering a green corridor to get these supply. Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh issued an order on Tuesday, appointing a team of officers to keep a check on supply of oxygen from the plants to the hospitals. In Pune district, four plants in Chakan meet the oxygen requirement of hospitals. The Centre has, in the meanwhile, asked chief secretaries of all states to convert tankers that carry nitrogen and argon into vehicles carrying oxygen. The district administration has decided to accord the status of ambulances to tankers carrying oxygen to ensure hassle-free transport of the gas essential for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/demand-up-o2-supply-in-district-a-worry-rao/articleshow/82168908.cms||Nisha Nambiar

At present, only Dhakoli has been declared as the containment zone, where extensive sampling is being done. In April, Mohali urban has seen 5,239 positive cases in 20 days with an average of 260 cases surfacing daily. In March too, Mohali urban saw 4,671 cases. However, Mohali deputy commissioner Gitish Dayalan said they have devised to put Mohali cases on Google Maps to show area-wise active load by indicating red marks. Dayalan said, “Orders to form containment and micro-containment zones have already been issued and after mapping, the zones will be declared. A cluster with five to 15 cases will be declared as micro-containment zone and those with over 15 cases will be declared as containment zones.” He said in order to analyse the daily positive cases, a methodology has been devised which picks up details from the database and automatically sorts on the basis of sub-division, locality, gender, age, health block etc. and it further indicates on Google Maps by showing area-wise load of active or daily cases. This helps in identifying the containment areas and micro-containment areas. He said, “Localities with large concentration of cases can be identified by setting a baseline. For example, if a locality has a minimum of eight cases, the Google Map will automatically flag such areas as red.” It is being believed that people from the UK or Europe carrying the UK variant virus B.1.1.7 have many contacts in Mohali urban and housing societies in Dhakoli and Zirakpur, where positive cases are also skyrocketing. The DC said, “We are aware of the outburst in Mohali. Many UK variant cases have been traced and isolated, but it has been observed that the new virus is similar to the earlier one so there is no need to panic. The treatment is nearly similar. We need to wear masks judiciously and maintain social distancing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/10k-cases-no-sealing-in-mohali-urban/articleshow/82168896.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The situation was resolved after three hours. In the meantime, medical teachers, faculty members including Gandhi Medical College (GMC) Dean Dr Jitendra Shukla took up varied responsibilities of the protesting contractual staff. They were also seen distributing food packets to Covid-19 patients. According to reports, at around 11 am, a deputy superintendent who has been entrusted with running of main Covid-19 ward, confronted a contractual employee over non-performance of her task. The employee replied ‘we can only do so much in the pay we get’. It led to heated exchange of words. Soon another contractual employees stopped work and alleged that the woman was mistreated. Contractual employees halted work in at around 11 am. It resumed when second shift began at around 3 pm. The doctor in question is incharge of Covid-19 hospital Block D and has been credited with setting up of the new wing in record time. Over 240 patients including private wards have been set up in record time in the new hospital block. “Main outsource agency has sublet the contract on hiring staff to another agency. GMC administration has been under pressure to perform. If doctors get blackmailed in such fashion, our morale gets dented and patient care would be adversely affected,” said a senior consultant at GMC. During the three hours of stir by contractual employees, the patient care was not affected. A total of 240 beds are installed on all three floors of the new building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/hamidia-contractual-staff-halt-work-for-3-hours-after-dispute/articleshow/82168900.cms||---

A bench of Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice V D Nanavati has sought reply from all respondents within two weeks, said advocate Anand Yagnik, who appeared for the petitioner, the leader of the opposition in the state assembly, Paresh Dhanani. The petition was filed last week, seeking an inquiry by an expert committee or by the government authorities into the procurement and distribution of the controlled anti-viral drug form the Surat BJP office earlier this month. Dhanani has sought criminal, civil and departmental action against all those involved or have aided Paatil in procuring the injections in such a huge quantity, which have been manufactured by Zydus Health Care Ltd. Dhanani has demanded constitution of an expert committee with neutral persons to inquire into hoarding, distributing, selling of 5,000 injections to people under the provisions of various laws – the Pharmacy Act, 1948, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act. He has claimed that after the central authority’s order of controlled selling of the drug, the act of hoarding required inquiry. Dhanani approached the HC after Paatil refused to divulge the source of the stock and even chief minister Vijay Rupani skirted the question in this regard. He submitted that an inquiry is necessary into who sold 5,000 injections to Paatil and whether a political party should be allowed to indulge in such an act amid a pandemic when thousands badly require the medicine and are finding it hard to get it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/remdesivir-hoarding-hc-notice-to-govt-bjp-state-chief/articleshow/82168913.cms||---

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao will take a final decision on this issue. The SEC consults the government on holding or postponing elections as per section 195 of the Telangana Municipalities Act,” said a source in the SEC. The SEC has been flooded with several representations from various civil society organisations and political parties, including Congress and Telangana Jana Samithi, to defer the polls. KCR and several leaders, who attended the Halia public meeting held as part of campaigning for bypoll to Nagarjuna Sagar constituency recently, have tested positive for Covid-19. Telangana Congress president Uttam Kumar Reddy told TOI that they had objected to KCR’s public meeting on the grounds that it would act as a superspreader, but the meeting was allowed. The SEC hurriedly announced the municipal poll schedule to please political masters, he alleged. “The election schedule and reservations were issued on the same day,” Uttam said. Uttam, who is down with fever, has self-quarantined himself. However, he has not taken the Covid test yet. Even some BJP leaders who campaigned in the by-poll have tested positive. Former MLC Ramulu Naik of Congress, who had campaigned in Nagarjuna Sagar, has also tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/secs-sos-to-govt-on-conduct-of-polls/articleshow/82168911.cms||Roushan Ali

The passengers were then made to board another flight, which landed in Pune around 9pm. The glitch resulted in the flight getting delayed by two hours. The flight was supposed to take off from Delhi around 4:40pm and land in Pune at 6:45pm. The flight had taken off from the national capital at 4:55pm, sources said. The aircraft, an Airbus A-320, made a turn back for Delhi near Jaipur in Rajasthan after the take-off. “It was an air turn back due to certain technical reasons. Following the flight’s landing in Delhi, another aircraft was arranged for passengers,” a GoAir official told TOI.

They also did not suffer from any serious lung infection after taking the two jabs. The study was conducted by Nizamabad Government General Hospital (GGH) radiology department. The department took 10 patients who did not take the shot and 10 patients who got vaccinated for its study and conducted all the tests, including CT scan of the chest. “The results were encouraging. Those who had taken their vaccine doses did not have any chest infection. Only one person had a mild infection but he did not require hospitalisation. Whereas, among the patients who did not take the jab, 80 per cent of them had chest infection and needed hospitalisation,” Dr Kiran Madala of GGH said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-vaccine-shots-a-shield-against-lung-infection-study/articleshow/82168940.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Nagpur||Even after HC order to send 10k, district gets 0 Remdesivir stock||NAGPUR: A day after the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court ordered the state government to send 10,000 Remdesivir vials to Nagpur district to tackle the Covid crisis, the district administration received only 1,100 from different sources on Tuesday compelling it to postpone its distribution to hospitals treating coronavirus patients. With around 165 Covid hospitals and some facilities, having more than 7,000 beds, waiting for the crucial anti-viral injection, the stock received by the district administration was only 15% of the total demand. On Sunday too the district administration could not distribute the injection due to short supply. On April 17, only 395 vials were received. As no Covid patients could be administered Remdesivir, the death rate on Monday was a pandemic-high of 113. With yet another ‘zero’ supply on Tuesday, the city hospital administration is expecting the worst on Wednesday. Not just Remdesivir, even other Covid-saving drugs like Tocilizumab and Alzumab are in short supply. “From now, whatever little Remdesivir stock is received will be distributed. There is a possibility of 5,000 reaching the district on Wednesday,” said district collector Ravindra Thakare who discussed the crisis with top officials of revenue department and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday evening. “On Monday, we could meet only 60% of the demand and the stock received was far too less for distribution on Tuesday,” added Thakre. According to a highly-placed source, even the details of the 1,100 Remdesivir vials did not reach the collector’s office till late making the job difficult of allotting it to the hospitals. Around 20 vials of Tocilizumab are expected to arrive by April 23. Even oxygen shortage has severely hit the district and region. According to Dr Anup Marar, convenor of the Vidarbha Hospitals Association, the district faced a panic situation and making relatives and patients anxious. “There is surplus stock in western Maharashtra hospitals but Vidarbha patients continue to get step-motherly treatment in terms of allotment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/even-after-hc-order-to-send-10k-dist-gets-0-remdesivir-stock/articleshow/82168912.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: No beds, critical patients die in queue||LUCKNOW: Raj Kumar Rastogi (59) died due to Covid-19 at RSM hospital on Tuesday morning after waiting for almost 24 hours to be shifted to a hospital with a ventilator facility. Even after an SOS by hospital authorities to Integrated Control and Command Centre (ICCC) that the patient’s inability to sustain oxygen is declining and blood oxygen levels have dropped below 70, and desperate attempts by his family to reach out to senior officers, the district administration and the office of the chief medical officer (CMO) could not provide help. The authorities said they were helpless as no critical care bed was available anywhere. For the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday, patients like Rastogi died for want of a bed. Rastogi’s case is an example of how Covid patients are suffering right from the day they test positive to treatment and death. Survived by his wife and son Swapnil, Rastogi’s ordeal started when he developed breathlessness on April 13 and his blood oxygen levels dropped to 82. Swapnil contacted over two dozen hospitals in the city over the phone but got no help due shortage of oxygen.  “We also enquired with KGMU, SPM Civil Hospital and RMLIMS for emergency beds, but to no avail. Finally, we got a bed in a small private hospital in Thakurganj. Tests results of April 14 showed he had Covid pneumonia. It took three days and help from some media persons that my father got admitted to RSM Hospital meant for moderate Covid cases on April 17,” said an inconsolable Swapnil, a resident of Balaganj. “On Monday morning, hospital officials called me to inform that my father’s condition had deteriorated. They told me that their hospital is L1 which is meant for moderate cases and my father needs to be shifted to an L3 hospital for critical care. The hospital officials said that they had informed the ICCC and CMO office and asked me to try through my contacts. I tried everything I could but a call on Tuesday morning delivered the news that shattered my world,” said Swapnil, the only son of Rastogi. Sources at RSM hospital told TOI that since the patient’s brain was not receiving enough oxygen, he suffered an anxiety attack. “Early Monday morning, the patient went to the hospital bathroom on his own and started pouring water on himself without taking off the clothes. This went on for half an hour when a ward boy noticed it and brought him to bed where doctors gave him medication. A few hours later, he had a massive heart attack and died,” an official said. Repeated attempts to contact CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar went in vain as he did not take any call. District administration officers said they were trying to get bed for every critical patient. “The problem is due to the unprecedented crisis created by Covid-19 pandemic,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-beds-critical-patients-die-in-queue/articleshow/82169887.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Government offices to function with 50% Class III & IV grade employees||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government on Tuesday announced that only 50% of Class III and IV grade government employees will be called to public offices. The decision came on the day when the hill state recorded more than 3,000 fresh Covid-19 infections, the highest single-day surge in new cases since the outbreak of the pandemic. In yet another decision aimed at containing the spread of the virus, the departments were directed to conduct meetings via video conferencing. In case an offline meeting is necessary, only a limited number of officials must be called for participating in it, said the order addressed to senior bureaucrats and top police officials. The order, issued by chief secretary Om Prakash, stated that the government departments (barring the essential services) will function with 50% strength of Class III and IV employees. The duties of these employees would be fixed on a rotational basis. Women employees with children less than 10 years of age and pregnant women staff are to be called to office only in unavoidable conditions. Similarly, employees above the age of 55 years would also be called only in urgent situations. The order further stated that disabled staff – barring those in essential services – would be exempted from coming to the office. The directive, however, added that any employee can be called for duty in urgent conditions. The order comes in the wake of the Uttarakhand Sachivalaya Sangh members demanding to restrict the number of government employees coming to offices. The order is to be implemented with immediate effect and will be in place until further notice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-offices-to-function-with-50-class-iii-iv-grade-employees/articleshow/82167957.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Pune||Curbs to affect Maharashtra GSDP by up to 1.5%: Industry association||PUNE: The enhanced lockdown-like restrictions in Maharashtra could impact the state’s economy by up to 1.5% if these curbs continued for about a month, industry observers said. The observers, however, said the overall impact would be softer than last year’s economic impacts following a total lockdown. Estimates from the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MCCIA) revealed that the Pune region, the state’s main manufacturing base and information technology hub, was losing around Rs5,600 crore in the gross value addition (GVA) — value of goods and services, minus input costs — per week in the enhanced restrictions and lockdown-like period. For the state, a two-week period of restrictions entails about a 0.5% impact on the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). More restrictions, such as a lockdown, or a lengthening of the period of restrictions to the middle of May, can increase that impact by up to 1.5%. With last year’s impact as a baseline, when the industrial and the services sector had all but stopped operations for more than a month, the effect, in terms of job loss, tax revenue or exodus of migrant workers, is estimated to be significantly lesser. The industry observers said barring a few, most industries have been working through the movement control orders in the recent weeks, despite lower levels of productivity and employment. “We expect an impact of about 0.5-1.5% on Maharashtra’s GSDP, if the current state of restrictions continues for another one to three weeks. The severity of the impact on health and lives is greater during this second wave of Covid-19. We all are still struggling with oxygen supplies in the city. On the economic front, the impact will be relatively lesser as compared to the same period last year. As more than half the factories are able to continue their production at some level so far, the reverse migration is also limited as compared to the last episode,” said Prashant Girbane, director general of the MCCIA. Girbane, however, warned about another blow to the contact-based services sector, such as restaurants, travel, and hospitality, with “another painful period of recovery”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/curbs-to-affect-maha-gsdp-by-up-to-1-5-industry-association/articleshow/82168918.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The growers were bracing up for bulk orders, and those who had were readying the stock when the second wave of pandemic struck. Most orders from Delhi and NCR districts were canceled or didn’t come at all. And a week-long lockdown in the national capital dashed the remaining hopes of flower growers of western Uttar Pradesh. “Flowers constitute at least 40% of the total cost of decoration in marriages in Delhi. We had thought about recovering from last year's loss this time. But as the marriage season started, lockdown was imposed in Delhi. This will ruin us now as it’s a cash crop with very little shelf life,” a farmer said. According to farmers, the demand has hit so low that a bunch of roses that sold for Rs 200 is now selling for just Rs 70. Rates of carnation have dropped 33%. Last year, visuals of farmers throwing away tons of flowers were shared widely. According to officials, there are 15 poly houses which farmers had set up on subsidy under government schemes of horticulture department. Out of them, flower farming is being practiced in eight poly houses. Flower growers are growing roses, gerbera, carnation and daisy. Talking to TOI, a flower grower of Bijnor’s Agri village, Sunny Chaudhary, said, “I have three poly houses in which I am growing gerbera, carnation and daisy flowers. Carnations bloom just once a year. Because of the lockdown, there are a handful of buyers of flowers. With the commencement of navratri festival, the marriage season had started. We felt that we will make up for the loss of last year. “But due to the lockdown and restrictions, orders for flower decoration that we had assigned have been cancelled by buyers. Prices are also low due to the restrictions. A bunch of rose containing 20 flowers is being sold at Rs 70, instead of Rs 200. Similarly, price for gerbera has reduced from Rs 60 to Rs 15, carnations from Rs 125 to Rs 40, gypsophila bunch containing 20 flowers from Rs 100 to Rs 50. In addition, marigold’s price is Rs 70 per kg instead of Rs 100.” District horticulture officer Narpal Malik acknowledged, “Flower growers are suffering huge losses. There is little demand for flowers at present.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/covid-19-hits-floriculture-2nd-year-in-a-row-orders-dry-up-due-to-lockdown-in-delhi/articleshow/82167954.cms||Harveer Dabas

So production will start from Wednesday. We are hoping some relief will come and issue will be resolved,” said Meena. She added, “Hospitals have to place orders directly from Hetero and other companies. There is no distribution being done.” Meanwhile, on Monday, cabinet secretary had held a review meeting with all states on oxygen. Telangana industries secretary Jayesh Ranjan, who took part in the meet, said, “Planning was done to beef up supplies to the states facing shortage.

The PIL also questions the civic body’s decision to surrender its 50% reserved beds in private designated Covid hospitals. The bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia told the authorities to respond to the PIL within two weeks. The court ordered the case to be heard with the suo motu PIL on the issue of lockdown and Covid-19. This PIL was filed by ex-MLA from Jamalpur, Sabir Kabliwala, through advocate K R Koshti. He has urged the HC to direct the AMC not to denotify private hospitals, which were earlier designated as Covid hospitals where patients were provided free treatment on 50% of beds. Kabliwala has told the court that the authorities should be directed to act in public interest according to their policy adopted on April 16, 2020. Under the policy, the civic body was to bear the cost of treatment for Covid-19. The AMC had designated private hospitals as Covid hospitals and had reserved beds for patients who wanted to avail of free treatment in the AMC’s quota. Later, as the Covid cases fell, the authorities denotified these hospitals. However, with the recent surge, the AMC has once again reserved 20% of beds in private hospitals and has announced free treatment on them. During the hearing, the judges were inclined to seek a response on this matter in four weeks, but advocate Koshti pleaded for urgency. “Your two words could save lives of many people,” the advocate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/respond-to-pil-on-free-covid-care/articleshow/82169000.cms||---

Despite an increase in production, supply chain still has many issues. I had to recently approach both Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar district authorities when a consignment of cylinders from Gandhinagar district was stopped from entering Ahmedabad,” said a hospital owner here. Meanwhile, Civil Hospital alone is using 55 MT of oxygen a day with over 2,200 patients. The hospital authorities said that in the past fortnight, 764 MT of oxygen was used. “Compared to 13 MT supply in March, in April the average daily supply needed is 55 MT, a four-fold increase,” said an official. The authorities added that along with a liquid oxygen tank at the 1,200-bed hospital, a separate 20,000-litre tank has also been installed at Manjushree campus. Another 20,000-litre tank is installed on Civil campus. Officials said patients on nasal cannula need up to 4 litres, ventilator masks 6 to 8 litres and NRBM mask 10 to 12 litres of oxygen per minute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/with-28k-patients-in-city-oxygen-use-soars/articleshow/82168969.cms||---

But not anymore. Since Monday, AHNA has stopped receiving the stock of remdesivir, an anti-viral drug. So anxiety confronts Covid patients under home quarantine who are looking for remdesivir injections. “The last stock of the injections was received on Sunday. After that we have not been given a single vial,” said Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president, AHNA. “The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not supplied injections to AHNA citing a shortage.” Dr Gadhvi said that ideally AHNA should be made the nodal agency for distributing remdesivir to home-quarantined patients. Mukesh Kumar, the municipal commissioner of Ahmedabad, said: “Guidelines of the WHO for the usage of remdesivir are very clear and must be followed.” He went on to say: “As laid out in the guidelines, the patients should not be at home but at hospital. We have settled the issue with AHNA about the new guidelines.” Meanwhile, the shortage of remdesivir prevailed, affecting patients who are at hospitals as well as those who are under home quarantine. “The demand is at least 10-fold of the stock we’re receiving and we are compelled to turn people away or to ask them to inquire the next day,” said Jaivik Shah, partner at a specialty medicine stockist. “Not enough stock of remdesivir is being moved for trade supply.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-remdesivir-supply-for-home-quarantined-patients/articleshow/82168952.cms||---

The groups have connected with housing societies for doorstep delivery of vegetables and they are getting positive feedback from citizens.The farmers’ groups usually organise weekly vegetable-fruit markets in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad to provide farm-fresh produce to citizens within their areas.Narendra Pawar, who has been heading one such farmers’ group under Samarthas Farmer Market, said that they have received a good response from housing societies for home deliveries. Pawar said that though the delivery to individual customers was always possible, they would now concentrate on bulk orders from housing societies that will be beneficial for farmers and citizens.“We will see if housing societies can place a bulk order with us. We will deliver the order to the society at the entry gate. Society members can distribute the vegetables and fruit by themselves. Good quality produce will be available at affordable price,” Pawar said.He added that around 1,000 farmers are attached to the weekly markets and there is a team of around 700 people for transport and delivery. Meanwhile, local vegetable-fruit vendors are also opting for home delivery options. Aslam Shaikh, a vegetable vendor, said that he has been delivering vegetables to local customers since last month. “Customers place the order over the phone and the items are delivered by evening or by next morning,” Shaikh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/farmers-groups-see-rise-in-doorstep-distribution-queries/articleshow/82168960.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Ahmedabad||Corona battle heat melts ice cream sales in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Ice cream makers’ joy from a turnaround has turned out to be short-lived as ice cream sales have again plummeted due to restrictions imposed — officially and voluntarily — to check the intense spread of Covid-19. Ice cream sales had eroded completely during the last summer season in the wake of the lockdown and the subsequent curbs implemented to control the pandemic. Ice cream manufacturers, however, were upbeat about a good season this year with their sales growing in February and till the middle of March. Much to their disappointment, the massive surge in Covid-19 cases and the re-introduction of curbs have again brought ice cream sales to their bottom levels. According to industry players, ice cream sales have dropped due to the measures —night curfews and the voluntary shutdown of shops and markets — put in place to break the chain of coronavirus transmission. With people remaining mostly indoors due to the fear of catching the infection, ice cream sales have currently fallen to only 10-15%. “Sales were good in February and March this year. However, the situation has again worsened for the ice cream industry. Sales have dropped to 10-15% only,” said Rajesh Gandhi, managing director, Vadilal Industries Limited, one of the top ice cream manufacturers in India. Summer months of March, April, May and June account for 60% of the annual ice cream sales. Most importantly, about 50% of ice cream sales in a day take place from evening till midnight. “Ice cream makers are hit hard as sales have dried up again. The current situation is very bad,” said Bhupat Bhuva, chairman, Gujarat Ice Cream Association, a trade body of small and medium-sized ice cream manufacturers in the state. Preparations for summer begin one to two months before the onset of the peak season with ice cream manufacturers placing orders for raw materials and other ingredients. “Several ice cream makers, especially smaller ones, are facing liquidity problems as their working capital has been blocked due to placing of orders before the season,” said Bhuva.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/corona-battle-heat-melts-ice-cream-sales-in-gujarat/articleshow/82168988.cms||---

Many wine shops in Pune began delivering liquor to consumers on Tuesday under a strict SOP, sources from Pune District Wine Merchants Association said. A source from the association told TOI, “On April 14, the PMC and PCMC had allowed home delivery of liquor by wine shops in their jurisdiction. However, those who tried to home deliver after that faced some issues from the police. The excise department then asked liquor vends to wait for a formal order by the district collector. On Tuesday, the Pune district administration gave a go ahead to liquor home delivery from wine shops after state government gave its nod via a notification on the same day.” Earlier this month, the state government had only allowed home delivery from bars as per the time window provided in local orders for restaurants and bars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-nod-to-home-delivery-of-liquor/articleshow/82168977.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Nagpur||Fadnavis slams MVA govt over Remdesivir discrimination, hails HC decision||NAGPUR: Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday slammed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) for discrimination in Remdesivir distribution, particularly for Nagpur division. Speaking to the media during his visit to the vaccination centres in his Southwest constituency, the former chief minister hailed the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court’s orders to the Maharashtra government to immediately send 10,000 vials of Remdesivir injection to Nagpur district by Tuesday 8pm. “There was a big discrimination in the distribution of this essential drug. Some powerful ministers were drawing excess stocks for their constituencies in cities like in Mumbai. The government must ensure fair and equitable distribution to all. Ideally, they should distribute the medicines where the number of patients is more. It wasn’t happening and therefore, the court needed to interfere.” He quoted examples that on few days, the district received very less Remdesivir stocks and one day, not a single one, despite the fact that thousands of critical patients needed it. Deliberating on the ongoing lockdown imposed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray government till April 30, Fadnavis said the coronavirus continued to wreak havoc despite all measures taken by the administration and therefore, the government needed to think on revising the strategy and implement new measures. 24x7 toll free helpline opened for Covid patients Southwest MLA Devendra Fadnavis opened a helpline — 08929908958 — and support centre for the coronavirus patients on Wednesday. It was set up in a joint venture with RSS promoted Sevankur NGO comprising many doctors and medical students, who will render their service free of cost. “The Covid patients are more in panic nowadays. They will get medical advice from the experts and also the psychological help if needed. They will also get assistance for bed arrangements and medicine availability. A cardiac ambulance service would start from Thursday for the needy patients. Offices of me and Union minister Nitin Gadkari would also coordinate with the helpline office-bearers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fadnavis-slams-mva-govt-over-remdesivir-discrimination-hails-hc-decision/articleshow/82168947.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Nagpur||Solemn duty to protect lives of citizens: HC reminds govt||NAGPUR: Concerned over deaths due to Covid-19 and unavailability of beds, oxygen and medicines, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court reminded the Maharashtra government about its obligation to save them. “At this juncture, we must point out that it is the state’s solemn duty to save and preserve precious life of every citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. We would be failing in our duty if we do not remind the government of this solemn obligation by doing whatever is possible for it today in this direction,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak said. While hearing a suo motu PIL based on TOI reports of bed shortage, the bench pointed out the spike in Covid-19 cases witnessed in Nagpur is of the steepest kind, not seen even during the first phase of pandemic last year. “We all agree that urgent steps are required to be taken. In this direction, some of the suggestions have been given by amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar, senior counsel MG Bhangde, government pleader Ketki Desai and counsel for the respective parties.” Warning the medical and paramedical personnel, and also institutions and organizations, to join duties to contain Covid-19 pandemic after being requisitioned by the government, the bench warned them of action. “All of them are duty bound to obey the directives passed by the nodal authorities with immediate effect. We would like to warn them that if any names of the defiers are supplied, this court would not hesitate to take necessary action, including contempt of lawful authority and also issuing punitive orders.” The warning came after the collector and NMC commissioner informed that even though specific orders have been issued by them as nodal authorities under the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act, requisitioning services and facilities for the purpose, the orders are not being strictly complied with by some medical and paramedicals personnel, institutions and organizations. This is affecting the quality of healthcare being provided by medical fraternity under their supervision. “We must remind such reluctant or disobedient service providers and duty renderers that if they do not comply with the orders, they would be failing in their constitutional obligation and doing so at their peril, inviting coercive action against them. However, considering the present situation and ordinary human difficulties, HC would be the last one to resort to any coercive measure against any reluctant or disrespectful personnel, institutions and organizations,” the judges said, adding that they wouldn’t be punishing them at this juncture. Reminding the doctors working or posted in government hospitals about their duties, the judges said everyone is duty bound to meet the obligation and give medical assistance for preservation of life. “No law or state action can intervene to avoid or delay the discharge of paramount obligation cast upon the medical profession members. The obligation to preserve life being total, absolute and paramount, laws of procedure whether in statute and or otherwise, which would interfere with its discharge, can’t be sustained and must, therefore, give way to whatever is conducive to saving and preservation of precious human life,” they said. Collector, NMC to verify condition of 4 hosps The HC directed collector and NMC chief to verify conditions of ESIC and three Ayurveda hospitals on whether they could be converted to treat Covid-19 patients. The total capacity of all these four establishments is 450. The suggestion in this regard came from IMA counsel Bhanudas Kulkarni. “On being satisfied that these hospitals can be made functional, those should be started for treating coronavirus patients by Wednesday evening and a report shall be placed before this court,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/solemn-duty-to-protect-lives-of-citizens-hc-reminds-govt/articleshow/82169029.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Goa||Mutant Covid strain likely to be afffecting younger people: Dean||Panaji: Goa Medical College (GMC) dean and in-charge of Covid hospitals in the state, Dr S M Bandekar said it is suspected that the mutant strain is responsible for raising the infectivity rate. As a result, many young patients — less than 45-years old — are presenting with bad pneumonia despite not suffering from any comorbid condition, he said. “While earlier it was believed that Covid-19 afflicts mostly the elderly having comorbidities. This is no more the case. We see a lot of young patients (not children) with bad pneumonia. I think it is the mutant strain,” Bandekar said. Till date, four strains — the UK, US, double-mutant Maharashtra strain and a regular one — have been detected in the state. Reports of some samples are still awaited from the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. Over the last three days, 54 people have died due to Covid-19, with several of them in the age bracket of 40 to 50 and mostly with no comorbidities. More than 2,000 people have tested positive in the last two days. Among the 26 casualties reported over the last 24 hours was a 34-year-old from Sattari without any history of comorbidity. He was detected with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and died within three days of admission. Bandekar said patients are also presented late, leading to complications. Three who succumbed to the virus shortly after their admission were rushed to a hospital in a critical state, while one died on arrival. Barring two patients, the average hospital stay of 24 people, who died over the last 24 hours, was three days. On an average, a Covid patient takes about two weeks to recover if brought to a hospital before major complications set in, a senior doctor said. “People have taken Covid-19 very lightly and they are not willing to get tested until they fall very sick and in the meantime the infection is passed on to others in their family as well as those who come in contact with them. This is the height of irresponsibleness on the part of people,” the doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mutant-covid-strain-likely-to-be-afffecting-younger-people-dean/articleshow/82169935.cms||---

The body was found buried in a plot of land near a laterite quarry, which is 200m away from the house of the missing woman. Subeera Farhath (21), daughter of Kabeer K, had gone missing 40 days ago and police investigations were going on in the case. Farhath, who was working in a dental clinic at Vettichira, was last seen on the morning of March 10 when she had left her home to go to her work place. However, she did not reach the clinic. Residents got suspicious on seeing a small heap of soil in the land on Tuesday afternoon and informed the police. Valanchery police said that they were able to find a portion of the body when they removed the earth using a JCB. “We have not fully recovered the body as it had turned dark by the time we found a portion of the buried body. We will exhume the body on Wednesday in the presence of forensic experts,” said inspector of police at Valanchery Shemeer PM. Meanwhile, police have taken a resident into custody in connection with the case. District police chief Sujithdas S, Tirur deputy SP KA Suresh Babu inspected the spot and police personnel have been deployed in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/body-found-suspected-to-be-of-missing-woman/articleshow/82169027.cms||---

Sources close to the development said that the office-bearers could not meet the officials. The primary bone of contention was discontinuation of remdesivir supply by AMC. Members said that the move will only increase burden on already stretched hospital infrastructure. The hospitals’ body also claimed that the AMC did not respond to their earlier letter of April 15. ‘Supply of oxygen to all the hospitals should be made available in the required quantity and in reasonable time. If there is an unfortunate event, who would be responsible?’ mentioned the letter. The letter also mentioned that majority of the Covid-designated hospitals have not received pending payments by AMC. The hospitals also requested advance payment of Rs 15 lakh to 25 lakh as financial support. The letter also raised the issue of AMC-requisited beds. ‘In the current scenario, it is unjustifiable to keep beds vacant for want of sufficient number of AMC-referred patients.’ mentioned the letter. ‘No patient who has been admitted as private self-paying patient should be converted to AMC-paid patient. This has happened in the past,’ mentioned the letter. The AHNA members said that the hospitals have been together in fight against Covid for the past one year and resolution of the issues would only boost their morale during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahna-to-amc-resolve-meds-oxygen-issues/articleshow/82169047.cms||---

Talking about the Centre’s decision to allow state governments and private hospitals to procure vaccines directly from manufacturers, he said Bharat Biotech would need Centre help to supply vaccines to states and private hospitals as Centre has blocked production capacity and left states to figure it out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-data-against-double-mutant-soon/articleshow/82169014.cms||---

Among the list of 32 approved kits, three are being manufactured in Gujarat. The kits meet the acceptance criteria of sensitivity and specificity, according to ICMR. The test kits have been validated as a Point of Care Test (POCT) as well as for the laboratory setup with samples collected in Viral Transport Medium (VTM). Till date, ICMR has validated 91 antigen-based rapid test kits, including 16 revalidated kits, a press release of ICMR said. The three companies from Gujarat whose kits have been validated are LabCare Diagnostics, Premier Medical Corporation, Valsad and Meril Diagnostics, Vapi. Among the several guidelines mentioned by ICMR, one is that a false negative test result may occur if the level of antigen in a sample is below the detection limit of the test or if the sample was collected or transported improperly. ICMR guidelines emphasize that a negative test result did not eliminate the possibility of Covid infection. “Individuals with CT values greater than or equal to 34 are unlikely to have replication-competent virus. Negative results from patients with symptom onset outside of one to five days of symptom onset should be treated as presumptive,” ICMR said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/icmr-nod-for-32-new-rat-kits/articleshow/82169040.cms||---
---||Lucknow||CMO & ICCC out of sync, Covid patients in lurch||Lucknow: When several patients, who were allotted beds by the Integrated Covid Command Control Centre (ICCC) and chief medical officer’s (CMO) office, reached hospital they were told by staff that no bed is available. In some of these cases, patients, who had proper referral from the CMO, were told by doctors that the Covid portal does not show that a bed has been allotted to them in their hospital. The patients had no option but to return to their homes. A few unfortunate ones lost their breath at the hospital gates itself. After two days of wait, a resident of Rajajipuram Ravindra Kumar (61) finally got the referral from the CMO office for two hospitals run by private medical education institutes. But when the family reached the two Covid facilities with the patient, it was told that the CMO office may have allocated the bed, but they have not communicated it to them. “My father tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday morning. When his blood oxygen level started dropping drastically by the evening, we made several SOS calls to ICCC and other Covid helplines with no response. With the help of some contacts, we communicated our distress situation to senior administrative officers, but no help came,” said Ravindra’s daughter. “Finally, after two days of waiting, on Tuesday morning, we got a message from the ICCC that my father can be admitted either at a hospital in Chowk or another on Kursi Road. We first went to the Chowk hospital, but were told no bed was available. After waiting for three hours, we then went to the hospital on Kursi Road, but there too got the same response,” she added. “After five hours of waiting, when the ambulance driver told us that oxygen in the vehicle is about to exhaust, we brought him back home. Later, in the afternoon we got another call from the Chowk hospital asking us to bring the patients as a bed is available, but on reaching there we were told that it has been reserved for a VIP. Now we are back home again and at the mercy of god,” she said. Similarly, after the blood oxygen level of Om Prakash Verma (76), a resident of Eldeco Udyan 2, dropped to 40% on Monday night, his family made fanatic attempts to hospitalise, but refused from everywhere. Distress calls to ICCC, CMO office and district administration officers went in vain. At this, the family somehow arranged an oxygen cylinder for the patient at home and with the help of a cop consulted a doctor who taught them how to administer oxygen and prescribed some medicines. “On Tuesday morning, we got a call from the ICCC that a bed has been allocated at KGMU, but when we went there, the staff told us that no bed was available. The ICCC allocated the bed without verifying from the hospital,” Verma’s nephew told TOI. The family then contacted some media persons who helped Verma to get a bed in a hospital in Barabanki. CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar was not available for comments. District administration officers also refused to go on record.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cmo-iccc-out-of-sync-covid-patients-in-lurch/articleshow/82169942.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Screens to go blank again from today in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Film theatres in Telangana will be closed from Wednesday. The decision was taken by film distributors and exhibitors who held a virtual meeting following the state government imposing night curfew. “Theatres will be closed till the end of the month. This decision on the part of the film industry is voluntary, owing to the increase in Covid-19 cases,” P Vijendar Reddy, secretary, Telangana State Film Chamber of Commerce, told TOI. However, screening of the recently-released Pawan Kalyan-starrer ‘Vakeel Saab’ will continue. This is because of the agreements that have already been signed between distributors and exhibitors to run the film. The film industry will take stock of the situation and decide on whether to open theatres depending on government decisions. Film shootings will also take place only in ‘emergency situations’ as the Telugu Film Producers Council has described. TFPC honorary secretaries T Prasanna Kumar and Mohan Vadlapatla said even if the shootings take place, they will follow Covid-19 protocols, and there will not be more than 50 persons on the sets. Because of the rising cases, two big-budget films, which were scheduled to release have been postponed. Another six big-budget films are said to be in the pipeline. According to industry sources, if producers choose to release their films even in this situation reducing the number of shows and following protocols, theatres may consider it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/screens-to-go-blank-again-from-today/articleshow/82169049.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Mumbai||Mumbai’s fatality rate much lower than Delhi’s: BMC chief||MUMBAI: Seeking to put to rest the fears of Mumbaikars as the city sees a high number of Covid cases every day, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday said that since the second wave began, the case fatality rate (CFR) in the city has been 0.3%. This, he said, was much lower than Delhi’s CFR of 1.41%. Civic data shows 947 Covid deaths were reported in the city in the 68 days between February 11 and April 19, while the total number of patients in this period has been 2,66,105. “The city reported around 7,000 cases on Tuesday, showing that there has been a decline in the last five days. Also, 87% of cases reported on Tuesday are asymptomatic. Our doctors, availability of all medicines and our healthcare mechanism are the reasons the fatality rate has been low,” Chahal said. In many first-wave hotspots in the city too, the fatality rate has been lower, officials said. For instance, in Worli Koliwada, which is again seeing a surge in cases, there have been only two deaths reported since March, they said. Similarly, Dharavi, which reported over 200 deaths between April and July last year, had only five deaths in February and four in March. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G North ward which covers Dharavi, said asymptomatic cases are being traced sooner this time because of increased testing. “Therefore, we have been able to trace positive patients before they turn serious or have any complications,” he added. In Dharavi, Dighavkar said that they are tracing more random cases than through contact tracing. Another senior BMC official said private medical practitioners now have set protocol to treat their patients. “This ensures that patients are treated before their condition deteriorates. Besides, BMC and other government hospitals now know much more on how to handle the crisis than last year. Of course, the large number of positive cases daily is placing a burden on them,” the official said. Parel-based general physician Dr Jeevan Jain said he has so far virtually treated almost 15,000 patients. “The first wave taught us a lot, and although the second wave is much more dangerous and infectious, we are able to treat patients virtually. We start treatment by sending them a detailed message on what they must follow and what medication is advised. They are also asked to send videos of their oxygen levels and body temperature.

But as the pandemic has been brought under control in many parts of the world, India’s diamond industry has achieved remarkable growth in the export figures. The export of cut and polished diamonds from India clocked the highest monthly figures, over last two years, in March. After weathering the lockdown and increasing numbers of Covid-19 cases among the diamond workers, the export of polished diamond in March alone was over US$1603 million, according to the figures of Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC). The industry suffered a setback, like other sectors, during the first two quarters of the previous financial year due to the lockdown. But the third quarter onwards, the export of polished diamonds has been consistently on the up. Due to the increase in the exports in second half, the loss faced during the first half was recovered and the year-on-year growth remained a marginal negative 4.7%. “As soon as the lockdown was lifted, the industry strived hard. Right now there is a balance in import-export ratio,” said regional chairman of GJEPC Dinesh Navadiya. “As the pandemic is under control in our export markets of USA, China and European countries due to medication and vaccination, the demand for diamond jewellery has also increased,” he added. Along with cut and polished diamonds, the demand for lab-grown diamonds has also increased overseas. The industry exported lab-grown diamonds worth over US$704 million in financial year 2020-21 registering a growth of 67.21%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/diamond-industry-ends-fy-with-highest-monthly-export-in-2-yrs/articleshow/82167997.cms||Jay Pachchigar

A circular issued by Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable mentioned that papers of major subjects like BA, BCom, BSc, BBA, BCA and others were being postponed. The new dates would be conveyed to the students once the situation becomes conducive for the exams, he said. “It was becoming difficult for the students to come to colleges to collect their hall tickets due to curfew. Without it, they can’t proceed, as it contains login Id and password to appear in the online exams,” Sable told TOI. The first semester exams were scheduled to commence from April 24 and 26, which is NU’s fourth phase. It has so far completed the first two phases and a majority of third phase’s papers. “Sending the examinees to collect hall tickets to the colleges was also risky as many college staff have turned positive and may spread infection. Even many employees from NU Exam Section have contracted the virus, including those from our helplines. With a view to avoid further complications, we have decided in larger interests of the students,” the director said. Sable added the decision on rescheduling these papers would be taken after observing the situation on May 1 and also considering the Maharashtra government’s directives. “The students from interior or rural areas faced another problem of appearing in the exams, as they use internet cafes to avoid connectivity issues. With closure of these cafes, they would find it difficult to appear in papers. We have over 20,000 students appearing in BA first year papers,” he said. Cancelled papers – * First semester – BA, BSW, BCA, BCom, BSc, BSc (IT), BSc (Home Science), BBA (CBS), BCCA, & Bachelor of Cosmetic Technology * Third semester – BArch (CBS), BALLB (CBS-five-year course)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-wave-forces-nu-to-defer-12-exams/articleshow/82167992.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Dehradun||Private bus operators in Dehradun announce to increase fare from today after state government asks them to ply with 50% seating capacity||DEHRADUN/MUSSOORIE: While the state transport department is issuing compulsory advisories for following social distancing and sanitisation in buses, the stage carriage operators have announced to increase fares from Wednesday. The decision has been taken in view of the government’s decision to run buses with 50% seating capacity. On the other hand, the city bus operators claimed half of the buses are not even working as there are no passengers. Dehradun Mahanagar City Bus Seva Mahasangh president Vijay Vardhan Dandriyal told TOI, “The government has imposed SOPs for running buses with 50% capacity, but there is no decision on raising the fares. The situation is becoming worse as running our business is getting very difficult.” In addition, the state transport department is also conducting a special drive to check social distancing in public transport like tempo. On Monday, the department had seized six tempos for not following social distancing among the passengers. Meanwhile, a day after Delhi announced lockdown till April 26 and migrant workers rushed to return to their native places on whatever mode of transport they could avail, several residents of Tehri Garhwal and Uttarkashi districts alleged that they were charged double the usual fare from places like Dehradun and Chamba to their villages. Pradeep Rana, a resident of Sem village in Tehri Garhwal, said, “Bus fare from Dobrapul to Chamba (in Tehri Garhwal district) is around Rs 40 but I was charged Rs 90 by a private bus. When passengers confronted the driver about it, they were asked to get off.” He added that buses were not following the state guideline on keeping the occupancy at maximum 50%. “If the vehicles are overcharging to compensate for reduced occupancy, they have absolutely no grounds for it. All passengers are huddling together in buses, there is no shadow of social distancing,” Rana said. “I was charged double fare from Chamba to Uttarkashi on Tuesday morning and upon questioning the bus operator told that the fares have increased. The fare is usually Rs 190 but we were charged Rs 300,” said Roshan Lal, a resident of Uttarkashi who was returning from New Delhi. “Aware of the urgency of people to get home, even local jeep operators have doubled their fares. For instance, the fare from Chamba to Mussoorie is Rs 140 and the jeeps are now charging Rs 250,” said Surendra Rawat, a resident of Chamba. Sandeep Saini, RTO (enforcement) said, “The matter (of fare hike of stage carriage operators) has been sent to the government for its approval. We are keeping a check on the fares being charged by bus operators. Meanwhile, we are conducting awareness drives for passengers as well as bus operators and auto-rickshaw drivers and distributing stickers for the same.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/private-bus-operators-in-doon-announce-to-increase-fare-from-today-after-state-govt-asks-them-to-ply-with-50-seating-capacity/articleshow/82168012.cms||Anmol Jain

An operation has been launched to rescue the animal. The tigress T2-C1 is from the second litter of park’s dominant female T2. It was noticed having a snare on its leg in Mathni area by patrolling staff on April 18. “There is an injury in the left front leg. The snare, suspected to be of either steel wire or a nylon rope, is still tied to its leg,” said Subhash Puranik, division forest officer (DFO), Pandharkawda. “A search has been launched with the help of a wildlife veterinarian, a WII researcher and other field staff. Yesterday, the tigress was in our vicinity but escaped. We will soon rescue the animal,” Puranik told TOI. On March 21, 2021, a 5-year-old tigress had died after getting its neck entangled in a wire snare in Ghonsa in Maregaon range under Pandharkawda. The 148sqkm Tipeshwar sanctuary has a history of people laying snares to kill animals but no lessons have been learnt, activists said. They called for regular de-snaring drives in the fringe areas. These snares are mostly laid by villagers to poach deer, wild boar, and chitals for meat. Tigers get caught in them with tragic consequences. There are 14 villages bordering the sanctuary. This is the fourth recorded case in Tipeshwar of a tiger getting entangled in wire snare. On November 22, 2011, a three-year-old tiger had died after getting entangled in a snare near Bodh Bahattar village. A full-grown tigress (T4) was found with a wire snare in the neck on September 11, 2017. T4 moved around with the snare for 18 months and died in the sanctuary on March 18, 2019, during an attempt to capture it by forest staff. Another tiger T1-C3 was found injured with a snare around its legs in the core area of Pilkhan on May 29, 2019. It was rescued by WII experts. DFO Puranik said, “We have decided to suspend grants to eco-development committees (EDCs) in villages involved in such illegal acts. I have already issued notices to some EDCs. We have benefitted these villages with several government schemes and the distribution of LPG. Yet, villagers laying snares and also indulging in starting forest fires is unacceptable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/op-on-to-rescue-tigress-with-wire-snare-in-tipeshwar/articleshow/82169056.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: This was Mahatma Gandhi’s SOP for the 1920 influenza||AHMEDABAD: On 14 March 1920, when the influenza pandemic raised its ugly head for the second consecutive period, Mahatma Gandhi, a senior member of the Gujarat Sabha back then had set up the Gujarat Sabha Epidemic Relief Fund. A detailed SOP was published in Bapu’s journal Navajivan. But most of all Bapu urged neighbours and citizens to help each other during the pandemic and reach out to and help them manage the disease. Under this programme, Bapu had recruited an army of volunteers to dispel myths about the influenza pandemic in the city and even brought out a 12-point task for citizens of Ahmedabad to act and cut the transmission of the disease. One may be surprised that a large part of the SOP has not changed in 100 years. Bapu's SOP included that family members should sleep in the open and maintaining adequate distance between beds and avoid sleeping in a room. The second being maintaining social distance and avoiding sitting in groups during normal course of the day. The third point was to ensure eating nutritious food. The fourth point being to avoid going too close to person who had fever. The sixth being isolate a person in a separate room within a house in quarantine. Bapu also warns that since the influenza patient's lungs are weak and swollen they should not be exposed to the winds and should be well protected even after recovery. Bapu also mentions how a patient's saliva droplets should not be allowed to dry on surfaces and their utensils should be kept separately and washed using adequate precaution. He also advocates the use of phenyl for disinfecting surfaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/this-was-bapus-sop-for-the-1920-influenza/articleshow/82169069.cms||---

While he bravery won millions of hearts, the man himself had to undergo the worst time of his life lying in hospital beds both in the city as well as in Chennai, waging his war with the virus unrelentingly for a 100 days. But that’s all in the past with the valiant doctor back to help Covid-19 patients again — this time with his convalescent plasma which he donated on Tuesday at New Civil Hospital. “Along with vaccine plasma therapy is helpful for treatment of Covid-19 patients. I appeal all those eligible to come forward for plasma donation,” said Mehta, who’s condition became critical when he removed his high flow nasal cannula while intubating a 71-year-old patient. Mehta was himself admitted in the ICU for 19 days then and had problems even in speaking due to breathlessness. But he gathered courage and intubated the patient to save his life. “Only anaesthetists can do incubation and Mehta saved the other patient’s life without caring for his own,” said his friend Dr Jayesh Thakrar, an anaesthetist. Despite being critically ill, Mehta remained without oxygen support for 10 minutes. He was initially stable but later his condition worsened and he was shifted to Chennai in an air ambulance. After treatment for 100 days Mehta recovered. “Dr Mehta did exemplary work as a doctor by saving the life of a patient despite being in critical condition last year. He has again come forward to donate plasma as a message for all to come forward for plasma donation,” said Dr Mayur Jarag, in-charge of NCH blood bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/doctor-who-fought-coronafor-100-days-donates-plasma/articleshow/82168008.cms||---

The cylinders are required because the oxygen-bed capacity is being enhanced at Samras hostel, and at LG, Shardaben, and VS hospitals. Each cylinder has the capacity of 70 litres and can sustain an individual for 33-34 hours, according to senior AMC officials. In a letter addressed to the AMC, RIL has requested that the cylinders be purged from the records of industrial use before being deployed at medical facilities, as mandated by a government notification. A few days ago, the AMC had placed a requisition for 1,400 cylinders. Earlier, Gujarat Congress leader Amit Chavda had written to RIL requesting it to spare a few industrial cylinders for various cities in Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ril-gives-250-industrial-oxygen-cylinders-to-amc/articleshow/82169064.cms||---

But the boost in trade is not translating into profits as businessmen’s margins have dropped due to the price cut by mask manufacturers in other states. The city businessmen are, however, okay with the situation as it will let them dispose of their old unsold stocks before starting new production.Vinod Thapar, chairman of Knitwear Club, said, “Earlier, when coronavirus cases were decreasing, people had started taking the mask rule lightly. As a result, units were left with huge unsold stocks. Amid the second Covid wave, the mask use has increased and so have their sales. City manufacturers are clearing their old stocks first. There is also huge local demand for masks, especially the three-ply ones which are lying in lakhs with every manufacturer and even trader.”Harish Kairpal, PPE suit and mask manufacturer, said, “Demand for all types of masks has once again gathered pace. But their sale price is very low due to drop in rates by manufacturers of other states. Though unable to make nominal profits, we are happy that at least we can dispose of our unsold stocks lying in our factories since last year.”Vinay, a chemist near Gill Road, said “Maximum demand is for three-ply mask. People prefer a pack of 100 or the box pack of individual masks. We are placing orders with local companies as they have ready stock with them and we can get as much quantity as we require the same day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/demand-for-masks-surges-but-not-profits/articleshow/82168001.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Ahmedabad||Attend to critical patients first: High Court directive to 108||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday asked the state government whether the EMRI 108 ambulance service has started attending Covid-19 patient on first-come, first-serve basis, and if so it said that not attending to critical patients first would not serve the purpose. During a hearing on the suo motu PIL on Covid-19, the bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia told government pleader Manisha Shah that the government should first verify information that the 108-ambulance service, under the new centralized system, has been attending to calls in queue and the seriousness of a patient is not taken into consideration. Earlier, the court had taken up this issue and mentioned the long waiting period for ambulances, which critical patients cannot afford “Verify the correctness of this, and if it is so, it is not serving the purpose. If somebody is critical they need to be attended to first,” the judges said. Earlier, the court had taken up this issue and mentioned the long waiting periods for ambulances, which critical patient cannot afford. The judge said that designated and government hospitals are not admitting Covid patients who come in private vehicles because 108-ambulances cannot attend to them. “If they come in private vehicle, why would the hospital not admit them? You can at least examine the patient and say that you do not need admission and you may go home,” the chief justice insisted on a proper response for all patients, many of whom are at present reportedly turned away. The state government asserted that beds for various types of patients are available, but still there is a clamour. The chief justice said that if the government figures are correct, why are there so much complaints that patients are not being admitted, though it is true that the type of bed depends on the condition of patient. “If this is the situation (beds are empty), why are people are running around finding sources and resources for recommendations for getting hospitals and treatment,” the CJ asked. To this, the government pleader said that such a situation has arisen because patients express a strong choice of hospital, and when beds are empty in AMC quotas and the hospitals are far from their homes, patients and their family members have reservations. To this, the CJ said that once a patient chose to get government help for treatment, it is not his or the attendant’s choice as to which hospital he is treated at. “If the government is providing beds, the choice cannot be insisted upon. If that complaint is coming, then the patient or attendant has to find a hospital on his own,” he said and opined that the government should not buckle under such pressure. The judges said they would pass an order soon and posted next hearing on April 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/attend-to-critical-patients-first-hc-directive-to-108/articleshow/82169084.cms||---
---||Mumbai||CM Uddhav Thackeray expected to announce strict lockdown across Maharashtra for 15 days||MUMBAI: Maharashtra is likely to face a strict lockdown for 15 days as Covid-19 cases in the state have continue to surge despite strict restrictions for a week. A demand for a complete lockdown was made by most ministers in the state cabinet meeting held on Tuesday, and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is likely to make an official announcement by addressing the state on Wednesday. The state government on Tuesday also added fresh curbs (reported by TOI in Tuesday’s edition), restricting the timings of grocery and other food shops to only four hours from 7am to 11am. However, home delivery from these shops has been allowed from 7am to 8pm, and local bodies have been given the authority to change home delivery timings. These restrictions came into force from 8pm on Tuesday and will be in force till 7pm on May 1. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said there was no option but to impose a strict lockdown. Officials said guidelines for a lockdown are being drafted, and restrictions on timings for essential shops will continue. Attendance in government offices may be reduced, and a ban on interdistrict travel is expected. Maharashtra will collapse if situation doesn’t improve, says ministerThe state government may impose a strict lockdown for 15 days. Officials said that at Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, there were suggestions regarding the shutting of public transport for the general public from some ministers, but that may not be feasible as many people step out for medical emergencies and even for vaccinations and rely on the use of public transport. A final call on this will be taken by Thackeray. Urban development minister Eknath Shinde said, “A demand for a complete and strict lockdown like last year’s was raised in the cabinet meeting, and the CM has agreed to it. Cases are going up rapidly and health infrastructure is proving inadequate. If strict steps are not taken, people will die on the streets without getting treatment.” He said with so many cases, Maharashtra was falling short of oxygen and was getting 300 MT from other states. “Even those states will stop giving us as cases are going up there as well,” Shinde added. Housing minister Jitendra Awhad said, “Ministers pressured the CM to announce a lockdown. There is a Covid-19 death in every other house in the state, and if the situation doesn’t improve, Maharashtra will collapse.” The data on the Covid spread in the state which was presented to the state cabinet reflected concerns raised by the ministers. Projections made by the state till May 2 show that most districts will have an acute shortage of beds , especially critical beds. It has been projected that Mumbai will have over 1.4 lakh active cases till May 2 if the cases continue to increase at the current rate, which is nearly twice the active cases today. Also, Mumbai will have a shortfall of over 6,000 oxygen beds, 1500 ICU beds and 121 ventilator beds. Cities like Nagpur and Pune have also been projected to have a massive shortage of beds. Tope said, “Imposing a strict lockdown is a must for the state. We will also be ramping up supply of oxygen, increasing bed capacity and boosting supply for Remdesivir.” He said another decision taken was that district collectors have been allowed to give orders to set up oxygen generators without having to wait for the tenders process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-will-collapse-if-situation-doesnt-improve-says-minister/articleshow/82169074.cms||Bhavika Jain

He was born in Mumbai, but had his roots in a village near Kharepatan in the Konkan. He started his career with theatre and also extended his acting chops to TV soaps, though it was his role in the film Vaastav that brought him fame. As news of his death spread, rich tributes from the film world and beyond poured in including from actors Prasad Oak and Siddharth Jadhav. Director Viju Mane said Nandlaskar was extremely polite and also happy-go-lucky. "In one movie, we had a dance sequence with other veteran actors Ramesh Deo and Viju Khote," Mane said. "He (Nandlaskar) took me aside and asked the age of (Deo) who was then 80. He (Nandlaskar) held my hand and with tears in his eyes asked if I would also make a song with him when he would turn 80!

The construction work of Outer Ring Road is going on at a fast pace. The entire stretch will be free of traffic signals and crossings which will ensure that no traffic congestion takes place. After the construction work is completed, the government plans to set up a new township here. “About 80% of the Outer Ring Road will be completed by December 2021 and by May 2022, the general public will get its benefits,” a senior official said. Outer Ring Road will solve the problem of traffic congestion in the city as heavy vehicles will no longer be required to enter Lucknow. Heavy vehicles will be able to reach Sitapur Road from Sultanpur Road via Ayodhya Road and Kursi Road without any traffic jam. Vehicles from Gorakhpur and Ayodhya will move to Sultanpur, Varanasi without entering the city. The 104-km long road will start and end at Kursi Road and is being constructed at the cost of Rs 5,500 crore. It will connect the city with five national, six state highways and104 villages. The Outer Ring Road will go from Bakshi-ka-Talab to Kanpur Road, enclosing the entire city. PWD and Setu Nigam have completed the 11-km long Kisan Path costing around Rs 280 crore. Once the Kisan Path is completed, heavy vehicles carrying material used in the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya will get an easy route. Vehicles carrying goods in heavy vehicles will reach Sultanpur Road in 15 minutes from Ayodhya highway via Kisan Path. Currently, it takes 45 minutes to reach here via Shaheed Path. Visiting Ram Temple in Ayodhya will also become easier for devotees. After the Outer Ring Road is ready, traffic on Shaheed Path will be reduced by up to 30%. The project will also open a new path of development for villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-to-inaugurate-kisan-path-next-month/articleshow/82169956.cms||---

A 77-year-old man at a residential complex off EM Bypass, who has diabetes and chronic heart ailments and advised oxygen support last week, was unable to source one. His son, a techie who had also developed Covid symptoms, called up over two dozen medical shops along EM Bypass and large parts of south east Kolkata but was unable to get a cylinder. “My father’s oxygen level was declining. But I just couldn’t get a cylinder. I even approached local nursing homes and the state health department’s telemedicine helpline but without success. Finally, an acquaintance who had an oxygen concentrator that was not being used came in handy,” said the 42-year-old man. According to pharmacies that stock oxygen cylinders in bulk and home healthcare service providers, the demand for oxygen cylinders and concentrators — a device that concentrates oxygen from gas by selectively removing nitrogen — is at an all-time high. “The demand for oxygen cylinders and concentrators has increased tremendously over the last one week. Even six days ago, there were around 40-50 queries per day and now, I receive more than 1,000 queries each day. But we have run out of stock. There are five major companies who supply medical oxygen and three of them are based in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Since there is even a higher spike in those areas, the entire oxygen is consumed in the home states, leading to the shortage,” said Aryan Shaw, a medical oxygen and oxygen equipment supplier in north Kolkata. Sajal Ganguly, a senior functionary of the Bengal Chemist and Druggist Association said, the dealer rates for cylinders and oxygen refilling has also increased manifold over the last few days. A number of companies and individuals have also started stocking cylinders for worse times, leading to the current crisis, he added. Like last year, this time, too, pulse oximeters — a device that is used for detecting hypoxemia or low blood oxygen level — are flying off the shelves, leading to a rapid demand-supply gap. Already priced double than last year, Germany- and India-made pulse oximeters are being sold at anything between Rs 2,000-Rs 5,000 at medical shops and online platforms while Chinese variants are available between Rs 1,200-Rs 1,500. Even the products that might not be meeting industry-specified medical standards are now being bought at a premium. “Last year, I had bought an oximeter online but it had developed snags soon after. After my wife and I both fell ill, I frantically tried to buy another oximeter but the online platforms weren’t delivering before at least seven days. I called five local shops after which I managed to buy an oximeter, that too for Rs 2,000, more than double at what I had paid last year,” said Arijit Roy, a resident of Behala. Some medical shops had stocked their shops after sensing the rapidly increasing demand but even the stocks are depleting fast. “We have six stores in Kolkata and have been selling anything between 25-30 pulse oximeters per day over the last few days. We are constantly in talks with our dealers to keep stocks ready,” said Somenath Ghos of Metro Pharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/oxygen-stock-running-out-of-breath-in-state/articleshow/82168024.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Report delivery time trebles as samples flood city labs||Kolkata: Labs across the city have started to feel the second wave Covid heat. With backlog mounting every with the sharp spike in the number of swab samples, some labs are taking as long as 72-86 hours to deliver results against the usual 24 hours. “My senior citizen mother had Covid symptoms and since three of us in the family had been in close contact. We all gave samples through the home collection service of a major lab. We had to wait for 72 long hours to get the reports. All of them were thankfully negative,” said Saumyajit Saha, a north Kolkata resident. From about 25,000 tests on April 1, the state currently is testing between 42,000 and 45,000 samples a day. Most private labs have pushed the capacity to their maximum. “We are overburdened. We cannot refuse people when they request for home collection or come to the lab. That is resulting in a backlog and the delay,” said a source from a private lab. Labs that are taking up major chunk of samples include Dr Lal Path Labs, Suraksha and SRL, where each are testing 1,000 to 2,000 samples. Labs attached with hospitals are some times testing beyond their capacity. Recently, an overworked RNA extractor machine at the Peerless Lab conked. “Our maximum capacity is 550 but on certain days, we running beyond it. During the peak last year, we would run about 350 samples a day. We will be getting a new automated RNA extractor soon. Then we would be able to run 200 additional samples,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri of Peerless Hospital. Even as some government-run labs have increased their capacity, they are still under-utilized, said sources in the health department. The lab at NICED with high through-put machines where about 4000 tests can be run in a day is currently testing between 1,000 and 1,200 samples. “Our lab has the capacity to run 4,000 tests a day. The lab is under-utilised given the number of samples we are getting currently, 50% of which are from central institutes. We had a meeting with KMC officials on Tuesday where they requested to take in about 500 samples daily from them. This will increase our productivity,” said ICMR-NICED director Shanta Dutta. Health department officials said labs attached with medical colleges in the city can run about 1,500 samples a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/report-delivery-time-trebles-as-samples-flood-city-labs/articleshow/82168059.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kochi||Vaiga murder: Cops take Sanu for evidence collection||Kochi: Though court has granted the custody of Sanu Mohan, who is accused of murdering his 13-year-old daughter Vaiga, to the police for 10 days, the investigation team is trying to resolve the confusion that arose from his contradictory statements. Though sources within Kochi police said that the accused has started cooperating with the investigation, it is learnt that the police plan to rush the evidence collection by recreating Mohan’s trail within and outside the state before the expiry of the custody period. On Tuesday, the accused was taken to different places within the city including the apartment complex in Kangarappady where he resided as part of evidence collection. The police also took him to the spot in Muttar River where he had reportedly dumped Vaiga’s body. “Evidence collection must be completed before the custody period expires and for that we may have to visit several places within and outside Kerala to recreate the trail of the accused. Material evidence is also crucial in strengthening the case. A credible explanation is yet to be found regarding the presence of alcohol inside Vaiga’s body,” said a top source. The accused was arrested from Karwar in Karnataka on Sunday after a manhunt that lasted nearly one month. On Monday, district police chief (Kochi City) CH Nagaraju had said that the accused contradicted his own statements several times. If he does not cooperate, evidence collection might not go as planned by the police, he had said. Police spent more than an hour at the accused’s residence on Tuesday to collect evidence. As per his statements, Mohan tried to smother Vaiga inside the flat before carrying her body on his shoulders to his car. The accused reportedly told the police about the sequence of events that happened at the flat. Later on Tuesday afternoon, police took him to the regulator-cum-bridge in Muttar River to know how he dumped his daughter’s body. Police are also keen on collecting digital evidence against the accused though he cleverly avoided the use of smartphones or ATM card while he was on the run. Sources said that police have seized a smartphone used by Mohan before he went into hiding. A search has been launched to recover other digital devices he had used. Meanwhile, police, who believe that Mohan acted alone, are likely to take the statements of his wife in the coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vaiga-murder-cops-take-sanu-for-evidence-collection/articleshow/82169101.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Talking to TOI, Kher, who is undergoing treatment in Mumbai, said her condition is better and that she is recovering fast. Due to the poor response of Covid-19 vaccination in the city, Kher said, “I appeal the residents of the city to come forward and get vaccinated.” “People in Chandigarh should not hesitate and get vaccinated. We all should work together in the fight against coronavirus. The vaccine facility is available in every hospital and dispensary,” said Kirron. On Covid-19 management in the city, she said she is in touch with UT administrator V P Singh Badnore, UT adviser Manoj Parida and BJP president Arun Sood. Recently, Chandigarh BJP president Arun Sood, during a special press conference, said the 68-year-old Bollywood actor-turned-politician was on the recovery path after her treatment for the disease started last year. “She had suffered a broken left arm at her Chandigarh house on November 11 last year. After her medical tests at the PGI, Chandigarh, she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. The disease had spread to her left arm and right shoulder. She then went to Mumbai on December 4,” Sood had stated. Kirron Kher’s husband and Bollywood actor Anupam Kher, in his recent message on Twitter, had said, “Just so rumours do not get the better of a situation, Sikander and I would like to inform everyone that Kirron has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. She is currently undergoing treatment and we are sure she will come out of this stronger than before. We are blessed that she is being looked after by a phenomenal team of doctors. She has always been a fighter and takes things head on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/battling-with-cancer-kirron-appeals-to-city-residents-to-get-jabbed-soon/articleshow/82169072.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

This demon considers all one,” said Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel while he was in the middle of the plague pandemic that had hit Borsad town. The book ‘Sardar Patel Ek Sinh Purush’ details the 1935 plague pandemic when Sardar Patel formed a team called the ‘Plague Nivaran Samiti’ to set up a makeshift hospital in Borsad. “Sardar had gathered 57 volunteers, including eight women for providing critical care to affected people in Borsad town. Interestingly, Sardar and his daughter Maniben did not opt for the immunity booster that was shipped from England,” says city-based historian Rizwan Kadri and the author of the book. When the pandemic began in Borsad town, Sardar had travelled to Bombay on March 23, 1935. One of the close associates of Sardar, Dr Bhaskar Patel had met him. “Sardar immediately asked Dr Bhaskar to meet an expert from John Hopkins Institute who was visiting Bombay back then. The idea was to gain the know-how into managing the pandemic and obtaining a detailed manual for medical protocols and standard operating procedure,” says Kadri. Sardar and his volunteers will travel 27 villages including the most affected areas like Borsad, Pandoli, Ankhlav, Bochasan, Dhabasi, Nava Rangipra, Bodal, Palaj, Vahera and Jeva villages where separate makeshift plague care centres were set up. Around 44 people were treated in these camps. “At the special plague care hospital in Borsad town, Sardar and his volunteers had taken care of 16 critical patients and of these, two had survived,” says Kadri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sardar-his-volunteers-visited-plague-hit-areas/articleshow/82169089.cms||---

On Tuesday, police officers visited areas frequented by people who go for walks or to exercise. They caught all found without masks and penalised them on the spot. On the other hand, the drive had dual purpose — officers too were ordered by the city police commissioner Ajay Tomar to go out for morning walks themselves to stay fit and also keep check on those moving around without masks. “To create awareness for masks we started taking steps from the daybreak. Hence, I asked my officers to go out and check morning walkers. They do this work while out for exercising and a team of cops on duty assists them,” Tomar told TOI. The drive surprised many who did not wear masks thinking that police will not check at such early hours. “People argued that that they have been walking in the open area and alone and so didn’t need a mask. However, many were seen walking in groups but not wearing masks,” said a police officer. “Police gave masks to those caught without it and penalised them as well. We will continue the drive and ensure that people wear masks while out,” Tomar added. City police are already registering offences against those found flouting quarantine rules based on complaints given by health officials. Those found roaming outside the containment area were booked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mask-penalty-starts-with-morning-walkers/articleshow/82168063.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

With the tests requiring to be done within 72 hours prior to departure, many flyers scheduled to travel to cities that require prior Covid test clearance have had to cancel their trips. “To travel to Port Blair, the RT-PCR test has to be conducted 48 hours prior to departure. For other cities like Ahmedabad, Baroda, Surat, Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior, Jabalpur, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur and Lucknow, the test needs to be done 72 hours before the flight departs. Given the current situation, travel to these cities and towns is in complete jeopardy as there is no certainty when the swab test will be done and when the result will be given," said Travel Agents' Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. The test is also essential for those travelling abroad. A test facility has been provided at the airport with a report assured in eight hours. However, there is no home swab collection facility and flyers need to go to the airport for the test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/delayed-cov-test-results-put-travel-plans-in-jeopardy/articleshow/82168025.cms||---

Nigrani samities or monitoring committees will play an essential role in breaking the Covid chain, the CM said, as they would help in monitoring isolated patients and ensuring that people don’t break the quarantine and educate people on getting vaccinated. “Migrant workers are returning from Delhi, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. They have to be tested when they arrive in UP and arrangements should be made for their quarantine and medical aid,” the CM said. To strengthen the ‘test, trace and treat’ system to curb infection, 59,000 monitoring committees are working in rural areas and 14,000 in urban areas and going door-to-door to identify those infected by the virus. This data is sent to the municipal corporation and health department for timely intervention and treatment. Lucknow Municipal Corporation has formed 110 ward monitoring committees, which are visiting homes of people in each ward daily and collecting information on their health. An official said, committees were asking people who arrived from outside and experiencing influenza-like symptoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/migrants-returning-to-up-to-be-tested-quarantined-cm/articleshow/82169993.cms||---

In a letter to the prime minister’s office (PMO), Kate said such a measure can help the government minimize economic damage caused by the outbreak. “Annually, CSR funds are collected from all corporate companies and are utilized under different heads. However, during this pandemic, the CSR funds should be streamlined for Covid-19 treatment and related welfare purposes,” Kate said. In order to motivate corporate firms to spend the CSR amount immediately, Kate said the government should give these companies certain tax benefits. “The corporate firms can be given weighted deductions under Income-Tax Act, 1962, or any local taxation upto 20% as an incentive,” he said. The Chamber of Marathwada Industries and Agriculture (CMIA) said corporate firms were already channelizing the funds for effective Covid management. “The need is to have adequate health infrastructure. Most of the firms in the region have spent their CSR funds on pandemic management,” CMIA secretary Satish Lonikar said. Meanwhile, Siemens Limited here provided critical diagnostics equipment for Covid-19 response to the Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/streamline-csr-funds-for-pandemic-management/articleshow/82169099.cms||---

According to sources, Sabir Mansur, 56, who was a section officer at civic body’s Varachha zone office, succumbed to the infection on Tuesday. “Till now, 32 SMC employees have died of Covid-19 since the coronavirus pandemic began last year. In 2020, 24 employees had died while eight employees died in the recent infection wave,” said an official.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Restricting shop timings will lead to more crowds’||MUMBAI: Householders, retailers and traders are anxious over the state government’s decision to restrict timings of shops from 7 am to 11 am. They pointed out that crowds may, in fact, increase during these hours, unlike previously, when footfalls were dispersed through the day. Police may find it difficult to manage the numbers. Citizens fear they will have to wait in queues at stores for milk, groceries and vegetables. “My wife and I both have recovered from Covid-19. Is it feasible to spend the morning hours lining up for essentials each day? At least earlier, we headed out in the afternoon when no crowds were present. And what if some infected person breaks home quarantine to join the queue?” asked a retired government servant from the western suburbs. Although home delivery has been permitted till 8 pm, shopkeepers said they will stop catering to small value orders. “With three delivery boys, we only sent orders worth upwards of Rs 150-200. Now the exodus of labour has caused a shortage of manpower, making home delivery difficult and not cost-effective. Two of my five workers have gone to the village, leaving just three to handle supplies, cash counter and delivery,” said a grocer from Andheri. Retailers’ federation president Viren Shah questioned the wisdom of having to summon staff for four hours a day. Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO of Retailers Association of India said, “Restricting timing may lead to crowding, which is a health risk. It may result in operational challenges, supply chain issues, panic buying and hoarding of essentials. Citizens also need clothing, hardware, electrical, household and kitchen items.”  The daily evolving norms make room for corruption too. “It will take much to convince me that we can curb Covid by grouping people together during concentrated hours. Night curfew also made little sense. It only helped police make a quick buck,” said Shailesh Pawar, a vendor in Khar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-restricting-shop-timings-will-lead-to-more-crowds/articleshow/82169118.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Lucknow||RSS gears up to help Covid-hit get beds in hospitals||Lucknow: Schools run by RSS Saraswati Shishu Mandirs and Saraswati Vidya Mandirs would be converted into isolation centres if the need arises. In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan these schools have already been turned into isolation centres to accommodate Covid-19 patients. Purvi Uttar Pradesh Kshetra Sewa Pramukh of RSS Naval Kishore said, “Prants have been given freedom to utilise resources at their end as per the requirement of the area concerned. Though the situation is under control in UP, we have our plan ready.” The RSS, central unit, has sought two names from every ‘prant’ that would work to provide full help to the needy if the Covid situation in the country plummets further. Purvi UP (east UP) ‘kshetra’ and pashchim UP (west UP) ‘kshetra’ have sent the list of names. Besides, each `prant’ has appointed key persons, who are RSS workers, in every district under its jurisdiction who would be contacted for help or who would facilitate things for people in need of medical aid or food while in isolation. ‘Prant’ is an administrative unit of RSS. There are 45 ‘prants’ in the country and UP has six. `Kshetra’, on the other hand, is a bigger unit of administration. The RSS has divided the country into eleven `kshetra’ and UP has two ‘kshetra’ ‘purvi UP’ and ‘pashchim UP’. “The ‘samitis’ have been formed. We have divided cities, especially the ones where the situation is critical into `nagars’ and formed a `samiti’ of `swayamsevaks’ who would help in every possible way,” said Sewa Pramukh, Awadh Prant, Purvi UP, Dr Devendra Asthana. Lucknow Mahanagar has been divided into 40 `nagars’. Gomtinagar is one `nagar’, while Indiranagar has been divided into three `nagars’ to make the outreach easy. Last year, all states had declared complete lockdown and requirements of people were different. “This time, there is no lockdown till now and people’s requirements are different,” said Prachar Pramukh, Purvi UP, Narendra Singh. The biggest emphasis is to develop a link of `swayamsevaks’ from the top most administrative unit till the grassroot level so that the machinery can immediately be put into action whenever the need arises. To keep the chain of workers active there is a constant conversation through phone and online medium. “So far, we have formed groups of allopathic, ayurvedic and homeopathic doctors who can be contacted for consultation by people. Their numbers have been publicised on social media. We had also held their `shivirs’ (camps) in the past. To get the right treatment is the biggest requirement of people,” said Kishore. RSS workers are helping people find beds, reach hospitals and vaccination centres, mainly those who are old and have no one to look after them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rss-gears-up-to-help-covid-hit-get-beds-in-hospitals/articleshow/82170033.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Kolkata||Vaccine schedule goes haywire for many as erratic supply forces centres to ration jabs||Kolkata: A senior citizen from Tollygunge, whose second dose of Covishield was due on April 16, was asked to come back after two weeks after the vaccination centre in south Kolkata ran out of vaccine. It was not an isolated case. Many inoculation centres in the city are now forced to curtail the number of second dose recipients as they complain of erratic supply of Covishield doses. About two weeks ago, some vaccination centres had to put a brake on the drive as the state faced acute shortage of Covishield doses. Though the supply has resumed now, it still is erratic. Coupled with this is the backlog of recipients whose appointment was due two weeks ago. “The supply is still erratic. We are trying to clear backlogs as soon as possible while taking in new appointments. That is why are requesting some of those whose second dose is pending to come after they get a call from us. It will take a few more days for the drive to be back on track,” said a source at a vaccination centre in south Kolkata. The supply of Covishield got better after the state received 4 lakh doses on April 12. After this, Bengal got an additional of 11 lakh Covishield and 2 lakh Covaxin doses. “The supply still remains inadequate. We are currently giving priority to second dose recipients so that they don’t miss out on the scheduled date,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, vaccination site supervisor at Beliaghta ID hospital. The health department officials have also told vaccination centres to prioritise those whose second dose is due. “To accommodate the maximum number of second dose recipients, we are currently not taking any fresh appointment for the first dose. Out of the 249 people vaccinated at our centre, only 60 were given the first dose as they had taken the appointment weeks ago,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. At three units of AMRI Hospitals, a total of 1,055 people were inoculated on Tuesday, many of them being administered the second dose. At its Dhakuria unit, Covaxin was also administered. “If it was not for the demand-supply gap, we have the capacity to administer 5 lakh doses a day. But currently, we are curtailing the pace of the drive so that we don’t run into a shortage again,” said a health department official. The last lot of vaccine vials arrived in Bengal on April 18, when the state got 2 lakh Covishield doses. The Centre has not intimated on when the next consignment will arrive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccine-schedule-goes-haywire-for-many-as-erratic-supply-forces-centres-to-ration-jabs/articleshow/82168065.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The boat and five fishermen on board were escorted by Navy personnel to Cochin Port early on Tuesday morning. The heroin was handed over to NCB that reportedly reached Kochi from Bengaluru on Monday. The vessel docked at Mattancherry wharf is now under surveillance. Sources said the crew members, all from Sri Lanka, were shifted to a secure facility in Kakkanad and their interrogation is underway. It is learnt that, central agencies like National Investigation Agency will be questioning them as the involvement of elements threatening national security were suspected in the case. Also, the spoils of narcotics trade feed syndicates involved in terrorism, radicalisation and criminal activities. “A detailed investigation is going on and the detainees are being interrogated. More central agencies will be questioning them in the coming days. The captured fishermen are mere peddlers and other details about the suppliers and receivers have to be collected. More details are unavailable as the probe is unfinished,” said a source in the Navy. Meanwhile, Navy and Coast Guard strengthened vigil at sea as the instances of drug seizures involving fishermen and fishing boats have increased over the past few months. There have been reports from intelligence agencies that the contraband originating from Makran Coast in Pakistan is being transported to Sri Lanka, India, Maldives and South Asian countries via the Arabian Sea. Maritime enforcement agencies consider the recent seizure made as a major setback to the international drug peddling mafia. “Navy and Coast Guard have been keeping an eye on suspicious fishing boats over the past few months. Based on the interception of communication between the drug mafia using secret channels, we get tips about drug peddling. The fishermen are expendable peddlers who just obey orders of the kingpins for money. Peddling via sea route from Makran is routine as it reduces the possibility of getting caught. But, with increased surveillance and patrolling at sea, we expect to make more seizures in the coming days,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/navy-hands-over-detained-fishermen-heroin-to-ncb/articleshow/82169119.cms||---

The deceased has been identified as Shaikh Aamir, who resided near Dargah Masjid in Naregaon area of the city. As per the police records, he had five offences including theft and arms act registered against him at MIDC Cidco police of Aurangabad city. Karmad police have registered a case of murder and destruction of evidence against unidentified suspects. After carrying out panchanama, the body was moved to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), where an autopsy was performed after which the body was handed over to the family. Karmad police station inspector Santsh Khetmalas told TOI, “We received information about the body at around 8.15 am, following which we carried out a panchnama. We suspect the murder to be the result of personal enmity.” Police, citing the inputs from the local residents, said that he would often remain under the influence of liquor and had the image of being “very aggressive” in his locality. The officer said that the suspects who murdered, appear to have first slit his throat, following which they poured some flammable substance before setting the body on fire. The body only got partially burnt, he said. In a bid to crack the case, Karmad police have zeroed down a suspect, while local crime branch which is conducting a parallel probe has detained two suspects. An officer from the city police said that owing to Aamir’s alleged involvement in criminal activities a preventive action was proposed against him in August last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/200421-criminal-found-brutally-murdered/articleshow/82169116.cms||Mohammed Akhef

According to police, the deceased, Priyanka Kshirsagar, has left behind a suicide note stating that no one should be blamed for her extreme step.

---||Mumbai||Now, Maharashtra’s smaller cities show higher rate of death||MUMBAI: A look at Tuesday’s Covid-19 death log in the state shows that smaller cities are worse hit than the bigger ones. While the Mumbai administrative circle registered 115 deaths and 16,202 cases, the Nashik circle recorded 116 despite having only half the cases at 8,601, which was indicative of a higher death rate among patients coming for treatment. In Solapur city, 45 deaths were recorded along with 250 cases. A state official said there was a delay in updating the toll. “Of the 519 deaths reported, 307 occurred in the last 48 hours and 114 in the last week. The rest of the 98 deaths correspond to the period before last week,'' the official said. Due to the reconciliation of death data, the state Covid chart showed that Vasai-Virar had 36 deaths compared to Mumbai’s Friday toll of 34 deaths. The Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation area, which has seen 12,213 cases and 66 deaths in 20 days, reported 879 new cases and five deaths on Friday. The weekly case fatality rate (CFR) in the state has been steadily rising. The state CFR from April 5 to April 11 was 0.53%, which has gone up to 0.58% from April 12 to April 18. There are five districts in the state which have reported a jump in the death rate. Topping the charts is Buldhana, which has reported a death rate of 4.7% in the last week, up from 0.2% in the week before that. Jalgaon's weekly CFR went up to 1.5% from 0.4% during the same time. Akola’s CFR has gone up to 1.7% from 1.1%. There were many instances of shortage of oxygen in various districts such as Ahmednagar, along with unavailability of the anti-viral drug remdesivir for private hospitals even in cities such as Mumbai and the long wait for hospital beds in most cities. A health officer said that rural Maharashtra was possibly the worst hit as diagnosis itself was difficult to come by. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that it had been brought to his notice that the patients in many districts were reporting very late and in critical condition to the hospitals. “There are many cases were a patient has been suffering the symptoms for 7-8 days and he comes to the hospital when he has deteriorated. We have have been stressing on early detection and early treatment all along. With cases going up in small cities it is a cause of worry,” said Tope. On Friday, Mumbai saw 34 deaths, compared to 50 per day since April 14. BMC Covid-19 data showed that 947 Covid deaths were reported in the city in 68 days (between February 11 and April 19) while 2.66 lakh positive cases were reported in the same period of time. The cases from Mumbai account for only 14% of Maharashtra’s daily caseload as against 17% until a week ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-now-states-smaller-cities-show-higher-rate-of-death/articleshow/82170700.cms||Bhavika Jain

In order to prevent the uncontrolled spreading of Covid-19, only officials related to counting of votes should be allowed within and outside counting centres, the petition filed by MK Sreekumar of Kottayam said. He is also seeking a ban on election victory rallies and gatherings. When the citizens are living in caution and are taking precautions to prevent the spread of the pandemic, despite losing lives and income, political parties, their leaders, and workers conducted election campaign without following Covid protocol, resulting in a huge increase in the number of persons affected with Covid-19 in the state, it is alleged. While only 15,000 Covid patients were there in the state on March 3, it has now increased many fold rapidly, the petitioner points out. It is alleged by the petitioner that politicians and political workers engaged in election campaign without wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and without using sanitizers. Though they have been the cause of the large spreading of Covid-19, no action is being taken against them, the petitioner complains while seeking the court’s intervention to prevent repetition of a similar scenario on the day of counting of votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/plea-in-hc-seeks-ban-on-gatherings-on-poll-result-day/articleshow/82169125.cms||---

While crematoriums had tuned to electric or gas-based furnaces over time, the pandemic and overflowing bodies have once again brought back the wooden furnaces for cremation. In such a situation, Keshod-based farmer 56-year-old Arjun Pagdhdar’s innovative furnace, however, will prove to be most competent in saving the massive sacrifice of woods in the death rituals. Rough estimates project consumption of around 400kg wood in single cremation. His scientifically constructed furnace uses only 25 percent wood in comparison to the traditional wooden furnace.“This furnace is made in a scientific way that people can use bio coal made out of agriculture waste and cow dung also. Everything has been taken care of to ensure that all Hindu rituals of cremation are followed to the last. The crematoriums need to procure the scientific furnaces,” said Pagdhar, adding that it also cuts on the burning time. Pagdhar also claimed that this furnace complete the cremation in two hours instead the traditional wooden furnace take three hours, thereby speeding up the process and cutting on waiting time at the crematoriums. The covered furnace has been designed keeping in mind the human body parts that need varied temperature levels to burn during cremation.At the age of 14, Pagdhar, had calculated the colossal loss of wood at a kin’s pyre. Thereupon, he studied the issue studiously down the years and created a covered furnace that consumes only 25 percent of the wood traditional furnaces burn. He claims that if one tree that yields 100-150 kg wood require at least 15-odd years to grow, then the sacrifice of greenery for such usage is humongous. Such furnaces have been installed at six places including Padali village of Devbhumi Dwarka, Kodinar, Bamnasa Ghed of Keshod taluka, Keshod, Alidhara and Mendarda of Junagadh district at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/farmers-furnace-saves-pyre-wood-time/articleshow/82168089.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Investigation officer and assistant police inspector (API) Dipali Nikam said that Danish had obtained anticipatory bail in the case, while Anisuddin had surrendered before the cops after the forensic report concluded the death was due to manual strangulation. “However, ASI Siddiqui and his wife were on the run since the case was registered and efforts were on to nab them. They made unscuccessful attempts to seek bail from a lower court as well as the high court. The couple surrendered on Monday and was produced before a court, which remanded them to one day police custody,” API Nikam told TOI. Twenty four-year-old Kulsum, wife of Anisuddin, was found dead under mysterious circumstances at her house in Satara area of Aurangabad city on October 4 last year.

The CM, who said the government will not enforce a lockdown in the state and declared a weekend curfew in all districts, also told officials to ramp up testing. Acting on the CM’s orders, the department of medical education has asked medical colleges and institutes to increase their testing to three times. From 51,900 samples per day now, the medical institutions have been asked to start testing 1,64,000 samples daily. Presently, about 2 lakh Covid tests are being conducted by all laboratories in the state. This includes tests by 104 private laboratories and 125 public sector ones. As many as 558 scientists, lab technicians, data operators and lab attendants are being deployed to carry out testing. A government spokesperson said that 12,000 samples will be tested daily at KGMU, RML, SGPGI, JIMS Noida and Meerut Medical College. The medical education department has also directed medical colleges and autonomous state medical colleges to increase resources for testing. This includes the purchase of 83 RTPCR machines, an automatic extractor, 23 biosafety cabinets, 29 autoclave machines and 29 deep freezers. The CM further said that hospital beds should be doubled in all districts. “There should be district-wise data on ICU and isolation beds’ availability so that they can be provided to patients in an organised way,” the CM said. He asked the health department to simplify its discharge policy so that patients with serious symptoms can get beds without delay. The CM has directed the health and medical education departments to ensure that all medical colleges with a minimum of 100 beds have their own oxygen plants. He asked officials to ensure there is no black marketing of oxygen. “Oxygen tankers should be tagged with GPS so that their movement can be tracked. KGMU and Balrampur hospital have to be utilised fully as dedicated Covid facilities. Besides, to ensure availability of beds, hospitals like Era, TS Mishra, Integral, Hind and Mayo should also be run as dedicated Covid facilities. The health department must ensure that they are provided with all essential facilities on priority so that there is no delay in providing treatment to patients,” the CM said. At least half of the fleet of the 108 Ambulance service should be reserved for Covid patients and the response time of ambulances should be reduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/celebrate-festivals-at-home-avoid-stepping-out-says-yogi/articleshow/82170105.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This is a key question amid the raging second wave. It’s also one of the topics of discussion at the Asia for Animals (AfA) Conference 2021, which will be held on April 24 and 25. People across the world can now attend the event as it is going virtual for the first time. “We will be talking about the meat markets in Asia and what we are going to do to deal with them as they are the breeding ground for many diseases and also one of these places from which Covid-19 emerged,” says Varda Mehrotra, executive director, Federation Of Indian Animal Protection Organizations (FIAPO), which along with the Blue Cross of India, and the AfA Coalition, is organising the conference. “We are also going to explore how organisations, and individuals interested in the movement can organise themselves and carry on our work in the post-Covid world, working with remote teams and adapting to the changing reality. The final session will focus on the future of the movement.” The biennial conference, which has been hosted in various countries across Asia will feature 45 speakers from across the world, including English primatologist and anthropologist Jane Goodall. “The aim is to share knowledge and discuss policies in Asia, brainstorm how to improve networking between animal welfare organisations across Asia, discuss best practices, and get all animal welfare organisations together to improve the lives of animals across Asia,” says Sathya Radhakrishnan, honorary joint secretary, Blue Cross of India. AfA 2021 will have presentations, panel discussions and breakways, all of which will be followed by Q&A sessions aimed at encouraging food-for-thought, discussing challenges and deriving customized solutions.  The highlights include sessions that explore the challenges organisations and activists face while combating the cat and dog meat trade, and how organisations can help tourist operators (elephant camps, circuses, animals used in selfie tourism etc) move away from animal tourism to alternative models. “Interested people can register online and attend the conference. People from Asian countries need to pay only $10,” says Radhakrishnan, adding that student discounts are also available.

---||Aurangabad||Authorities engage in revival of oxygen supply in Aurangabad||Aurangabad: A day after the supply of medical oxygen to Covid care facilities almost stopped, the local authorities on Tuesday swung into action to address the issue. The state-run health facilities sourced oxygen to private hospitals in available capacity to tide over the crisis. The dearth of oxygen saw a few private hospitals either discharging Covid-19 patients or informing them in advance that they needed to move elsewhere. FDA joint commissioner Sanjay Kale said the supply of oxygen in Aurangabad had encountered some technical issues during the past 24 hours. He, however, refused to give more details. Other senior FDA officials said the suppliers failed to send medical oxygen to local distributors. “Private hospitals were at the receiving end due to the supply related issues. As a makeshift arrangement, GMCH, Aurangabad, offered oxygen to them.” Santosh Yadav, management representative with MediCover Hospital, said oxygen supply was streamlined after a gap of 24 hours, by Tuesday. “As a precautionary measure, we alerted Covid patients and their families about the dearth of oxygen on Monday, informing them about the need to shift to other health facilities if the shortage persisted,” he said. Notably, city MP Imtiaz Jaleel has already opposed the supply of medical oxygen from Aurangabad to cities such as Dhule and Malegaon during the current outbreak of the disease. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan could not be reached for comment. As per official record, the demand for oxygen by Covid care facilities in Aurangabad was around 59 metric tonne last week. The FDA authorities did not have off-hand information about the current demand and supply for Aurangabad. Meanwhile, GMCH, Aurangabad, saw commissioning of two oxygen tanks of 11 KL capacity each, further augmenting the need for oxygen to the state-run facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/authorities-engage-in-revival-of-oxygen-supply-in-aurangabad/articleshow/82169139.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On Tuesday, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education decided to cancel SSC exams. “The school education department is committed to devising a fair and accurate assessment criterion,” Gaikwad said. She also said that the department would explore the possibility of giving students the option of appearing for the exam at a later date. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said, “All ministers opined that students should be promoted as no school could open during the last academic year except for online education.” Parents across the state have welcomed the move. Anubha Sahai, member of the India Wide Parents’ Association, said, “It is a great decision by the state government. It will not only save students from anxiety, but also keep them safe in these difficult times. The boards and students can begin planning for the next academic year.” There had been a growing demand from parents groups across the country for board exams to be cancelled. Teachers are, however, apprehensive. “Even if the board has cancelled SSC exams, the guidelines for scoring students are very important. They must consult stakeholders and make the decision at the earliest,” said Anil Bornare, a teacher at Swami Muktananda School, Chembur. Most boards have not yet announced their guidelines. Another teacher raised concerns over first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions. “Unlike many parts of the country, the competition for FYJC seats is fierce in Maharashtra, especially Mumbai. So while the move to cancel SSC exams is in the interest of students, the government must plan ahead keeping in mind the admission process. All students will be marked at their respective schools and there might be no parity when they compete for college admissions,” said Shivnath Darade, a teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ssc-exams-cancellation-raises-concern-over-fyjc-admissions/articleshow/82169148.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar

The mill management told health officials that the 13 had left for their native places in Jharkhand, without informing them. Now the health authorities have alerted the state health officials to pass on the information to the health department in Jharkhand about the arrival of the 13. According to health officials in Tirupur, the 13 men had undergone Covid-19 testing on April 6. The results, which came on April 9, found they were positive for the virus. They were hospitalized for a week and then asked to be in home isolation till April 20, to complete the 14-day isolation period. Since then, they were at the staff quarters of the mill at Vellakoil, where they were working. The staff quarters was also declared a containment zone till April 22. However, they were missing from the staff quarters on Monday. When the local health authorities got wind of their absence, they questioned the mill staff, who said the 13 had left without informing them. Subsequently, health authorities found out that they had left for their native places in Jharkhand on Sunday night, along with a bunch of guest workers, who left Tirupur. Health officials, however, say the chances of infection spreading from the 13 was remote, as they have completed 13 days of quarantine. “99% there is no chance of spreading,”’ said a health officer. However, as a precautionary measure, they have alerted the state health department to inform Jharkhand authorities so that their co-passengers in the train could be isolated and tested once they land there. Health officials have tightened vigil on the mills and garment units and have instructed the managements to keep a close watch on workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/13-mill-guest-workers-jump-quarantine-leave-for-home/articleshow/82169138.cms||---

Police have arrested the two and exhumed the dead body. The Madukkarai police identified the deceased as R Nagaraj, 36, of Chandrapuram near Negamam. A police officer said Nagaraj had married Amutha, 36, of Madukkarai Market, around eight months ago, after the demise of his first wife. “It was also Amutha’s second marriage. Her first husband had died a few years ago and with him she had two daughters and a son. After the marriage, Nagaraj had moved in with Amutha and her kids at her residence at Madukkarai Market.” The officer said the couple had joined Amala Minerals, a kolapodi supplying private firm at Seerapalayam area near Madukkarai, for work four days ago. “Amutha instantly fell for co-worker S Shankar, of Lakshmipuram near Ottapidaram in Thoothukudi district and they developed an extra-marital affair. A welder, he was staying on the premises of the firm,” the officer said. According to the officer, Amutha was not home when Nagaraj returned home in an inebriated condition on Monday night. “He immediately went to the private firm, where he found his wife in the company of Shankar. Nagaraj fought with Shankar and tried to attack him. Shankar took a hammer and beat Nagaraj on his chest and later strangulated him. Amutha also helped him murder her husband. Later, the duo buried the dead body near the private firm around 12.05am on Tuesday.” The firm owner, Mayilvaganam, 57, found the pit filled with sand and informed the Madukkarai police, who exhumed the dead body in the presence of Madukkarai tahsildar Nagaraj and sent that to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for postmortem. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/woman-lover-jailed-for-killing-husband/articleshow/82169144.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Mukhtar’s ambulance row: Hospital owner, aide held||LUCKNOW: Dr Alka Rai, the co-owner of Shyam Sanjeevani Hospital and Research Center in Mau, in whose name the ambulance used by Mukhtar Ansari to visit Mohali court from Ropar jail in Punjab was registered, was arrested by Barabanki police on Monday. Her associate Sheshanath Rai was also arrested. On April 2, Barabanki police had lodged an FIR against them under the charges of forgery, criminal conspiracy, intimidation and knowingly furnishing false information to a public servant in connection with the documentation related to the ambulance. SP Barabanki, Yamuna Prasad, said the two accused had prepared fake documents for purchase and registration of the ambulance. Alka Rai told the police that she had got the ambulance registered in her name at the behest of jailed don and BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari, the SP said. “Alka Rai also said that the ambulance bearing number UP41AT 7171 was registered on December 21, 2013, and was with Mukhtar Ansari since then. But Rai did not inform police about this,” Prasad added. The ambulance was meant for the use of Shyam Sanjeevani Hospital and Research Center in Mau only but was illegally used by the don for his court hearings in Punjab. Ansari is MLA from Mau. About the role of Sheshnath Rai, the SP Barabanki said he was the guarantor as the ambulance was financed by a private company. “All the documents for the vehicle were signed by Sheshnath Rai and then submitted to ARTO Barabanki by Mukhtar’s aide Rajnath Yadav who was arrested on April 5,” Prasad said. A team of UP Police had brought back the ambulance from Punjab for technical inspection. Barabanki police did not find any trace of bullet proofing or weapon support system inside the ambulance during inspection, the SP added. Mukhtar Ansari has been shifted from Ropar jail to Bnda jail in UP on the Supreme Court’s directive. Prasad said others accused in the case including Ansari’s aide Mujahid will be arrested soon. Meanwhile, police has also launched a probe to trace officials in the RTO who helped Dr Alka Rai and Sheshnath Rai to get the ambulance registered on fake address in Barabanki.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mukhtars-ambulance-row-hospital-owner-aide-held/articleshow/82170146.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

Due to this, his right lung had completely collapsed and his heart was pushed to the extreme left, thereby compressing the left lung against the chest wall, resulting in heaviness in the chest and respiratory distress. Subhash (39) from Angadipuram, Malappuram, would have never known of his condition if he had not fractured his right femur bone. “I used to feel breathless, had heaviness in the chest and could barely eat. But I never really understood the changes in my body. After the fracture, I was taken to a nearby hospital where the doctors observed that I was breathless,” said Subhash. He was immediately sent for CT scan of the chest and reports showed that his liver, stomach and intestines were in the chest cavity with his right lung completely collapsed and his heart grossly pushed to the extreme left, thereby compressing the left lung against the chest wall. Subhash’s family informed the doctors about the road accident and how an emergency surgery had saved his life but left him paralyzed in both legs. Two months after the accident, he had returned home and since then he was homebound, with physiotherapy sessions. He was immediately referred to Dr Nasser Yusuf, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Sunrise hospital, Kochi. After studying his reports, the treating doctors here realized that it must have started as a small rent in the diaphragm that went undetected to begin with, and over the years gradually it increased to cause a large defect (15cm) through which the abdominal contents had herniated into the chest. It was decided that a surgery was needed to place all his vital organs back to the abdomen but it was a formidable challenge as six years had passed. However, since the family agreed to the operation despite the risks involved, he was operated on March 30. “The vital abdominal organs had entered into the right chest cavity through a large gaping hole in the diaphragm (partition between chest and abdomen) and were stuck to the chest wall, heart and the diaphragm itself. The organs were removed without any injury to them and the defect was repaired with a mesh. With all the organs back to where they belong, the right lung began to function,” said Dr Yusuf. The entire surgery lasted five hours and Subash was put on ventilation. Within a day, he was taken off life support. “Diaphragmatic rupture is rarely seen in less than 1% of chest injuries and occurs three times more frequently on the left side,” added Dr Yusuf. Subhash was discharged from the hospital on the ninth day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/docs-put-mans-vital-organs-back-in-place/articleshow/82169146.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Surat||Sugarcane waste to hasten cremations||Surat: As crematoriums in Surat are running round-the-clock and forced to use kerosene and green wood for burning the bodies quickly, cooperative sugar factories in Surat have started providing bagasse for cremation. Bagasse is the dry pulpy fibrous remains of sugarcane after it is crushed. It is generally used as bio-fuel.  In a first, Sayan Sugar Factory provided 20 tonnes of bagasse to crematoriums at Pal and Olpad for free. The factory sells bagasse at Rs 900 a tonne for manufacturing paper products and as fuel for its boiler. “Bagasse is our by-product and we use 50% of it for our boiler as fuel and the remaining 50% is purchased by paper product manufacturers. Since we got to know that kerosene and diesel are being used to burn the bodies of Covid victims, we decided to provide bagasse,” said Rakesh Patel, chairman of Sayan Sugar Factory. A private trust operating a crematorium in Olpad first successfully tested that bagasse can be as efficient as the dry wood following which 10 tonnes each were supplied to the two crematoriums. Currently, due to the shortage of dry wood, green wood is being used by the crematoriums for burning the bodies. Surat Municipal Corporation’s garden department too has been providing 15 tonnes of wood on a daily basis since April 10. “Bagasse catches fire quickly and if it is placed along with green wood, it helps wood too in burning,” Patel added. He said that the sugar factory will be supplying more quantity of bagasse to other crematoriums, but the 20 tonnes supplied to two crematoriums will last for several months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/sugarcane-waste-to-hasten-cremations/articleshow/82168127.cms||---

The MC had planned to set up two fire stations at Sector 65 (phase XI) and Sector 78. The plans were mooted three years ago, but till date, nothing has been done in this regard. Mohali municipal corporation commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “A resolution has already been sent for approval with the Punjab government, which is awaited. The samples of the soil are being tested by Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology University in Patiala. We are yet to receive the reports, following which the design and drawings of the two buildings will be finalised. A Chandigarh-based private architect has been hired for the purpose.” It has been proposed to station one fire tender at International Airport to cater to the southern sectors till the two fire stations are constructed. According to the a study conducted by the experts from PU, the average travel time for a fire tender from Phase I to Sector 78 is 20 minutes to 25 minutes, it takes 35 minutes to 40 minutes to reach Mullanpur and the time increased in case of traffic congestion. “This wastes the golden hour. If we have sub-stations at Phase XI, Mullanpur and at Sector 78, the reaction time will reduce to half,” said a fire officer. The fire station at Mohali Phase I has 13 firefighting vehicles i.e. three water tenders (5,000-litre each), four multipurpose tenders, one water boozer (20,000 litres), one Branto sky lift, one rescue tender (equipped with cutters), one firefighting jeep and two motorcycles. A senior official of the fire department said more staff would be required at the new fire stations as the current fire station was already facing staff crunch. Against the sanctioned posts of 80 firemen, the station has just 24 officials. Similarly, against 24 sanctioned posts of drivers, only seven drivers are performing the duty and the station has only one leading fireman, whereas the number of sanctioned posts is 24. On the last day of the Fire Safety Week, Mohali municipal corporation mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu alias Jeeti Sidhu visited the Fire Brigade Office at Phase I and inspected fire-fighting arrangements. Mock drills were also conducted by the fire brigade staff. The fire officer provided information on all types of machinery and fire brigade vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-fails-to-construct-two-additional-fire-stations/articleshow/82169132.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

On Tuesday, 49 of the city’s 129 vaccination centres remained shut due to unavailability of vaccines. Some of the major public vaccination centres such as BKC jumbo and Mulund jumbo had to shut their gates after vaccines ran out in a few hours. Of the 49 centres that could not vaccinate, 38 were private, six BMC and five state centres. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC executive health officer, said the city had received 1.1 lakh doses on Tuesday but these would mainly be distributed among the public centres doing free vaccination. With the addition of 1.1 lakh doses, the city now has stocks to last three days. “Private centres may not be able to vaccinate in full capacity till the supply is streamlined,” Gomare said. Municipal officials are facing issues in distribution too. “There are 130 vaccination centres and we are getting doses, sometimes as few as 20,000 and 40,000. It is a challenge to distribute such few doses among centres,” an official said. At the BKC jumbo centre, officials closed the gates after 400 doses. At the Mulund jumbo centres, which sees a footfall of 1,300-1,800 daily, officials stopped vaccinating after running out of 250 doses. Dean of Mulund jumbo centre Dr Pradeep Angre said they had received only 100 vials (1000 doses) on Monday and 25 vials on Tuesday. “We are forced to turn away people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vaccine-drive-heavily-hit-as-centres-run-out-of-doses-in-mumbai/articleshow/82170705.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||India||Congress says govt’s new policy will lead to multiple prices of vaccines, shortchange poorer states||NEW DELHI: Slamming the new vaccine policy as “the Modi government abdicating its responsibility in the garb of giving more powers to states”, Congress Tuesday said it will lead to multiple prices of vaccines and shift a large financial burden of vaccinating the poor to the “already overstretched states” while seriously handicapping the poorer states in procurement of vaccines from the open market. Addressing a press conference, former finance minister P Chidambaram, and senior leaders Jairam Ramesh and Ajay Maken said, “We demand one nation, one price. It’s a party (BJP) that believes in one nation, one election; one tax etc. Why cannot it say so about vaccine price? Under the new rules, the prices will be different for the Centre, the states and private hospitals.” Congress said the new rules will promote “unhealthy price bidding and profiteering” and it will hurt the poorer states in comparison to better-off states. “The Union Government has finally acknowledged the deficiencies in the current vaccine policy … but the modified vaccine policy is regressive and inequitable,” Chidambaram said, adding, “Nowhere in the world has any government left its vaccination programme to be determined by the vagaries of market forces.” The Congress trio protested that in future, the states will bear the cost of vaccinating 18-45 year age group that does not fall under the category of healthcare workers and frontline workers. “The central government appears to have abdicated its responsibility towards the poor by excluding them from its vaccination programme. In a country where the median age is 28 years, to leave those below 45 years out of a public-funded programme is callous. The migrant workers who live in other states will be the worst affected,” the party argued. Congress warned that vaccination programme will suffer as states, weighed down by shrinking GST revenues, lower tax devolution and increased borrowing, will have to bear new expenditure. “Meanwhile, nobody knows where the thousands of crores of rupees collected under PM-CARES are being deployed,” Chidambaram remarked. The opposition party stressed that the modified vaccine policy does not provide funds for capital investment to the vaccine manufacturers to ramp up production. Also, compulsory licensing should have been invoked to let other vaccine manufacturers enter the manufacturing of the two approved vaccines, it argued. With the Centre finally allowing import of vaccines, Congress asked the government to clarify if any foreign manufacturer had agreed to export its vaccine to India. Urging a focused expenditure, Jairam Ramesh said the Centre should defer programmes like Central Vista and ensure that “livelihoods are not threatened”. He demanded a monthly cash transfer of Rs 6,000 to poor families till the crisis lasts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-says-govts-new-policy-will-lead-to-multiple-prices-of-vaccines-shortchange-poorer-states/articleshow/82171979.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Heavy rain brings mercury levels down||Coimbatore: Heavy rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, lashed the district in the early hours of Tuesday, offering the residents much-needed respite from the sweltering sun. While the regional meteorological centre’s rain gauge at Peelamedu recorded 15.4mm rainfall, Periyanaickenpalayam and Mettupalayam recorded 17mm and 24mm rain, respectively. The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in the west zone of the city registered 34.8mm rain. While the summer showers brought down the mercury levels, it also led to power cuts and filled the roads with sludge. Waterlogging was also reported in certain areas. An official source said the power outage was widely reported in west zone of the city. The areas that were affected included Edayarpalayam, Chinna Thadagam, Seeranaickenpalayam and Veerakeralam. It took officials almost an hour to restore the power supply. Many roads in the city and outskirts were, meanwhile, filled with sludge. D Veerathambi, a commuter at RS Puram, said the roads were already in a mess because of the ongoing smart city and flyover works. “Many stretches were dug up and the mud was simply left on roadsides. After the showers, the mud mixed with water filled the roads.” In Sulur, the road between Selakarichal village and Siddhanaickenpalayam developed potholes after the rain. The stretch usually sees movement of many heavy vehicles. Struck by lightning, a vagai tree also caught fire in the area. When alerted, fire and rescue services personnel put out the flames. Weathermen attributed the rain to convectional activity and a trough. S Balachandran, deputy director, Indian Meteorological Department, said it was the usual convective rainfall (summer rain). “There is also a trough that is extending to interior Karnataka from central India. But it is the evaporation that is providing the moisture for the trough, resulting in rain.” Weather experts said the trough would continue for the next two to three days. Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist with Skymet Weather Services, said the district might receive rain, accompanied by thunder, for at least two days between Tuesday and Saturday this week. “However, people have to wait till May 1, when the summer rain will intensify, for the weather to change noticeably,” said Santhosh Krishnan, a weather blogger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/heavy-rain-brings-mercury-levels-down/articleshow/82169149.cms||---

The letter sent on Monday cites an earlier communication that had suggested 10% of the total remdesivir stock received in each district be reserved for ‘emergency use’. ‘From the said reserved quota, the district administrations, on priority, should provide remdesivir injection to frontline workers like police, health workers and those associated with emergency services’ reads the letter. When contacted, FDA commissioner Abhimanyu Kale said, “We have asked the district collectors to reserve 10% of the daily remdesivir stock for the frontline workers, so that they are provided with the vials in case of emergency.” The senior IAS officer added, “The reserved injections left unused on a given day, should be added to the quota received on next day and be distributed as per the laid norms and directives.” “Each person’s life is important and there is no harm if any district administration utilizes this 10% quota, in case there is a sudden emergency situation, provided the move is calculated,” said Kale. He said that his order should be taken in a positive sense, as his intention is to take care of the frontline workers, who are more exposed to the infection in their daily life. “There is a surge in demand for remdesivir from across the state and we are hopeful of soon meeting the daily demand of the entire state,” said Kale. According to FDA authorities, as on date, there is a daily demand for about 50,000 vials of remdesivir in Maharashtra. Moreover, the recently floated tenders for bulk purchase of totally eight lakh vials, failed to find any bidder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/reserve-10-remdesivir-for-frontline-workers-fda-comm/articleshow/82169145.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The new infrastructure expansion of a third such tank in the hospital premises is expected to start functioning after trial runs are conducted in the next few days. At present, two tanks of 20,000 litre and 10,000 litre are already in use at the civic body’s hospital. These tanks are storing and supplying 26 tonnes oxygen daily to Covid-19 patients admitted in the hospital. The third tank has been set up to supply oxygen in SMIMER Plus hospital which has been developed in multi-level parking of the hospital developed in 2020 for treatment of Covid. The new set up is functioning on the hospital’s three floors of multilevel parking and an ICU is being developed on the fourth floor. Around 100 ventilators are likely to be installed in the ICU, for which the additional oxygen requirement will be addressed by the new tank. “The oxygen tank has been installed considering the expansion of overall hospital infrastructure. It will be in use in next few days after testing,” said Puneet Nayyar, DCF and in-charge of SMIMER hospital. Meanwhile, SMIMER has installed a backup facility for oxygen supply if the pressure supplied from the tank drops below a certain level. Total 20 oxygen cylinders have been installed that will maintain the pressure for a few hours till the bulk oxygen tanks are refilled. At present 921 beds have been set up for Covid-19 patients of which 600 are occupied. SMIMER has 214 ventilators which are in use currently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/20k-litre-oxygen-tank-at-smimer-to-start-work-soon/articleshow/82168136.cms||---

Section officer V Vinod was placed under suspension in February this year after an internal inquiry found him responsible for manipulating the mark list of several students. The recommendation for dismissal was passed at the syndicate meeting chaired by VC M Mahadevan Pillai, on the basis of a detailed inquiry report submitted by PVC PP Ajayakumar. It was found that the section officer has modified the mark list of 74 candidates. During the hearing of students, at least six of them claimed that they were persuaded to bribe and earn higher marks. According to reports, he used to humiliate students initially for not securing a pass mark and later consoled them by offering help to improve marks for a bribe. However, university is yet to cancel the degree certificate of around two dozen students whose mark lists were manipulated. The university had claimed that software glitches led to the inadvertent gifting of marks. This tampering had taken place in the case of 12 exams held between 2016 and 2019. KU authorities had then sought the help of an outside agency to trace the glitches in the software. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ku-to-dismiss-official-for-marks-fudging/articleshow/82169157.cms||---
---||Goa||Brandon using ACL to showcase talent||Margao: It is no coincidence that Brandon Fernandes has had a foot in all of India’s international goals in the last 18 months. All of them from set-pieces. He set up the goal for Sunil Chhetri against Oman, for Adil Khan against Bangladesh and Seiminlen Doungel against Afghanistan in the World Cup qualifiers. Even in the AFC Champions League, it was Brandon’s free-kick that allowed Edu Bedia to head home FC Goa’s only goal against Iranian giants Persepolis FC. “For set pieces, he has a good right foot. That’s good for us,” said Goa coach Juan Ferando. “He has quality, so we prepare for set-pieces with him. The last part of the ISL was difficult for him as he was out for three months. Now, he is ready, working in training.” Brandon missed nine games for Goa in this season’s Indian Super League with injury and returned only for the second leg semifinal against eventual champions Mumbai City. He missed from the spot – along with three others -- during the tiebreaker, but his preparations for the AFC Champions League since then have been top-notch. “In the last weeks before ACL, Brandon worked a lot. For us, it’s a pleasure to have him in the pitch,” said Ferrando. Having a fully-fit Brandon in the team provides any coach with plenty of options. He can play on the right, left or even as a No. 10, his favourite position since his junior days. And given his technical ability, he’s clearly a cut above the domestic players. Most of this edge is thanks to his training stint with ASD Football Academy in Cape Town between 2010 and 2013. He even attracted interest from Premier League sides like Leicester City, Sunderland and Reading but could not win a contract. “I always wanted to play abroad, that's always going to be open,” Brandon told TOI on Thursday. “Right now, the opportunities I get, I’ll take it. I got this opportunity to play in AFC Champions League. It’s a big opportunity for me “ACL is one of the best tournaments in Asia, so this is a stage I can showcase my talent, prove myself. The (first) three games have been good for me. We still have three more (games). I need to give a lot to this team and lots to prove. This type of games help me improve as a player and professional.” Brandon, 26, has started all three games for Goa in the ACL and has given a good account of himself. He struck the post against Al Rayyan from just outside the box, created the goal for Edu and almost scored himself, only to be denied by an excellent save by the Persepolis goalkeeper. “My aim was to just hit the target. That’s what I always do when I find myself in such situations. Against Al Wahda, I hit the post. When I got a similar chance (against Persepolis), I wanted to keep it in the frame, but unfortunately the goalkeeper made a brilliant save,” said Brandon. The talented midfielder said it’s not a surprise that he has created the goals from set-pieces. He practices a lot, and his teammates know what to expect when he has the ball at his feet. “My teammates know here I will put the ball and they can attack the space.

---||Lucknow||Waseem Rizvi elected UP Shia Waqf Board member||Lucknow: The controversial former chairman of UP Shia Central Waqf Board, Waseem Rizvi, made an easy re-entry to the Board after being elected as its member from mutawali (caretaker of endowment property) quota on Tuesday. Rizvi got 21 out of 29 votes. The Board’s tenure had ended around 10 months ago following which the government had appointed an administrator. However, after the intervention of the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court, election was held for the new Board. Besides Rizvi, mutawali of Talkatora Imambara and BJP member Syed Faizi also got elected as a member from mutawali quota. During the election process, a few mutawalis and their supporters reportedly had a heated exchange of words. Chief executive officer (CEO) of the Board, Mohd Naseer Hasan, told TOI that Waseem Rizvi and Syed Faizi have been elected as Board members and received 21 votes each. Rizvi is the president of the All India Shia Yateem Khana and mutawali of Karbala Malka Jahan in Lucknow. He faces corruption charges and was ostracized by Muslims after he moved the Supreme Court to seek removal of some Quranic verses. Six mutawalis had filed nomination of whom mutawali of Faizabad-based mausoleum of Bahu Begum, Ashfaq Husain alias Ziya, got six votes, mutawali of Unnao-based waqf Karbala Munshi Fazley Husain, Musharraf Husain Rizvi, got five votes while mutawali of waqf property Nawab Shahenshah Begum in Lucknow, Asim Rizvi, got one vote. Apart from two members from mutawali quota, two Shia community members each from the State Bar Association, MP quota and MLC quota, constitute the entire board. “Former MP from Rampur Noor Bano has filed nomination from MP quota. MLC quota elections are awaited and there has been no nomination from the Bar yet. Election for the chairperson will be done in a few days after the panel is ready,” said CEO Naseer Hasan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/waseem-rizvi-elected-up-shia-waqf-board-member/articleshow/82170168.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Lucknow||Dark horse Noor Bano may upset Rizvi’s applecart||Ayodhya: Ayodhya: After the surprise re-election of the controversial former Shia Waqf Board chief Waseem Rizvi as a member from mutawalli quota, all eyes are on the election of new chairman, the notification for which is eagerly awaited. Rizvi will now try for his re-election as Board chairman as well, notwithstanding the controversies he was mired in during his tenure during Samajwadi Party and BJP regimes, said sources. However, the entry of former MP Begum Noor Bano, scion of the Shia royal family of Rampur who enjoys an overarching appeal in the community, has queered the pitch for Rizvi. And she may prove to be the dark horse in the election for chairman of UP Shia Central Waqf Board. Noor Bano has been elected member from MP quota while BJP MLC Buqqal Nawab also became Board member but through MLA/MLC quota. Sources said, BJP may be interested in getting Buqqal Nawab elected as chairman, but the possibility of his sailing through appears dim. After the election of two members from mutawalli quota on Tuesday, now the UP government will nominate five members to complete the quorum. There must be 11 members in the Board, according to the constitution, but due to non availability of Shia members in various categories this time, the quorum will be of nine members only. “After the election of former Congress MP Begum Noor Bano and BJP MLC Buqqal Nawab as members of the Board from MP/MLA/MLC quota, two members have been elected from the mutawalli quota and the rest five, including two lawyers, one cleric, one social worker and a government officer of special secretary rank, will be nominated by the government,” said Shia Waqf Board, CEO Syed Naseer Hasan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dark-horse-noor-bano-may-upset-rizvis-applecart/articleshow/82170176.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Mumbai||ICSE exams scrapped; council tells its schools to start class XI admissions||MUMBAI: The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) late on Monday night announced the cancellation of ICSE (Class X) exams and said it would instead use a “fair and unbiased criterion” to mark students. The board had earlier given class X students an option to appear for offline examinations whenever they are conducted. The council’s circular stated: “Given the present worsening situation of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, the CISCE has decided to cancel the ICSE 2021 exams and the options given to the students earlier now stands withdrawn. The safety and wellbeing of our students and teaching faculty is our topmost priority and of paramount interest.” The board said it is devising a “fair and unbiased criterion” for drawing up the scores. Dates of results will be declared later by the board. CISCE also asked its affiliated schools to begin the admission process for class XI. “Schools should prepare a schedule to begin the online classes for Class XI students at the earliest,” it said. The status of the ISC (Class XII) exams remains the same. In a circular issued on April 16, the board said that it would review the Covid-19 situation in the first week of June and decide when the ISC exams can be conducted. Parents and school principals are relieved with the board’s decision. “It would have been very unfair to keep students waiting to know when the class X exams would be conducted considering that the Covid-19 situation isn’t going to improve overnight. Cancelling the exams at a later date would mean students would continue to study only to be disappointed,” said Priya Rajkumar, parent of a ICSE student. A school principal said this decision will ensure that results are announced in time and the next academic year isn’t impacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-icse-exams-scrapped-council-tells-its-schools-to-start-class-xi-admissions/articleshow/82169170.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar

However, when cops reached the address Patil had provided at the time of admission, the thatched house near Valsad city police station was found empty. Patil, a ragpicker used to live alone. With nobody to claim the body, police donned its humanitarian uniform and took up the task of giving the body a dignified send off it deserved. Valsad cops who have been tasked with finding kin of Covid dead, cremated Patil with all Covid protocols in place. While police are able to find family members in some of the cases, it doesn’t hesitate to take the responsibility of bodies without any relations and cremate them. Like Patil, even Niranjan Desai, a confirmed bachelor who lived in Hanuman Bhagda area, too found a family at last in the khaki uniform. “There was one more case wherein a married man from Udwada had died. But his wife too had contracted the virus and was in quarantine, so we cremated him,” said V D Mori, inspector of Valsad city police station, adding that they have to find the relatives if they are absent or unreachable. Mori said that so far, they were asked to find relatives of four victims. Vapi police was also informed to reach out to family members of Sukhiya Kheda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/valsad-cops-asked-to-find-kin-of-unclaimed-covid-victims/articleshow/82168141.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Chandigarh||With arrivals in full swing, Punjab turns attention to e-payment, lifting||Chandigarh: With 54.12 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of wheat having already arrived in Punjab’s mandis till Monday, the state machinery is trying hard to keep pace with timely lifting and e-payment under the newly introduced direct benefit transfer (DBT). So far, payment of Rs 2,600 crore has been made and nearly 20 lakh MT of the total 50 lakh MT procured stocks lifted. The highest arrival of produce so far has been in Sangrur (71,5270 MT), followed by Patiala (5,76,584 MT) and Ludhiana (4,38,911 MT). As on Monday, the unsold quantity of wheat stood at 4.78 lakh MT across districts. Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said direct payment of Rs 2,600 crore was made to farmers on Tuesday and payments of Rs 4,200 crore would be cleared by Wednesday. “Payments worth Rs 1,141 crore were cleared till Monday and Rs 1,500 crore was cleared till Tuesday,” he said. “The arrivals have been nine times more than the previous year and the sudden influx has put immense pressure on the arrangements,’ he added. Meanwhile, Punjab Arhtiyas Association president Ravinder Singh Cheema complained that lifting has been slow at many places and contractors were asking arhtiyas to move to wheat stock. Besides, he claimed, the online system has been unable to take the load of so many farmers getting registered and arhtiyas were facing problems with the system crashing frequently. “The issue of shortage of gunny bags too needs to be addressed as even though arhtiyas have been asked to purchase stocks, they do not have GST numbers,” he added. Ashu rejected reports of shortage of gunny bags in the state and appealed to political parties against politicising the issue. On DBT, he said, “Punjab government has been making direct payments to farmers since last 18 months and assured that payments to each and every farmer would be made within the stipulated time.” BOX ‘SHUT MILLS AFFECTED GUNNY BAG SUPPLY’ Reacting to the charge of shortage of gunny bags, Ashu said that due to Covid and elections in West Bengal, many jute mills are shut, leading to shortage of jute bags across the country. He said they had even taken up this issue with the jute commissioner of India. “There was some shortage of bardana (jute bags) initially, but now the matter has been resolved. On April 12, 2021, the Centre allowed Punjab use of used bags by arhtiyas, for which Rs 41.90 per bag has been fixed,” he said. BOX LESSER YIELD EXPECTED THIS SEASON Punjab director of agriculture Sukhdev Singh Sidhu said while detailed reports of the experiments by his department were awaited, it is unlikely to be a bumper wheat crop this time. “The last bumper crop was in 2017-18. Last season, the produce was 50 quintal per hectare. The weather was very hot this time, but the exact situation will be clear after the detailed experiments. Some people also store the produce for delayed sales so it’s too early to conclude,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/with-arrivals-in-full-swing-punjab-turns-attention-to-e-payment-lifting/articleshow/82169159.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Slow poll analysis rekindles internal discontent in BJP||Thiruvananthapuram: BJP is once again courting internal criticism for being slow in assessing its organizational performance a fortnight after the assembly election ended. BJP’s state committee or core committee are yet to meet or discuss how the party’s rank and file worked in the crucial election. According to sources, party president K Surendran has convened an online meeting of party district presidents on Tuesday night to discuss election. But, other major political parties and fronts have already held several rounds of discussions on their poll performance and formulated an idea about the poll outcome based on the ground-level feedback they received from party workers. “Assumptions on the number of seats a political party would win or lose may go wrong. Prediction of seats is not the only objective of such post-poll brainstorming sessions. A comparison of the expectation shared immediately after elections and the final result is what would ultimately help a political party to chart out future course of action in parliamentary democracy,” said a senior leader who is upset over the ‘casual approach’ of the party towards self-analysis. However, another section of leaders offered a different view, saying that the party has already held district-level meetings and assessed the ground situation. “Perhaps, BJP did district-level analysis more comprehensively than any other party. Assembly segment-level analysis was carried out immediately after polls. Since the counting of votes is to take place only on May 2, there is no need to hurry. The core-committee meeting would soon be held,” they argued. Meanwhile, a senior leader with RSS background said that the assembly segment-wise analysis was done by RSS coordinators and BJP leadership cannot claim credit for the same. “The coordinates of RSS would invariably carry out their analysis immediately after polls. This is mainly because they would like to disassociate with the political work immediately after election and get back to the RSS work, which is not political at all,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/slow-poll-analysis-rekindles-internal-discontent-in-bjp/articleshow/82169166.cms||B S Anilkumar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra seeks to import vaccines to boost drive||MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray will seek permission from the Centre to import Covid-19 vaccines from other countries to carry out an extensive inoculation drive in Maharashtra. Public health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government has decided to carry out an ‘exemplary vaccination drive’ for which funds will be diverted from other departments. “With the Centre opening up vaccination for all, we plan to massively scale up the drive in the state. If required, we will be importing vaccines like Moderna, Pfizer and Sputnik from other countries,” said Tope, after the cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Housing minister Jitendra Awhad said it was unanimously decided in the state cabinet to approach the Centre for permission to import vaccines. “The two manufacturers that we have will not be able to produce the required amount of vaccine, so we are seeking permission to import vaccines,” he said. Tope had earlier said the state planned to vaccinate seven lakh people daily, but did not meet its target due to supply constraints. He added that the UK had imposed a lockdown, but also ensured that 60% of its population got vaccinated. “With this approach, very few new cases are being detected there, while the death toll is in single digits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-seeks-to-import-vaccines-to-boost-drive/articleshow/82170716.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Corpn gives up stadium plan near Thomas Park||Coimbatore: Following TOI reports on growing opposition to the smart city works being undertaken at Race Course without informing the public and how the same has affected the greenery of the locality, the city corporation has begun dismantling the steel structures erected near Thomas Park. Corporation commissioner Kumaravel Pandian said they decided to remove the sports stadium as local residents were opposed to the move. Residents, who have been opposing certain components of the project, are planning a protest by walking the Race Course circle on Wednesday morning. The residents have been protesting remodelling of Race Course for more than a week. They were mainly opposed to removing the historic Thomas Park, which was set up in the 1900s, and replacing it with a sports stadium, and felling more than 70 trees for the project. Suren Gurusamy, a resident, said Race Course was always known as a serene area with a lot of trees and gardens. “The trees provided an effective canopy to the walkers and commuters.” Renuka Kumar, another resident, said the excess of colourful lights and fabrications had, in fact, made the locality unpleasant after the remodelling. Mohammed Saleem, Environment Conservation Group founder, had started a petition on change.org to save Race Course, which he said was being “filled” with artificial structures. He said the plan to remodel Race Course was neither discussed or shared with the local people, despite that being a requisite step as per the ministry of housing and urban development. “The road space is reduced, leading to traffic snarls. Concretization will prevent water from percolating underground.” The residents have also demanded the civic body to share information and project plan with them and consider their opinions and requirements. “We plan to join hands and show our displeasure against Race Course, which is one of the city’s lung spaces, being systematically destroyed under the smart city initiative,” said Satish Balagopal, another resident. “We invite people to start walking the Race Course circle from anywhere in a clockwise direction at 6.30am on Wednesday.” The civic body has rebutted the residents’ claims. “We had discussed all the plans with the Race Course Walkers’ Association and Race Course and Neighbourhood Residents’ Associations. We haven’t felled any trees. Thomas Park was not a park, but a wrongly designed traffic island. In consultation with police, we will soon create another traffic island. We are not reducing greenery. We, in fact, plan to plant some native species,” an official clarified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-gives-up-stadium-plan-near-thomas-park/articleshow/82169194.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Allahabad HC encroached upon executive domain: Govt||LUCKNOW: UP government has welcomed SC’s decision to stay Allahabad HC’s directive to impose lockdown in five districts of the state. In its special leave petition (SLP) in SC on Tuesday, the government stated it had already imposed several restrictions, but apart from saving lives it also had to think of saving livelihoods. The government stated that high court had “effectively encroached upon the executive domain and passed a mandamus, which is incapable of being executed at the present stage, and if executed, is capable of creating panic and law and order situation in the state”. “These steps will help stop spread of the deadly virus and currently there is no need for a complete lockdown in Uttar Pradesh,” the petition said.It further stated that high court had “effectively encroached upon the executive domain and passed a mandamus, which is incapable of being executed at the present stage, and if executed, is capable of creating panic and law and order situation in the state”. The petition went on to say the order was an “outcome of an ‘irresistible belief’ of the High Court that imposition of lockdown was the only way to break the chain of infection”. Since it had not considered steps already taken by the government, the SLP said, the high court order had ventured into governance by “breaching the statutory principles of separation of powers between judiciary and executive”. The government said, it would not implement a lockdown in the state as such a “drastic measure” could trigger panic among people and the administration would have to mobilise logistical support to “provide either cooked or uncooked food to the needy”. Among the steps taken so far, the government stated in the SLP it announced a fine of Rs 1,000 for first violation of the mask rule and thereafter, violators have to pay a penalty of up to Rs 10,000 every time they were seen without a mask. The government has set up a system for contacting patients in home isolation and ensuring they are provided medical kits for at least one week. For migrant workers returning to UP from other states, the government has set up quarantine centres in every district, which have facilities for testing, food, medical aid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-encroached-upon-executive-domain-govt/articleshow/82170212.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The accused, Rajesh Gupta, a Lower Parel resident, was admitted to the Malabar Hill hospital last week. A few days ago, he complained that his oxygen level was low and that he should be shifted to another room where he could get better facility. The nurse checked Gupta’s oxygen level and said he was getting the required oxygen and there was no need for shifting him to another room. Angry with the response, Gupta hit the nurse with a kitchen knife’s butt and injured her. Seeing her bleeding, the accused managed to flee from the hospital, said a police source. A section of the hospital was recently converted into a Covid 19 section for treating patients. Meanwhile, the nurse alerted hospital authorities about the assault after which the Malabar Hill police registered a case against Gupta under section 324 (for voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the IPC. “Gupta was found on the road and taken into custody. He was brought to the police station for inquiry and later sent to another Covid center at Worli for treatment.Further legal action will be taken once he is discharged from the hospital,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-patient-attacks-nurse-with-knife-butt-over-treatment-in-mumbai/articleshow/82170761.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Rain adds to farmers’ woes as grain piles up in mandis||BATHINDA: Light rain on Tuesday caused considerable inconvenience to farmers sitting in mandis for the last three to four days. They are said to be waiting in mandis due to shortage of bardana (gunny and white plastic bags) apart from glut. Lack of arrangements made to cover heaps of wheat with tarpaulin has also compounded the problem. Farmers fear increase in moisture content in the wheat because of the rain, which would extend waiting time to sell it. Farmer Surinder Singh from Pharwahi village, who has been camping at Barnala grain market said, “I have been sitting here for the last three days. I hoped that the crop would be procured on Tuesday but due to some showers, it could not be procured even today. We are facing a double blow of shortage of bardana and vagaries of weather.” Piara Singh, another farmer sitting in the mandi for three days said, “the yield is lower by 5% to 6% this time and now, the inclement weather will increase moisture content, giving a reason to procurement agencies to delay procurement.” “Such weather could cause loss to wheat which could not be lifted from mandis due to any reason and is lying without cover. The grain in mandis could get discoloured if exposed to these weather conditions for long,” said a state procurement agency official on condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rain-adds-to-farmers-woes-as-heaps-of-grain-in-mandis-face-damage-risk/articleshow/82169168.cms||Neel Kamal

The measurements of these houses are being taken as part of the exercise to conduct a valuation of the houses to ascertain how much money was spent for their construction. According to vigilance officials, PWD officials have been asked to submit a report within a week. Also, vigilance department will conduct a valuation of the furnishings of the houses. Meanwhile, VACB is likely to question K M Shaji’s wife as she is the owner of some of the properties. VACB had seized Rs 47.3 lakh from Shaji’s house at Kannur on April 12. Also, officials had seized gold ornaments weighing 535g and 77 documents. Shaji was interrogated by vigilance on April 16 during which he said that the Rs 47.3 lakh seized during raids at his house in Kannur was part of the funds collected for election purposes. He had sought a week’s time to submit documents to prove the source of money. VACB had registered a case against the MLA after preliminary inquiry found that Shaji had amassed wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income from 2011 to 2020 by a margin of 166%. The inquiry was made on the basis of a petition filed by advocate MR Harish before the court of enquiry commissioner and special judge, Kozhikode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/vacb-seeks-help-of-pwd-for-valuation-of-shajis-homes/articleshow/82169196.cms||---

Two Covid care centres have started in Amreli on Tuesday — one in Savarkundla and other in Rajula. Solanki’s Royal line club got permission from the district administration to start the Covid care centre looking at the huge rush in the hospitals. If sources can be quoted, to earn some cheap publicity, Solanki also directed his workers to paste his photo stickers. But when media persons asked him, Solanki, refuted the allegations and said, “These stickers are pasted by the workers merely to ensure that the empty cylinders don’t get misplaced.” A four-time MLA from this constituency, Solanki was defeated by Congress’s Amrish Der in 2017 assembly election. Meanwhile, NGO Manav Mandir which provides stay for people with learning difficulties, has started a 100-bed centre in Savarkundla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/bjp-leaders-pics-pasted-on-oxygen-cylinders/articleshow/82168177.cms||---

Ludhiana-based dental surgeon Dr Amandeep Singh Bains who is part of the ‘Tractor2Twitter’ team, which ran a campaign urging Punjabi netizens to join Twitter and campaign there in support of protesting farmers, had filed RTI application seeking information from Delhi Police about specimen of Khalistani flag if any, specimen of Hindu Rashtra flag if any, specimen of all banned flags in India and Specimen of all flags hoisted on Lal Quila by protesting farmers. The online RTI application to the additional deputy commissioner of police, first North District, came to the Kotwali station house officer (SHO), who replied that the first three questions were not related to him and about the flags hoisted by protesting farmers at Red Fort information should be put to the Archaeological Survey of India’s office at the Red Fort. Tractor2Twitter team said on Monday: “Only the Delhi Police headquarters and not an ordinary police station will have the information we seek. But their answer suggests there is nothing like a banned flag of Khalistan that couldn’t be hoisted. From now on if news channels will insult a Sikh flag, we will take legal action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/delhi-cops-ducked-queries-on-banned-flags-tractor2twitter/articleshow/82169201.cms||IP Singh

The party said the government’s decision to make 50% vaccine supply available directly to the open market would shift the burden on state governments and condemned the move as “discriminatory, anti-equity and haphazard”. “This policy is essentially an effort to liberalise vaccine sales and deregulate prices, without augmenting supply. The Centre has failed for a year to do anything to ramp up adequate and needed vaccine supplies. This is a recipe for exclusion of crores of people who will find it unaffordable to procure the life-saving vaccine,” CPM said in a statement. The party’s politburo said so far, vaccines were made available to states free of cost, but with the change in policy, they will now need to “procure” them from the open market without price regulation, leading to black marketing and hoarding. This, CPM said, would allow vaccine makers to declare their “self-set vaccine price” and would exclude an overwhelming majority of India’s people from the vaccination drive, especially the poor. “This is not going to mitigate the pandemic or resolve the huge public health emergency that our people face. On the contrary, such a discriminatory policy will only make India more vulnerable to the pandemic surge,” the party added. CPM also demanded that states be funded for the vaccines from the central exchequer so that the vaccination programme remained free and universal, as has been “independent India’s heritage and practice”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cpm-slams-new-vaccine-policy-says-govt-trying-to-absolve-itself-from-colossal-health-crisis/articleshow/82172012.cms||Swati Mathur

The decision was taken at a meeting with ministers and senior officials. Currently, vaccination at government facilities for those above the age of 45 years is free. At private facilities, one is required to pay Rs 250 per shot for any of the two vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin. However, the government has not clarified whether its decision would be applicable to private facilities as well. During the meeting, the CM directed the health department to chalk out a plan for implementation of the vaccination rollout. This would include raising vaccination centres and preparing a database for target age-groups. The department would also have to assess the requirement for vaccines based on number of beneficiaries and plan for procurement. Cold chain and safe-storage facilities will also have to be arranged. The CM said, ministers in charge of various districts should carry out regular reviews of bed availability and ensure their numbers are doubled. They should also ensure availability of sufficient oxygen, Remdesivir and other essential medicines. The ministers have also been asked to coordinate with local administration to ensure people are wearing masks and quarantine centres are operational, ambulances are available and integrated command and control centres are operational.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/up-govt-announces-free-vaccination-for-18-plus-citizens/articleshow/82176839.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The rate, in D ward, which comprises areas like Nepeansea Road, Malabar Hill and Pedder Road, is 1.86%. In comparison, the city's average is 1.46%. Next is H-West ward (Bandra, Khar and Santacruz), with a rate of 1.84%. Officials say that currently most new cases are from contact tracing while index cases are few. Last July too, when the city's average Covid case growth rate was 1.34%, D ward had a rate of 2.1% and H-West 1.55%. In the first week of September, D and H-West had 1.44% and 1.4% compared to the city's 1.1%. In D ward, the BMC has seaed several high-rise buildings in each of which over five Covid cases were reported. The plush Embassy Apartments alongside the Russsian consulate was unsealed on April 19, while both wings of Dariya Mahal on Nepeansea Road continue to remain sealed after 16 cases were reported. The ward's assistant municipal commissioner, Prashant Gaikwad, said 95% of cases are from buildings and only 5% from slums. "We are following all micro-containment zone guidelines and have explained the same to the residents of sealed buildings. The ratio of index cases to other positive cases is 1:3. A person is infecting family members and at times also household help and drivers. We have increased testing," he said. Malabar Hill activist Indrani Malkani said the problem is that people are still not following Covid-appropriate behaviour despite being into the second year of the pandemic. "People will be seen wearing face masks that are falling off their nose or using a hand sanitizer only for the sake of it and not to ensure that they are protecting themselves from infectious germs. The problem is also asymptomatic people infecting others," she said. On a positive note, in H-West, where till recently over 500 cases were being reported, since April 15 the numbers are down to 350-400 a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-climbing-fastest-in-malabar-hill-ward-in-mumbai/articleshow/82170813.cms||Richa Pinto

Already, there are 78 startups working out of the incubator in Kochi and the next batch will have 15-20 new startups. “The next set of applications are coming in – around 75 applications are there now and we are now reviewing who can get on board. We still have space to allocate and we need startups to come up. There are some interesting ideas [with the applicants], some related to the pandemic and others generally in the electronics innovation side like the internet of things (IoT) or robotics space,” Mohammed said. The first level of screening, the internal one, of the new applications is already over and the next level is with the external committees. “We will do the due diligence and if everything goes well, by mid-May we might ask them to join us,” he said. Of the 75 applications received, some were not related to electronics and they had to be weeded out, Mohammed said. “We don’t take the whole batch because we want to devote our resources to the most-promising ones for the socio-economic development and coming out with innovative products. Our screening process will be a little bit stringent going forward also,” he said. When a startup is successful in finding a place in Maker Village, initially support is given for a period of 18 months, starting from the ideation and then going through proof-of-concept and prototype stages before reaching a market-viable product (MVP). “We extend the 18 months to 30 or 40 months too, if needed,” he said. Of the existing startups in Maker Village, a few of them have already come up with MVP and they have started getting orders also. “But they still want to be associated with us because we have the facilities and the ecosystem with us,” Mohammed said. Soon, Maker Village will be coming up with innovation challenges that are open to students across Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/next-startup-batch-to-join-maker-village-in-may/articleshow/82169233.cms||Shenoy Karun

The letter reads that till the lockdown is in place, the government should grant relief of Rs 5,000 to families whose livelihood has been robbed completely. “The homeless, street vendors, ragpickers, construction labourers, housemaids and other workers in the unorganised sector should be given the relief of Rs 5,000 till lockdown ends and Rs 2,000 till their livelihood restores completely,” the letter said. It also stressed the need of providing pulses and oil to the beneficiaries of the National Food Security Act (NFSA). “Additional 5kg wheat should be given to beneficiaries like it was given during lockdown,” the letter said. Raising the issue of hunger among construction labourers, the letter said Indira Rasoi Yojana should run from small towns to big city areas where poor and needy families reside.

---||Jaipur||Industry steps in to meet oxygen shortage at hosps||Jaipur: In an office order on Sunday the central home secretary had prohibited the industrial use of oxygen to divert them for meeting rising medical demand. But here in Rajasthan, the industry has come forward to donate cylinders to government hospitals. JCB, which has a manufacturing plant in the Mahindra World City Jaipur, has provided 20 cylinders, while National Engineering Industries (NEI), which makes bearings, has given 15 cylinders. Jaipur-based Unitech Industries which makes transformers and corrugation tanks has been providing 50 cylinders for the past few days. Industrial units in Bhiwadi have collectively provided 500 cylinders. Bhilwara industries members have given 250 cylinders. Shree Cement has been providing 125 cylinders for the past few days. Hindustan Zinc Ltd, which has its plant for own use is also providing 5 tonnes of oxygen daily. There are several others who are voluntarily donating cylinders for the needy patients. Dispatching the cylinders to RUHS Medical College, NEI said in the letter, “Kindly return the empty cylinders after use as the same are very costly and refilling will be arranged”. Sanjay Saboo, chairman, CII-Rajasthan, which is facilitating and coordinating between the industries and the medical department, said, “The industry is equally concerned about the crisis. If they have spare cylinders, they are providing them to the government so that lives can be saved.” But in coming days, the industry will not be able to provide more as the oxygen manufacturing units have come under the central government. “We have given all our spare capacity and from now on it would be difficult for us as we will not able to lift new capacity from the oxygen manufacturing units, production and supply of which is now controlled by the Centre,” said one of the companies. In the order, the centre has allowed only eight categories of industries to get supply of the oxygen cylinders and prohibited all other industrial use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/industry-steps-in-to-meet-oxygen-shortage-at-hosps/articleshow/82169223.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
