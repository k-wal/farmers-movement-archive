In the rail sector, total freight loading was the maximum ever at 1,233 million tonnes up by around 2% over the previous year and freight revenue too showed a rise of 3% over 2019-20. Both the key infrastructure ministries created the records despite losing the first three months due to the Covid induced lockdown. “We achieved construction of 37 km per day, which is a record, though it's a little short of the 40 km target I had set. We have maintained the parameters that UPA had followed for measuring the construction,” Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said on Thursday while felicitating the officers and engineers for this achievement. While the cumulative NH construction at 13,400 km exceeded the target set by the highways ministry by 20%, the government could achieve the target in award of contracts at 10,000 km. Sources said while NHAI, which mostly constructs highways of four lanes or more reported the highest ever construction of around 4,100 km, falling a little short of the target, the construction and widening of highways by the road ministry was close to 8,000 km compared to the target of 5,680 km. The road ministry largely executes highway projects through the state public works departments (PWDs). NHIDCL, another wing of highways ministry that undertakes road works in the north-east and hill states, reported construction of 1,053 km in 2020-21. Addressing officials on Wednesday, Union railway minister Piyush Goyal had said the total loading of freight was expected to cross 1,230 MTs when the final figure for 2020-21 was out. He said this achievement was registered despite the shortfall of 70 MTs during the first four month of 2020-21. Goyal said railways had been setting records every month since September registering the highest ever loading of freight. Railway ministry officials also said the revenue from freight movement had touched Rs 1.17 lakh crore early Wednesday, which was 3% more than 2019-20. Goyal said, had revenue from passenger segments not been hit the railways would have achieved an even better record||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/highway-and-rail-infra-registered-record-growth-despite-covid-blues-in-first-quarter-of-year/articleshow/81787796.cms||Dipak K Dash

Under the new norms, only one physical document in the prescribed format along with a soft copy is required to be submitted by applicants, having beneficial ownership in countries sharing land border with India, seeking registration of bidders for government procurement, according to an office memorandum. Issuing instructions for submitting revised format for registration of bidders from countries sharing land border with India, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has stated that the applicant would be asked to submit additional hard copies, if required, at a later date. In July last year, the government amended the General Financial Rules 2017 to enable imposition of restrictions on bidders from countries which share a land border with India on grounds of defence, or matters directly or indirectly related to national security. As per the order any bidder from such countries sharing a land border with India will be eligible to bid in any procurement whether of goods, services (including consultancy services and non-consultancy services) or works (including turnkey projects) only if the bidder is registered with the competent authority. "...henceforth only one hard copy in the prescribed format along with a soft copy is required to be submitted by the applicants seeking registration having beneficial ownership in land border sharing countries in accordance with the Department of Expenditure order...," it has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dpiit-revises-application-format-for-registration-of-bidders-from-countries-sharing-land-border/articleshow/81788238.cms||---

Nandigram in West Bengal is all set for a similar high-octane political battle between two politicians who were once together but today are on the opposite sides of the political divide. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her once-trusted aide Suvendu Adhikari both owe a lot to Nandigram for their political identity in the state. The movement against Tata’s Nano project in Singur and Nandigram was greatly instrumental in catapulting Mamata to power in 2011 and also in making Suvendu a powerful leader in the region. Ten years down the line, the people of the region still seem to be debating if opposition to industry was the right thing to do. Some who got their lands back and successfully returned to farming are a happy lot. But several others who could not gain substantially from farming have been left wondering if industry would have been a better option. And while the “farming versus industry” division of the population is one aspect of the region’s politics, there is another divide that is being talked about in Nandigram in the run up to the 2021 assembly elections - the 70:30 division. Suvendu Adhikari, the BJP candidate for Nandigram, in one of his election rallies in January claimed that Mamata’s political strategist Prashant Kishor had said that Trinamool Congress will get complete support of 30 per cent of the population, a reference to the minorities in the state of West Bengal. Adhikari then went on to appeal to the remaining 70 per cent of the population to stay united and defeat the ruling Trinamool in the state. With the BJP aggressively targeting Mamata over appeasement politics, the Trinamool chief has been forced to do course correction with temple visits and doles to Hindu priests in the run up to the election. So, will the voters of Nandigram get influenced by the “farming versus industries” debate or are they likely to get polarised on religious lines? Nandigram over the years has seen some close contests suggesting that religious polarisation may not have been the dominant factor during voting. In 1996, the Congress won this seat by only 138 votes (.11 per cent). In fact, the victory margin has been less than 10 per cent in Nandigram in several other assembly elections between 1977 and 2011. However, in the 2016 assembly elections, Suvendu Adhikari won the seat on a TMC ticket by over 80,000 votes which translated into a victory margin of 40.30 per cent. In 2011 also, the TMC’s victory margin was 43,640 votes, which translated into 25.42%.

The company will also offer a Feed Filter Bar that would allow users to switch between algorithmic ranking of their feed or show content in the order it was posted. The changes come as the world’s largest social network has been under fire for amplifying hate speech and misinformation globally across its platforms. Users can manage the comments for any public post by choosing from options such as anyone who can view the post can comment or only people and pages they tag, Facebook said here in a blog post. Separately, Nick Clegg, vice president of Global Affairs at Facebook, claimed in a Medium post on Wednesday that the company’s algorithms do not lead to polarisation. “The reality is, it’s not in Facebook’s interest — financially or reputationally — to continually turn up the temperature and push users towards ever more extreme content,” Clegg said. He also noted that majority of Facebook’s revenue comes from advertising, and advertisers would not want their brands and products displayed right next to “extreme or hateful content.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/facebook-denies-fueling-polarisation-launches-tools-to-control-feed/articleshow/81788520.cms||---

"I suppose this was because the elections in Kerala are around the corner. Because I didn't hear a single word about the sisters who were harassed in Jhansi," she said, a day after Modi targeted the ruling LDF over the gold smuggling scam in a poll rally in Palakkad, saying the CPI(M)-led government "betrayed" the people, just as Judas did to Jesus for a few pieces of silver". Addressing an election rally here, Gandhi said there was nothing more hollow than quoting from the Bible "to sow seeds of division and hatred in the country". She said she has worked for many years with the nuns belonging to Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity in Delhi, who taught her how to clean the wounds of the destitutes. "I worked for many years with my sisters in Mother Teresa's order of Missionaries of Charity. I was a volunteer at their homes in Delhi", Gandhi said while narrating her experience as a volunteer the sisters of Mother Teresa's order. "They showed me the dignity of service. And today when I meet them often, they tell me of how they are persecuted," she said. Hitting out at the Prime Minister, the Congress general secretary said she found it very interesting when Modi "quoted from the Holy Bible". "There is nothing more farcical than quoting the lines of Jesus on a political stage and unleashing the prosecution on those whose lives are spent on serving the poor," Gandhi said. She said it was Jesus Christ who exposed the tyranny of a ruler, whose greed and selfishness ravaged his people. Slamming the Centre, she said everybody knows how the central government, headed by Modi, has "divided our own country in the name of religion". The Prime Minister, while attacking the Left government on the gold smuggling case allegedly involving the former principal secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, had remarked about LDF - "Judas. Judas betrayed Lord Christ for a few pieces of silver. LDF has betrayed Kerala for a few pieces of gold." Modi sought to link the betrayal of Jesus by Judas in exchange for money, to the gold smuggling case in the rally held during the Holy Week being observed by the Christian community. During Holy Week, Christians recall the events leading up to Jesus death by crucifixion, his betrayal by Judas during the week in exchange for money, and, according to their faith, Jesus' Resurrection. Judas was one of the 12 Apostles of Jesus. On Monday, union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal had dismissed as wrong, the charges that two nuns and two postulants belonging to a Kerala-based congregation were attacked during a train journey via Uttar Pradesh recently and alleged that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was "making false statements" on the issue. Vijayan on Tuesday dubbed Goyal's statement as 'shameful' and an 'utter lie'. The alleged incident occurred at Jhansi railway station on March 19 had its echoes in poll-bound Kerala last week with Vijayan taking it up with the Centre and Home Minister Amit Shah promising strong action||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/priyanka-gandhi-takes-on-modi-for-quoting-from-bible-at-rally/articleshow/81788434.cms||---

---||World||New York is latest state to legalize recreational marijuana||New Yorkers over the age of 21 can now possess and use up to 3 ounces of cannabis in public under a legalization bill signed Wednesday by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, while sales of recreational-use marijuana won't become legal for an estimated 18 months until the state draws up regulations. Advocates for criminal justice reform hope it will also help redress the inequities of a system that has locked up people of color for marijuana offenses at disproportionate rates. The legislation provides protections for cannabis users in the workplace, housing, family court and in schools, colleges and universities, and sets a target of providing half of marijuana licenses to individuals from underrepresented communities. And police could no longer use the odor of cannabis as pretext for searching someone's car for contraband. ``By placing community reinvestment, social equity, and justice front and center, this law is the new gold standard for reform efforts nationwide,'' Melissa Moore, New York state director of the Drug Policy Alliance, said. New York will start automatically expunging the criminal records of individuals with certain past marijuana-related convictions, and law enforcement in the state won't be able to arrest or prosecute individuals for possession of marijuana up to 3 ounces. That's a step beyond a 2019 law that expunged many past convictions for marijuana possession and reduced the penalty for possessing small amounts. Unlike all other states that have legalized recreational marijuana, New Yorkers over the age of 21 can now smoke cannabis in public, including on sidewalks. ``No adult-use legalization state permits the personal use of cannabis in public,'' Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the nation's oldest cannabis reform advocacy organization, said. ``In every state it remains a penalty, typically a civil one.'' The law immediately allows using cannabis in public spaces, though New Yorkers can't smoke or vape marijuana in locations prohibited by state law, including workplaces, indoors bars and restaurants, colleges and universities, hospitals and within 100 feet of a school. And stricter local rules on smoking apply: New York City banned smoking in parks and beaches, while Great Neck on Long Island bans has banned smoking on sidewalks in front of commercial buildings. Local governments can pass stricter rules on marijuana use and impose small civil penalties as long as they don't ``completely or essentially prohibit a person`` from lawful use of marijuana. ``This legislation is pretty broad, that looks like it was the intention of the state Legislature,`` New York State Association of Counties Executive Director Stephen Acquario said. ``It looks like it was also their intention for local governments to further regulate that in the community.'' The new law allows cities, towns and villages to opt out of allowing adult-use cannabis retail dispensaries or on-site consumption licenses by passing a local law by Dec. 31, 2021, or nine months after the effective date of the legislation. They cannot opt out of legalization. Mackenzie Stevenson, a 20-year-old portrait photographer and dental assistant in central New York, was thrilled at the news. She has a relative with epilepsy who's been greatly helped by medical marijuana. ``I've seen the benefits it's had for her, so I'm excited for more people to be able to benefit from it,'' she said. While the marketplace will take a while to set up, estimates by the trade publication Marijuana Business Daily show New York could become the largest on the East Coast _ generating a potential $2.3 billion in annual sales by its fourth year. Cuomo said it could take years to collect about $300 million in annual tax revenues, though Republicans are skeptical the state will see that much. California was forced to cut $223 million from state budget projections in 2019 due to slower-than-expected pot sales. Tax revenues from marijuana would first cover the state's cost of regulating and enforcing the marijuana legalization law, with the remainder divided among schools, drug treatment and prevention programs and a fund for investing in job skills, adult education, mental health and other services in communities that bore the brunt of the national and state drug war. New York will set a 9% sales tax on cannabis plus an additional 4% county and local tax and another tax based on the level of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. Sen. Liz Krueger, the legislation's Senate sponsor, estimates marijuana will end up facing an effective tax rate of around 20 to 21% in New York. ``In the beginning, marijuana prices will be higher because there's less of it available,'' she said. ``So the tax rate will actually be lower. As market matures and there's more product in the legal market, the pricing with the tax will average around a 20 to 21% tax rate.'' The state will provide loans, grants and incubator programs to encourage participation in the cannabis industry by people from minority communities, as well as small farmers, women and disabled veterans. Krueger said the state can't mandate giving 50% of licenses to underrepresented communities because it could be unconstitutional. ``Fifty percent is a very high bar to try to reach, but if it happens, it would be amazing,'' said Hillary Peckham, chief operator of Etain Health, a women-owned New York medical cannabis company that is considering applying for a recreational marijuana license if it becomes legal. ``The next step is to see how the regulations and the program are stood up to actually provide those opportunities,'' added Peckham, whose company has four dispensaries around the state. Social equity emerged as a key theme in marijuana legalization in recent years, with newly legal states trying to build it in and others seeking to make up for a lack of diversity in the businesses they approved earlier. But the plans haven't played out as intended in many places. Illinois, for instance, was touted for the equity provisions in its 2019 law. But that has drawn criticism and legal action from some Black-owned businesses that were passed over. Illinois has since revised its process in an effort to address those issues. New York joins at least 15 other states that have legalized recreational marijuana, including neighboring New Jersey. Voters moved to legalize recreational and medical use of marijuana in South Dakota in November, though it is currently being challenged in the state's Supreme Court. Opponents of legalization include law enforcement organizations and groups representing parents, who are concerned legalization will encourage marijuana use among children and lead to more traffic accidents caused by impaired drivers. ``We are in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, and with the serious crisis of youth vaping and the continuing opioid epidemic, this harmful legislation is counterintuitive,'' several organizations wrote in an open letter earlier this month. Supporters who hope legalization will reduce illegal sales say it's already easy for young adults to access marijuana and that there's no clear link between marijuana legalization and impaired driving accidents. New York officials plan to conduct a study that will examine the extent that cannabis impairs driving, and whether it depends on factors like time and metabolism. The law also allows state police to receive sales revenue to train more officers as ``drug recognition experts,'' though University at Buffalo professor R. Lorraine Collins said there's no evidence those experts can tell whether someone's high or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-york-is-latest-state-to-legalize-recreational-marijuana/articleshow/81788818.cms||---
---||Business||ByteDance says it is 'bleeding' due to bank account freeze, no relief from court||MUMBAI: The Mumbai high court on Wednesday granted no relief to China’s ByteDance, owner of the TikTok video app, in a case where the company challenged the local tax authority’s decision to block its bank accounts in India, dealing a blow to its operations. The authorities in mid-March blocked ByteDance’s bank accounts for alleged tax evasion, prompting the company to ask a court to quash the directive which it feared would hurt its operations. A two-judge bench at the high court in Mumbai city heard the plea of a ByteDance counsel who said the company was “bleeding” and needed funds to pay staff salaries and rent, but the court gave no relief. “I’m completely hanged. I need some oxygen to survive. All bank accounts are frozen. I have to pay salary to the staff,” ByteDance’s counsel Prakash Shah told the court, adding that four of the company’s bank accounts had been blocked. After hearing objections from a government counsel, the court said the case will next be heard on April 6. ByteDance, which has said it disagrees with the tax authority’s decision, said in a statement late on Wednesday it was confident in its legal position and was looking forward to a ruling by the court. ByteDance in January cut its Indian workforce after New Delhi retained a ban on its popular video app TikTok, first prohibited last year following a border clash between India and China. China has repeatedly criticised India’s move. ByteDance still has around 1,300 employees in India, most of whom service its overseas operations, including work on activities such as content moderation. Authorities ordered ByteDance India’s accounts at Citibank and HSBC to be blocked this month because of alleged evasion of certain taxes in online advertising dealings between the ByteDance unit in India and its parent entity in Singapore, TikTok Pte Ltd, Reuters reported. Last year, the tax authorities inspected documents at ByteDance’s office and questioned some executives in relation to the advertising and other transactions with its parent entity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bytedance-says-it-is-bleeding-due-to-bank-account-freeze-no-relief-from-court/articleshow/81788895.cms||---

With the death tollMacron was forced to abandon his goal of keeping the country open to protect the economy. "We will lose control if we do not move now," the president said in a televised address to the nation. His announcement means that movement restrictions already in place for more than a week in Paris, and some northern and southern regions, will now apply to the whole country for at least a month, from Saturday. Departing from his pledge to safeguard education from the pandemic, Macron said schools will close for three weeks after this weekend. Macron, 43, has sought to avoid a third large-scale lockdown since the start of the year, betting that if he could steer France out of the pandemic without locking the country down again he would give the economy a chance to recover from last year's slump. But the former investment banker's options narrowed as more contagious strains of the coronavirus swept across France and much of Europe. For school-children after this weekend, learning will be done remotely for a week, after which all schools go on a two-week holiday. Thereafter, nursery and primary pupils will return to school while middle and high school pupils continue distance learning for an extra week. "It is the best solution to slow down the virus," Macron said, adding that France had succeeded in keeping its schools open for longer during the pandemic than many neighbours. Daily new infections in France have doubled since February to nearly 40,000. The number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care has breached 5,000, exceeding the peak hit during a six-week-long lockdown late last year. Bed capacity in critical care units will be increased to 10,000, Macron said. The new restrictions risk slowing the pace of recovery in the euro zone's second-largest economy from last year's slump. Macron said the vaccine rollout needed to be accelerated. It is only now finding its stride three months in, with just 12% of the population inoculated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/macron-orders-covid-19-lockdown-across-all-of-france-closes-schools/articleshow/81789657.cms||---

Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and R S Sharma, chief executive of the National Health Authority who oversees the Co-Win system, reviewed preparedness with states and UTs and said there was no shortage of vaccines and urged that private hospitals should be promptly supplied stocks to encourage vaccination.   The Centre assured states that it would continually replenish the stocks based on consumption trends. “There is no value in conserving vaccines for the second dose and states must promptly supply vaccines to all government and private hospitals where there is demand,” Sharma told states. After a weekend and Holi, close to 20 lakh shots were delivered on March 30. Coronavirus live updatesThe Centre said efforts should be made to keep vaccine wastage under 1% and regularly review use of the shots. At present, the average wastage is pegged at 6%. Read AlsoVaccinate all 45+ in 2 weeks, says govtThe Centre on Tuesday said door-to-door vaccination against Covid-19 may not be feasible, even as it asked states to ensure 100% saturation of vaccination of the priority age group of those above 45 years in the next fortnight, particularly in high burden districts seeing a surge of fresh cases.States have also been asked to ensure there is no pile-up of vaccine stocks at any level of storage, distribution is based on consumption to avoid over- or under-stocking at cold chain points and Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) and to carry out regular review of vaccine stocks to identify gap areas and address these expeditiously. The Centre stressed the need to involve more private hospitals. On Wednesday, only 6,457 vaccination sessions were in private facilities, while 42,502 were in government hospitals. Read AlsoDelhi records 1,819 Covid-19 cases, 11 deathsThe city 1,558 cases on Saturday, 1,534 cases on Friday, 1,515 cases on Thursday, 1,254 cases on Wednesday and 1,101 cases last Tuesday, when it crossed the 1,000-mark for the first time since December 24.Till 7pm on Wednesday, 6.4 crore vaccine doses were given in the country. Of this, over 3 crore were first doses to people above 60, whereas 76.7 lakh people between 45 and 60 with co-morbidities received the vaccine. Around 92.6 lakh people were fully vaccinated with two doses till 7 pm on Wednesday. The government is expecting an upswing in numbers from April 1 when all those above 45, irrespective of co-morbidities, will be eligible for vaccination against Covid-19. While registration for vaccination will be available both online and onsite, those opting for onsite registration will have to go after 3pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-hoard-for-2nd-shot-govt-to-states-as-vaccine-opens-for-45/articleshow/81792045.cms||Sushmi Dey

The new rates, effective Thursday and applicable for the first quarter, coincide with the government’s move to tax interest income on annual employee contributions of over Rs 2.5 lakh in provident fund, while giving government employees exemption up to Rs 5 lakh contribution. The move has already prompted several private sector employees to review their voluntary contributions to escape the Rs 2.5 lakh threshold.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); The rate of interest on public provident fund is now at 6.4%, its lowest since 1974 (a 46-year low), according to National Savings Institute data. The latest rate action on small savings will go beyond active workers to include senior citizens as well as the girl child, who are major beneficiaries of the schemes. Senior citizens are already amongst the worst hit by falling rates as bank fixed deposit rates have crashed, leaving them with lower interest income. Senior Citizens Saving Schemes and National Savings Scheme will see a 90-basis point reduction, while the popular PPF and Kisan Vikas Patras will see a 70-basis point fall. The sharpest cut of 110 basis points (100 basis points equal a percentage point) was reserved for one-year fixed deposits, while three-year deposits will see a mere 40 basis points cut. For senior citizens with five-year deposits, the new rates are in line with the rate on three to five years deposits offered by State Bank of India, which is also at 5.8%. But the bank is paying higher than post office deposits in maturity buckets of one, two or three years. In case of other deposits, SBI is currently offering higher rates across maturities. The move will provide relief to banks, which compete with these schemes when it comes to raising deposits. Although the government has been arguing for a market-linked interest rate on small savings schemes, its actions have not always been in line with the market movement. The revised interest rate of 6.4% on PPF, where up to Rs 1.5 lakh can be deposited annually, is significantly lower than the 8.5% proposed to be paid by the Employees Provident Fund in 2020-21. In both cases the tax benefits make the returns higher. Besides, both savings instruments come with the power of compounding. So, after a certain period your annual contribution can be matched by the interest income that you earn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-slashes-rates-on-small-savings-by-up-to-110-basis-points/articleshow/81795385.cms||---

The resumption of import of these items will lead to the country’s partial revival of trade relations with India. In August 2019, Pakistan had downgraded trade relations with India in reaction to New Delhi’s decision to revoke Article 370 of its Constitution, which granted Jammu and Kashmir special status. There was no response from India to the development until late in the evening. Pakistan’s decision to import from India follows the February ceasefire agreement that had sparked speculation about possible efforts by both countries towards normalising ties. However, even as the Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers participated in a multilateral conference in Tajikistan on Tuesday, there was no meeting between the two. To ensure there was no shortage of essential drugs amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Pakistan had lifted the ban on import of medicines and raw material from India in May 2020. This was the first step of reversing the complete suspension of trade with India. Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is also minister-in-charge of commerce and textiles, had approved the summaries of importing goods from India before placing it for approval of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad after chairing a meeting of the ECC, the finance minister said the government had allowed the private sector to import 0.5 million tonnes of sugar from India. “The price of sugar is much lower in India as compared to Pakistan, so we have decided to reopen sugar trade with the neighbouring country for up to 0.5 million tonnes for the private sector,” the minister said. On allowing import of cotton from India, Azhar said there was high demand for it because Pakistan’s textiles exports had increased but last year’s cotton crop was not good. “The price of the commodity in India is lower than what it is in Pakistan. The import of cotton and yarn through the Wagah border will help meet domestic requirements at reasonable rates,” Azhar said, adding that import of cotton from India for small industries would take place until June. India is the world’s biggest producer of cotton and the second biggest sugar producer. The import of sugar will help Pakistan lower its soaring prices ahead of the holy month of Ramadan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pakistan-to-import-sugar-cotton-from-india/articleshow/81797194.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||World||Biden announces huge infrastructure plan to 'win the future'||PITTSBURGH: President Joe Biden on Wednesday outlined a $2.3 trillion plan to reengineer the nation's infrastructure over the next eight years in what he billed as ``a once in a generation investment in America'' that would undo his predecessor's signature legislative achievement of giant tax cuts for corporations in the process. Speaking at a carpenters union training center in Pittsburgh, Biden drew comparisons between his hard-hatted proposed transformation of the US economy and the space race and promised results as grand in scale as the New Deal or Great Society programs that shaped the 20th century. ``It's not a plan that tinkers around the edges,`` Biden said. ``It's a once-in-a-generation investment in America unlike anything we've seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago. In fact, it's the largest American jobs investment since World War II. It will create millions of jobs, good-paying jobs.'' White House officials say the spending would generate those jobs as the country shifts away from fossil fuels and combats the perils of climate change. It is also an effort to compete with the technology and public investments made by China, which has the world's second-largest economy and is fast gaining on the United States' dominant position. ``I'm convinced that if we act now, in 50 years people are going to look back and say this is the moment when America won the future,'' Biden said. Funding for the infrastructure projects would come from a hike on corporate taxes that would aim to raise the necessary piles of money over 15 years and then reduce the deficit going forward. In doing so, Biden would undo the action by Trump and congressional Republicans to lift the corporate tax rate to 28% from the 21% rate set in a 2017 overhaul. ``Ninety-one Fortune 500 Companies, including Amazon, pay not a single solitary penny in income tax,'' Biden said. Wednesday's announcement will be followed in coming weeks by Biden pushing a companion bill of roughly equal size for investments in child care, family tax credits and other domestic programs. That nearly $2 trillion package would be paid for by tax hikes on wealthy individuals and families. ``Wall Street didn't build this country,`` Biden said. ``You, the great middle class, built this country. And unions built the middle class.'' Biden's choice of Pittsburgh for unveiling the plan carried important economic and political resonance. He not only won Pittsburgh and its surrounding county to help secure the presidency, but he launched his campaign there in 2019. The city famed for steel mills that powered America's industrial rise has steadily pivoted toward technology and health care, drawing in college graduates in a sign of how economies can change. The Democratic president's infrastructure projects would be financed by higher corporate taxes _ a trade-off that could lead to fierce resistance from the business community and thwart attempts to work with Republicans lawmakers. Biden hopes to pass an infrastructure plan by summer, which could mean relying solely on the slim Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate. The White House says the largest chunk of the proposal includes $621 billion for roads, bridges, public transit, electric vehicle charging stations and other transportation infrastructure. The spending would push the country away from internal combustion engines that the auto industry views as an increasingly antiquated technology. An additional $111 billion would go to replace lead water pipes and upgrade sewers. Broadband internet would blanket the country for $100 billion. Separately, $100 billion would upgrade the power grid to deliver clean electricity. Homes would get retrofitted, schools modernized, workers trained and hospitals renovated under the plan, which also seeks to strengthen U.S. manufacturing. The new construction could keep the economy running hot, coming on the heels of Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. Economists already estimate it could push growth above 6% this year. To keep companies from shifting profits overseas to avoid taxation, a 21% global minimum tax would be imposed. The tax code would also be updated so that companies could not merge with a foreign business and avoid taxes by moving their headquarters to a tax haven. And among other provisions, it would increase IRS audits of corporations. Biden appealed for Republicans and the business community to join him in negotiations on the bill, but the legislative prospects for Biden's twin proposals already appear to hinge on Democrats coming up with the votes on their own through the budget reconciliation process, which requires just a simple majority in the 50-50 Senate. ``I'm going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office, listen to them, what they have to say and be open to other ideas,`` Biden said. ``We'll have a good faith negotiation. Any Republican who wants to help get this done. But we have to get it done.'' Democratic leaders embraced Biden's plan on Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said it would create millions of jobs. ``I look forward to working with President Biden to pass a big, bold plan that will drive America forward for decades to come,'' Schumer said at an event in Buffalo. But key GOP and business leaders were already panning the package. ``It seems like President Biden has an insatiable appetite to spend more money and raise people's taxes,'' Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the GOP whip, said in an interview. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell dismissed Biden's package as nothing more than a ``Trojan horse'' for tax hikes. The business community favors updating U.S. infrastructure but dislikes higher tax rates. U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley, said in a statement that ``we applaud the Biden administration for making infrastructure a top priority. However, we believe the proposal is dangerously misguided when it comes to how to pay for infrastructure.'' The Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs, would rather have infrastructure funded with user fees such as tolls. Trump, in a statement, blasted his successor's proposal, claiming it ``would be among the largest self-inflicted economic wounds in history.'' Infrastructure spending usually holds the promise of juicing economic growth, but by how much remains a subject of political debate. Commutes and shipping times could be shortened, while public health would be improved and construction jobs would bolster consumer spending. Standard & Poor's chief U.S. economist, Beth Ann Bovino, estimated last year that a $2.1 trillion boost in infrastructure spending could add as much as $5.7 trillion in income to the entire economy over a decade. Those kinds of analyses have led liberal Democrats in Congress such as Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal to conclude Tuesday, ``The economic consensus is that infrastructure pays for itself over time.'' But the Biden administration is taking a more cautious approach than some Democrats might like. After $1.9 trillion in pandemic aid and $4 trillion in relief last year, the administration is trying to avoid raising the national debt to levels that would trigger higher interest rates and make it harder to repay. Biden's efforts may also be complicated by demands from a handful of Democratic lawmakers who say they cannot support the bill unless it addresses the $10,000 cap on individuals' state and local tax deductions put in place under Trump and a Republican-led Congress. With a narrow majority in the House, they could conceivably quash any bill that doesn't significantly lift the cap or repeal it entirely. ``I can only vote for a bill that has meaningful tax impact for my constituents if it addresses the SALT cap,'' tweeted Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J. ``We say No SALT, no deal,'' said Democratic Reps. Tom Suozzi of New York and Bill Pascrell and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey in a joint statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-announces-huge-infrastructure-plan-to-win-the-future/articleshow/81798919.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata civic body may bring back C-zones as Covid cases rise in busy pockets||KOLKATA: Acting on a Nabanna advisory, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) is exploring the option of bringing back case-specific, area-wise containment zones after a resurgence in Covid cases in the past three weeks. While Kolkata saw a jump in new cases from 265 to 380 between Tuesday and Wednesday, the number of new cases in Bengal leaped to 982 on Wednesday from 628 a day earlier. According to KMC health department sources, the civic body’s borough health officials have recently set alarm bells ringing after a sudden and rapid rise of cases. These cases are mostly being reported from high-rises, housing complexes and crowded markets. These are the places which could be declared as containment zones. In all probability, the civic brass will declare such containment zones after the Assembly polls and when a clear instruction from the state secretariat reaches the civic headquarters. Though the KMC health department is yet to come up with a list of probable containment zones, sources maintained that markets in the Burrabazar-Jorasanko belt, high-rises in the Bhowanipore-Alipore belt and housing complexes and stand-alone buildings in large areas of Behala, Tollygunge, Garia, Jadavpur and some neighbourhoods off EM Bypass were under scanner. However, this time, the concept of a containment zone will be stricter, said a civic official. “During the last phase of containment zones last year, we had shown leniency to residents of those areas. Now we need to impose strict rules for entry and exit of people or vehicles. We are in touch with the cops to enforce such containment zones once we get a green signal from the state secretariat,” a KMC health department senior official said. There has been a sharp jump in new cases in Kolkata over the past three days. On March 29, Monday, the city had 225 new cases. The number on Wednesday climbed to 380. Active cases in Kolkata jumped from 2,094 on Tuesday to 2,309 on Wednesday. After the report of the rise in Covid cases in certain city pockets was communicated to the state health department, Swasthya Bhawan senior officials advised the civic brass to keep strict watch on the areas and scale up testing facilities. The state health department, too, has stepped up vigil and has asked state and private hospitals to ramp up testing facilities and keep ready the infrastructure in case a further surge is seen in Covid cases. “We are ready with the list of areas which have seen a spurt in Covid cases in the past three weeks. But we have formed a borough-wise team, which will regularly visit the areas of concern and update us about the actual number of citizens testing positive or people coming in close contact with the positive patients. Depending on the feedback, we will decide on the future course of action,” a KMC health department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-may-bring-back-c-zones-as-covid-cases-rise-in-busy-pockets/articleshow/81790047.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid rules set for safe Maundy Thursday||KOLKATA: As city churches prepare to usher in the fifth day of the Holy Week, Maundy Thursday, the Roman Catholic Church has cancelled the traditional washing of the feet, because of the pandemic while the Church of North India has decided to go through it with caution. Maundy Thursday commemorates two events from the life of Christ — where he washed the feet of his disciples and The Last Supper that he had with the Apostles, as described in the gospels. Archbishop Thomas D Souza, head of the Catholic church here, has given detailed guidelines about how, from Maundy Thursday till the end of the Holy Week, churchgoers will have to maintain certain protocols. Normally, priests wash the feet of 12 parishioners. “This year, the archbishop has asked priests to select 12 of the most deserving parishioners who are to be given towels andbread to symbolize the tradition,” said Dominic Gomes, vicar general of the archdiocese of Kolkata. There will just be folding of hands as a mark of respect and no touching or kissing the cross.Even during the round of the Stations of the Cross, no gathering will be allowed, the guidelines said. The Church of North India is going ahead with the washing of the feet ritual. Bishop Paritosh Canning described Maundy Thursday as a day to be spent in humility and display of exemplary love for all humanity. “It was an unusual day when Jesus himself took to servitude showing us the way to be. The word Maundy means love unto humanity, and that is how the day should be spent,” he said. The washing of feet will happen at St Paul’s Cathedral, it was said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-rules-set-for-safe-maundy-thursday/articleshow/81790699.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The matter came to light after night patrol police noticed a man with a bag roaming around suspiciously and checked his belongings. Meanwhile, police found an unidentified body with its hand chopped off in a field near Ramachandrapuram under Pedakakani mandal. Police concluded that the man, aged between 30 and 35, had his hand chopped off after he was killed. According to sources, the man carrying the chopped hand has not been identified as he has been giving different versions of his story. He also gave different names to the police and was not carrying any identification cards. Police visited the crime scene where the body was found and tried to match the chopped off hand to the unidentified body. Sources in the police department said that they are in the process of scientifically establishing whether the hand they recovered belongs to the dead body. Prima facie it appears that the hand belongs to the body but the identity of the deceased and the person whom the police took into custody are yet to be established, said sources. Cops also trying to establish the connection between the two and the motive behind the act.

This is the biggest single-day jump in nearly 130 days since the state recorded 1,221 cases on November 20 last year. The toll increased to 7,217 as four more people succumbed to the pandemic. Altogether 456 patients were declared cured on Wednesday. There are currently 7,338 active cases with 8,87,434 cumulative recoveries and 7,217 fatalities. Andhra Pradesh tested 30,964 Covid-19 samples and detected 1,184 new cases, translating to a case positivity rate of 3.8%. Andhra Pradesh recorded an average 0.25% case positivity rate in February. This was the lowest ever transmission rate for a month since the beginning of the outbreak. The state accumulated 12,073 cases in March 2021 when officials screened nearly 11.3 lakh people. This translates into a positivity rate of 1.1%, the highest in the last four months. From just 58 cases on March 1, the state ended the month with a steep surge of 1,184 infections on Wednesday. Based on the recent decision of the Union government, Andhra Pradesh will roll out the vaccination drive for citizens aged 45 and above from April 1.

---||Visakhapatnam||Return to online instruction for educational institutions||VISAKHAPATNAM: It is a déjà vu moment for the educational institutions of Andhra Pradesh after a year as several institutions have reverted to online classes in recent days amid the surge in Covid-19 case numbers. These institutions had started conventional face-to-face learning just a few months ago after remaining shut for almost seven months during the lockdown last year. Andhra University was the first major institution in the state to switch over to online classes on its main campus in Visakhapatnam when about 100 students tested positive for the novel coronavirus disease a few days ago. Even though the cases surfaced from the AU College of Engineering located on the north campus, the varsity swiftly stopped offline classes in all its constituent colleges on the main campus in Vizag to contain the spread of the disease. Another major institution of Visakhapatnam, Gitam Deemed to be University, rolled out complete online classes from March 30. Citing the prevailing pandemic situation, the University College of Engineering, Kakinada of Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University-Kakinada opted for digital instruction a few days ago. Not only higher educational institutions, several schools and colleges are also encouraging their students to attend virtual classes instead of face-to-face instruction as a preventive measure. According to the managements of various schools, the number of students taking online classes has seen a sudden jump in the last two weeks, which could be correlated with the fears over increasing daily infections. Worried parents are also prefer their children attend online classes instead of face-to-face instruction. Speaking to TOI, secretary and correspondent of Little Angels School at MVP Colony, Venu Mohan Manga, said that educational institutions are well placed to conduct online classes compared to March 2020 as Covid-19 accelerated the adoption of digital technologies. “It will be hampering the fundamental right of the student, if education could not be delivered at least through online mode due to the pandemic situation. For instance, in our school, we have embraced Google Suite for Education technology, which allows students and teachers to collaborate in real-time to conduct virtual classes, activities and assignments,” said Venu Mohan. GITAM registrar Prof D Gunasekharan said the institute has decided to conduct online classes for graduate and postgraduate students to contain the disease. “However, the ongoing first semester exams for UG students would continue as per earlier, by taking all Covid-19 precautions,” said Prof Gunasekharan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/return-to-online-instruction-for-educational-institutions/articleshow/81786327.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

It has, however, sought time of three more months to complete its investigation as it is still awaiting evidence from the social media companies. The standing counsel for CBI told the court they have filed a status report of the investigation so far, adding that they have been trying to gather more evidence from the social media companies through diplomatic channels. As the process is likely to take time to gather and analyse the evidence, he sought additional time to file a detailed report. Allowing his request, the high court posted the matter for further hearing to June 28. It may be recalled that the HC registrar general had filed a complaint with the crime investigation department after social media was flooded with objectionable, derogatory, and threatening comments against high court judges. The court also found the statements given by some ruling party leaders to be objectionable. Though the CID registered the cases, the high court later transferred the case to CBI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/getting-evidence-from-social-media-cos-cbi/articleshow/81786616.cms||Srikanth Aluri

In a bid to crack down on those indulging in illegal activities under the pretext of snake rescue operations, the forest department has decided to allow only authorized persons to conduct snake rescues. It is a first of its kind initiative in the country for creating teams of authorised and professional snake rescuers. Shyamal Tikadar, chief wildlife warden, Gujarat, on Tuesday shot off a letter to the chief conservator of forests (CCFs) as well as all conservator of forests (CFs), instructing them to create snake rescue teams across the state. He said that no unauthorized persons should be allowed to carry out snake rescues. Tikadar said in the circular that if any unauthorized person is found rescuing snakes, he or she shall be booked under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. According to forest officials, there are numerous cases of snake rescues across the state but the forest department doesn’t have any robust system to handle them. Tikedar mentioned in the circular that presently, mostly volunteers/NGOs are engaged in snake rescue across the state. “Many times they also receive the call directly from the public and undertake rescue operation. Legally, most of the snakes listed are protected species under various schedules of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972,” stated Tikedar. Snakes can’t be rescued or handled by anyone except under the authorization of the Chief Wildlife Warden. “In addition, while many of these volunteers/ NGOs may be genuine and may not be doing any illegal activity, but at times, the complaints like using snakes for display, extracting venom, trading, making irrational demands from the residents etc are also received,” Tikedar said in the circular. So, the forest department felt that there was a need to create a system of training, certification, authorization, facilitation, monitoring of snake rescuers in the state, to fix a maximum charge for rescues and creation of a protocol of rescue and release of snakes. “The snake rescuers will be trained by GEER Foundation and the teams will be in place in two to three weeks,” said S K Srivastava, additional PCCF, Gujarat. “We will be training the snake rescuers in the batch of 15 each.

It is not known if the new project is the shelved expansion plans or moving the existing operations which are shut and in a legal dispute. In a public announcement on Wednesday, Vedanta said it was looking to partner state governments which can offer 1,000 acres of land in a coastal location for the new smelter. India’s copper requirements are set to grow exponentially in the coming years. “We are therefore actively on the lookout for a suitable partner state to help take forward the vision of Atmanirbar Bharat,” a Sterlite statement said.The company said that the new project will entail an investment of Rs 10,000 crore and create 10,000 jobs and generate annual contribution of Rs 3,000 crore in taxes through its operations. It is not clear if Vedanta management is relocating its Tuticorin smelter which is the eye of a pollution storm. The announcement for the proposed 5 lakh tonnes a year smelter comes at a time when Vedanta management had completely impaired the value of part of expanded capacities of copper smelters after a bloody protest which left 13 dead nearly 3 years ago.Sterlite was operating its copper smelter in Tuticorin and sought approvals for expanding capacity with the second plant, which was rejected by the state government after the locals protested citing pollution concerns. The unit was shut down for maintenance in March 2018 and ordered closure in May 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sterlite-seeks-new-partner-location-for-copper-smelter/articleshow/81789208.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

---||Business||From plunge to peak, a turbulent fiscal for sensex||Mumbai: With a 627-point slide in the sensex on Wednesday, Dalal Street closed one of the most tumultuous years in its history. Within 12 months, the sensex recorded its sharpest slide on record and then, from near a multi-year low level, rallied to its all-time peak past the 52,500-point mark by mid-February. However, with several positive and negative factors impacting markets globally, the index closed the financial year 2020-21 at 49,509 points, up 68% on the year. The rally in FY21 attracted foreign fund managers into the market like never before with the total net inflow for the financial year at almost Rs 2.75 lakh crore — also an all-time high figure, data from CDSL showed. For market veterans, the sharp rally of FY21 was a deja vu moment. Joseph Thomas of Emkay Wealth Management pointed out that the uptick in FY21 came on the back of a sharp drawdown witnessed towards the close of FY20, which had recorded a negative return of about 30%. That was quite similar to the base that was created in FY09 when markets corrected by 40% due to the global financial crisis, which was swiftly followed by close to 80% returns for FY10. “The fall in markets due to severe economic distress proved to be the best investment opportunity (in FY21). The star performers among individual sectors were IT, pharma and banking,” Thomas said. With the Covid vaccines being rolled out at a fast pace across the globe and signs of economic revival emerging from various parts of the world, FY22 could also be a good year. “As we enter the new financial year, there is a ray of hope that the economic performance will continue with support from fiscal and monetary policies, and the second wave of the pandemic may be well under control as the vaccine rollout is under way across the globe,” Thomas said. The year’s rally also made investors richer by a record Rs 94 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 206 lakh crore. A major part of this gain came from the sharp rally in Reliance Industries, which saw its market capitalisation more than double from Rs 7.05 lakh crore to over Rs 15 lakh crore, but closed the year at Rs 13.2 lakh crore. The year also saw a record amount of funds being raised through the IPO route at Rs 1.9 lakh crore and Rs 64,256 crore through the rights offer route. RIL, which successfully closed its Rs 53,124-crore rights offer during the year, was the biggest equity issue in the country’s history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/from-plunge-to-peak-a-turbulent-fiscal-for-sensex/articleshow/81791174.cms||---

The ratings major noted that it revised the outlook to stable due to a number of reasons that include “demonstrated fund-raising, comfortable asset quality in retail segments and lower than expected rise in NPA levels, regularisation of collection efficiency to pre-Covid levels, strong capitalisation with healthy cover for asset-side risks and strong liquidity position”. “The current revision in outlook back to ‘stable’ reflects IBHFL’s strengthened capital position and expected further capital mobilisation in the medium term, continued fund-raising, which has benefitted from various schemes announced by the RBI and the government and the lower than expected inching up in IBHFL’s non-performing assets (NPAs) in the retail book. The previous year or so have also seen some correction in the share price of IBHFL,” the ratings agency said in a release. On March 24, 2020, Crisil had revised downward its rating outlook on the long-term debt instruments and bank facilities of IBHFL to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’, while reaffirming the rating at ‘CRISIL AA’, the release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/crisil-upgrades-indiabulls-housings-ratings-outlook-to-stable/articleshow/81793788.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Patna||Patna’s air quality dips to poor category on ‘Holika dahan’||PATNA: After being ‘moderately clean’ before March 28, the city air quality slipped to poor category on Holi because of smoke and fire emanating from ‘Holika dahan’ the previous day. A study conducted by Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) before, during and after ‘Holika dahan’ shows that the air pollutants were higher on March 28 and 29 compared to being moderate on Saturday and Tuesday. Air pollution in the city saw a significant increase on Sunday and Monday with PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micron) rising almost 2.5 times more than the permissible limit of 60 microgram per cubic metre (mpcm). The average PM 2.5 level was recorded at 138.9 mpcm. The air pollutants data was collected through continuous ambient air quality monitoring centres at SK Memorial Hall, Patna City, BIT-Mesra, DRM office Khagaul and Eco Park and two manual centres at Beltron Bhawan and Parivesh Bhawan. As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the overall air quality index (AQI) of Patna was recorded at 187 on March 27, which was under ‘moderate’ category. The next day, the AQI shot up to 209, bringing the city air quality under ‘poor’ category while post-’Holika dahan’, the AQI value further spiked up to 220. BSPCB public relations officer Birendra Kumar said an ambient air quality study had been conducted for the first time at Patna, Hajipur, Gaya and Muzaffarpur. “At Hajipur and Muzaffarpur, the pollutant level was normal on the ‘Holika dahan’. But the air pollutants at Patna and Gaya were higher that day mainly because of burning of all kinds of waste, including tyres, plastic, tubes and polybags besides firewood,” he said. Kumar further said that the air pollutants, however, were not alarming because of the awareness drive conducted by the board at several places through ‘nukad nataks’ and ‘sabhas’. On March 27-28, the average PM 2.5 level was recorded at 108.9, while it was 123.7 on March 28-29 despite the less vehicular movement on Patna roads. Kumar said the main reason behind the air pollutant was vehicle emission on March 27-28, but on March 28-29, the major source of air pollutants was burning of waste on ‘Holika dahan’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patnas-air-quality-dips-to-poor-category-on-holika-dahan/articleshow/81787779.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Allahabad||AU could hold admissions through NTA||Prayagraj: For the first time, admissions for the upcoming academic session (2021-22) at Allahabad University (AU) and its constituent colleges could be done by the National Testing Agency (NTA). This follows the recent letter of the University Grants Commission (UGC), which has been sent to the Registrar of AU, Prof NK Shukla wherein the apex decision body of all higher education in the country has proposed that the entrance exam at AU could be conducted through NTA. If implemented, AU would be holding a common entrance test with all the rest of the central universities of the country for UG and PG programmes or any one of the exams. However, varsity authorities have not yet taken a final call on the UGC’s proposal as to whether to conduct the entrance test through NTA or for that matter whether admission to undergraduate and post-graduation courses would be conducted by the testing agency which has been conducting entrance test for institutions including Delhi University or Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). This would be decided by the second week of April when AU would be releasing its calendar of the admission process for the new session. Till last year, admission in constituent colleges and AU has been organised by the AU authorities and based on a common merit list, admission is granted at AU’s main campus or the constituent colleges, barring Ewing Christian College and Hamidia Girls Degree College. For holding the undergraduate admission test (UGAT) and postgraduate admission test (PGAT), AU administration conducts the entrance process from Pravesh Bhawan located at the Chatham line. This year too, AU authorities had appointed Prof IR Siddiqui of the department of Chemistry as the new Director of the Admission Cell for admission in the new session (2021-22). Meanwhile, the UGC has sent this proposal to the varsity registrar for conducting the admission process through NTA. “Any decision would be taken only after holding talks with the vice-chancellor as it has to be seen what information has been passed on to her by the UGC or NTA authorities in terms of holding the entrance test along with all the central universities of the country”, said Prof Siddiqui. Till now, admission at central universities is conducted either based on cut-off marks of class XII or the entrance test conducted by the university concerned. However, after this arrangement, a common entrance test would be made mandatory in 54 central universities across the country. There will be two papers, one for general ability and the second would be the subject paper. In the general ability, students would be tested on areas of reasoning, quantitative and reasoning and subject based on which they would be able to decide on the course they would like to pursue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-could-hold-admissions-through-nta/articleshow/81784620.cms||---

Commercial taxes department commissioner cum secretary Pratima Kumari said on Wednesday that it was 22.35% more than the tax collection in 2019-20, when it stood at Rs26,000 crore. She also said of the total tax collected during 2020-21, 75% has come by way of the goods and service tax (GST) and the remaining 25% from the consumption of items that fall outside the GST net. Such items include petroleum products, electricity tariff and professional tax. During 2020-21, the department collected Rs 16,000 crore by way of the GST, which is 2.6% more than the collection made through GST in 2019-20. Similarly, the items outside the GST net yielded taxes whose volume is 10.47% more than the amount that came in 2019-20. She also said while the department provided support to ease the burden on the tax-payers due to the coronavirus pandemic, it also created internal mechanisms to ensure that the tax collection drive went steadily after the situation began to relatively ease from July onwards. In between, the department activated its intelligence wing to prevent tax thefts, she said. Further, over and above the one-time tax settlement (OTS) scheme, a mechanism was developed to monitor the tax collections and also ensure that the big tax-payers also filed their tax returns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/commercial-tax-collection-raised-by-22-35-in-state/articleshow/81784914.cms||Abhay Singh

The Kamath panel has been tasked with scrutinising recast proposals of over Rs 1,500 crore under the regulator’s Covid relief scheme. Over a dozen lenders, including most of the public sector banks, have an exposure to the group. In terms of the scheme, lenders will restructure nearly half of the group’s Rs 22,200 crore of debt. The recast will prevent the group from being classified as a non-performing asset or a bank defaulter. The scheme involves a moratorium until March 2022 with the interest for the period being converted into a term loan. The restructured loan amount would be raised by SP Group through a sale of assets in group companies Eureka Forbes, Afcons Infrastructure and Sterling & Wilson Solar. Two bulk deals in Sterling & Wilson were reported on Wednesday. This is the first major corporate loan to be restructured under RBI’s resolution framework for Covid-related stress announced last year. According to the exchange filing, there were two sale transactions of 35.4 lakh and 26.3 lakh shares worth nearly Rs 150 crore. According to the exchange filing, the client was Khurshed Yazdi Daruvala, part of the Daruvala family which is a joint promoter of Sterling & Wilson. Lenders said that the restructuring was not impacted by the SC verdict that barred the group from pledging shares in Tata Sons, which is a key source of the promoter’s wealth. “The promoters had said that they would bring in equity by selling assets and not through borrowing against pledged shares. The problem faced by the group is largely of liquidity as they have assets,” said a senior executive with a public sector bank. Shares of Sterling & Wilson closed 2% higher on Wednesday at Rs 258. The company also informed the stock exchange that the National Company Law Tribunal approved a scheme of amalgamation by way of absorption of Sterling & Wilson-Waaree (SW Waaree), a wholly owned subsidiary, into the parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kamath-panel-clears-sp-loan-for-recast/articleshow/81790591.cms||---

Serena Capital, Sanabil Investment, and Cisco Investments were the other new investors in the round. Existing investors March Capital Partners, National Grid Partners, Chiratae Ventures, Iron Pillar Fund, and Sistema Capital also participated.This takes the total funds raised by Uniphore to $210 million and is the company’s largest funding round to date. The company did not disclose the current valuation but said that the raise makes them poised to emerge as a ‘decacorn’ (a company valued at over $10 billion) in the next few years. Rob Rueckert, managing partner at Sorenson Capital Partners also joins Uniphore’s board with this fundraise. The funds will be used to expand its focus to Europe and Middle East markets, cement its leadership in voice AI technology and also focus on video-based AI applications. Uniphore's focus on AI-powered video analytics follows its recent acquisition of Spain-based Emotion Research Labs, a startup that analyses facial expressions and eye movements to gain insights from video calls. “We saw video emerging as a key touch point for enterprises during the pandemic, and believe that over 70% of organisational tasks will remain on video even after Covid. We are in the process of developing new products that assess video communications that should be ready by next year,” Umesh Sachdev, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO), Uniphore, said. As the pandemic forced enterprises to increase their reliance on contact center agents to service customer needs remotely, digital transformation has accelerated in the sector. Uniphore said it has capitalized on this momentum over the past 12 months, recording around 300% growth in 2020, and said it is poised to cross $100 million in contracted annual recurring revenue (ARR) in fiscal year 2022 even without factoring in the new video product. With call centres seeing 4x more traffic and with agents working from home during Covid, AI and automation emerged as the differentiator for efficiency, Sachdev said.Uniphore's voice products leverage AI to automate and analyse customer service calls for enterprises. Using the platform, virtual agents take over transactional conversations from humans, support human agents during calls, and predict language, emotion and intent in real-time. Launched in 2008 and incubated out of IIT-Madras, Uniphore counts former Cisco chairman John Chambers as an investor and mentor. Uniphore also recorded significant deal wins from global telecom providers, insurance companies and financial service organizations in the last year. They also won contracts with customer experience (CX) providers including Tech Mahindra, NTT DATA, Sitel, Firstsource, and WNS. The company, which has significant presence in Chennai, Bengaluru, California, and Singapore, also expanded headcount last year with the addition of more than 100 new employees globally, including former PwC partner Stéphane Berthier as CFO. It plans to double its headcount and said it is set to hire more than 300 employees in the coming year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/uniphore-gets-140m-in-series-d-led-by-sorenson-capital-partners/articleshow/81789806.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The deceased are identified as Dinesh Ram and his wife Bina. Within few hours of Dinesh’s killing, Azamgarh cops claimed to have worked out this murder case, and came to the conclusion that Bina and Dinesh’s cousin brother Vipin conspired to kill him, as they were involved in an illicit relationship. Azamgarh SP Sudhir Kumar Singh said that the police recovered the sharp-edged weapon used in attacking Dinesh, and interrogated his injured wife, Bina. After repeated questioning, Bina confessed that she had illicit relations with Dinesh’s cousin brother Vipin, and in order to get rid of Dinesh, Vipin murdered him. Search is on to nab Vipin, while Bina is undergoing treatment at the hospital. Bina has also been made an accused in the murder case due to her alleged involvement in conspiring to kill her husband. She is under police custody, added the SP. During initial investigation, it came to light that after having dinner, Dinesh and Bina went to sleep at the terrace of the house on Tuesday night.

---||Lucknow||AAP issues new list for panchayat polls after quota tweak||Lucknow: The Aam Aadmi Party on Wednesday reissued its list of candidates for the upcoming panchayat elections, having been forced to change many candidates due to changes in the reservation policy. It issued 500 names in the first list and said that their aim will be to make people of rural UP aware of the Delhi and Kejriwal model of development. This will be done keeping in mind the 2022 assembly polls which AAP will contest for the first time. AAP’s Rajya Sabha MP and Uttar Pradesh in-charge Sanjay Singh said that the party will try and field candidates on all seats. “The candidates will work towards bringing the Delhi development model to UP. The Kejriwal model which has free health services, free water, free power, free bus rides for women, double pension, where the government saved Rs 300 crore in construction of five flyovers. We will do this keeping in mind the assembly poll in 2022 and will be the one way we can reach out to voters in rural UP,” he said. Singh added that while Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is travelling to various states for election campaigning, he should also spend some time focussing on UP. “Appointment of rural development officers was cancelled, leaving many of them in distress, women are not safe, shiksha mitra were forced to shear their hair. Nobody is happy with the BJP government and this will be the first opportunity before assembly polls to teach BJP a lesson,” the AAP MP said. Among the list of 500 released on Wednesday, Singh said that there were 47 former zila panchayat members, 33 candidates who had joined AAP from other parties, 19 who were previously gram pradhans, 18 traders, 16 from the agriculture sector, 15 social workers, 12 housewives, seven sitting gram pradhans, seven lawyers, six former zila panchayat members, four students, three retired armymen, three former Lok Sabha candidates and two sitting nigam parshads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aap-issues-new-list-for-panchayat-polls-after-quota-tweak/articleshow/81794244.cms||---

He added that the extension of ECLGS 1.0 and ECLGS 2.0 by three months to September 30, 2021 will provide additional headroom for borrowers if they have not utilised the sanctioned facility earlier. “ECLGS has been instrumental in providing liquidity relief to borrowers and addressing their cash-flow mismatches.

The daily operations and flight movement at Patna airport, however, remained unaffected. The employees sat on dharna on rotational basis without affecting the daily flight operations. JFUA-AAI, Patna convener Aklesh Kumar Singh said, “Privatization is never in the interest of the employees and the country. So, we have opposed it and will continue to do so till the government relents. At a time when the aviation sector is struggling, efforts should have been made to improve the situation through existing agencies rather than inviting private players.” Singh said they will ensure that their agitation remains peaceful. “Our protest will not cause any inconvenience to the passengers or hamper the airport’s functioning,” he said. The AAIEU wrote to the AAI chairman about the strike, drawing his attention to the concern of employees regarding uncertain future following the privatisation of airports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-airport-staff-stage-protest/articleshow/81787522.cms||---

The construction of the 1.5 km retaining wall at a cost of Rs 122.90 crore will provide relief from floods to about 31,000 people living in Ranigari Thota, Tarakaramanagar and Bhupeshgupta Nagar areas. Under the project, a wall will be constructed adjacent to the riverbank to prevent floodwater entering residential areas of the city. The project, which was proposed back in 2009, was delayed till 2016. The then TDP had government completed the first phase of works. But with inundation in the city becoming a regular feature over the last two years, the state government had assured the project would be completed soon Upon request from the locals, the state government revised the wall construction plan so that only 500 houses needed to be relocated. “Our government always cares for the poor and their welfare. As per the plan prepared during the TDP regime, 3,000 houses should be relocated, but the revised master plan can ease up the works by relocating 500 residences on the river bund. People of Krishna Lanka and other river bund areas are thankful to CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy,” said YSRC Vijayawada East in-charge Devineni Avinash. Vijayawada East MLA Gadde Ramamohan Rao said that the TDP had given top priority to the project and completed a major portion from Yanamalakuduru to Ramalingeswara Nagar.

The court of additional sessions judge SM Rajpurohit on Wednesday awarded capital punishment to Kanku Koli (38) and her lover Umang Thakkar for the murder of her daughter Sonal, then 17. Kanku and Sonal used to work as domestic help to earn a living in their native Dhama village. Kanku used to work at Thakkar's house too and they got into a relationship. He had a grocery shop and was unmarried. When Sonal got to know about the affair, she rebuked her mother and threatened to expose them. Kanku tried to convince her not to do so, but Sonal refused to relent.  The duo then hatched a plan to eliminate Sonal. As per their plan, Kanku, on July 11, 2018, urged Sonal to accompany her to Thakkar's house to complete domestic chores. Sonal was reluctant but Kanku pleaded with her saying that there was too much work and she needed a helping hand. When they reached his house, Thakkar shut the door and started making attempts to convince Sonal to accept their relationship. However, Sonal stood firm on her stand. Thakkar then took out a knife and stabbed the girl five times in the abdomen and once in the neck. After Sonal died on the spot, Thakkar fled from there, but Kanku kept sitting beside the body. When Umang's mother returned home, she saw Sonal's body and informed the villagers. Later, Sonal's uncle Vishnu Koli lodged a complaint at Zinzuwada police station naming Kanku and Thakkar. Thakkar was arrested from Maliya town of Morbi district a couple of days after the crime. Public prosecutor Vasudev Bhatt said that there were no eyewitnesses to the crime, but the court relied on corroborative and scientific evidence."A total of 26 witnesses were examined of which seven, including the complainant, had turned hostile," said Bhatt. "Kanku had got involved in the illicit relationship out of lust and both had conspired to kill Sonal," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/woman-lover-get-death-for-killing-her-teen-daughter/articleshow/81784761.cms||---

The SHO said the girl started crying and drew the attention of another elderly girl near the spot. “On seeing her, Dharmendra threatened the girl and fled from the spot,” she said.

---||Business||4 PSU banks get Rs 14.5k cr in recap bonds||Mumbai: The government has infused Rs 14,500 crore into four weak public sector banks by issuing them recapitalisation bonds for a matching amount. The investment will improve the capital adequacy of these banks and enable three of them to exit the lending restrictions they face from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The four banks that have subscribed to the special government bonds in return for equity are Central Bank of India (Rs 4,800 crore), Indian Overseas Bank (Rs 4,100 crore), Bank of India (Rs 3,000 crore, which is not limited by the RBI) and Uco Bank (Rs 2,600 crore). The investment took place on the last date of the fiscal, which enables the banks to include the capital while drawing up its balance sheet for FY21. These banks have been issued zero-coupon bonds maturing between 2031 and 2036 in six equal annual tranches. Bankers say that the capital infusion is somewhat like a book entry as the government borrows from the bank and invests the same money as bank’s equity. The capital infusion will enable three of the four banks (excluding Bank of India) to exit the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework applied by the RBI on them because of their financial ratios falling below prescribed parameters. The advantage of the zero-coupon bond route is that it reduces the pressure on the fiscal deficit, and it ensures that there is no glut of government bonds as no one other than these banks can hold the recapitalisation bonds. “With the government deciding to infuse substantial capital in all the three public banks which were in the PCA framework, we expect these banks to come out of PCA in FY2022,” said financial sector ratings agency ICRA’s vice-president Anil Gupta. “However, given the capital infusion is through zero-coupon recapitalisation bonds, the earning profile of these banks may not improve on account of this transaction as their capital position improves,” he added. In addition to the infusion by the government, the public sector banks are expected to free capital by selling non-core assets. Central Bank of India has been trying to sell its home finance arm and had signed a deal with Centrum Housing, which had agreed to purchase Cent Bank Home Finance for Rs 160 crore. However, the deal fell through as the transaction could not be concluded in time. “We now inform that the long stop date of the share purchase agreement being March 31, 2021 has lapsed. Therefore, the said binding agreement stands rescinded,” Central Bank of India said in a statement to the exchanges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/4-psu-banks-get-rs-14-5k-cr-in-recap-bonds/articleshow/81791315.cms||---

The farmers are already under financial stress due to the restrictions imposed during the first wave of Covid-19 and the situation is once again similar as there is lower demand for fruits and vegetables. The farmers from Nashik who are already getting poor prices for their produce during the Covid-19 norms are further feeling the pinch as the weekly bazaars have also been closed down. “The bulk of fruits and vegetables are sold in APMCs at wholesale price, but at this time there are restrictions against gathering of people due to which the traders or buyers are discouraged from coming to the markets. At the same time the restrictions in the cities has lowered the demand for the vegetable,” Khandu Bodke, a farmer from Karanjgaon in Niphad taluka, said. The farmers sell their produce in bulk at the APMCs and at the same time they visit the weekly markets to get some additional income through retail pricing. These markets are a good source for the farmers who sell them for better returns. “The return in the weekly bazaar is better when compared to bulk selling, but that consumes time hence we only sell a small portion directly. But these days even that is blocked especially when the markets have been closed due to the Covid-19 health advisories,” Keshav Gangurde, a farmer from Kalwan taluka, said. The farmers are also incurring loss of produce as well. “At times farmers sell the goods at throwaway prices in the market and that hardly brings in any revenue. Besides the excess vegetables are also dumped as well. If the vegetable vendors are allowed to do the business in the cities, naturally there will be demand for the same and thus help us in making profits,” Pankaj Usheer from Yeola taluka said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/closure-of-weekly-markets-hurt-farmers/articleshow/81784350.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The project, Phase I of which was launched in 2012 and the second in 2017, aims to mobilize resources for the vulnerable species and promote their conservation. “Although the scheme could not be promoted much amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the SBI has adopted a tiger, zebra, giraffe, chimpanzee, bird and rhinoceros,” zoo director Satyajeet Kumar told this newspaper, adding that the programme gave animal lovers an opportunity to connect with the zoo inmates and understand their behaviour. According to sources, a large number of adoptions are done by big organisations under their corporate social responsibility initiatives. Hence, they are free to get their names displayed outside the enclosures of the adopted animals. Urging common people to participate in the scheme, Satyajeet said the criteria for adoption varied from animal to animal. “More initiatives for the welfare of the zoo inmates as well as the visitors are in the pipeline,” he added. Principal secretary of the environment, forest and climate change department, Dipak Kumar Singh, pointed out that the people adopting an animal would enjoy perks like free entry to the zoo for an entire year. “We promote the adoption scheme from time to time with the help of advertisements and awareness campaigns,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bird-tiger-among-6-adopted-by-sbi/articleshow/81787832.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||With WFH, IT sector saves on transport cost||VISAKHAPATNAM: In an unintended benefit, the pandemic has helped many IT and ITeS companies, including BPOs, in Vizag save on transport costs and other allowances extended to employees. Taken together, these savings amount to between Rs 2-3 crores by around 100-odd companies that account for nearly 25,000 employees. On average, hired vehicles at each major company carry out nearly 70 to 80 trips per day to transport staff, who work in any of the three shifts designated by the firms. “For us, transportation cost for facilitating cabs for employees for all three shifts is around Rs 7-8 lakh. We are not depending on cabs now as almost all staff are well-versed with working from home,” said Lakshmi Mukkavilli, managing director of Patra India BPO in the city. Some companies said they spent the money saved on procuring additional computer systems for increasing their workforce and sharing the infrastructure at the homes of staff who opted for work from home (WFH). “One system is enough for three employees at office, which runs on three shifts, whereas under WFH, we require three systems. So, we need to spend the money saved on procuring more systems for our staff,” said another BPO executive head. Speaking to TOI, Software Technology Parks of India (STPI), Visakhapatnam Centre, joint director MP Dubey said savings from transportation indirectly helped in protecting the environment. This apart, most IT-ITeS companies including BPOs are now well stabilished with a hybrid work culture and WFH, which will continue to be the norm in the event of a second wave. Pulsus chief executive officer Gedela Srinubabu said, “We recruited nearly 2,000 employees for our company during the pandemic. We also provided required furniture and internet bandwith for WFH staff with the money we saved on transport facilities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/with-wfh-it-sector-saves-on-transport-cost/articleshow/81786406.cms||V Kamalakara Rao

The man is said to have threatened to kill the women due to which many ended up in the flesh trade. Workers of the women’s group Mahila Chetana have alleged that Arun, the accused, had even trapped his friend’s wife and even forced his daughter into flesh trade.  The accused’s first wife Geetanjali and second wife Lakshmi have claimed that he has links with local police who are safeguarding him.  He even threatened to frame cases against them if they raised their voice against him, they told reporters on Wednesday.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: No new e-class for students with uncleared school fees||KOLKATA: After pushing deadlines for fee arrears several times to accommodate children whose parents have not paid, schools have taken the stand of not allowing such kids into online classes as the new session starts for most schools on April 5 — and, for some, on April 12. Many schools have held back information about the subject scores in the final exams and report cards of such students. Till fees are cleared, many schools have refused to promote children to the next level. Schools have not yet taken the final step of striking names off rolls and said that till fees are cleared, they can stay at the level they were on last year. Birla High School for Boys and Sushila Birla Girls’ High School have told defaulting parents that their children will not be allowed to attend online classes when the schools reopen virtually. “Their names have not been struck off the register yet, but they will not be sent the links to the new classes. Technically, they can continue in the classes they were in last year. We hope we are sending the message aloud now,” said school spokesperson Brigadier V N Chaturvedi. The school-fee cases where parents and schools have locked horns are being heard in both the Supreme Court and the Calcutta High Court. The latter, on October 13 last year, had given a 20% relief in tuition fees to parents because of the pandemic with a deadline of clearance by November 8. In every school, there are about 150-200 parents who are on the defaulting list. At South Point School, report cards have been issued but defaulting parents were told their kids will not be allowed to attend online classes when the school reopens, said spokesperson Krishna Damani. The list is long in St Thomas Kidderpore too. Parents are being individually informed that there would be no more shifting of deadlines and their children will not be allowed into the online classes, said spokesperson John Ghosh. The numbers are comparatively smaller in St James’ School, but report cards of students whose parents have defaulted on payment have been withheld. Principal T H Ireland has asked them to collect the report cards from him, after which a final call on their wards will be taken. Report cards have been withheld for defaulters in Shri Shikshayatan School, too. “The numbers are smaller now, but we had to take a stand somewhere,” said spokesperson Bratati Bhattacharya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-new-e-class-for-students-with-uncleared-school-fees/articleshow/81790159.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Nagpur||Granny beats Covid at 91, rides pillion 268 km to return home in Yavatmal||NAGPUR: Doctors keep stressing on the fact that combating Covid-19 is more of a mental and emotional test rather than physical. There are many examples of senior citizens coming out of the Covid ordeal on the basis of sheer will power and 91-year-old Parvatibai Khanzode is one such inspiration. She not only recovered from Covid-19 in Nagpur, but also travelled back to her hometown Ganjegaon in Umarkhed Tehsil, some 268 km away, on her grandson’s bike. Her grandson, Ankush, works for the Maharashtra Security Guards (MSG) and is deployed at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). He told TOI that his grandmother insisted on going home on his bike. “My grandma is fond of bike rides. Since she insisted, I decided to fulfil her wish because doctors had told me that it’s the responsibility of relatives to keep the Covid patient mentally and emotionally happy. It took us an entire day to reach our village. Family members welcomed her with garlands,” said Ankush. Parvatibai had tested positive on March 13 a their native village in Umarkhed Tehsil of Yavatmal. As her fever was not receding, Ankush and other family members shifted her to GMCH Nagpur on March 16. “My grandma was unhappy in hospital. After two days, she wanted to go back home. After her oxygen level became normal, doctors allowed me to take her to my room where I stay alone,” said Ankush. Parvatibai stayed in Ankush’s room for ten days in home isolation. Ankush used to take care of her medicinal and dietary needs. He also checked her SPO2 level regularly. “I used to boost her confidence. Once, to cheer her up, I promised to take her back home on my bike if she recovered,” said Ankush. The motivation worked wonders and Parvatibai recovered in ten days. Her re-test for Covid on March 26 was negative. “I was planning to hire an ambulance or a cab but my grandma insisted on the bike ride that I had promised her. I was surprised and worried as well. But she was confident,” said Ankush. The duo decided to go home on Holi eve on Ankush’s Royal Enfield. It was a like a dream ride for Parvatibai. They started early in the morning from Nagpur and reached Ganjegaon by evening. “We took short breaks in Wardha, Yavatmal, Arni, Dhanora, Umarkhed and some other places. My grandma enjoyed the ride to the fullest. She told me that it was her dream to go on a long bike ride,” Ankush said. Not only family members, even villagers of Ganjegaon welcomed Parvatibai with garlands. She said Covid-19 has fulfilled her long-cherished dream.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/granny-beats-covid-at-91-rides-pillion-268km-to-return-home-in-yavatmal/articleshow/81791343.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Street vendors see dead end if lockdown-2 is brought in||NAGPUR: Rajkumar Gupta — the kulfi seller is a known face in the narrow lanes near Gandhi Chowk, Sadar. Moving around with his handcart since he was a lad, now 51-year-old Gupta still needs to go on to make two ends meet. “You are sensible enough to know what will happen to people like us, if there is another round of lockdown after April 2,” he says with a sarcastic smile. Yet to recover from impact of the first lockdown, Gupta only sees hopelessness, if it happens again. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has hinted of another lockdown from April 2 or 3. As TOI talked to people who need to venture out each day to make a living, the very thought of a lockdown was nightmare for them. “I also used to park my cart in front of schools in the day time, but schools were closed for the entire year. My earnings were already halved and now are further down due to the time restrictions in force these days. We can only manage because of our frugal lifestyle ” he says. Every such vendor or a small time businessman TOI met complained of having lost nearly half of the earnings due to the time curbs. Another lockdown may only bring the worse, they said. Manju Waghmare has been selling snacks near the divisional commissioner’s office since last eight years. “My blood pressure dips when I think of another lockdown,” she says. Just then a policeman arrives asking her to wind up as it was 4pm already. “I need to pay Rs7,000 as home rent, another Rs1,500 for electricity bills and then there is an EMI. My earnings are already down by Rs10,000,” she says. Despite cops insisting, the vendors manage to stretch for another hour or so. Even the police remain polite. “Yes I have heard that there is going to be another lockdown soon. In that case I’ll have to sit at home. May be I will work at a construction site, if it is allowed, or go back to my village,” says Gaurishanker Prajapati, a sugarcane juice seller close by and a migrant from Rewa in Madhya Pradesh. His earnings this summer are already down to a quarter as compared to the times before Covid. Vishal Rathore, a fruit vendor, says even now its difficult to recover the purchase cost, as much of the stock remain unsold and has to be discarded. Mohammed Nissar, a mask seller near Mount Road, says he has a large family to feed, and timing curbs have brought down his earnings to not more than Rs500 a day. Trade associations on the other and are planning to take on the government if lockdown continues. “We will not pay the wages to our employees for the lockdown period, unless the government compensates,” said Ashwin Mehadia, president of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC). Dipen Agrawal, president of Chamber of Maharashtra Associations Industries and Trade (CAMIT), said the businessmen would accept a lockdown only if it its total, but not if only shops and other establishments are made to shut down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/street-vendors-see-dead-end-if-lockdown-2-is-brought-in/articleshow/81791252.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Lucknow||State nurseries set to supply 42cr saplings||Lucknow: UP will plant 30 crore trees this year and to get that many number of trees ready in nurseries is a huge task. State nurseries would raise 42 crore saplings to meet the tall order. Instructions have been issued to nurseries, close to 1,700 in number in UP, to raise the needed number so that surplus stock can be maintained. The forest department also replaces saplings that do not survive within a few days of plantation. Besides, the number of saplings transported to plantation sites is always more than the actual number needed for plantation to avoid any shortage. Besides, plantation numbers mostly cross the set benchmark. Last year, against the target of 25 crore saplings a total of 25.8 crore saplings were planted. Keeping this in view, nurseries would raise 42 crore saplings, said chief conservator of forest (CCF) Mukesh Kumar. The forest department has issued instructions to nurseries to get saplings of all the species ready. Saplings of 121 different species of trees and creepers would be raised. The state government has added 13 new species to its plantation programme this year with emphasis on medicinal and immunity-boosting plants like giloy. Like last year, sahjan would be planted extensively at all anganwadi centres. The tree has each part of it rich in nutrition. The state government has included it in its annual plantation programmes to cure malnutrition among people from economically weaker sections. Other new species being grown in nurseries are curry leaves, several varieties of bamboo, papaya, chakotara, Krishna sirus, kardhai and kinnu. Plantation programme incorporates the state’s endemic tree species and others are commercially viable, timber and fodder yielding, fruit-bearing, those with dense canopies, ornamental, flowering trees, those that support a population of birds and other biodiversity and environmentally significant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/state-nurseries-set-to-supply-42cr-saplings/articleshow/81794303.cms||Neha Shukla

To sort out this issue, Naimesh called PRatik to his house on the night of March 28. “However, when Pratik came home, he was brandishing a knife. He threatened to kill Naimesh if he did not allow Kajal to live with him. When Naimesh confronted Pratik, he attacked with the knife. Naimesh’s father Sailesh tried to defend his son and sufered injuries to his hands,” the complaint stated. Pratik allegedly threatened Naimesh with dire consequences and left the house. On the other hand, Pratik, who runs a cellphone shop in Chandkheda, filed a complaint against Naimesh and Shailesh alleging that they thrashed him badly. He told cops that Naimesh had called him, asking him to come home. When he went to their house, the father-son duo allegedly abused him first then thrashed him so badly that he had to be taken to Civil hospital in Asarwar for treatment, claimed Pratik.

The incident occurred in September 2020, but the bribe came to light now when the cyber cell sleuths again called the Basti Jodhewal resident to join the investigation. Forty-year-old resident of Basti Jodhewal told the TOI that in September 2020, he received a call from the cyber cell of Ludhiana police, stating that a complaint has been received against him. He discussed the matter with a few people, including the accused who was known to him. The accused claimed that he knew inspector Sukhpal Kaur, who was then in charge of the cyber cell. “The accused took me to the cyber cell office, where cops told us that our Wi-Fi network was used to upload an obscene video on social media and they were investigating that case. I told them that I own a shop and we often share the password with our customers. After knowing the content of the complaint, I got scared. When we came out, the accused said he could settle the matter by talking to the cell in-charge. After that, the accused went inside the office and minutes later he returned and asked for Rs 10,000, claiming that the complaint will be closed now,” he alleged. “I gave him the money and did not receive any call from the police for six months.

---||Lucknow||e-PoP machines to nix fixers at wheat procurement units||Lucknow: To get rid of middlemen, the Yogi Adityanath government has decided to use electronic point of purchase (e-PoP) machines during the mammoth wheat procurement exercise scheduled to start from Thursday. Under the arrangement, farmers will be required to register on the portal of the food and civil supplies department: www.fcs.up.gov.in. Food commissioner Manish Chauhan said e-PoP machines have been made available by vendors. “This will ensure transparency in purchase of wheat as only registered farmers will be able to sell their produce at the purchase centre after biometric authentication,” he told TOI. Farmers will be compensated through Public Financial Management System, a central plan monitoring system of the finance ministry. It is used as a platform for e-payment of direct benefits transfer (DBT)/non-DBT payments for both Aadhaar and non-Aadhaar-linked accounts. The UP government’s measures to check the involvement of middlemen in the wheat procurement process come amid a prolonged farmers’ stir against the new farm laws. The development also comes close on heels of the state government scaling up the minimum support price for wheat from Rs 1,925 in 2020-21 to Rs 1,975 in 2021-22, besides increasing the number of procurement centres from 5,000 last year to 6,000 this time. Earlier, the department of civil supplies had used e-point of sale (e-POS) machines for selling ration through 80,000 public distribution system (PDS) shops. The move had helped the state government weed out 25 lakh ghost ration cards. The UP government had taken the step even as it embarked on the Centre’s flagship PM Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana that envisages free foodgrain distribution among the needy, particularly migrants who returned to the state during the lockdown. In fact, UP had produced 3.75 crore metric tonnes of wheat in 2020-21. Against this, the state government managed to procure 35 lakh metric tonnes, benefitting a little over 6.6 lakh farmers. This was less than the 37 lakh metric tonnes of wheat procured in 2019-20 when more than 7.5 lakh farmers were benefited. Officials said the dip in wheat purchase was due to the aftermath of the pandemic-induced lockdown which affected movement of farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/e-pop-machines-to-nix-fixers-at-wheat-procurement-units/articleshow/81794358.cms||Pankaj Shah

At the time, the number of respirators was the same as is now. On September 26, the figure was the same, but it comprised 23 cases from Ludhiana. By October 2 last, there were 32 patients, including 19 of the district, on ventilators. By October 15, the number was 15, of which eight were of Ludhiana. On October 31 last, 10 patients, including four from the district, were on respirators. On November 3, of 13 patients on ventilators, eight were of Ludhiana. By November 13, the number increased to 13, of which seven were of Ludhiana. On November 30, there were eight patients on the machine, of which two were of the district. On December 1 last, seven patients, including two of the industrial hub, were on ventilators. On January 1, the figure was three, including one out of district case. In February as well, the number was mostly below 10. However, this month, the count has increased from five on March 1 to the present value. The health department officials said people should act more responsibly and report early. An official of the department said, “With patients coming late for treatment, more cases are on ventilators. People should get themselves tested immediately after they notice symptoms. This will help treat them early and avoid their reaching the advanced stage wherein there is a need to put them on ventilators.” He added that the number of patients on ventilators was less than 15% of the machines available in Ludhiana hospitals. People should follow Covid-19 guidelines of wearing masks, maintaining social distance and hand hygiene to check the infection spread, he said. “There are more patients on respirators as we are passing through the second wave that has brought surge in cases. Even as cases are more, fatalities are less as compared with the first wave, maybe because the infection is caused by a weaker strain,” said Ludhiana IMA president Dr Saroj Aggarwal. Civil surgeon Dr Sukhjeevan Kakkar could not be contacted despite repeated calls. Active cases Active cases also witnessed an increase recently and were the highest since August-end.

---||Ahmedabad||Covid kit thief was Robin Hood of testing: Cops||AHMEDABAD: A final semester MBBS student who was arrested for stealing corona test kits was on Wednesday projected by cops as a misguided ‘philanthropist’ who pilfered in the service of the poor. Meet Jethwa, a student of NHL Medical College in Ellisbridge, was on Sunday nabbed for stealing 16 boxes of Covid-19 rapid antigen testing kits worth Rs 6.20 lakh from an urban health centre in Ghatlodia. He had stolen the kits on March 24. “Jethwa is not a habitual criminal and so he was not questioned aggressively,” said an officer of Ghatlodia police. “He told us that he was asked by a friend to hold a testing camp for poor people. So he decided to lift the kits to provide them to his friend.” The officer said as Jethwa was working with the urban health centre, he assured his friend that he would manage to get the kits. “On the afternoon of March 24, he went to the urban health centre, took the kits, and put them inside his car,” said the officer. “When he saw some people chasing him, he sped away.” Police seem unaware that individuals are not allowed to carry out corona testing at present. Moreover, the cops appear to have believed Jethwa’s assertion that his intentions were good. The accused was granted bail on Tuesday, said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-kit-thief-was-robin-hood-of-testing-cops/articleshow/81794348.cms||---

On Wednesday, cyber police registered an FIR under Information Technology Act. Mumbai Police spokesperson DCP S Chaitanya said cyber police personnel were probing the hacking of MIDC’s server. In a circular on Tuesday, MIDC said users and customers have been facing disruption in online services since March 21. “The ransomware SYNack impacted the application and database. The ransomware also infected some end-point personal computers across different locations of MIDC.” Chaitanya said, “The hacker used ransomware to encrypt into the server. Due to this, the work at MIDC to access data has been halted. A case under Information Technology Act sections 43 (A) (accesses or secures access to such computer, computer system or computer network), 43 (F) (denies or causes the denial of access to any person authorised to access any computer, computer system or computer network by any means) and 66 (computer related offences) against unknown person has been registered.” MIDC CEO P Anbalagan denied receiving any demand for ransom. “No such demand! The source (of hacking) is being ascertained,” he said. The FIR did not mention any demand for ransom, police officials said. MIDC received many complaints from industrial units about their inability to make online payments. The circular stated that due to complexity in restoration, systems are being made live in a phased manner. It also announced an extension in deadlines for payments from March 31 to April 15. Anbalagan said the site was restored for single window services last Friday. “For ERP it will be done today (Wednesday). From tomorrow (Thursday) 100% applications will be functional,” he said. MIDC applications are hosted on ESDS cloud service managed by the service provider and on local servers managed by MIDC’s internal team. Advocate Prashant Mali, a cyber law and security expert, said it was shocking that MIDC took 10 days to file an FIR in such a serious incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-midc-took-10-days-to-file-fir-after-cyber-attack/articleshow/81794424.cms||Clara Lewis

The tree was a little over 60 years old, according to South Zone municipal officials. The tragedy occurred near the Maninagar BRTS bus stand. The victim was identified as Renuka Mehta. The victim used to stay at Chandraprakash Society Part-2, near Kankaria, with her husband Bharat Mehta, 67. On Wednesday, she and her husband had ventured out on their scooter to buy vegetables. While he stood outside the vegetable market, she headed to a vending cluster. Times ViewEach year some 200 trees fall during the monsoons in the city. In most cases, such trees are along roads frequently dug up for laying civic utilities, which weakens the roots. Often contractors do not ensure proper soil compaction after digging, while in some cases the tree base is covered with bitumen and footpath blocks leaving no space for water to seep down to the roots. This weakens the trees and a strong wind is enough for fatal consequences. Its time that a comprehensive tree audit plan be made part of municipal duties. Trees that are weak should be secured so that no lives are lost.Moments later a tea vendor, Motisinh Rajput, saw the tree tilting and raised an alarm. At her age, Mehta could not move out of the danger zone quickly enough. She was hit by the tree and suffered serious injuries, said a local social activist Harshad Patel. “The area had been dug up a couple of times for laying utility lines,” said a senior AMC official from the South Zone. “We suspect that in the absence of sufficient soil compaction, the tree could not withstand strong winds. We also noticed that the tree did not have many branches, which clearly indicated that its roots were weak.” The tree’s girth had a circumference of 7.5 feet, the official said.  The official admitted that while laying roads, municipal contractors often cover up the entire tree base with bitumen, which restricts trees’ proper growth and weakens roots. “We had noticed that the neem tree had weak roots,” the official said. Mehta succumbed to the injuries on the spot. A team of Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) had reached the accident site along with a 108 ambulance. Mehta was taken to LG Hospital where she was declared brought dead. AFES personnel removed the tree which had fallen on carts selling snacks and vegetables. Some vehicles were damaged too. Maninagar police registered a case of accidental death and began an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/maninagar-woman-64-crushed-by-neem-tree-60/articleshow/81794639.cms||---

As per MoHFW, on-the-spot vaccination will be allowed only after 3pm. NMC officials said they were yet to receive the orders and will implement whatever decision is taken by MoHFW. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “People should not crowd at the centres and follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. We will implement token system in case of rush. Centres will ask people not following Covid-19 guidelines of social distancing etc to come next day.” NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said vaccination will be held in two shifts at eight centres, including six health centres of NMC, AIIMS and IGGMCH. “Vaccination will be facilitated from 8am to 10pm at these centres,” he said. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said, “People should visit counters opened at all 10 zones in case they face any problem in registering online. Also, 100 staffers have been engaged for special camps organized by public representatives and NGOs in residential areas to register people. City buses are also provided for people who have no means to travel from their areas to vaccination centres.” The vaccination in district increased to 12,974, of which 6,093 were in city and 6,881 in rural on Wednesday.

The party engaged the services of bulk SMS senders by paying them,” senior advocate V Kathic said, representing BJP. On its part, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) also submitted that Aadhaar data had not been compromised or shared with anyone. "The information collected by UIDAI is not used for any purpose other than the generation of Aadhaar numbers and authentication. It is not possible to share Aadhaar details in bulk with any entity," he added. The issue pertains to a plea moved by A Anand, president of the Puducherry unit of the Democratic Youth Foundation of India (DYFI) alleging that the local BJP candidates had obtained the cell phone numbers illegally from Aadhar data and were creating WhatsApp groups for election campaigning. Representing the Election Commission of India (ECI), senior advocate G Rajagopal said, sending bulk SMSs for election campaigns without the prior approval of the commission amounts to violation of model code of conduct. “We have obtained details from telecommunication companies like BSNL, Airtel and Jio and ascertained the amount spent by the party was Rs 4.33 lakh. The same will be added to the election expenses of the party,” he added. The court directed the BJP to file a detailed counter on April 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/bjp-denies-using-aadhaar-data-to-send-voters-sms/articleshow/81788157.cms||---

In the 14-page letter sent to the President on Wednesday, she claimed her husband can be killed in encounter by planting some false story in case, UP police officials are allowed to bring Mukhtar from Punjab without fixing their responsibility for his safety. Referring to the recent killing of sharpshooter Girdhari in an encounter in Lucknow and killing of Prem Prakash alias Munna Bajrangi, a co-accused with Mukhtar in killing of BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai, in Baghpat jail few years ago, she demanded personnel of central paramilitary forces in the escort team.

Claiming five attempts to kill Mukhtar had already been made in the past 16 years. She further alleged in the letter that BJP MLA Alka Rai and some political opponents of Mukhtar have been stepping up pressure on the state government because of which some senior officials can hatch a plot to kill her husband. The don’s wife also alleged that several properties of her family have been destroyed and the career of her son, a national-level shooter, spoiled by booking him in false cases.

---||Lucknow||Anti-power theft wing clicks, recovers Rs 47crore, curbs rampant ‘katia’ culture in UP||LUCKNOW: The enforcement wing of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) is playing a perfect foil to energy minister Shrikant Sharma, who launched consumer-friendly schemes to augment revenue, and has realised nearly Rs 47 crore from power theft culprits by disposing off just 12.28% of the total FIRs lodged in 2020. “It is a major achievement and shows that the decision of setting up special anti-power theft police stations has worked and is paying dividends,” director general, vigilance, UPPCL, Kamal Saxena, told TOI. “We realised Rs 47 crore by disposing off just 12.28% of total cases and are awaiting assessment reports from the SDOs concerned in remaining 88%. If we dispose of all the cases, our recovery would climb to Rs 402 crore,” he added. The anti-power theft police stations that became fully functional in 2020 proved to be a game changer and have succeeded in curbing the ‘katia’ culture and creating fear among offenders that they would have to face action for power theft. Earlier, chargesheets were filed in most cases, but now the stress is on recovery. In 2017, chargesheets were filed in 67.23% cases, but after dedicated police stations started working, chargesheets were filed in just 4.35% of total FIRs in 2020 as focus shifted to realizing penalty and dues rather than fighting cases in the court for years, said Saxena. The DG Vigilance has submitted a report to energy minister and Union government on the impact analysis of creating anti-power theft police stations in UP where cases of power theft were registered at local police stations and gathered dust. The impact analysis report states that 1,76,007 cases of power theft were registered in 2020 and Rs 47.52 crore has been realised from disposed of 12.28% cases. Before dedicated anti-power theft police stations were set up, the situation was just reverse as over 68% went into litigation and revenue was realised in 31% only. The fact that now we have a dedicated staff on ground to tackle power theft, lodge cases, pursue them diligently has helped a lot in curbing the notorious ‘katia’ (illegal connection) practice and has curtailed transmission and distribution losses, said the IPS officer. The vigilance department is sincerely pursuing over 1. 50 lakh pending cases and asking substations concerned to send the assessment report soon. Once a complaint is registered, the theft of power is assessed by the local SDO who files an assessment report on which the enforcement wing takes further action. “If we get the assessment reports from SDOs in time, I am confident of recovering around Rs 387 crore more from the offenders,” Saxena said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/anti-power-theft-wing-clicks-recovers-rs-47crore-curbs-rampant-katia-culture/articleshow/81794497.cms||Subhash Mishra

Farmers carrying BKU and black flags reached the venue and started raising slogans against the JJP leader and the BJP-JJP government. Heavy police force was deployed outside the mini secretariat to control the protesting farmers, but they stood their ground and burnt an effigy of Dushyant. The deputy CM had cancelled his visit scheduled on March 26. Even though the administration refused to give reasons for cancellation, sources said it was following the intelligence reports that farmers would oppose his visit. While interacting with media personnel, the deputy CM said, “We have taken up 15 registered grievances, seven of which were resolved on the spot.” Regarding the farmer’s protest, he said, “Everyone has the right to protest in a democracy. The government is ready for talks. The protesting farmers should come forward for talks, as it is the only way to resolve the issue.” Claiming that the government’s aim was to make the farming community prosperous, he said all arrangements have been made for procurement of wheat and mustard which started on April 1. He said six crops are being procured at minimum support price in the state and full payment would be made directly into the farmers’ accounts this season. Reply to a question about his uncle and INLD leader Abhay Chautala’s statement that farmers should tie up BJP-JJP leaders if they visit their village, Dushyant said, “ I don’t think he is a serious politician.” Condemning the attack on BJP MLA Arun Narang in Punjab, he said it was a police failure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/on-panipat-visit-dushyant-gets-a-black-flag-reception/articleshow/81791365.cms||---
---||Meerut||UP: 30-inch-tall man’s five-year quest for partner bears fruit||MUZAFFARNAGAR: For five years, Azeem Mansuri has been looking for a partner. And for five years, he has met disappointment. But now, the quest of the 30-inch tall man from UP’s Kairana could finally be over — he has got not one but two proposals. Azeem, a class V dropout who works at a cosmetics store, believed it was his height that held him back in his quest. TOI had in May 2019 reported that he had met former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav with his urgent request seeking help to find a partner for life. On March 12 this year, TOIreported he had gone to the police with his request. Cops had then told him they would see what they could do to help. Earlier this month, the first proposal came from Rehana Ansari, 25, in Ghaziabad. “I would be happy to marry him,” said Rehana, about the same height as Azeem. She had dropped out when she was in class III. “I can help him at home,” she added. Her father, Mohammad Iqbal said, “He is in distress and so are we. If this marriage is solemnised, both families would be glad. My friend has got in touch with the Mansuri family with the ‘rishta’. We are hoping they say yes.” Then, within days, came the next proposal, this time from a woman in Delhi. “I want to say this to Azeem Mansuri. You are alone and I am alone. I live in Delhi and I want to marry you. I saw him in a video,” says the woman in a video circulating on WhatsApp, which reached Azeem. The woman did not identify herself in the 30-second video. But Azeem is optimistic: “I think it is a sign from god. He has shown there is someone for me in this world. It is he who will bring her before me.” A relative of his, Asif Mansuri, said many proposals have been coming in since the news was picked up. “There are families from Moradabad, Hapur and Saharanpur who have expressed interest,” he added. Azeem, meanwhile, is upbeat. He said, “My family is discussing which girl would be suitable for me. Hopefully, I will be married soon.” Watch Uttar Pradesh: 30-inch-tall man’s five-year quest for partner bears fruit||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/and-its-a-match-30-inch-tall-mans-5-year-quest-for-partner-bears-fruit/articleshow/81784396.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||Lucknow||Ghaziabad civic body bond over-subscribed by 4 times||LUCKNOW: The Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation became the second municipal corporation in the state after Lucknow to raise funds through listed bonds. On Wednesday, it concluded its municipal bond issue and raised Rs 150 crore for the construction of a tertiary sewage treatment plant. The green bond, termed so as it is meant for an environmentally sustainable project or waste water reuse, was over-subscribed by four times with 40 bids worth Rs 401 crore. Rajneesh Dubey, additional chief secretary (urban development), said that the base issue was for Rs 100 crore with a green issue option of Rs 50 crore at a coupon rate of 8.10%. “This can be termed as a highly competitive rate in the history of municipal bonds in India. The issue was oversubscribed by more than four times which demonstrates the confidence of the market in the municipal bonds segment and is a resounding validation of good governance in the state of Uttar Pradesh,” he said.The issue was reportedly subscribed within the first minute of opening. The tertiary sewage treatment plant will be set up in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram for use in the Sahibabad Industrial Area. The total cost of the project is Rs 240 crore and it will be partly funded by the green municipal bonds. An official said that the detailed project report has been readied and the treated waste water will be purchased by local industrialists which would reduce their dependence on groundwater. The project is slated to be completed within 27 to 30 months. The Rs 200 crore Lucknow Municipal Corporation bond, when it was launched on November 13, 2020, was oversubscribed by 4.5 times and closed at 8.5% coupon rate for 10 years. Lucknow became the ninth city in the country to raise funds through municipal bonds. The funds raised will be used for various infrastructure schemes like water supply and housing which are being implemented under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) Scheme. Some states like Gujarat have been generating funds through bonds since the past few years. To be able to list on the BSE, a corporation requires a minimum of an AA rating, to be given by at least two independent agencies. So far only the Lucknow and Ghaziabad corporations have qualified for the AA rating. The government will also be pushing for bonds to be similarly floated by the municipal corporations of Agra, Kanpur and Varanasi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ghaziabad-civic-body-bond-over-subscribed-by-4-times/articleshow/81794588.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Chandigarh||Resolve to continue stir biggest victory for farmers: Bhupinder Singh Hooda||ROHTAK: Haryana leader of opposition and former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Wednesday commended the farmers for their ongoing struggle against the three farm laws, saying their determination to continue the protest even after four months was their biggest victory. Hooda, who once again reached out to protesting farmers at Makdouli toll plaza, reiterated his whole-hearted support to the movement while justifying demands of farmers. “It has been more than four months since the farmers started their movement against farm laws. All this while, the movement has remained peaceful and disciplined. The morale is high and farmers are not tired despite their long struggle. The movement continues to grow, and this is the biggest victory for farmers,” he said. Sounding a note of caution, he said the government would try to repeatedly provoke the farmers, but “farmers have to ensure that no one takes any step that goes against the movement or gives a chance to point fingers at the struggle”. He said more than 300 farmers have lost their lives during the protests, but the government has not shown any empathy. “The Congress Legislature Party has given a financial help of Rs 2 lakh each to families of the martyred farmers. When the Congress forms the government, these farmers will be given a martyr status, appropriate financial help and government jobs would be provided to a member of their families,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/resolve-to-continue-stir-biggest-victory-for-farmers-hooda/articleshow/81791369.cms||Sat Singh
---||Mumbai||Bombay high court raps ex-Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, asks why no FIR against Anil Deshmukh||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday, following a marathon hearing, reserved its orders on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by former city police chief Param Bir Singh seeking a CBI probe into his allegations of “corrupt malpractices” against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh after the state objected to its maintainability. The HC itself questioned Singh’s plea for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) without any First Information Report (FIR) being filed. State advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni sought dismissal of the PIL, with exemplary cost. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni questioned the maintainability of Singh’s petition as a PIL, stressing on the absence of an FIR, and said that as a police officer, Singh would know the Criminal Procedure Code well and would be “failing in his duty” if he didn’t file an FIR. “Simply writing letters to the CM won’t do… If any citizen finds an offence being committed, he is duty-bound to file an FIR. You are a police officer. If you find an offence has been committed, you are duty-bound to file an FIR. Why did you not do it?” asked the CJ. Singh, in an 8-page letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, had alleged Deshmukh had met subordinate police officers, including suspended API Sachin Waze, and asked for a collection of Rs 100 crore. Deshmukh has denied the allegations. Read AlsoMumbai: Retd HC judge Chandiwal to probe ex-CP’s chargesA week after the MVA cabinet took the decision to institute a probe by a retired judge, the state government on Tuesday appointed Justice Kailash Uttamchand Chandiwal, a former judge of Bombay high court, to investigate charges of irregularities and corruption levelled by former Mumbai police“What have you done for registration of FIR?... Did you approach state police?” the CJ asked, repeatedly stressing how, without an FIR, the criminal law cannot be set in motion. The bench asked senior counsel Vikram Nankani, appearing for Singh, to first satisfy HC on maintainability of the PIL and whether the court can direct investigation without an FIR in order to get interim relief. The interim relief sought is ‘safe custody’ of CCTV footage from outside Deshmukh’s residence. Nankani read out Singh’s letter and referred to the report by Rashmi Shukla, former commissioner (intelligence) to the Director General of Police to submit the issue is “related to interference by political masters.” He said Singh was not challenging his transfer order of March 17. The CJ also observed there was “no affidavit” either by any police officer to say the alleged demand was made in his presence. The bench asked Singh’s counsel if the ex-top cop had any first-hand information himself. Kumbhakoni said the plea was based on “hearsay” and contended that Singh came to court without clean hands and heart. He cited a judgment that warrants no relief to such petitioners. He also said that after Shukla’s report of August 2020 on a corruption racket in police transfers, the state had in September 2020 closed the file. Kumbhakoni said the ex-police chief had not revealed his “enmity” with the home minister. He also called Singh a “disgruntled” litigant and said his PIL was “motivated by personal vendetta.” Nankani said the issue raised is larger and of grave importance and if state has done nothing yet, HC is not powerless and can even convert a letter into a PIL. In his rejoinder to the AG, he said the state having appointed an inquiry panel headed by former HC judge K U Chandiwal shows the state too thinks it is a serious issue. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, for CBI, said it was willing to probe Singh’s allegations but left it for HC to decide in what form or by which agency. The CJ said, “Are police officers, ministers, politicians all above the law?” The bench said, “Do not view yourself so high, the law is above you.” In 1977 Lord Denning had immortalized Thomas Fuller’s words of over 300 years ago, “Be ye never so high, the law is above you.” The bench said if police commit a crime in presence of another police officer, what would it (police) do? Would it not register an FIR? Nankani, who appeared along with counsel Birendra Saraf and Sharan Jagtiani, cited judgments but HC asked him to cite one which says without an FIR, the HC can direct a probe. Nankani cited the landmark 2014 SC judgment in Lalita Kumari’s case which empowers police to even conduct a preliminary enquiry to ascertain if a cognizable offence is made out. The bench also said, “It is only in extremely rare cases that court can order an FIR to be registered.” It said HC cannot be reduced to a magistrate’s court which can direct police to register an FIR if police fail to do so. Subhash Jha, counsel for another PIL petitioner, advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay, who is also seeking a probe based on Singh’s letter, said the issue merited a probe against those running an “extortion racket”, which was akin to “loot and plunder.” The HC also heard submissions in another PIL filed by chartered accountant Mohan Bhide of Bhide Education Pvt ltd. His PIL, citing Singh’s letter, sought a CBI probe. Read AlsoParam Bir allegations serious, but he should go to HC: SCNEW DELHI: While observing that allegations levelled by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh are quite serious, the Supreme Court asked Singh to approach the Bombay HC in pursuance of his plea for a fair and impartial probe. Referring toAnother city advocate, Jaishri Patil, the first to file a petition, not a PIL, on March 23, for a CBI or independent agency probe against Deshmukh and the role of Singh based on his letter, had also sought directions to Malabar police to register an FIR on her complaint made on March 21. Her complaint was based on Singh’s letter. Another bench had on Tuesday questioned her “locus” but recorded AG’s submission to seek clubbing of all related petitions with Singh’s PIL. She mentioned before HC on Wednesday that her complaint was pending. The CJ-led bench observed that earlier, it was not often that FIRs were “not registered.” Before 4 pm, as the hearing continued, the HC called immediately for the station diary from Malabar Hill police station to know the status and action taken by them on her complaint. The bench asked the AG if any FIR was registered based on Patil’s complaint. The AG said none had been. He relied on the landmark SC ruling of 2013 to submit that police may take a while to ascertain existence of a cognizable offence by conducting a preliminary probe. The AG later said the inward register had an entry but not Patil’s name in the station diary. Nankani said lack of entry in station diary proves Singh’s point of the state not likely to take action. “This is a great example of state sweeping things under the carpet.” To HC’s queries on FIR, he said, “It would be Ceasar to Ceasar because police come under the home department.” The HC said even if complaints are made against ministers or CMs, CrPC provisions cannot be set aside. “Tomorrow if a PM or HM is involved, who will investigate… would you want a superpower from outside to investigate,” the CJ wondered. Nankani said in such a case, there can be court-monitored probes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/high-court-raps-param-bir-asks-why-no-fir-against-deshmukh/articleshow/81800057.cms||Swati Deshpande

I think the government should not do any kind of strictness.” He said the five Sikh high priests held a meeting and had directed the members of Chief Khalsa Diwan (CKD) to strictly follow it (CKD) constitution. He said the Sikh clergy had also directed the management of CKD to reinstate the supremacy of Akal Takht which was removed by the management in the name of making certain amendments in its constitution.

---||Lucknow||Yogi: Cong-DMK alliance demeaning ‘matra shakti’||Lucknow: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday mounted a veiled attack on the Congress-DMK alliance in Tamil Nadu, accusing it of demeaning ‘matra shakti’ (empowerment of mothers) by using abhorrent language against women. “Jo log aadhi abadi ka samman nahi kar sakte unhe satta mein aane ka koi adhikar nahi hai. (Those who cannot respect women have no right to come to power),” Yogi said, while addressing rallies in Coimbatore (South) and Virudhunagar in poll-bound Tamil Nadu. His attack came a day after Election Commission slapped a notice on DMK leader A Raja’s alleged lewd remark at Tamil Nadu chief minister E Palaniswami. Raja had reportedly said: “MK Stalin (DMK leader) is a child of a good relationship and good birth while Palaniswami is a child of a bad relationship and was prematurely born”. BJP, which has struck an alliance with All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) is contesting 20 of 234 seats, while Congress has partnered with Stalin-led DMK to contest 25 seats. Reiterating that BJP was committed to ‘matra shakti’, Yogi said, Kanyakumari symbolised empowerment of the mother. As part of an alliance with AIADMK, BJP will be contesting the bypoll in Kanyakumari Lok Sabha seat and would be up against DMK-backed Congress. The seat fell vacant after the death of Congress MP H Vasanthakumar. “The history of Congress and DMK is replete with corruption, anarchy and nepotism. They misuse power for personal gains and are responsible for polluting the political environment of the country and the state,” Yogi said, citing the Commonwealth Games scam, coal scam and 2G scam, which surfaced in the tenure of previous Congress-led governments. Yogi also invoked Tamil and Sanskrit, calling the languages ‘samriddh’ (prosperous). “Both have given recognition to the country on the international forum,” he said, stressing on the need to preserve Tamil cultural identity. The UP CM also spoke about the valour of Tamil Nadu-born fighter pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, saying the contribution of the south Indian state in safeguarding India’s borders can never be forgotten. Wing commander Varthaman was held captive in Pakistan for 60 hours after his aircraft was shot down in an aerial combat during the 2019 India–Pakistan standoff. He also stressed that the proposed defence corridor in Coimbatore would help fortify the country’s defence. “Wing commander Abhinandan Pakistan ke chhakkey chhudane ka karya karta hai…Coimbatore mein banne wala defence corridor rajya ko nayi pehchan dila kar ke bharat ki raksha ke liye Tamil nadu ko sadaiv smarniya banata rahega… (The state would always be remembered for the valour of wing commander Abhinandan and the upcoming defence corridor in Coimbatore),” he said. Yogi said, the proposed defence corridor project was part of PM Narendra Modi’s vision to make the state self-reliant and turn it into a defence hub. The UP CM claimed BJP was poised to storm to power in Assam and West Bengal. “And if the AIADMK-BJP alliance wins in Tamil Nadu, it will become a symbol of sabka saath sabka vikas,” he said. Yogi said, the Modi government, which came to power at the Centre six years ago, initiated multiple public welfare schemes, including those entailing housing and free gas connection. “These schemes will be fast-tracked if the BJP-AIADMK comes back to power,” he said, underscoring BJP’s vision of development that was driven by safety for women and employment of youth. Yogi pointed out that the BJP government at the Centre had chosen as many as 12 cities of Tamil Nadu to be developed as smart cities. At the same time, the NDA government would fulfil the popular demand of setting up a new university, an international sports academy and coaching facilities for the youth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-cong-dmk-alliance-demeaning-matra-shakti/articleshow/81794632.cms||Pankaj Shah

One of the two thieves arrested on Wednesday in connection with the theft committed last month in Bijnor’s kotwali dehat area told police during the interrogation. Bijnor superintendent of police Dharm Veer Singh said two thieves broke into a public service centre owned by Nawab Haider on the intervening night of February 16 and 17. Following a complaint lodged by Haider that more than Rs 7 lakh was stolen from the centre, police had registered a case against the unidentified accused and launched a probe. On Wednesday, police claimed to have cracked the case with the arrest of two accused — Naushad and Ajaj, both in their early 30s— from Alipur under Nagina police station area. The SP said the accused were arrested from a restaurant on Wednesday with the help of a surveillance system. “The accused are habitual offenders and have several cases registered against them at different police stations. They confessed to have committed a robbery at the public service centre and fled with Rs 7 lakh cash and other valuables kept in an almirah. The accused told police that they had thought of mere thousands of rupees at the centre, but were overjoyed after getting the huge amount of money. They divided the money evenly. However, soon after the theft, buoyed Ajaj suffered a heart attack and was admitted to a private hospital. He had to squander a big chunk of the stolen money on his treatment. Naushad, however, spent the money in betting in Delhi,” said the SP. The SP added that police seized Rs 3.7 lakh cash and two pistols from their possession and impounded a bike that they had lifted from Phulsanda village. The SP, meanwhile, announced a reward of Rs5,000 for the police team for cracking the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/overjoyed-thief-suffers-heart-attack-seeing-huge-amount-of-stolen-money-spends-a-big-chunk-on-his-treatment/articleshow/81784430.cms||---

Gyms, which had been shut for most part of the last year, were opened for a brief period in October only to be closed again from March 15 due to rising Covid-19 cases in the city. The gym owners, led by All India Congress Committee (AICC) member and social worker Kunda Raut, submitted a memorandum to the minister at the divisional commissioner’s office. “Most of these youths are certified gym trainers and have taken loans to start the gyms. Many of them also have the EMIs pending. Like doctors, these trainers are also Covid warriors as they help people remain fit, build immunity, reduce blood pressure and control diabetes etc,” said the AICC member. Gym owner Kuldeep Chikane said, “We’re following all protocols and guidelines issued by the government from the day we were given the go ahead to start gyms after almost a seven-month-long national lockdown.” Another gym owner Rajesh Ghodmare said if not allowed to reopen now, we will not be able to service the loans availed for purchasing the instruments. “We don’t have any other source of income. We somehow managed during the seven-month lockdown, but now all our savings have exhausted. The government should at least grant some concessions in taxes for the gym owners considering the pandemic situation. It would be extremely difficult to survive if another lockdown is imposed,” he told TOI. While accepting the memorandum, Raut said he understands the hardships being faced by the gym owners. He assured the delegation that there would be a new standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the central government, which the state would study and take a call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/allow-reopening-of-gyms-owners-plead-min/articleshow/81791619.cms||Ranjit Deshmukh

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra receives 27 lakh Covid vaccine doses for 45-plus drive from today||MUMBAI: The state received a supply of nearly 27 lakh doses of the Covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday as it prepared to kickstart immunisation of all above 45 years from Thursday. In Mumbai, at least five hospitals—BKC jumbo, Goregaon Nesco jumbo, KEM in Parel, BYL Nair in Mumbai Central and Rajawadi in Ghatkopar—will start operating in two shifts from Thursday. Over the next few days, five more centres will start working in 8am-8pm shifts. Dr Dilip Patil, Maharashtra’s in-charge for immunisation, said there will be no specific time slots. People will have to register online or do on-spot registration at vaccination centres. “The only change is that they don’t have to carry any comorbidity certificate. They can simply come with any age and identity proof document,” he said, adding the number of sessions in Maharashtra could be raised from 2,800 to 3,200 in coming weeks. Officials in Mumbai are waiting to see if the daily turnout will increase with the opening up of vaccination for more categories. Mumbai’s average turnout has dropped to 28,000-30,000 from a high of 45,000 till last week, even as civic chief I S Chahal said the ideal target should be 1 lakh vaccinations in a day. The Centre on Wednesday also told states to identify low vaccine coverage pockets, particularly in districts showing a Covid surge. “We are preparing more centres to work in double shifts in the hope that more people show up. Our concern is that people from upper and middle strata have taken the vaccine. The challenge now is to get those from slum pockets,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. As for the preparedness for Thursday, Kakani said nurses have been hired to work in double shifts. Mumbai will receive fresh stocks of 2.25 lakh doses in addition to 1.5 lakh that are already there. At BKC jumbo centre, dean Dr Rajesh Dere said a new waiting area with 500 chairs has been created. Around 16 new registration desks have been added in addition to the existing 18. “We have increased the vaccination cubicles to 22,” he said. At the Nesco facility in Goregaon, vaccinations will start at 8am. “We will have 15 units vaccinating in 2 shifts. The staff will be different for the two sessions,” said dean Dr Neelam Andrade.

Police, however, did not confirm any hooch death and were probing the incidents. Except in Begusarai where two persons died and police took possession of the bodies for conducting postmortem on Wednesday, the deceased in other districts were cremated by their kin, making it difficult for the administration to ascertain the cause of deaths. Two hooch deaths were reported from Goriyari village under Bakhri police station area in Begusarai, four from Badhauni panchayat under Town police station in Nawada and five at Kochas and Kargahar in Rohtas. Begusarai DM Arvind Kumar Verma said he, along with SP Awakash Kumar, visited the village after getting reports about hooch deaths. “However, the family members of the deceased, ward members and other villagers denied that they had consumed liquor. We have decided to register unnatural death cases for further investigating the matter,” he said. Verma said one Virendra from the village is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Begusarai. “He also denied consuming liquor. Postmortem of the deceased have been conducted and viscera preserved,” the DM said. Bakhri SHO Basuki Nath Jha said the deceased were identified as Rajkumar Sahni (22) and Sakaldeo Choudhary (35). In reply to a query, the DM admitted that 400 litres of countrymade liquor was seized from the village during raids on March 22. Verma said the deceased as well as the one in hospital had symptoms of vomiting and loose motion. Incidentally, two of the four deceased in Nawada also suffered from vomiting, diarrhoea and breathlessness. Nawada Town police station SHO TN Tiwari said the deceased were identified as Ramdev Ram (60) of Gondapur, Gopal Singh (35) of Kiswa, Prabhakar Gupta (40) of Akbarpur and one Loha Singh Thathera of Kharidi Bigha village. “Ram died on Wednesday morning while Singh passed away on Tuesday. Gupta died on March 28 and Thathera three days back,” he added. Sadar SDPO Upendra Prasad said since the bodies have been cremated, the cause of death could not be ascertained. Nawada DM Yash Pal Meena said a team of doctors and district administration officers was constituted to ascertain the reason for their vomiting, diarrhoea and breathlessness. “Nothing related to hooch poisoning has surfaced yet. The four died in two different villages of Bhadauni. The doctor has mentioned cardiac arrest as the reason behind the third death,” he said. “The family of one deceased is yet to be traced. Private doctors who treated the other two for vomiting, diarrhoea and breathlessness said no foul smell was coming from their mouth to ascertain that they had consumed liquor," he said. Meena said they might have died of food poisoning or by consuming expired medicines. “We are probing the case from all angles,” he said. Rohtas SP Ashish Bharti said all the five bodies had been cremated without informing the administration. “The DM has constituted a probe team to ascertain if the deaths were related to hooch poisoning. Nothing can be said at the moment,” he said. The deceased were identified as Vinod Chauhan of ward number 11, Manoj Ram of ward number 13, Ramavatar Ram of Chawri and Rajesh Singh of Kanjar under Kochas police station area and Satish Kumar of Rampur under Kargahar police station area. “Satish, 16, died on Wednesday. He suffered from vomiting and diarrhoea after eating too much on Holi,” he said. The SP said Ramavatar also died after suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea on March 24. He said Ganesh and Manoj had fallen ill on Monday while Vinod was found dead in his house on Tuesday. “The family members of the deceased said some people had promised them financial assistance from the government if they told the police that their kin died after consuming liquor,” the SP said. “A team led by Sasaram SDO is conducting inquiry,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/suspected-hooch-kills-11-in-begusarai-nawada-and-rohtas/articleshow/81788468.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Automatic doors of Goa Tejas Express kaput in 4 yrs||MUMBAI: India’s most advanced train Tejas Express, which runs between CSMT and Karmali (Goa), has developed a snag in its automatic door-closing system which was introduced for the first time ever on long-distance train coaches on Indian Railways in 2017. The premium train caters to elite passengers. Times ViewIt is surprising that such a snag has developed in deploying a technology which finds widespread application in railways and metro coaches across the world. Such snags should not dissuade railways from extending its use to all coaches. Automatically closing doors are necessary to prevent boarding or alighting from running trains.Among its major features were reclining chairs, wi-fi, infotainment, bio-vaccum toilets and automatic door-closing system. The automatic door-closing system was provided to ensure safety of passengers and also security so that unauthorised passengers do not enter the coaches. Also, it prevents accidents as passengers are not able to board or alight from a running train. However, the train’s automatic door-closing system has encountered a technical problem due to which the door does not open or close. A senior CR official confirmed, “There have been problems in some doors, but not all. We have identified these doors and have deputed attendants who operate the doors. Even train ticket examiners have been alerted about it.” The official said that due to this glitch, there has been no adverse impact on punctuality of the trains though doors are operated manually. CR’s chief public relations officer Shivaji Sutar said, “We are close to resolving this issue in the next few weeks. Also, we have decided to appoint a contractor to undertake annual maintenance. The contractor will fix the glitch and also ensure that this problem does not recur.” The Automatic sliding Plug doors installed in the rake are controlled by centralized door control equipment installed in the guard’s compartment. Guard panel has push buttons to activate the door functional commands. Emergency door opening switch is also provided on the door. The train moves only after all entrance doors are closed and the doors open only when the train halts. Rail Yatri Sangh’s Subhash Gupta said, “Within just four years, the glitch has occurred. The railway board should inspect all Tejas rakes to see if it is a manufacturing or defect in technology.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-automatic-doors-of-goa-tejas-exp-kaput-in-4-yrs/articleshow/81794742.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Allahabad||UP: Ex-cop who sought POTA against Mukhtar Ansari exonerated||LUCKNOW: Former deputy superintendent of police (DySP) Shailendra Singh, who resigned from the police services in 2004 when he fell out with then ruling Samajwadi Party government for recommending the arrest of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari under POTA, got a major relief when a Varanasi court accepted Yogi Aditaynath government’s decision to drop charges against the ex-cop that were allegedly slapped for challenging the might of the mafia don. “It is a big relief to me and my family. Finally, the truth has prevailed. It was because of this criminal case that I was unable to get a passport, an arms licence,” said Shailendra talking to TOI on phone. He said the criminal case was a part of the arm twisting tactics of the powers that be to silence him and allow the dust to settle on the entire episode including his resignation from the police services. The government had approached the court to drop charges against Shailendra, which was accepted on March 6. Shailendra was handed over a copy of the court order on Tuesday. Widely known as an upright officer, DySP Shailendra’s resignation in February 2004 made national headlines when he faxed his resignation to the then governor Vishnu Kant Shastri after he was allegedly ‘asked by his higher-ups’ not to initiate POTA proceedings against Mukhtar Ansari in a gun running case. The move rocked the state assembly that was in session as the opposition mounted its attack on the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led government so much so that the chief minister who was on a tour to Auraiya cut short his schedule and flew back to Lucknow. The then leader of opposition Lalji Tandon said the developments were indicative of a rot in the system. “It seems the state is heading towards the Constitutional breakdown and at some point of time, the governor might have to take cognizance for of such a situation for recommending the dismissal of the government," he had said. In a knee jerk reaction the government slapped a criminal case on Shailendra when he staged a sit-in outside the office of Varanasi District Magistrate (DM). Police later arrested him and he resigned from the service. The incident came as a major blow to the morale of the Special Task Force which was constituted by the Kalyan Singh government in 1998 to tackle organised crime and had by then managed to earn a reputation of an elite crack force since it came into existence six years ago. By then STF had conducted successful operations in several states primarily because of the support that it got from the political masters. Shailendra Singh episode had left the STF sleuths disheartened, recalls a senior police officer. After his resignation, Shailendra decided to contest the 2004 Lok Sabha election from Varanasi as an independent candidate. He lost the 2009 Lok Sabha poll on the Congress ticket from Chandauli. In the 2012 assembly elections, he tried his luck on the Congress ticket from Saiyadraja assembly constituency in Chandauli but lost. He had an almost seven-year stint in the Congress where he headed the party’s RTI cell for UP. Singh joined the BJP on April 15, 2014. In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Singh was in charge of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘war room’ in Varanasi. In 2004, it all began when DySP Shailendra was directed by the then SPgovernment to keep a watch on associates of Mukhtar Ansari and then MLA Krishnanand Rai after the two sides exchanged fire in Cantonment police circle of Lucknow. The government was of the view that the standoff between the two could end up in a major crime which had to be averted. As surveillance was stepped up, on the basis of electronic evidence it was established that Mukhtar was in touch with an army deserter to buy a light machine gun. Mukhtar wanted the sophisticated weapon allegedly to eliminate Krishnanad Rai. “Actually, Krishnanand Rai then moved in a bullet proof vehicle and use of normal rifles would not have helped. Hence Mukhtar wanted to buy a light machine gun (LMG) from an army deserter,” recollects Shailendra. The problem began when Shailendra initiated POTA proceedings against Mukhtar and others arrested in the case. Overnight not only Shailendra was shifted from Varanasi to Lucknow headquarters of STF but the then IG, DIG and SSP STF were transferred out for having failed to stop a DySP. In November Shailendra was heading an agitation of students and had staged a sit-in at the office of DM Varanasi when an FIR (crime number 576/2004) was lodged against him for creating ruckus. The former DySP was booked under sections 143 (unlawful assembly) / 353 (Assault to deter public servant from discharge of duty) / 419 (cheating by personation) was slapped when he was accused of forcing himself into the office. On the initiative of the state government, the charges have now been dropped against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ex-cop-who-sought-pota-against-mukhtar-exonerated/articleshow/81812136.cms||Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Investors can lease land, set up units||GANDHINAGAR: Those wishing to set up an industrial unit in Gujarat, here’s something that might entice you. The state government plans to ease the process of land allotment on long-term lease. All the investor has to do is pay an annual rate of 6% of the total land value, according to a new policy by the department of industries and mines. The policy, according to the state department, will ease the tedious process of obtaining land to set up industrial units. The scheme will be a huge relief for industries that may have otherwise have to shell a large sum to buy land in the state. The government has also made necessary changes in the present state revenue laws to ensure that the scheme is implemented hassle-free for industrial purposes. A government resolution (GR) issued by the state industry and mines department announced the new scheme as ‘allotting government waste land to industries on long-term lease under the new industrial policy 2020’. The GR states, “The decision to make available the government waste land to the industries on long-term basis was under consideration. So, by the following scheme, the government has decided to offer government waste land to industries at 6% annual rate of the derived market value of the said land. Annual rent will be increased by 10% every five years. Maximum term of the lease period will be 50 years. However, the government of that time decides so, the lease can be extended further.’’ Manoj Das, incharge ACS industry and mines department, said: “The state government had received widescale feedback from industries that if they get land on lease, they will be in better position to start operation in much lower time as time will be saved in acquiring land. Long-term lease will save cost of industries also so they will be in position to invest more on other requirements. Government has made categorical rules to ensure that industries fulfill expectations of generating employment and contributing to the state GDP.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/investors-can-lease-land-set-up-units/articleshow/81788512.cms||Kapil Dave

---||Ahmedabad||White tigers to roar at Indroda||AHMEDABAD: The Indroda Nature Park will soon get two royal inmates to join its big cat gang. Already home to lions and leopards, the park will get a pair of white tigers from the Rajkot zoo. The pair – 5-year-old Godavari and 2-year-old Gautam – will arrive at Indroda later this week or early next week. Confirming this, Rajkot Zoo Superintendent RK Hirpara said, “We have given the tigers to Indroda in exchange of other animal which we are receiving from Sakkarbaug Zoo.”  Hirpara said the Rajkot zoo has given white tigers to Kankaria zoo in Ahmedabad, Chattbir zoo in Punjab, and Pune zoo. He said that the Rajkot zoo received a pair of wild asses, four-horned antelope (chausingha), and one male wolf. Gir officials said that with the arrival of the white tigers, Indroda will have eight big cats including a pair of Asiatic lions and two pairs of leopards. Apart from this, Indroda also has herbivores like sambhar, white buck, black buck, spotted deer, chinkara among others. Also, due to its proximity to the Sabarmati river, neelgai grazing in the open is a common sight here. A senior official said that Indroda park receives about 6.5 lakh visitors annually. Most of them are youngsters and college students. Officials said that the big cats will not be displayed in cages. Indroda park has already readied its largest moated enclosures for the big cats where they will get more space to move around in a green surrounding, similar to its natural habitat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/white-tigers-to-roar-at-indroda/articleshow/81794677.cms||---
---||Dehradun||We are ready to make Kumbh a grand event, says Uttarakhand chief secretary||DEHRADUN: With the Kumbh Mela starting officially from Thursday, chief secretary Om Prakash in an exclusive interaction with TOI on Wednesday said that all preparations have been done to make the religious fair a grand event. “Even though the Covid-19 pandemic pushed back our preparations by a few months, almost 95% of the total works have been completed,” said Prakash, who was camping in Haridwar for the past few days. He added that apart from a vehicle parking and a bus stand project at Bairagi camp, all other works have been completed. “The Kumbh Mela area — spread over 604 hectares — has been divided into 23 administrative sectors, including one of the railways. We have arranged for adequate parking space and security forces have been deployed to ensure that the pilgrims do not face any problem,” Om Prakash said. To make sure that there is no overcrowding at the ghats, a total of 107 ghats – stretching over a distance of 20-km – have been prepared, he added. On the key bathing dates, the authorities will set a time period for the devotees to leave the ghats after taking a dip in the Ganga. As for the security arrangements in the Kumbh, a total of 1,411 police personnel, one team of NSG, 12 companies of paramilitary force, four companies of PAC, three teams of ATS, two bomb disposal squads, and one dog squad have been deployed, the senior IAS officer said. The entire Kumbh and adjoining areas have been covered with 500 CCTV cameras, which have been linked to the main control room. In addition, nine police lines have been set up and parking space has been created at six different locations for parking of inter-state vehicles. In case the parking gets full, the authorities have identified different locations — in the range of 5 km-to-6 km from the Mela area — for parking of vehicles. Around 1,000 shuttle buses have also been stationed at these locations to bring the devotees to the ghats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/we-are-ready-to-make-kumbh-a-grand-event-says-ukhand-chief-secretary/articleshow/81784457.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: I-T unearths Rs 700 crore in land deals in Yadadri||HYDERABAD: Days after conducting searches on two real estate companies involved in purchase and sale of land in and around Yadadri temple town, the income tax (I-T) department has unearthed unaccounted cash transactions of Rs 700 crore and seized Rs 11.9 crore cash and gold jewellery worth Rs 2 crore. The I-T wing found incriminating evidence relating to unaccounted cash receipts of Rs 700 crore pertaining to the last six years, the income of which is taxable in the hands of the transacting parties. “The two firms were found to be accepting cash over and above the registered value of the land,” an I-T official said. “Such unaccounted cash is used for on-money payments for purchase of land and other incidental business expenses,” the official said. Sources said during the searches, the sleuths recovered documents, handwritten books and agreement papers indicating unaccounted cash transactions. Data was also recovered from a specialised software application as well as from other electronic gadgets. During the searches on JSR Group SunCity and Spectra Group, I-T sleuths verified cash transactions in purchase and sale of 1,000 acres in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district. Spectra has two major projects — Spectra Divine Galaxy an Spectra Galaxy Gold — in Yadadri. Searches were also conducted on Spectra India Housing Private Ltd, which is into land development in Yadadri district. Ever since the Telangana government decided to finish work on refurbishment of Yadadri temple on the lines of Tirumala, the area has become a hot spot for real estate companies and buyers. Some politicians involved in real estate transactions have also come under the radar of I-T department. The I-T wing is probing Congress leader Beerla Ilaiah in connection with some land parcels he had sold to the real estate companies. In all, searches were conducted in 18 locations in Hyderabad and Yadadri. Jadapalli Narayana, CMD of JSR Group, is also director of JSR Real Estates India Private Ltd, SunCity Resorts Private Ltd, Jadapalli Ecopolyptech India Private Ltd and two other companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/i-t-unearths-rs-700-cr-in-land-deals-in-yadadri/articleshow/81794786.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

It has been revamped keeping in mind various facilities meant for tourists coming from all over the world to visit the heritage site. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will inaugurate the stretch on April 17. Motorised vehicles will be banned on this road from 9am to 9pm so that people coming to Chandni Chowk do not have to face problems, including traffic jams. “It is a historical heritage site and the entire area has been made very beautiful, seeking to bring back the glory of this historical place,” Kejriwal said while announcing that the main road of Chandni Chowk had been redeveloped. “After the beautification of Chandni Chowk, tourism will get a major boost, and people coming to Delhi will be attracted to pay a visit to Chandni Chowk,” he added. The public works department (PWD) had decided to renovate and beautify the main road, which is in front of the Red Fort, in light of its historic importance and Chandni Chowk’s own identity. Due to poor maintenance, visitors and shoppers to the area had to face a lot of trouble. The tourist crowd and traffic jams also affected the image of the area. PWD took up the project to spruce up Chandni Chowk — from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Mosque— in order to make visitors feel good about the whole experience and let them admire the beauty of the area. Arrangements have been made on both sides to accommodate visitors. During the reconstruction process, the needs of the disabled were kept in mind.

While most hospitals have made a list of recipients who called up for a slot and will be registered on the portal as they walk in, there will be scope for others to walk in and get registered on the spot.  Other than the portal, several hospitals have registered 45-plus recipients on their own websites. “It will be a time-consuming process since the number will be huge. So, we have spaced out recipients across different time slots. Leaving scope for a reasonable number to walk in without prior intimation, we have arrived at a number that we can handle. If everything moves smoothly, we are ready to scale up the number,” said R Venkatesh of RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS). At AMRI Hospitals, 1,200 are expected to receive the shot across three units. Around 60% of the recipients could belong to the 45-plus group, according to CEO Rupak Barua. “We have registered many over the last few days but are keeping our registration windows open for recipients to walk in. There will be a separate registration counter for them,” said Barua. Belle Vue Clinic has 300 45-plus recipients booked for Thursday. About 150 more will be vaccinated as walk-in recipients. “We will inoculate at least 450 a day for the next week,” said CEO P Tondon. The Co-Win portal is yet to allow 45-plus recipients to register. So, Peerless Hospital is still asking for doctors’ certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosps-gear-up-for-45-vaccination-rush-keep-options-open-for-walk-in-recipients/articleshow/81788526.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Many districts sizzled with over 50 heatwave days in 7 years||HYDERABAD: Northern and north eastern districts of Telangana such as Jagtial, Mancherial, Peddapalli, Mahbubabad, Karimnagar, Adilabad have suffered during summers as they recorded more than 50 heatwave days each between 2014 and 2020. With the mercury rising even this year, several isolated pockets in these districts have already recorded maximum temperature of up to 43 degrees Celsius. The India Meteorological Department, Hyderabad standards identify heatwave conditions if maximum temperature of a station reaches at least 40 degrees Celsius or more for plains, 37 degrees Celsius or more for coastal areas and at least 30 degrees Celsius or more for hilly regions. The Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS) carried out hazard vulnerability analysis based on heatwave and severe heatwave conditions over each mandals in the state for the past seven years. The analysis indicates that three mandals fall under severe heatwave vulnerable category, 62 are critical, 187 are semi-critical, 316 are vigilant and 21 are under safe category. “Since these districts fall on the Deccan plateau, all the weather changes that occur in the northern parts of the country reflect over these districts,” said Rama Rao, consultant meteorologist, TSDPS. “Telangana is a semi-arid area and geographically located on a plateau due to which absorption of heat is higher than the southern parts of Telangana. Even during winters, they witness lowest temperatures in the state.” As per TSDPS data from 2014 to 2020, Jagtial has had maximum number of heatwave days, as much as 89, followed by 81 in Mancherial, 74 in Peddapalli, 64 in Karimnagar, 52 in Mahbubabad and 59 in Adilabad. With Telangana experiencing heatwave like conditions in many districts, meteorologists forecast there might not be respite anytime soon. “While heatwave like conditions will prevail till April 2, we don’t see any thunderstorm activity or any major change in the weather conditions for at least a week from now,” said Naga Ratna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/many-districts-sizzled-with-over-50-heatwave-days-in-7-yrs/articleshow/81791721.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Pune||Two former CMs warn of deep economic impact||Pune: A consensus against a possible lockdown in the state is building among former chief ministers and bureaucrats with demands to compensate the poor for the loss of income first, an effective implementation of the Covid-19 protocols, and caution about huge economic losses. Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said no state should be allowed “thoughtless” announcements for a lockdown. The state government must look at direct cash transfers to cover the needy in the likelihood of a lockdown, he added. “No one wants a lockdown, but if a state proposes one, adequate arrangements have to be made for minimal impact on the economy,”he said. Leader of opposition and another former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis told TOI that there should be a policy of “no lockdown” in the state as it is not the solution for addressing the rise in Covid-19 cases. “A lockdown is an intermediary step for readying infrastructure which was done last year. Today, it is about effective implementation of the Covid-19 protocol. A uniform policy has to be readied,” Fadnavis said. Even if there is a lockdown, people are compensated, he added. “It will impact the economy deeply and people will be affected badly. It is not advisable and is not the solution,” he said. Former bureaucrat Mahesh Zagade said a shutdown is an easy way out for the administration and only reflects the failure of the administration to strictly implement the Covid-19 protocol. “What is needed is engagement with the people to follow the rules and decentralise powers to follow a wardwise enforcement. I have submitted the same plan to the Pune Municipal Corporation but there has been no response to it,” he said. Zagade was the municipal commissioner of Pune during the swine flu outbreak in 2008. Another senior bureaucrat said a lockdown is no option at all as it will impact the economy hugely and many will lose jobs and livelihoods that give them a one-time meal. He recalled the situation of the migrant labourers and their return home last year when they could not cope with the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-former-cms-warn-of-deep-economic-impact/articleshow/81788537.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Over the past one month, seven cases have been registered by cybercrime sleuths of Hyderabad police involving app-based scamsters who disappeared with invested amount after promising higher returns. Senior officials suspect it could be the handiwork of a new group which sprung up in the past one month. Fraudsters initially offered 10% interest per day against small investments, ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 through mobile phone apps. After gaining the confidence of investors by prompt payments, gullible depositors were called and some were convinced to increase their investments to Rs 1 lakh or more, a senior official probing the case said. “After convincing investors to make bigger deposits, the accused became inaccessible. The apps also become defunct,’’ assistant commissioner of police (cybercrime) KVM Prasad told TOI. The fraud began with victims responding to unsolicited WhatsApp messages, police said. By clicking on the links sent in the messages, the app is downloaded on phones and then used for transactions, the sleuths said, adding that these apps are not available on play stores or other similar platforms. All the complainants are employed in different private organisations, police said. Police are now trying to locate the accused by tracking the accounts in which the money has been transferred Earlier, in the cases involving the Chinese apps, about 50 people, including four Chinese, have been arrested. At least six persons had killed themselves after harassment by lenders running these Chinese apps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/investors-duped-app-disappears-with-cash/articleshow/81794988.cms||Srinath Vudali

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Pandemic leaves kids with no play, no school||JAIPUR: For kindergarten kids, playschools are their first steps to the formal and social world. Outside their cocooned home environment, here they feel secure enough among children of their age, almost similar height, likes and dislikes, to mingle and make friends. Sadly, Covid pandemic has stolen away their sort of home away from home. Worse still, they are shut out from going to malls, zoos, or even social and sometimes family gatherings. Their physical and social isolation at this developmental stage for a prolonged period is reaching a tipping point, feel many parents. “I can no longer control my son with phones or television. Very often, he is seeking out friends to play, and demanding to go out to the park or just any place outside the home confinement,” says Shivang Malhotra, whose son is in KG. Malhotra says his five-year old’s vocal tones have become slightly shriller, with occasions of insistence on activities he likes to do growing by the day. It’s been more than a year since the schools were closed. Till a month ago when the Covid pandemic seemed to be fading out, parents were expecting the schools to reopen and a resetting to normalcy would begin after the emotionally challenging phase. Dr Savita Jagawat, a senior clinical psychologist said the prolonged confinement at home and addiction to gadgets can affect the children’s cognitive power, attention span, memory and intelligent quotient and also lead to psychosocial and mental health implications which could be both short-term and long term. “Kids between three-six years of age need emotional gratification through various means. But at that age, they can neither understand a problem nor express the mental distress they are in for not getting what they want. If things of their likes are denied to them regularly, that can reflect negatively in their behaviour and lead to psychological disorders,” she said. In the formal, yet relaxed atmosphere of the playschools, children are drawn to activities like colouring the drawings, singing, dancing, and playing games, etc. They take part in national day celebrations, festivals and other social occasions. Priya Chadha, who teaches nursery classes at a private playschool, said, “Those kids who were supposed to take admission in the playschool but could not do so due to the pandemic have suffered the most because the activities undertaken for them in the school cannot be replicated at home or through online. It might have, in some measure, stunted their mental development.” She said the bigger worry is that there is no clarity as to when they will come back to school again. “They have already lost one complete year and they cannot afford to miss another one. Unfortunately, the current Covid situation does not generate enough optimism,” added Chadha. Jagawat said that schools need to create awareness among parents about the children’s psychological needs. Parents should also look out for manifestation of behavioural problems in kids early on so that they can find remedy, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pandemic-leaves-kids-with-no-play-no-school/articleshow/81791908.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala assembly elections 2021: Hidden agenda? A low-key League & up-beat CPI||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As election campaign reaches the final phase, LDF and UDF camps are witnessing unusual developments. Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) – the second biggest constituent in UDF –is taking efforts to minimize its presence outside its strongholds. Whereas CPI, the second biggest partner in LDF, is hell-bent on making its presence felt in constituencies where it holds very little political clout. Both parties seem to have valid reasons for their actions. The unsavoury attack from CPM and BJP has prompted IUML to lie low. The accusations that IUML has emerged as the strongest political outfit, even capable of deciding who should be the CM candidate of Congress, has literally forced IUML and its mascot PK Kunhalikutty to keep away from the frontline political blitzkrieg. Being aware of the impact the anti-IUML campaign by BJP and CPM could have on the Congress, IUML has chosen to be the shadow of Congress outside Malabar, for the time being. But the party did not take this tactical decision by giving up anything. It wanted to contest in 30 seats, but reached an agreement with 27 seats. The party that has presence in Malappuram and Kozhikode had contested in 24 seats in the previous assembly elections, winning 18 seats. “They are concerned about the campaigns by political opponents and its possible impact on Congress, outside Malabar. They know Congress shouldn’t come under a shadow. But once back in power, I think they will start dictating terms as ever,” said political commentator Joseph C Mathew about IUML leaders keeping a low profile this time. Allegations of Love Jihad and interpretations of IUML’s growing presence in UDF prompted Kunhalikutty and his men to call on Church leaders, one by one. It is learnt that church heads were apprised about the ‘hollowness’ of the anti-IUML campaigns. It assured that it would fight religious radicalism. Kunhalikutty’s repeated statements that IUML will not stake claim for deputy CM attests the low-key strategy of the party. Meanwhile, CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran who made abortive attempts to stonewall the entry of KC(M) to LDF, appears to be making repeated attempts to irritate Nair Service Society (NSS), which is unhappy with the government women-entry stand at Sabarimala. Rajendran’s attempt to irritate NSS over its stand on Sabarimala appears to be based on twin objectives. First, to deflect NSS ire on KC(M) candidates and smoothen CPI’s ‘true communist’ image. CPI had to concede Kanjirappally and Changanassery seats to KC(M) despite CPI’s claim. It is argued that resentment of NSS against Left would be more detrimental to KC(M) in central Travancore than any other party. KC(M), which is now part of LDF, will contest in 12 seats. “Kanam may be trying to rupture Nair community support that KC(M) used to enjoy. More than that, he would have felt CPM’s refusal to stick to its stand on Sabarimala women-entry issue as an opportunity to preen the real Communist image once again. Kanam knows that a large chunk of CPM men would find merit in what he says on Sabarimala,” said political observer NM Pearson. CPI is contesting in 25 seats this time, which is two less than last time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/hidden-agenda-a-low-key-league-up-beat-cpi/articleshow/81788626.cms||B S Anilkumar
---||India||After US, India is desis’ top pick for B-schools||Even as the US is the preferred destination for Indian management aspirants, desi students are more likely to consider a business school closer home (21%) due to the pandemic than consider online learning (5%). The UK, with its one-year management programme, is a lesser favourite at number three with candidates unsure of whether they would have to complete the entire programme online if the pandemic continues. Interestingly, the top post-MBA career goal for Indians is to work for a company where they can travel internationally. Interest in graduate management education programmes in 2021 continued to grow —a trend that coincided with waning concerns about the impact of Covid, according to a report published on Wednesday by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC). The survey showed 76% Indian respondents do not plan to change their original plans due to the pandemic. Globally, a third of international MBA aspirants (73%) are not likely to change their plans in favour of an alternative such as online learning or a business school closer home than those keen on a business master’s (68%). Only one in eight (13%) candidates who wish to fly out for an MBA is willing to consider online learning compared with one in three (30%) domestic candidates. Specifically, 41% of international candidates who plan to pursue a business master’s programme report they are very or extremely concerned about the impact of Covid-19 compared with 27% domestic candidates. Domestic candidates report more willingness to consider alternatives such as staying closer to home or adopting online learning. Domestic candidates for MBA (28%) and business master’s (30%) programmes indicated they are more willing to consider a business school closer home to pursue their degree in 2021. “In sum, the pandemic is compelling some candidates to consider alternatives; however, they are not giving up on their career aspirations for pursuing GME in 2021,” noted the GMAC report. “As vaccines become increasingly available, prospective students around the world are seeing light at the end of the tunnel regarding the global pandemic,” said Sangeet Chowfla, president and CEO of GMAC. “It is especially encouraging to find female candidates seeking advanced business degrees for career advantages despite the unique challenges and barriers they face due to Covid-19.” The 2021 report analyses the data collected between July and December 2020 from a total of 2,515 (330 from India) individuals worldwide planning to pursue GME. The council’s 2021 Prospective Students Survey Report found the proportion of respondents reporting they are extremely or very concerned about Covid-19 declined from 41% to 33% over the survey period. Full-time MBA remains the most popular programme as 42% candidates reported it as their preferred option. The full-time one-year MBA is the preferred programme for candidates planning to study in Canada (26%), France (27%), Spain (38%), and the UK (28%). A full-time two-year MBA, though, is the preferred programme for candidates planning to study in the US (33%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-us-india-is-desis-top-pick-for-b-schools/articleshow/81800907.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Pune||Pune: Fear of lockdown sparks scramble for essentials||PUNE: Retailers said citizens were crowding grocery shops to stock up on essential items, such as rice, flour and pulses, following apprehensions of a lockdown because of the recent spike in Covid-19 cases. The retailers said they had witnessed such a rush when lockdown was imposed last year. Sachin Nivangune, president of the Pune District Retail Traders’ Association, said, “Ever since words started going around about a lockdown, the retailers are buying more stock of essentials and other products of use from wholesalers, fearing that a repeat of last year should not occur. People are also buying more than usual amounts of grocery items, so that they do not fall short of anything in the coming days.” Nivangune said only grocery products and essentials were being bought in higher quantities. “Other businesses, like clothes, cutlery and takeaway orders in restaurants, have been affected adversely during the past few days with a significant drop in sales. This is because most people are mostly spending on essential products,” he said. Nivangune said all traders have unanimously opposed any lockdown in Maharashtra, adding that people were willing to cooperate with the government and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Bharatlal Unecha, owner of a supermarket in Gokhalenagar said, “Since the past two to three days, the customers have preponed their monthly shopping. Mamy people stocked up groceries for April by the end of March, instead of the usual period of first 10 days of a month.” Another retailer in Model Colony said though the rush at grocery stores was not like last year when a lockdown had been announced, grocery sales have recently picked up with customers buying more due to apprehensions of such curbs. Apprehensions about another lockdown have already sparked a scramble for the vaccine. Experts said such apprehensions were likely to affect the vaccination numbers if the lockdown measures came into force and would undermine the huge efforts that have gone into boosting the inoculation numbers over the past three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fear-of-lockdown-sparks-scramble-for-essentials/articleshow/81788699.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Ahmedabad||Elections in other states bring in moolah for Ahmedabad traders||AHMEDABAD: The upcoming elections in five Indian states including West Bengal have given good reason for some businessmen in Ahmedabad to party. From banners, gamchha, caps and flags, the city once known as the Manchester of India, is now rolling out campaign materials for various political parties in these different states. The yearly turnover for a clutch of businesses at Narol is about Rs 300 crore. A substantial part of this is for the election campaign material used in West Bengal state assembly elections this year. Abubhai Kucherawala, who runs a proprietary firm here for over three decades now, claimed that Ahmedabad is the biggest market for election campaigning materials. “From manufacturing and printing, a lot of the election campaigning material is made here. We have sent flags, caps, banners and gamchhas to political parties like Trinamool Congress, CPI (M) and the Congress,” he said. He further said that the raw material or fabric for manufacturing is sourced from Bhiwandi and Malegaon in Maharashtra and final processing takes place at the factories in Narol. Kuchrewala said that the demand for the campaigning material picked up two months ahead of elections when firm orders were placed by parties. Currently, most orders have been dispatched. Kalubhai Thakore, an employee at a Narol firm that manufactures election material, said this year his firm has prepared material using about 4-5 lakh meters of fabric. The company representatives reach out to political parties ahead of the elections. They present samples to the parties before dispatching them the final material within a week’s time of placing the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/elections-in-other-states-bring-in-moolah-for-ahmedabad-traders/articleshow/81788725.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Delhi||Pedestrians welcome change at Karol Bagh, motorists fret||New Delhi: A day after North Delhi Municipal Corporation announced to revive its pedestrianisation plan in Karol Bagh, the entry of vehicles was stopped on the stretch from the Metro station till DB Gupta Road on Thursday. With civic defence volunteers deployed at all intersections to enforce the decision, pedestrians had a good time. “Walking on this stretch has become easier and even benches have been cleared. The stretch isn’t that big that people can’t walk,” said Anvesha Gupta, a resident of Mayur Vihar who came for shopping after three months. However, she mentioned that finding a parking space was a big challenge. During a visit to the area in the afternoon, TOI found e-rickshaws and vehicles parked haphazardly even in front of barricades. In designated parking lots such as the facility on Arya Samaj Road, vehicles were parked in multiple lanes and beyond permissible space, while attendants charged higher than the fixed rates. The decision also led to traffic jams on connecting roads. Local traders, who are against the revival, clarified the project wasn’t feasible unless a multi-level parking lot was constructed or sufficient surface parking space was provided. “Due to the pandemic, people had stopped coming to markets using public transport, which is why we allowed a ‘drop and go’ facility on Ajmal Khan Road. Now when the cases are surging again, the decision will lead to losses,” said Murli Mani, president of Beopar Mandal Karol Bagh. “We are not against the project but the authorities need to make sufficient arrangements and wait for the right time.” The association has shared their apprehensions with the official team on the first day. A senior corporation official said the association had been provided enough off-road parking space at Bank Street and Shastri Nagar. “We have even suggested that they use Ajmal Khan Park and Pusa Road parking lots. People have to understand that the step will only increase footfall in the area,” said the official. The rebidding process of the proposed multi-level parking projects is not over, he added. Traders have also written to MP Meenakshi Lekhi for postponing the plan till tendering of multi-level parking at Shastri Park and Pyarelal Road is done. “How could a customer buying jewellery will be comfortable walking on the road or taking a common e-rickshaw?” said Rakesh Sharaf, general secretary of Karol Bagh Jewellers Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pedestrians-welcome-change-at-karol-bagh-motorists-fret/articleshow/81862475.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Mumbai||Deaths in Maharashtra rise, but still 5 times fewer than Sept peak||Mumbai: On Wednesday, 39,544 Covid cases were added in the state, the second highest daily tally so far, taking the total caseload to 28.12 lakh. It is nearly the same as Germany, which is the 10th worst affected country with 28.16 lakh cases. Worryingly, Maharashtra reported 227 deaths, a significant jump from 139 fatalities a day before. Wednesday’s toll is the highest in 146 days, since November 5 (256). In absolute numbers, monthly fatalities are on the rise, but the case fatality rate is dipping. In March, the state added 2,495 deaths and reported a CFR of 0.4%, as against 1,072 deaths in February and a CFR of 0.8%. At its peak in September, the state’s fatality rate was 2.1% with 12,024 deaths. Though the state breached the September high in cases in March, deaths were five times fewer. Mumbai ended March with 200 deaths, higher than February’s toll of 127 but less than January’s 236. The city had reported the highest deaths in June last year (3,277). Members of the state task force said Maharashtra could continue to see the surge through April. “We saw in 2020 that cases surge for a few months before declining. Our silver lining so far has been the low fatality rate, both for Mumbai and Maharashtra. But we need to be mindful of rising deaths in absolute numbers,” said intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the Covid task force. Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death committee, said fatalities continue to be most common among the elderly and those with comorbidities, but there is a small percentage of young people who come to hospital late and succumb within 7-8 days. “The key here is to stay watchful even if one doesn’t have major symptoms so that any deterioration is treated promptly,” he said. The demand for private hospital beds kept growing in the city. A few major hospitals said they have a long waiting list of patients who want to be upgraded or shifted from smaller hospitals or government facilities. Dr Om Srivastava said it was stretching up to 80-90 in certain hospitals. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said there are enough beds in public hospitals, but the demand is for private beds. Dr Gautam Bhansali said over 100 private beds were added on Wednesday to push the private capacity to nearly 4,800. At the state level, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (9,941) added the highest cases while the Nagpur region recorded its maximum deaths (54). Palghar district’s tally crossed the 50,000 mark on Wednesday, even as it lifted the ban on weddings after April 15. Weddings can take place with 50 guests and police permission.

---||Kolkata||Kol sweats on hottest March day in 7 years||Kolkata: On a scorching Wednesday, Kolkata recorded the highest maximum temperature of the year so far — 39.3°C, five notches above the normal mark. It was also the warmest March day in seven years and there will be little respite from the stifling heat and humidity till at least early next week, said the Met office. The mercury, however, is set to drop a couple of degrees during the weekend as moisture flows in from the Bay of Bengal. Although, that won’t be enough to trigger showers. It is the scorching westerly wind that has resulted in this warm spell, according to Regional Meteorological Centre director G K Das. “We have rarely seen westerly winds flowing in so consistently in March. Moisture incursion from the sea, too, has been negligible, which is unusual. This has led to a dry period. Heat has been building up but there has been no nor’wester due to the negligible moisture incursion,” said Das. On March 30, 2014, Kolkata had recorded a maximum temperature of 39.9°C. Ever since, the mercury has never crossed 39°C in March. “The average maximum temperature in Kolkata in March is around 33°C. This time, it has been substantially higher,” said Das. However, with the westerly set to weaken from Friday, there will be moisture incursion that may lower the heat. “The maximum temperature may settle at 36°C-37°C on Thursday,” Das said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-sweats-on-hottest-march-day-in-7-years/articleshow/81788705.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

He was 54. Mahipal died at 1 am. He suffered serious head injuries and a fracture on his left leg and has been in ICU after he was shifted to a hospital on March 27 night following the accident. The family donated his organs to Jeevandan. Education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy and Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar paid homage to the ASI at his house and consoled his family members. He was given state funerral with police honours. Cab driver Mohammed Aslam was arrested and booked under IPC section of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Abetment charge was slapped against cab company Uber also. On that fateful night, when Cyberabad traffic police were conducting a drunken drive enforcement, Srujan, a resident of Bachupally, tried to escape from a checkpoint in Nizampet upon seeing a police barricade since he was in an inebriated condition. While reversing his car, Srujan first hit a tree and later hit another car. He again tried to escape by passing through the zig-zag barricades set up on the road, but ended up hitting two others, including a constable. Srujan and his friend Pavan were both booked under the IPC section of attempt to murder. Mahipal, who was the night round officer, went to Nizampet to enquire into the accident and was inspecting Srujan’s SUV when Aslam crashed his cab at high speed into the ASI and fled from the spot by abandoning his vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/asi-hit-by-cab-driver-dies-family-donates-his-organs/articleshow/81791958.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Parents shun personal space, juggle between home chores, online classes||JAIPUR: When Raghav Popli got his two-and-half-year-old daughter enrolled in a playschool in the first week of March last year, he did not know that would be the last day for her to be in-person on the premises. Before the session would start, schools were closed following the pandemic. More than a year has passed and there is no indication when she would return to the school. While narrating the details of what he and his home-maker wife have gone through, he almost seemed depleted. “If the higher class school boys can go to school, why not the kids. Shanayna (his daughter) is too small to attend any online classes. We as parents cannot give the grooming the school environment and the teachers provide. Despite our best efforts, I can say she has lost a crucial year in her life when mental development happens at a faster clip,” said Raghav. The fact that he has another two-year old daughter is adding to the stress of managing both kids 24x7. Parents having a joint-family support system are not spared either. While some largely managed to keep pace with the kid’s online classes, the pandemic has upended their lives. “My work has also suffered as I cannot leave them unattended to. I have lost some creative personal space as the priority shifted to my kid. But the bigger impact has been on the kids becoming indisciplined. As they spend most of the time at home, their routine has gone haywire. Second, they are not as forthcoming socially as they used to be. And thirdly, it's really hard on working parents," said Surbhi Jain, an interior designer, whose son is Prep. It’s been tough times for working parents in the nuclear family set up. Instances of one of the parents quitting his or her job for being with the kids is not rare, while some have just managed to live through the stressful phase. Dr Eshita Pandey, whose daughter was in Prep, said, "Yes, it was very stressful. I used to make my one-and-half-year-old sleep so that Nitya (her daughter) can attend the online classes. Initially, I would even take her to my clinic where she would attend the classes." While she navigated the juggling between her clinic and kids, Dr Pandey is worried of the fact that children are becoming cranky. “They have stopped listening to parents. Many of my friends say they have also noticed the same behavioural pattern in their children due to staying at home for a prolonged period. They listen to teachers, not parents.” However, she said once they get back to the school routine, these problems will go away and discipline will come back to their life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/parents-shun-personal-space-juggle-between-home-chores-online-classes/articleshow/81791979.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala assembly elections 2021: ‘Independents’ in fray have a point to prove||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: From crorepatis, homeless and unemployed people, to farmers, salesmen, auto drivers and social workers — the motley crowd of independent candidates contesting this assembly elections have nothing in common. While some are in the fray merely to exercise their rights, it is moral outrage that pushed a few others to throw their hat in the ring. Bhagyavathi, who takes on Pinarayi Vijayan in Dharmadom as an independent candidate, has just a gram worth gold pendent (thali) in her possession. A 400 sq ft house and land measuring 3.5 cents are her other notable assets in addition to a savings of Rs.55,000. Senior Congress leader Oommen Chandy who lords over Puthupally with his unbreakable winning streak has probably one of the richest independent candidates as his co-contestant. George Joseph, a farmer by profession and who was also into maritime service, has assets worth around Rs.2 crore. He is serious about his candidature against Chandy. “Nobody talks about elderly people. I am a supporter of ‘one India, one pension’. Politics has become a dirty pool of corruption and so I decided to fight as an independent candidate,'” said Joseph, who is busy attending meetings as part of his campaign. Nemom, where the leading fronts are keen on making strong statements, also has seven independent candidates in the fray. These include a daily wagers, an auto driver, a pensioner and a man with the patent for Aranmula mirror. “My family moved from Pathanamthitta to Thiruvananthapuram around 70 years ago. I have my right to contest and I am using it,” says T Balachandran, one of the independent candidates at Nemom. He said he holds a patent in Aranmula mirror making which is his profession. He had also contested as an independent candidate in the recently-concluded local body elections. Mohanan D, a street vendor, had also contested in local body polls and he has an emotional reason to contest in the assembly election. “I filed my nomination as an independent candidate in civic body polls. Later, a party decided to support me but they withdrew their support. I felt humiliated and hence decided to contest in assembly polls,” he said. Ebinu S, an independent candidate from Nedumangadu constituency, chose to turn up atop a horse for submitting nominations and he became an instant target for photographers. A salesman by profession, Ebinu had also contested in the local body polls in 2020. As for namesakes, the source of income is mostly nil and some of them don’t belong to the constituency where they contest. Raju Antony who is contesting as an ‘independent’ from Thiruvananthapuram constituency, which has Antony Raju as LDF candidate, resides in Changanaserry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/independents-in-fray-have-a-point-to-prove/articleshow/81788838.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Sources said that the paediatric department of SSG Hospital has started getting six to eight paediatric cases a day in the last couple of days. In most of these cases, samples of such paediatric patients tested positive of Covid-19 in RT-PCR tests.  Of these cases, some of them had severe pneumonia while in one or two cases, infants born just fortnight ago have developed Covid-19 infection. “Everybody including those who were critically have been saved,” said Dr Minoo Patel, advisor to officer on special duty at SSG Hospital. “The paediatric department had submitted a proposal to set up an emergency room, a kind of enclosure, of eight beds with oxygen points ready at the ground floor with provision of ventilators so that any such emergency can be handled. This has been set up by the department,” he said. Currently, there are three paediatric patients who are hospitalized at SSG. They have been kept in a separate enclosure in Covid-19 building. “We are keeping the emergency room reserved so that Covid-19 paediatric patients who really require critical care can be admitted there,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/covid-gripping-infants-kids-emergency-room-set-up-at-ssg/articleshow/81786107.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: The silent, ordinary cop will restore the force’s legitimacy||By: Jai Jeet Singh Mumbai police is under scrutiny once again. There has been a breach of trust, hard to mend. The public’s disbelief and their fractured sense of faith in the system is evident. The force seems to be facing a legitimacy deficit, seemingly difficult to address. This makes it imperative to construct a broader context which brings to its centre the ordinary, unassuming, persevering cop. Over time, people’s perception of the policeman has been defined by images of the criminal cop, flamboyant cop and super cop. Brashness and daredevilry on one end, superhuman attributes on the other, have created unreal binaries. Fortunately, the force operates through a more stable framework. It is sustained by steady, silent, invisible workers, operating from many levels of a system. They neither break rules to deliver quick results, nor indulge in attention-grabbing tactics. They do not necessarily pull off landmark achievements either. These are men and women who steadily and consistently work to keep a vast, complex city operating through its class and communal divides, its financial swings, its blue and white collared syndicates. Among these are foot soldiers who don’t just perform everyday duties but painstakingly contribute to an organizational culture bequeathed to them by a celebrated lineage. They learn of the back alleys of slums, red light areas and betting dens with the passion of a researcher. They understand the new machinations of white collar criminals. They tap the cultural and emotional nuances of the common man to steer him through communally sensitive times. They build personal connections, information networks and insights. They do not bother about the eight-hour duty rule when they are tracking leads that disappoint repeatedly before yielding results. Their driving force is neither money nor fame, but a reiteration of a work ethos they take pride in. There are also officers, from the IPS and state cadre, who spearhead operations, provide leadership and take difficult decisions. The more senior among them spend countless hours creating logistical support for their men, planning for their housing and health, uniforms and weapons. They also provide assessments and course corrections. They are rarely seen taking press conferences or being cited as saviours. Yet, they continue to provide a centrifugal force to the department, oiling its cogs and enabling its smooth functioning. While the media focuses on aberrations in the system, we need to remember that it is these ordinary cops who form its backbone. They are human and fallible. However, their allegiance to organizational structure and their willingness to subordinate desire for personal glory to the requirements of the system ensures that they do not stray. It is their unobtrusive presence which will salvage the trust. For it is they who keep the core functioning consistently. It is the ordinary cop who will restore legitimacy by tiding over this crisis and the next, from their positions of anonymity which afford no personal accolades.

---||Kochi||Kerala assembly elections: M Swaraj has ‘faith’ in development, K Babu and BJP in Sabarimala||KOCHI: As the convoy of MLA M Swaraj moves in Kumbalam panchayat, a stronghold OF LDF, it stops for the candidate to say a few words. A middle-aged man approaches the decorated vehicle and says, “This is ward number 10. Please come here occasionally and be seen here.” Swaraj just turns away and the convoy moves on. A bike rally moves ahead announcing his arrival as it traverses through the narrow lanes of the panchayat. Absent MLA is a tagline used by his opponents during campaign. “He was never there for the people. If anybody wanted to meet him, they must go to party office from where the complaints were forwarded,” says his opponent and UDF candidate K Babu. Though Babu got off to a shaky start with opposition from his own party workers over old corruption charges, he has not given up hope. “This is my constituency; my home and I am always there for the people. Vigilance director Jacob Thomas and LDF government framed me. When police submitted in court that they found no evidence of foul play, what more is there to be said,” he asks. The demographic structure of this constituency is visible during poll campaigns. UDF and BJP are united in their charges against Swaraj in the municipality where faith is a big matter. UDF is using his statement from last year, on Ayyappan having married Malikapurathamma and thus women can enter Sabarimala, in its campaign. “I am a religious person and if going to temples and believing in God makes me a fundamentalist, then I am one. My day starts with a visit to the nearest temple and my campaign started with my nomination papers being kept before Poornathrayeesa. Who will protect faith in this country? LDF or BJP? UDF will bring a law to protect faith,” he says. Swaraj feels that he doesn’t need this issue. “Development and welfare are the main topics of discussion this election and it is happening here. We proposed development activities worth Rs 2,600 crore and brought the first ayurveda research centre here, Kerala’s first unmanned electricity sub-station for Rs 26 cr and a new career development centre. Kundannoor flyover is operational and we are a toll-free town,” he says. A project that is progressing slowly is Anthakarathodu waterway. “It will be ready in a couple of months. Project has funding from KIIFB worth Rs 12 crore. Valanthakad Bridge work is almost done,” he adds. He denies there is an anti-incumbency factor. “My opponents are raising non-issues, but we will talk only about development. If you are hinting at ‘faith’, then I would say that UDF and BJP are looking to cash in on votes using it. I would like to point out that the largest fund allocation to Sabarimala happened under LDF regime. We are not against faith. Tripunithura is full of places of worship. I have proposed a pilgrim tourism circuit which has been cleared by the government. It involves development of facilities in some temples, churches and mosques here,” he says. K Babu counters saying that most of the main projects which changed the phase of Tripunithura were brought during his term. “He claims development worth Rs 2600 crore, but it is on paper. Tripunithura bypass, taluk hospital, RTO, Kochi Metro were all from back then. The Choondi drinking water project was proposed by me in my term,” he says. BJP’s K S Radhakrishnan says UDF and LDF are worried about voters who are upset over Sabarimala issue. He is confident of a win. “Both fronts can make claims, but they are involved in corruption, backdoor appointments and are desperately seeking the votes in the name of faith. I have visited 59 colonies in the constituency, most of which belong to SC, ST and backward communities. There are no facilities in most places. After my interaction with these people over the past several days, I am confident of getting 60,000 votes,” he says. “The government said that there are 1,200 cases against me, but they have submitted around 258 cases in the high court. I am thankful to Pinarayi for not foisting charges of murder and rape against me,” he adds. Ayyappa Seva Samajam, which has its origins in Tripunithura, against whose members cases were filed has asked people to vote for those who support faith. It is this vote bank that UDF and BJP are banking on. While the fight is strongly between UDF and LDF, BJP could play spoilsport here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/swaraj-has-faith-in-development-babu-and-bjp-in-sabarimala/articleshow/81788765.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Pune||50% drop in elective surgeries across Pune hospitals in March||PUNE: The city hospitals have recorded a 50% drop in non-emergency elective surgeries after a fresh spike in Covid cases in March and experts fear large-scale disruption in medical services, including routine immunisations, and maternal and child health services, if there is another round of lockdown. Medical expert Ketan Apte, head of Sahyadri hospital, Deccan branch, said, “The non-Covid healthcare services had picked up to pre-Covid levels following the lull in Covid cases in Pune. However, they started declining again from mid-March in the wake of the rising cases. This will certainly reduce further if lockdown is announced.” Elective surgeries often bear the biggest setback during the lockdown. “The elective surgical work may go down to almost zero since most patients will prefer doing their non-emergency surgeries after lockdown (if any),” Apte said, underlining the lockdown’s adverse financial impact on the healthcare sector as non-Covid work virtually comes to a standstill. “Most elective surgeries will not be catered to during the lockdown. Even today, elective surgeries are hardly 20-30% of what we used to do prior to Covid,” said Bomi Bhote, chief executive officer (CEO), Ruby Hall Clinic. Bhote said, “Private hospitals are already crumbling under different impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. The non-Covid occupancy has gone very low, municipal corporations are not making timely payments to private hospitals for treating Covid patients and now 80% of the hospital beds have been taken over by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). If another lockdown gets announced, hospitals will have to bear the massive brunt.” Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati hospital, said, “Private hospitals in Pune had almost reached 75% of non-Covid medical services between mid-September 2020 and February 2021. But the rising Covid cases have hit them hard again. There has been a drop of 50% in elective surgeries/non-Covid medical work in March alone. The situation will go from bad to worse if lockdown is announced.” Emergency medical services will continue uninterrupted even if the lockdown gets announced. “But it will disrupt all other non-Covid medical services, including routine immunisation work of newborns and paediatric age group. This will potentially impact children’s health in the long run,” said Oswal, also a paediatrician. The child immunisation programme was the worst-hit during the lockdown last year. It has slowly started getting back to normal. Among other concerns, hospitals may face massive absenteeism or even job desertion if lockdown becomes a reality. “Some staffers are likely to shun jobs in hospitals and join Covid care centres as the salary offered is 50% higher for the nursing and doctor staff on contract. This may make staff-retention an issue,” Oswal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/50-drop-in-elective-surgeries-across-city-hospitals-in-march/articleshow/81788775.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The reason is, officials of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) are gearing up to facelift nearly 25-kilometres length of storm-water drain system ahead of the onset of monsoon. For this, the civic body has almost completed the tender process and spending of nearly Rs 8 crore to Rs 10 crore for facelift of decades-old SWD system.

---||Hyderabad||HC to Telangana: Is fee rule followed in schools?||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday wondered how many schools have been derecognised till now for violating the government’s directive to collect only tuition fee and not any other fees from students during the pandemic. The judges said officials would not be spared for their lackadaisical attitude to rein in private schools fleecing the parents. “Tell us what have the inquiry teams constituted by you done to ensure that every school implements the GO. What action have you taken against errant schools? How many of them have been derecognised so far,” asked a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy. The judges directed the school education authorities to inform the court by April 23 on the action taken against schools and also sought a counter from the government. The judges were hearing a batch of pleas filed by parents and also PILs questioning the government’s inability to come to the rescue of parents. The government issued GO No. 46 on April 21, 2020, asking the private schools to confine themselves to collecting tuition fee component of the school fee in view of the pandemic. Appearing for more than 200 aggrieved parents of St Andrews High School (Marredpally and Bowenpally branches) in Secunderabad, senior counsel L Ravi Chander told the court that the school did not reduce the school fee despite the government’s fiat. “Instead, it started calling the whole of the collected fee as tuition fee,” he said. State’s special counsel A Sanjeev Kumar said the government has also received complaints against the school. “They are collecting caution deposits from students over and above the school fee. They are saying that this money would be refunded at the time of the student leaving the school. We issued a notice to the school. We also issued notices to several such schools,” he said. The school’s counsel said that a previous bench had made an interim arrangement for the parents to pay 50% of fee arrears pending up to January 5, 2021, to enable their students to sit for examinations. The parents’ counsel said the school management, however, withheld the results of the students having fee dues even after clearing the full arrears. The judges then directed the parents and the school to ensure that those who did not pay 50% dues to hand over the same to the school counsel in the court. The school will then declare the results within one day upon receipt of such a fee, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-to-t-is-fee-rule-followed-in-schools/articleshow/81795127.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Most of the parents of children aged between six and 10 years of age group are complaining of excessive use of smart phones and electronic gadgets usually for online games and social media. Many parents have even reported behavioral changes in the children. Dipti Tiwari, mother of an eight-year-old in Jaipur, said her son had become addicted to phones and laptops. “It’s all about games and watching videos online for my son now-a-days. We have tried many times to engage him in other activities, but he gets irritated. As the number of cases are rising, it is not safe to let him go outside to meet his friends. At home, there is not much for a child to do other than playing online games,” said Tiwari. If parents try to divert their children’s mind in other activities, they face a hard reaction, anger bursts and mood swings. MD in the psychiatrist centre at SMS Medical College, Chitra Singh, said she is receiving a case almost every day of parents in distress about their children being addicted to gadgets and online gaming. “Recently, I received a case in which an eight-year-old boy, who has been constantly playing violent online games for the last one year, has now become paranoid and having panic attacks. His parents have hidden all the knives of the household as he has expressed that he might harm himself or his parents. I have to counsel him and have given him some medication,” said Singh. She said mood swings, disobedience, anger burst, talking back to parents are some symptoms of online addiction and constant use of gadgets children from six to ten years are facing. Deepika Behl, a mother of seven-year-old, said due to constant use of phones, her daughter’s eyesight has now become weak. “She watches videos online and makes social media reel videos. Her eyesight has become weak and irritation level has increased. Even the power of my 14-year-old son has increased. We can’t keep on watching the children all the time due to our other responsibilities. I really hope schools reopen soon,” said Behl. Senior professor at department of psychiatry at SMS Hospital, Sanjay Jain, said it is the routine after 2 pm that has been disrupted due to school closure. “Till 2 pm, most students have online classes after that kids become idle. Without any alternate option, they focus more on online gaming. Moreover, many children don’t want to socialise as that needs coordination with people. In the digital world, they are their own boss. Hence, cases of such children have increased,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/children-below-10-yrs-addicted-to-online-games-in-absence-of-classes/articleshow/81792020.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat added most CNG stations in India||AHMEDABAD: Continuing its thrust on the usage of clean fuel, Gujarat added the highest number of compressed natural gas (CNG) stations in India during the April-January period in 2020-21. In fact, the state accounted for 20% of the new CNG stations developed in the country during the period. The number of CNG stations in Gujarat increased by 102 to 738 by the end of January 2021 as compared to 636 CNG stations on April 1, 2020. The information was released by the rating agency Care Ratings, which cited the data from Petroleum and Planning Analysis Cell, the Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas. Gujarat figures include CNG stations in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu. The total number of CNG stations across the country increased by 506 to 2,713 as on January. The number was 2,207 at the beginning of the fiscal 2021. Gujarat was followed by Uttar Pradesh (89 new refuelling stations), Maharashtra (70), Odisha (47), Haryana (40), and Rajasthan (34). Gujarat is covered 100% under the city gas distribution network with the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) awarding natural gas retailing licences to all the geographical areas in the state. As a result, more and more CNG stations are being set up in the state, said an industry source. The government’s push for cleaner fuel along with a deeper penetration of natural gas have led to the establishment of more CNG stations in the state, added industry players. City gas distribution players estimate that the number of new CNG stations in Gujarat could be about 150 by the end of the 2020-21 fiscal. “CNG is 60% cheaper than petrol and 45% cheaper than diesel,” Care Ratings said. “Given the volatility in petrol-diesel prices, more vehicle users are making a shift to CNG-powered vehicles and it is fast gaining prominence as a preferred fuel especially in the case of public transportation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-added-most-cng-stations-in-india/articleshow/81789267.cms||Kalpesh Damor

In fact, the TRS wrested the sitting seats of Congress in the bypolls to Palair, Narayankhed and Huzurnagar Assembly constituencies, and retained Medak and Warangal Lok Sabha seats vacated by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and the then deputy chief minister Kadiyam Srihari, after Telangana was formed in 2014. Now, the TRS is going all out to win yet another bypoll in Nagarjuna Sagar. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has fielded Nomula Bhagat, son of sitting MLA Nomula Narsimhaiah, whose died in December 2020. The talk in the political circles is that sympathy factor has failed to work in the bypolls held to various constituencies after the formation of Telangana. For example, the Congress had fielded P Sanjeeva Reddy from Narayankhed constituency in 2016 bypoll which was necessitated due to the death of his father and sitting MLA P Kishta Reddy, but people voted TRS candidate M Bhupal Reddy to victory. In Palair bypoll in 2016 too, the voters gave their mandate to Tummala Nageswara Rao of TRS and not to Sucharitha Reddy, widow of sitting MLA R Venkat Reddy, whose death necessitated the bypoll. The TRS won both Naraynkhed and Palair seats with a huge majority. Though sympathy was not a factor in the Huzurnagar bypoll in October 2019, the TRS wrested this seat too from the Congress by defeating N Padmavathi Reddy, wife of TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy. TRS won this seat with over 40,000 majority. Interestingly, the sympathy factor failed to work as recently as November 2020 in Dubbak wherein TRS had fielded Solipeta Sujatha, widow of Solipeta Ramalinga Reddy. TRS lost the seat to BJP. However, the margin of victory was thin with Raghunandan Rao of BJP winning by a little over 1,000 votes. Political analysts said the Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll is a different ball game altogether as CM KCR’s selection of Nomula Bhagat is more out of cast equation than the sympathy factor. Former MLC and political analyst prof K Nageshwar said: “I don’t think KCR is banking on the sympathy factor. He is pinning hopes on social engineering as Yadavs constitute a major chunk of voters in the constituency. This is precisely the reason for Nomula Bhagat being fielded as he belongs to the Yadav community. It is also aimed at frustrating the BJP which was waiting to field a BC candidate if the TRS finalised a Reddy candidate,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sympathy-no-more-a-factor-in-t-byelections/articleshow/81792034.cms||Roushan Ali

Sameer Paul, 56, a passport agent from Habra in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, was arrested by the Cyberabad police in the third week of March. So far, police have arrested four Bangladeshis — Nitai Das, Mohammed Rana Mia, Mohammed Hasibur Rehman, Parimal Bain — and four others, including Shahnaj Pail, a businessman from West Bengal, his friend, Sadham Hussain, a flight ticketing agent from Mumbai, Mateen Ahmed Mirza, a MeeSeva centre worker from Bodhan, SI P Mallesh Rao and ASI B Anil Kumar of Bodhan Special Branch police, for the passport fraud. After their arrest, Cyberabad police team launched a manhunt for Sameer Paul, who worked as the middleman between Bangladeshis who wanted Indian passports and Bodhan based Bangladeshi, Parimal Bain, who helped them in getting the passports. Sameer reportedly confessed to have played a key role in the fraud, police said. According to RGI Airport police, Sameer, who works as a car driver-cum-passport agent at Habra, said that Das, Rehman and Rana Mia had approached him through mediators after crossing the border in the early part of 2020 seeking help in obtaining Indian passports. Sameer in turn contacted Parimal Bain, who was in Bodhan and after obtaining Aadhar cards with fake names and West Bengal addresses for the three Bangladeshis, sent them to Bodhan. “The trio spent a few months in Bodhan, including the period of lockdown, and after the change of address in Aadhar cards to the Bodhan one, they managed to obtain the Indian passports and returned to Bangladesh in July 2021 after handing them over to Samir for visa processing,” an investigator said. In January, 2021, Sameer had contacted the trio informing them that the visas were ready for Dubai. The trio crossed the border at Benapole and reached Bangaon. They met Sameer Paul on January 9 and he accommodated them at a hotel. On January 21, Sameer handed them over to Shahnaj Pail at Howrah and the latter took them to Hyderabad by flight. The trio stayed in a lodge at Secunderabad along with Shahnaj and on January 24, checked into a lodge at Shamshabad, where Shahnaj gave them passports with visiting visas and Aadhar cards. “Sameer’s son Manoj is the only absconding accused in the case. All the 72 passports obtained through fraudulent means by the gang have been cancelled and LOCs were issued against them,” RGI Airport police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/passport-fraud-key-accused-arrested-bangladeshis-crossed-border-twice-in-a-yr/articleshow/81792026.cms||Mahesh Buddi

He was chairing a review meeting in which Delhi water minister Satyendar Jain and Delhi Jal Board officials were also present. Kejriwal asked the officials concerned to come up with detailed plans on projects related to the Yamuna cleaning. Another review meeting has been scheduled for next week. A senior government official said that Kejriwal stressed upon completion of the projects before the scheduled timelines. “Four major drains are going into the river. The CM directed the officials to ensure that no untreated wastewater flows into the river,” the official added.

We should work towards expediting the Yamuna cleaning process, every sub-project should be completed within the stipulated time frame." DJB officials told the CM that various low-cost technological interventions are being done to expedite the work. They presented a detailed plan to clean four majors drains falling into the Yamuna—Najafgarh, supplementary, Shahdara and Barapullah drains. “Out of the four drains, the work on interception of two major drains i.e. supplementary and Shahdara is almost complete. The untreated water from the supplementary drain will be completely tapped and treated by December 2021. The untreated water from the Shahdara drain will be completely tapped in the next few months,” the officials claimed. “Work on the Najafgarh and Barapullah drains will be completed within the stipulated deadline,” they said.

The government’s decision will help 711 Class III and Class IV employees besides the 13 Class IV employees, who were appointed on compassionate grounds. The Telangana government has asked these employees to accept posting anywhere in the state. A delegation of these government employees met AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy at his Tadepalli camp office on Wednesday and apprised him of their plight. They also apprised him of the representations sent to the governments of the two Telugu states ever since they were sent to AP against their will. The employees told the CM that they had opted to stay with Telangana but were attached to the AP government during the distribution of employees. The chief minister immediately directed chief secretary Adityanath Das to prepare orders and take steps to send them back to Telangana after due consultation. Later in the night, the chief secretary issued a GO directing all heads of departments to obtain undertakings from the Class III and Class IV employees and send them back to Telangana.

Holidays and travel only resumed in some capacity from the end of 2020. The lack of travelling throughout most of 2020 also effected employment directly, with a family’s stay at a hotel being estimated to support between 50 to 75 jobs. The hospitality sector has not witnessed meaningful recovery, in terms of both jobs and revenues, said representatives. “There are no international flights, barely a few weddings in hotels and the same is the case with meetings, conventions and exhibitions. The larger entities made losses but somehow will survive. Many smaller entities would unfortunately close and that would mean addition to the unemployment levels. These informal workers at the bottom of the pyramid are almost never captured in surveys,” said Prashant Girbane, director-general of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/extreme-steps-will-hit-hospitality-sector/articleshow/81788877.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The graph of active cases is also going up with increase in daily new infections. The health department is conducting over 30,000 tests daily as the virus is spreading fast in several districts.

---||Kochi||Kerala assembly elections 2021: BJP emulates CPM in ‘background’ poll battle||KOCHI: These days, Kiran KK, Aviation Committee Convenor for BJP-Kerala uses helicopters to fly national leaders and State President K Surendran around Kerala making up to seven landings per day. So far 65 landings have been made and by the time the campaigning for the assembly election ends, it would have made a minimum of 100 landings. And on the ground, VIP movements via road and rail are also planned, monitored, and managed by dedicated teams working out of the party’s Central Election Committee Office at Thycaud, Thiruvananthapuram. While CPM is considered to be a party that meticulously plans the execution of poll campaigns in the state, BJP’s war room and its campaign system are as good or perhaps even better. “We have election committees set up right from the state level going down to the booth level. This was done six months before the elections,” said George Kurian, State General Secretary, BJP. “Then, we have 62 departments overall to manage the campaign. So, once we fix an event, we handover the schedule to them and they take care of the rest,” he added. BJP is using experienced hands in each department. For instance, Kiran has been managing the VIP movement in the air since the 2016 elections and for MV Renjith, in-charge of the car fleet, it is the third time. While the roadshows of VIPs and candidates and the related chopper and vehicular movements are what people normally notice, there is a very silent but efficient campaign mechanism of BJP running in the background. “At the booth level, there will be a committee of four or five people and they execute the election campaign at the grassroots level,” said KVS Haridas, BJP spokesperson and former editor of Janmabhoomi. “Every two years, nationwide the party runs workshops for new members as well as office-bearers. This time it happened just before the LSG elections,” he added. The moment the election was declared, Union Minister Pralhad Joshi was put in charge of campaigning in Kerala and Karnataka Deputy CM CN Ashwath Narayan was assigned to assist him. Once the campaign started, a bunch of high-profile national leaders flew in to attract the masses. On the night of March 23rd, office-bearers from all constituencies gathered for a meeting with the Union Home Minister Amit Shah, which ended at midnight. “Entire Sangh Pariwar organizations are with the party," Haridas said. "Yesterday, we had a retired professor working for Seva Bharati drop in [at Thrippunithura campaign office] to volunteer for house visits. Similarly, members of Tapasya Kala-Sahitya Vedi, Bharatiya Vichara Kendram, BMS, professional organizations like that of college teachers, RSS, VHP, and Hindu Aikya Vedi all take part in campaigning.” Further, there was Griha Sampark Abhiyan on the last two Sundays, and on the first day itself 75% of the constituency was covered, he said. All campaign offices have a call centre with three or four members reminding the workers and local leaders of the forthcoming meetings of the candidates in their neighbourhoods. Hence, by the time a candidate goes out to meet voters, the background work is already done – his profile distributed, and his request printed and handed over. All that remains is eye-contact with the voters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bjp-emulates-cpm-in-background-poll-battle/articleshow/81788862.cms||Shenoy Karun

Deputy commissioner of police Dr V M Rathod said, “Our team camped in Jharkhand for the last 45 days and established sources who tipped them about the accused. We were informed of the accused flying from Patna to Mumbai after which we alerted the local police and arrested them at Mumbai airport,” said Rathod.

There are currently over 300 FRHs in the Himalayan state, most of which date back to the colonial era when they were used for night halts by forest officials on duty. Officials said that the prices have been increased in view of the rise in the influx of tourists, who wish to have an experience of staying in the FRHs that are situated in picturesque locations. “This hike in price should ideally happen every three years but in our state, it is happening after a decade. From April, a new rate list for staying in the FRHs — with a price hike of at least 20% — will be issued,” said Anand Bardhan, principal secretary, Uttarakhand forest department. Rajiv Bhartari, head of forest force, Uttarakhand, also confirmed the move. “The idea is to rationalise the prices so that it creates a win-win situation for both the forest department as well as the tourists visiting Uttarakhand.” The FRHs at Corbett Tiger Reserve are among the most-visited and sought-after FRHs. Also, the FRHs in Pithoragarh and Uttarkashi are popular among tourists who wish to enjoy views of snow-capped mountain ranges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/stay-in-british-era-forest-rest-houses-of-ukhand-to-get-costlier-by-over-20/articleshow/81785674.cms||Shivani Azad

Sachin Holkar, agriculture activist, said, “The fear of another round of lockdown has already started taking a toll on fruit rates in wholesale markets across the state. Grape growers are scared and worried about their harvest. Maximum growers are in desperation and want to sell their produce to prevent last year’s situation.” Jitendra Badwai, president, grape growers’ association, Junnar tehsil, said, “Fruit growers are already staring at huge losses as the prices of many summer fruits have collapsed. The prices of grapes, watermelon, muskmelon, papaya, among others, have dropped significantly in the wholesale market in the last few days.” Many agri-business owners echoed a similar sentiment. “There are many agri groups which are involved in this business. Another lockdown will wipe away jobs generated by them,” said Kaluram Thorat, who runs a jaggery business in Daund tehsil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/farmers-growers-dread-fresh-losses/articleshow/81788946.cms||---

The beds have been added in 33 private hospitals after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal reviewed the situation. Only 25% of the existing beds are currently occupied but the government has made advance arrangements because Delhi also receives patients from outside. Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and other big states are also reporting a surge in Covid cases. In reaction to a question, health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said that the decision on whether those coming from states with a heavy Covid caseload would require a Covid negative report to come to Delhi, was still being discussed. There is no clarity on whether the government is planning to make negative Covid report mandatory for entering Delhi. Currently, random Covid tests are being done at the airport, bus terminals and railway stations to test those coming from states reporting a surge in Covid cases. Jain said the ICU beds have been increased by 25% in 33 private hospitals. “CM Arvind Kejriwal ordered to increase Covid ICU beds,” he added. “In Delhi government hospitals, enough beds are vacant. Overall occupancy rate, inclusive of private and government hospitals, is 25%. It is a comfortable situation but, there were instances of shortage of beds in 2-3 hospitals, therefore, orders were issued yesterday to increase 230 ICU beds in 33 hospitals,” Jain said. Delhi had 1,705 Covid beds till March 30, which increased to 2,547 on Wednesday, while the number of Covid ICU beds increased from 608 to 838 in a day. Delhi government has also instructed private hospitals to update the list of extended ICUs and common beds on the data management portal. “Delhi reported 992 cases on Tuesday and the positivity rate stood at 2.7%. Delhi has set the target of conducting at least 80,000 tests daily,” said Jain. Kejriwal had on Tuesday stated that in view of the prevailing Covid situation, the number of normal and ICU beds reserved for Covid was being increased in a few hospitals. “This will improve bed availability. We are keeping a close watch and will take all steps necessary. There is nothing to worry about. But please follow all precautions,” he had tweeted. “For the past few days, the positivity rate is looming around 3% as Delhi as well as the entire country is witnessing a surge. In some states, the positivity rate has crossed 10%. Testing capacity, too, has been increased. More than 80,000 tests will be conducted daily. We are conducting genome tracing of up to 30 family and friends of those who have tested positive,” Jain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1072-more-beds-in-33-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/81792074.cms||AlokKNMishra

His family is running from pillar to the post for his body to be flown to India, but have failed in its efforts so far. Suresh Goswami, first cousin of the deceased, said his brother died of a severe heart attack. “As per information received from his friends, he died of heart attack while working and his medical report said the reason for his death was Covid. This is being done by the company to avoid sending the body home,” said Goswami. Jhunjhunu MP Narendra Kumar said that he had written to the Indian High Commission seeking help, but the latter refused to grant the body due to Covid fatality. “As per the rule, if anyone dies due to Covid, the body is not granted to the family in the native country. The authorities in Dubai are seeking permission from the family for cremation,” said Kumar. Singh was a labourer in a construction company based in Dubai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/family-waits-for-kins-body-from-dubai/articleshow/81792055.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Vehicle movement in Ranthambore poses a big threat to wildlife||JAIPUR: The accident between a leopard and a bike with three riders has highlighted the perennial issues of wildlife management in Ranthambore National Park (RNP). The jeep mafia that opposes complete ban on vehicles in the park, lack of monitoring the forest staff and political interference have snowballed into a bigger problem that has put the wildlife at risk. To resolve the issues once again brought to public light after the leopard-bike accident, chief wildlife warden Mohan Lal Meena is expected to visit RNP for inspection and discussions on Thursday. The forest department was to start a shuttle service to ferry devotees and tourists to the Ganesh temple inside RNP. The vehicle owners had sought road tax exemption for this from the state government. “The proposal, however, remains on paper in the absence of a political will,” said a green activist, who wished not to be identified. The forest department held a meeting with the district administration recently and put a ban on private vehicles for three days a week on the road leading to the temple inside the RNP. The jeep owners, who are currently ferrying devotees and tourists inside the park, are constantly opposing the move to the ban saying it would take away their livelihood. A source said, “As jeeps are allowed, the forest department also has to give entry to private vehicles of other villagers.” The forest staff required to keep a vigil on devotees and tourists coming to RNP is in acute shortage. Against a sanctioned strength of 123 posts of forest guards, there are currently just 70 personnel. A forest source said, “There is an acute shoratge of frontline staff for wildlife management. Preventing devotees from entering inside the big forest area remains a major challenge.” The road leading to the temple criss-crosses territories of at least five tigers, said forest sources. The road passes through the territories of tigress Arrowhead, her cubs Riddhi and Siddhi, tigress T-102 and her cubs and tiger T-86. Experts believe that if the issue is not resolved at the state level, it may create serious problems in wildlife management in future. A recent study titled ‘Challenges presented by pilgrimage sites and their impact on ecology of protected areas’ by a group of experts pointed out that 1.2 million pilgrims go to the Ganesh temple inside RNP every year. So many pilgrims are able to go deep into the tiger reserve by flouting norms due to easy availability of transport. DFO Ranthambore Mahendra Sharma said, “Efforts are on to regulate the movement of pilgrims in a controlled manner. We have already placed a three-day ban per week on private vehicles going to the temple. Deliberations are on to initiate the shuttle services soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vehicle-movement-in-rbore-poses-a-big-threat-to-wildlife/articleshow/81792052.cms||---

Kabeer, who is not in the fray this time, had learned it the hard way in 2001 when he lost by the narrowest margin in the state's electoral history — just three votes. Kabeer had tasted two back-to-back defeats in Kodungallur and Mattanchery in 1991 and 1996 and IUML had fielded him the third time at Eravipuram, which made the drubbing even more painful for him. “The counting day was a real cliffhanger with the leads of the two candidates remaining in double digits and swaying from one side to the other. Finally rival candidate A A Azeez of RSP was declared winner with a margin of 21 votes. “We were all crestfallen and since the margin was too small we approached the court for a recount. After the recount, the winning margin was reduced to just three votes which is the narrowest for any candidate in the state so far,” Kabeer added. “The message I learned from the incident is that every voter counts and we must put voter first. Democracy demands every candidate to earn the trust of voters. Though I lost the election by a whisker, as a believer I found solace in the thought that it would have destined by God to be like that and moved forward,” he said. Later Kabeer was elected to the assembly from Mankada in Malappuram district in 2011 and got re-elected in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/a-word-of-advice-every-single-vote-counts/articleshow/81790045.cms||K R Rajeev

---||Jaipur||Despite virus blues, FY21 GST and VAT collections surpass last year’s receipts||JAIPUR: Despite large-scale demand destruction due to Covid in 2020-21, the VAT and GST revenue collections during the year have surpassed those of the previous year riding on increased compliance and economic recovery. VAT and GST collections, which account for about 63% of the revenues of the state, reached Rs 38,122.66 crore in the 2020-21 against collections of Rs 37,796.24 crore in 2019-20, registering a growth of 1%. “It’s a herculean task to cross the collections of the previous financial year given the widespread damage the economy suffered due to the pandemic. We pursued a relentless approach to analyse various data provided by traders and introduced stringent measures against fake invoicing to claim input-tax credit which helped us beat the numbers we had achieved in 2019-20,” said Abhishek Bhagotia, commissioner, commercial tax. Bhagotia also attributed the growth in collections to the economic activities that picked up pace even though some critical sectors like travel and tourism remained laggards for better part of the year. He said improved compliance was a major reason for the feat achieved despite the severity of the economic situation. In fact, average GSTR 3B return filing of the state rose to 93% up to December, 2020 during FY 2020-21, while national average is 90%. During 2019-20, average return filing of GSTR 3B of the state was 90.56%, while national average was 88.96%. Bhagotia said the department created a performance matrix for tax officers’ evaluation on anti-evasion activity based on data analytics and focused attention on non-filers of return to achieve the growth. During the first quarter of 2020-21, the growth in revenue collection fell to 36.84%. It recovered during the second quarter, where the growth in revenue was 7.37% while the deficit up to second quarter stood at 14.78%. During third quarter revenue growth was 11.95% and the cumulative shortfall compared to the same period last financial year was 5.62%. During last quarter of FY 2020-21, growth in revenue collection clocked 20.12%, leading to a growth of 0.86% as of March 30, with collections of one more day still to be added. A senior official of the commercial tax department said that Rajasthan is the only state where GST collections for both the state and Centre ended up in positive territory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/despite-virus-blues-fy21-gst-and-vat-collections-surpass-last-years-receipts/articleshow/81792092.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Also, markets in urban areas across the state will close by 9 pm instead of 10 pm, according to an official release. The decisions were taken in a Covid review meeting chaired by chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Night curfew was imposed last week in eight cities/towns —Ajmer, Bhilwara, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Udaipur, Sagwada (Dungarpur) and Kushalgarh (Banswara) — from 11 pm to 5 pm but now the curfew will start from 10 pm. However, IT companies, restaurants, chemist shops, offices related to emergency services, wedding ceremonies, transportation, travellers will be exempted from the night curfew. During the meeting, Gehlot directed officials to take strict steps to save the state from the second wave of Covid infection. Gehlot also reviewed the vaccination drive . He said in areas where more cases are reported, district collectors would be able to take a decision regarding the closure of educational institutions in consultation with the state government. The chief minister said commercial establishments where Covid protocol is violated, the violator as well as the operator will be held responsible. He directed that joint teams of the district administration, police and local bodies should visit markets to ensure compliance of Covid protocol in the establishments. These teams will conduct a rigorous inspection till April 14 and will also be able to initiate fines and seizure if a violation is found. In addition, operators of wedding venues will be held responsible if they flout the prescribed limit of attendees. Such marriage places can be sealed. Gehlot directed the district collectors to regularly review the positive rates, mortality and testings. Special emphasis should be placed on contact tracing, micro containment zones and testing, the CM said. “Vaccination is the strongest weapon to protect against Covid. We have to insist on vaccination,” he said, adding that district collectors have been instructed that the targets of vaccination should be attained as soon as possible. Gehlot appealed to the patwaris, who are on strike, to return to work in view of the situation. He said the government would try to take appropriate decisions on their legitimate demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-increases-night-curfew-timings-by-1-hr/articleshow/81792070.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala polls 2021: Ramesh Chennithala ‘leaks’ list of over 4 lakh bogus voters||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on Wednesday released the full list of 4.34 lakh voters whose names were found to have entered twice or multiple times in the voters’ list for the upcoming assembly elections. The list was released on the website www.operationtwins.com. Releasing the list, the office of the opposition leader said it contains the names of duplicate voters in each booth, and the names of voters whose photographs have been used for committing fraud in other booths and also other constituencies. The list also includes the constituency number, the booth number, the name of the candidate, the name of the voter and the voter ID number and the ID number of the same voter in other booths. The website has been designed in such a way that one can choose a district, and the assembly constituency in it to find the details of the duplicate voters. The list has three parts- one part contains a list of duplicate voters with same photographs in the same constituency, while another section has a list of voters with same photographs in the neighboring constituency and the last part contains a list of voters with the same photographs but with different names and addresses, which in all probability could have been arranged without the knowledge of the original voters in the photographs. Chennithala had taken strong exception to the list prepared by the election commission, which said that only 38, 586 duplicate voters are in the list. He had said that the commission’s list is incomplete and that he would release the full list of 4.34 lakh names that have been repeated in the list, which itself is incomplete. The list will be constantly updated with each new finding, and the public or political parties can access the data and take it up with the election commission. Though he expressed satisfaction over the high court order that has vindicated his claims that there are several duplicate voters in the voters’ list, Chennithala said the election commission has not been able to successfully conduct an inquiry for locating the duplicate voters and cleanse them. The opposition leader said the commission has instructed booth-level officers to examine and locate bogus voters, but the BLOs can check the duplication only in their specific booths and cannot spot the same person holding different identities who have made it into the voters list in several booths. Also, they cannot identify same voters whose names are in the list in different constituencies, Chennithala said. He said it took a great deal of effort and several days for the Congress activists to spot the list of duplicate voters, and there could be more such entries. He expressed concern over how the commission could seek an affidavit from those whose names are found multiple times in the voters list, as such duplication could have occurred without their knowledge. He said the opposition has no intention to block the election process, but the commission should ensure that one person casts only one vote. He also welcomed other measures for checking bogus voting like the deployment of central forces in the booths, ensuring camera facility in the booths etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ramesh-leaks-list-of-over-4l-bogus-voters/articleshow/81788981.cms||---

Among Delhi’s 18,000-odd parks, 14,500 are maintained by the civic bodies. “The parks have been turning dry over the past few years. This is a direct result of the carelessness of the municipal corporations. The National Green Tribunal had ordered that all the tubewells used to irrigate these parks should be closed, and the municipal corporations and DDA should draw water supply from the sewer treatment plants (STPs). If the civic bodies believed that the order was unfair or arbitrary, they should have gone to the Supreme Court two years ago. They were sleeping on it, and now that the NGT is sternly implementing the order, they are closing the tubewells,” Bharadwaj said in a press conference. The NGT had also said that the corporations should alternatively use sewer water, while Delhi Jal Board was also asked to create infrastructure to implement this plan. “DJB decided to provide water from STPs for free if it was being used for irrigation, lake construction or water recycling purposes. The parks where tubewells have been sealed are not getting water for irrigation because the corporations are not sending their tankers,” said Bharadwaj. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, according to the latest NGT order, the responsibility of providing water for the parks through tankers was with DJB. “It will be better if Delhi government provides funds to the municipal corporations so that they can maintain the parks effectively,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/parks-turning-dry-due-to-corpns-negligence-aap/articleshow/81862876.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sena appoints LS MP along with Raut as its chief spokesperson||MUMBAI: Seven months after it announced a list of 10 spokespersons, the Shiv Sena on Wednesday released a revised panel of 16. While retaining Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut as chief spokesperson, it named another chief spokesperson along with him, Lok Sabha MP Arvind Sawant. The move comes in the wake of Raut’s recent controversial remarks about home minister Anil Deshmukh and the leadership of the UPA, which had created unease among MVA allies NCP and Congress. A party functionary said the move by Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, who is CM, was aimed at not giving Raut unfettered powers as sole chief spokesperson. Another functionary said that the 2022 BMC polls was another reason the party felt like revising its list of spokespersons. Raut had written in his column in Saamna last Sunday that Anil Deshmukh was an “accidental home minister. “Raut later said that he had warned a few leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi not to reinstate suspended cop Sachin Waze. The statement sounded as if he was affirming the opposition’s claim that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had cleared the proposal for Waze’s reinstatement.” The functionary pointed to Ajit Pawar’s reaction after the column appeared, that Raut should not play “spoilsport” when the three-party government was functioning properly. “Raut also suggested that at the national level, NCP chief Sharad Pawar should head the UPA. This has irked the Congress, which is one of the partners in the state government,” the functionary added. However, another Sena functionary said that Raut was the only leader in the party now who was known to be a firebrand. “As a working journalist, he has a knack of smelling things in politics, and the party should use him as an asset,” the functionary said. Besides the two chief spokespersons, the other spokespersons announced by the party are Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi, minister Anil Parab, MLA Pratap Saranaik, Sunil Prabhu, Bhaskar Jadhav, MLC Ambadas Danve, former MLA Sachin Ahir, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar, MLC Manisha Kayande, former mayor Shubha Raul and corporators Sheetal Mhatre, Sanjana Ghadi, Kishor Kanhore and Anand Dubey. The Sena has also dropped some names from its list of 10 declared in September 2020, including that of deputy chairperson of state council Dr Neelam Gorhe and ministers Gulabrao Patil and Uday Samant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-appoints-ls-mp-along-with-raut-as-its-chief-spokesperson/articleshow/81795375.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

Beneficiaries of the scheme can avail the benefits at private hospitals and government hospitals empaneled under the scheme,” said Raghu Sharma, health minister. “Universal health scheme is a Rs 3,000-crore health scheme. We have not seen such a big health scheme anywhere. The state government will bear 80% of it. Those who fall under any specified categories, will not to pay any premium, which will be paid by the government. Those who do not belong to any specified category, will have to pay Rs 850 per year per family,” said Sharma.

---||Jaipur||Over 2.09 crore people aged 45 and above to get vaccine from today||JAIPUR: Covid vaccination drive will be extended to all persons above the age of 45 from April 1 (Thursday). Around 2.09crore citizens aged between 45 and 59 years will be benefitted from the move. On the eve of expansion of the vaccination drive, health minister Raghu Sharma, while encouraging people aged over 45 years to get the jab said, “I appeal to all those who are above 45 years not to be hesitant as the vaccine has no side-effects and it is safe. After vaccination, according to doctors, wearing of face masks will be necessary because mask is more effective than vaccine. There are people who have tested positive even after getting two doses of vaccines, but their life is not in danger. Vaccines can save life, but infection cannot be prevented, which is why, appropriate Covid-19 behaviour should be followed such as wearing face mask, maintaining social distancing and washing hands frequently.” From April 1, the health department has a challenging task of vaccinating 2.09 crore beneficiaries who are between 45 and 59 years. “We are taking the help of public representatives in rural areas such as sarpanchs, patwaris and swasthya mitras to encourage the drive,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, project director (immunization), health department. The Centre has directed the states to vaccinate the above 45-year population in 14 days. However, the health department officials claimed that it depends on the target beneficiaries who need to be vaccinated. For the purpose, the state government is encouraging them to get the jab. Officials said till now they had been organizing 2,500 to 3,000 vaccination sessions daily. Now, the drive will be expanded so that people get the vaccine at their nearest vaccination centre. However, the health department might have to manage the drive with limited staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/over-2-09-crore-people-aged-45-and-above-to-get-vaccine-from-today/articleshow/81792232.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand hotels claim to have lost 30% bookings for Good Friday weekend within 12 hours of state government advisory on RT-PCR test||DEHRADUN/NAINITAL/MUSSOORIE: Hotels in prominent tourist destinations across the state claimed to have lost 30 to 40% of their bookings for the first long weekend of April (Good Friday/Easter) within hours of the state government releasing an SOP that advises tourists from 12 states which have seen a spike in Covid-19 cases, including Delhi, Maharashtra and UP, to carry RT-PCR negative test reports. Hoteliers said they were particularly worried about how the order will be implemented by local police, considering they may not understand that the state has only issued an “advisory”, and not made it mandatory for tourists to carry RT-PCR test reports. Expressing concern, Sandeep Sahni, president of the Uttarakhand Hotel Association, said, “We have received dozens of calls this morning from guests asking for clarification on whether they need a negative Covid-19 RT-PCR report or not. We highlighted the part where it says that the Covid negative reports are ‘advised’ and not mandatory. Tourism is a fragile industry and has suffered a huge jolt last year. Any such news immediately puts off tourists.” Another hotelier, Digvijay Singh Bisht, who is vice-president of Nainital Hotel and Restaurant Association, added, “Since news of the new SOP spread, which the state claims to be an advisory, close to 35 to 40 % bookings for the long weekend have been cancelled. Such knee-jerk reactions from the state government and use of confusing language in orders has created a situation where no one knows what is going on.” Abhishek Ahluwalia, president of Tour Operators’ Association of Uttarakhand told TOI that all tourism-related industry bodies will collectively approach the chief minister with their grievances. “We have already faced so much trouble last year that more confusion will drive our businesses over the edge. It will be especially hard on those who own small hotels, restaurants or taxis. The state should be very clear on whether people from these states should come or not, on if they should bring a Covid-19-negative report or not. A confusing advisory will cost the tourism industry dearly,” Ahluwalia said. Meanwhile, Sahni urged that those in the hospitality industry should be vaccinated on priority. “The government must understand that we, too, are frontline workers. If hotel staffers are vaccinated, people can come to stay at our properties without fear,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-hotels-claim-to-have-lost-30-bookings-for-good-friday-weekend-within-12-hours-of-state-government-advisory-on-rt-pcr-test/articleshow/81785859.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Mumbai||5% stamp duty for property registrations restored in Mumbai||In a setback to the real estate industry as well as flat buyers, the state government on Wednesday decided not to extend the cut on stamp duty on property registrations. Ready reckoner (RR) rates, though, remain unchanged for the 2021-22 financial year. The slashing of stamp duty in Mumbai from 5% to 2% from September to December 2020, and 3% till March 31, 2021, had boosted residential realty sales. On a brighter note, the 1% stamp duty waiver for women home buyers, as announced in the state budget on March 8, would come into effect from Thursday. The concession is only for residential units and not for land. Besides, the concession will not be applicable if there is a male co-owner of the unit. The RR rates, revised six months ago, would be continued for this financial year, stated the state circular issued on Wednesday evening. State revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat tweeted that regular rates would be applicable from April 1. Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (Credai) national chairman Satish Magar told TOI the government had announced the stamp duty waiver as a short-term booster after the lockdown. “We had again approached the government for an extension of the concession for three months. The government had its compulsions and did not agree to the extension,” he said. State inspector general of registration and stamps Shravan Hardikar said as per the government direction, the Annual Statement Rate for 2021-2022 would be the same as in 2020-21. The RR rates for residential and commercial properties are announced on April 1 every year. In 2020, the revised rates were announced in September because of the Covid-19 pandemic. On an average, the RR rates were increased by 1.74% last year. The highest average increase (3.91%) was registered in Pune district. In Mumbai, the average upward revision was 0.6%. Credai national vice-president Shantilal Kataria said they had demanded reduction in RR rates as per Maharashtra Stamp (Determination of True Market Value of Property) Rules, 1995. “We are, however, happy the government has kept it untouched. A certain amount of buoyancy was witnessed in the last five to six months,” he said. Suhas Merchant, national chairman of Credai’s statistics and standards committee, said, “We are happy to see our submission (on RR rates) has been considered.” Niranjan Hiranandani, managing director of Hiranandani Group and national president of Naredco, said while Maharashtra had played a “stellar role” by announcing the stamp duty waiver last year, it could have continued it. “We will request the state to reconsider its decision,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-5-stamp-duty-for-property-registrations-restored-in-city/articleshow/81789131.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) said the Metro tunnels would be 19-20 metres below the river’s surface, after starting at 13 metres. They would cover 80 metres under the riverbed. The first tunnel boring machine (TBM) has reached the beginning of the riverbed and is expected to cross the 80-metre stretch in about 10 to 15 days. The second TBM is expected to complete the excavation in next two weeks. According to the MahaMetro, two parallel tunnels are being excavated for Up and Down lines. The second TBM has started the excavation from the Civil Court station site and has progressed about 50 metres. After crossing the river, the tunnels will proceed towards Budhwar Peth/Kasba Peth Metro station site. The Metro lines would cross the rivers in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad at four locations. Of these, the Civil Court-Kasba Peth is the only stretch where the tracks would be below the river. At the remaining three locations -- Harris bridge, RTO and Bund Garden -- the Metro lines will cross the rivers on a viaduct. Hemant Sonawane, the general manager (PR) at the MahaMetro, said, “The Metro work is progressing at all the sites according to the schedule. The TBMs are working in two shifts. Three TBMs have been deployed now. Of them, two are progressing from Civil Court towards Kasba Peth-Mandai and the third machine is drilling from Swargate towards Mandai.” The MahaMetro has mostly found uniform basalt rock in the underground stretch from the Agriculture College ground to Swargate. The presence of rock was found even under the river, another MahaMetro official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metros-tbm-ready-to-dig-tunnel-under-mutha-river/articleshow/81789140.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala assembly polls 2021: Unquiet flows the Kallada||PATHANAPURAM: “Where is the Taluk Hospital you promised?” screams a giant hoarding of Jyothykumar Chamakkala on the busy Kollam-Madurai Highway, criss-crossing the Pathanapuram constituency. Such imaginative, if not provocative, posters have come up all across the constituency where Chamakkala, the United Democratic Front candidate, is taking on Left Democratic Front’s KB Ganesh Kumar. Carpet-bombing the constituency, Chamakkala has caused a kerfuffle of sorts in the minds of voters. For the uninitiated, Pathanapuram is a bastion of Ganesh (MLA since 2001) despite switching from UDF to LDF before the 2016 Assembly polls. Few have nurtured the constituency like Ganesh, representing Kerala Congress (B), has in the last 20 years and it’s all there to be seen: be it roads (dubbed mini-highways), schools, libraries, primary health centres, potable water supply, and more importantly bridges (seven of them on the Kallada river alone). Ganesh has probably ticked all the right boxes and his popularity – despite many personal controversies– seems to be intact. Having said that, Chamakkala’s audacious blitz has evoked a ripple effect, reinvigorating the Congress-led UDF to “even think about the unthinkable”.  The Chamakkala blitzkrieg hasn’t rattled Ganesh, but he is surprised. “Suddenly, someone is walking in and uttering many things. I really don’t understand when he says there has been no development in Pathanapuram. The whole of Kerala talks about the work I have done in the constituency,” says Ganesh. Baulks Chamakkala: “Of course, in an election, we talk about development. I am not saying he has not done anything, but he has not done what has been promised. What about his 2016 poll manifesto? This is the only taluk headquarters without a taluk hospital. Be it the police station at Pattazhy, or solid waste management plants in panchayats, he has not delivered. Where are the industries and job opportunities? I challenge him for an open debate anytime, anywhere.”  Terming the allegations an election stunt, Ganesh says development is all about “basic amenities”. “People are worried about their basic needs, be it water, roads, or even transport. My focus has always been that and it’s there to be seen. Also, the last tenure has been the most productive with Rs 600-crore developmental work executed here,” says Ganesh Kumar, who has been increasing his majority in every election. If it was 9,931 in 2001, it steadily increased to 11,814, 20,402 and 24,562 in 2006, 2011 and 2016 respectively. The contentious Taluk Hospital, he clarifies, is being built on a two-acre plot on a budget of Rs 80 crore. Why did Chamakkala pick Pathanapuram when there were relatively easier constituencies elsewhere? “It’s a political decision. UDF leaders were discussing multiple options, but I preferred Pathanapuram. Candidate aside, from 2001 to 2011, voters chose a candidate of UDF. I have been working here for the last four years. The plan is to wrest Pathanapuram back from LDF,” says Chamakkala. Bombarding the constituency with hoardings and graffiti is part of a clear strategy, he says. “Every constituency needs different strategies. In some places, you need to be upfront to send across strong political points.” Suspecting a plot, Ganesh says “so much money is pouring in” to divert the developmental narrative. “I have seen richer candidates contest elections. For instance, my father [ex-minister R Balakrishna Pillai] was one of the richest candidates in the district itself, but he never splurged money like this on any election. From where is the money being thrown in? Even the number of hoardings and graffiti is way beyond the prescribed limit. Let EC take a look,” he says. To his credit, Chamakkala refuses to attack Ganesh Kumar on personal issues. “I repeat, it’s a political contest and there is no question of mud-slinging. From the feedback I get, I am confident of winning this time,” he says. Never before has a Congress candidate created such a flutter in Pathanapuram. Is it the toughest fight ever in Ganesh Kumar, 20-year-old political career? “Every election is tough and I must say there is no room for complacency. Just through publicity, a perception of a close fight has been created. I have trust in my electorate and my margin will go up this time too,” he contends. Not many are talking about BJP’s Jitin Dev, but he will be looking to up the party’s vote share. Chamakkala has managed to push open the sluice gates but the Kallada River seems to be flowing quite steadily. Or are there any undercurrents?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/unquiet-flows-the-kallada/articleshow/81789155.cms||Rajaneesh.Vilakudy

CM Rawat attended the event via video-conferencing. With this, officials said that Haridwar has become the second city to have underground cabling of electricity wires after Varanasi. Speaking to TOI, Radhika Jha, secretary, power, said, “The project was completed in a period of one year and 10 months. While underground cabling has been done in some pockets in several cities, Varanasi and Haridwar are the only two cities that have been fully covered with this facility.” The Rs 388.49 crore-worth project was completed by Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited. The CM said that the project will help provide uninterrupted power supply to Haridwar and will also minimise the possibility of cable snapping and power theft. “This will avert the snapping of cables and possible accidents due to rain and thunderstorms. While underground power lines will reduce maintenance costs, there will be open space for beautification of residential and commercial areas as well,” he said. Union minister of state for power RK Singh said underground cabling greatly improves power quality and reduces power loss significantly. Singh said that efforts will be made to expand underground cabling in Haridwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/underground-cabling-project-inaugurated-for-kumbh-area-of-haridwar-becomes-second-city-after-varanasi-to-have-facility/articleshow/81785926.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Hyderabad||Cops in action over woman’s ‘kidnap’ call||Hyderabad: Banjara Hills police launched a massive search operation on Wednesday night after receiving a ‘Dial 100’ call about a suspected kidnapping of a woman. At around 10.30 pm, a woman residing in the lane next to a sweet shop on Road No. 3 of Banjara Hills called 100 and informed about an unidentified person kidnapping a woman on a two-wheeler. Police immediately swung into action and verified the CCTV camera footage in the area. Patrolling teams in the city have also been alerted about the complaint. However, when police verified the CCTV footage, they noticed a scooter stopping in the lane after a wobble at 10.30 pm and a woman riding pillion sliding off the seat. The scooter rider was seen unsuccessfully trying to lift the woman, who squatted on the road. Two bikers passed by, but they did not stop to inquire. After a while, the rider managed to lift the woman and drove away on the scooter. “In the video, it appears like the woman was not able to stand properly may be due to intoxication or ill-health. We are trying to identify the vehicle’s details. We are also trying to trace the scooter rider and the woman,” west zone joint CP AR Srinivas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-in-action-over-womans-kidnap-call/articleshow/81792286.cms||---
---||Kochi||Don’t summon central govt officers: High court to Kerala Police||KOCHI: The high court on Wednesday ordered Kerala Police not to summon any officer of central agencies in relation to the FIR alleging that gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh was forced by Enforcement Directorate (ED) to name the chief minister in the case. Justice VG Arun issued the directive, along with extending the previous order not to take any coercive steps, after a hearing on a petition filed by P Radhakrishnan, deputy director of ED Kochi zone, challenging the FIR filed by crime branch wing of Kerala Police. The court’s directive means that police can continue with the investigation but it cannot take any coercive steps or summon any officers of ED or any other central agency. After hearing counsels representing ED and the state government on Wednesday, the court had only ordered for extending its earlier directive not to take any coercive steps until it hears the case again on April 8. But central government counsel (CGC) Suvin R Menon submitted at that stage that a Customs official was summoned by a deputy commissioner of Kochi police on Wednesday itself. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta then pushed for a stay but the court only issued the directive not to summon any officers of central agencies. The court told senior public prosecutor Suman Chakravarthy that it is recording that he submitted that officers of central agencies will not be summoned by police. Earlier in the day, the solicitor general had submitted during hearing that a Customs officer has been summoned by police even when the court is hearing ED’s plea to quash the FIR by police. However, senior advocate Harin Raval, who represented the state government, had submitted that no such action was taken. Only notice was issued by the advocate general on a contempt of court plea, the senior counsel said. However, when the day’s hearing was ending, CGC Suvin submitted that a Customs official was in fact summoned as submitted by the solicitor general earlier and that he had personally verified the same. During Wednesday’s hearing, the solicitor general and additional solicitor generals SV Raju and KM Nataraj had represented the central government and its agencies. They contended that Kerala Police’s FIR is improper and legally flawed. If such a move is allowed, it would result in a never-ending exercise as state and central agencies will keep on filing cases against each other. Senior advocate Harin Raval argued on behalf of the state government that the FIR does not have anything to do with the investigation under Prevention of Money Laundering Act as portrayed by the opposing counsels but it was registered when it was found during preliminary enquiry that there was an attempt to target high-profile persons under the guise of investigation. State government’s version will be heard in detail at the next hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dont-summon-central-govt-officers-high-court-to-police/articleshow/81785976.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Property tax tied to collector guidelines, may shoot up||Bhopal: Expect a property tax increase of up to 10% after the tax slab was linked to collector guideline rates in Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) budget for 2021-22 presented on Wednesday. The budget has been approved by Bhopal divisional commissioner who is also the BMC administrator. Direct effect of the hike would be witnessed in several areas effective from April 1. Tax may increase by an average of 8%, according to estimates. BMC proposal follows Madhya Pradesh Municipality (Determination of Taxable Property Value of Buildings and Lands) Rules – 2020. With the new slabs, BMC is expected to cross property cess collection of Rs 400 in the next fiscal. Given the controversy over increase in water and Swach tax in Indore, a similar move has been delayed in Bhopal, according to highly placed sources. Bhopal divisional commissioner and BMC administrator Kavindra Kiyawat approved budget of 2021-2022, with a projected expenditure of Rs 2,516.82 crore. Last fiscal budget was Rs 2,495.68 crore. BMC has been under an administrator since the BMC council term ended in March 2020. Income and expenditure have been balanced in the budget, with no deficit. The no-profit-no-loss budget for second consecutive year, focuses on completing the on-going BMC works. “There are about 600 to 700 small and big projects which should be completed this year. The focus is also on improving water supply, sewage and other basic services,” said BMC commissioner, KVS Choudary. “Property tax was fixed and approved by the BMC council. Linking property tax to collector guideline rate is further going to complete matters. We have the instance of billboards being linked to collector rate. A recovery of about Rs 200 crore is still pending. There are instances, in some locations where collector rate is higher than actual property rate. This will complicate matters. In the coming days, we will oppose the move,” said former BMC corporator Girish Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/property-tax-tied-to-collector-guidelines-may-shoot-up/articleshow/81789154.cms||---
---||Pune||SSC students await new GR on additional marks for drawing||Done / Graphic with Sanjay Pune: After a government resolution from the ministry of higher and technical education last week which said students would not get any additional marks in the standard X board examination for qualifying intermediate drawing examination, Maharashtra Arts Teachers Association that opposed the move, has written to the board telling it not to implement the order. An online meeting between the ministry and the state board officials was held on Tuesday and sources said that a positive outcome is expected. A new GR will be issued soon. State board students after the age of 12 can appear for the elementary drawing examination, post-qualifying which they can appear for the intermediate exam. They get an extra 3-7 marks for securing a drawing intermediate certificate. Last year, 1,44,183 students in standard X had taken advantage of this. However, due to Covid-19 this year, no such examination was conducted. But a student who has gained the certificate in standard VIII or IX is eligible for these additional marks. The controversial government resolution on March 26 said that keeping in view the safety of children during the pandemic, the state has decided not to conduct the Government Drawing (Elementary and Intermediate Drawing Grade) Examination for 2020. Due to this, in the academic year 2020-21, in the secondary schools, the students appearing for the standard X examination should not be given extra marks for the concession of the government drawing examination, it added. Sunil Borole, secretary of the Pune chapter of the association, said, “ Many students have already cleared the examination and we have sent their names to the board for the additional marks. The higher and technical education ministry is not the competent authority to look into this matter as the state board that conducts the board examinations comes under the school education ministry. Hence, the final decision will come from this department. We have received assurances from both the higher and technical education ministry, as well as the state board that the issue would be resolved in favour of the students.” The association had also demanded that the additional marks this year should be given on the basis of elementary certificate grades in the drawing examination since the intermediate examination could not be conducted. An official from the education department said, “There was an online meeting held yesterday between the higher and technical education ministry and state board officials and a discussion on additional marks for drawing in standard X followed. Once they issue a revised GR, the school education ministry will also issue an order which will be implemented by the state board. The officials were positive about it.

---||Delhi||Traders knock on LG’s doors over excise policy||New Delhi: Perhaps buoyed by the new law giving primacy to the lieutenant governor, an association of liquor traders has urged him not to clear the new excise policy brought in by the AAP government. Delhi Liquor Traders’ Association has submitted a memorandum to LG Anil Baijal alleging arbitrariness in the new policy framed by the group of ministers headed by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. The association had earlier decided to approach the Supreme Court to challenge the legal validity of the policy, but now wants the LG to “form a fact-finding committee to ascertain which players are manipulating and manoeuvring the policy in their favour, and to get these investigated by an impartial agency, such as the CBI.” In a representation through lawyer Rushab Aggarwal, the association stated that the new policy was influenced by corrupt means. “The corruption is so glaring that these criteria have been carefully tailor-made to enable licences to fall in the lap of 1-2 people,” it alleged. The association president Naresh Goyal claimed that the proposed policy would increase proxy ownership and cartelisation, as the individuals who would be granted licences under the new policy could apply under the names of their family members and friends, which could lead to a situation where virtually one player might control the entire retail trade of liquor in Delhi. Announcing the new excise policy last month, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said it would act as a major blow to the liquor mafia in the capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-knock-on-lgs-doors-over-excise-policy/articleshow/81862911.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Meerut||UP: Overjoyed after stealing Rs 7 lakh, thief suffers heart attack; spends loot on treatment||BIJNOR: This thief was overjoyed when he and his accomplice laid their hands on a large amount of money when they had least expected it, so much so that he suffered a heart attack. His joy turned into tragedy, and soon he had to cough up a large chunk of the stolen money on his treatment. The matter came to light when one of the two thieves was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the theft committed last month in Bijnor’s Kotwali Dehat area told police during interrogation. Bijnor superintendent of police Dharm Veer Singh said two thieves broke into a public service centre owned by one Nawab Haider on the intervening night of February 16 and 17. Following a complaint lodged by Haider that over Rs 7 lakh was stolen from the centre, police had registered a case against unidentified accused and launched a probe. On Wednesday, police claimed to have cracked the case with the arrest of two accused — Naushad and Ajaj, both in their early 30s — from Alipur under Nagina police station area. The SP said the accused were arrested from a restaurant on Wednesday with the help of a surveillance system. “The accused are habitual offenders and have several cases registered against them in different police stations. They confessed to have committed a robbery at the public service centre and fled with Rs 7 lakh cash and other valuables kept in an almirah. The accused told police that they had expected just a couple of thousand rupees at the centre, but were overjoyed after seeing such a huge amount. They divided the money evenly. But soon, Ajaj suffered a heart attack and was admitted to a private hospital. He had to cough up a large chunk of the stolen money on his treatment. Naushad, however, spent the money in betting in Delhi,” said the SP. The SP added that police seized Rs 3.7 lakh cash and two pistols from their possession and impounded a bike that they had lifted from Phulsanda village. The SP, meanwhile, has announced a reward of Rs 5,000 for the police team for cracking the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/overjoyed-after-stealing-rs-7l-thief-suffers-heart-attack-spends-loot-on-treatment/articleshow/81784600.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No-mask action losing steam? Over 11k fined Rs 23.6L on Holi||MUMBAI: BMC’s action against ‘mask-less’ offenders seems to be losing steam. On Monday, on the occasion of Holi, only 11,809 people were caught for violating the face mask rule and Rs 23.6 lakh collected in fine, probably the lowest ever since Mumbai Police joined the civic body in taking action. On Tuesday, the number of offenders caught rose to nearly 16,000 and Rs 31.9 lakh fine was collected, but the numbers were low compared to March 6 when 24,809 people were penalised and over Rs 49.6 lakh penalty collected. The action-taken reports of the past few days show that less than 20,000 offenders are being penalised. BMC chief Iqbal Chahal on Tuesday said that so far nearly 24 lakh Mumbaikars have been penalised Rs 200 each for not wearing face masks in public and more than Rs 48 crore collected in fines. “No other city has penalised such a large number of offenders...But I appeal to citizens to observe Covid-appropriate behaviour by always wearing a mask in public and ensure there’s no crowding to help curb the spread of coronavirus,” Chahal said. But King’s Circle activist Nikhil Desai pointed out: “It is sad that even after one year of the pandemic outbreak, many people are not wearing face masks and the BMC needs to undertake such a drive.” Meanwhile, the state directive to increase the penalty amount for mask rule violation to Rs 500 from Rs 200 is yet to be implemented in Mumbai. Marine Drive resident Mahendra Hemdev, who takes regular walks on the promenade, said BMC’s clean-up marshals are still charging Rs 200. “But offenders complain even about paying this amount. I wonder if they would even pay Rs 500,” he added. A civic official said that they need the BMC chief’s sanction to impose the Rs 500 fine as receipt books would also have to be reprinted. “The current receipt books mention Rs 200 as penalty. Once the approval is received, we will print new ones with the increased amount,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-mask-action-losing-steam-over-11k-fined-rs-23-6l-on-holi/articleshow/81792356.cms||Richa Pinto

In a case pertaining to lifting the cap on reservation (50%) which is pending before the apex court, LDF government gave an affidavit that the reservation cap can be increased. Recently, the government also announced reservation for Christian sections in Nadar community. At the same time, the government, which introduced job reservation for economically-weaker sections (EWS) in forward caste, couldn’t publish the list of eligible communities. “EWS reservation was a long-standing demand by community organizations like NSS. UDF couldn’t implement it because of the objection from constituents like IUML. But, LDF government decided to implement it,” said political observer Jacob George. “Nadar Christian, EWS reservation will reflect in elections. Members of Christian and Nair communities may consider this as a factor to support LDF,” he said. Reservation announced for Christian Nadar sections may have implications in Parassala and Nemom. According to CPM leadership, the decision to introduce reservation for these sections are part of the party’s policies rather than an  plank. “It is a positive response from the government. There has been a consensus that the cap should lifted from 50% to give job reservation for EWS,” said politburo member MA Baby. “As far as CPM is concerned, reservation is a temporary solution. Providing education and job opportunities for everyone and making them competent to get jobs is our suggestion. Job opportunities also should be increased. Congress and BJP governments that assumed power at the Centre sold many public-sector undertakings thereby reducing reservation for eligible communities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/job-reservation-may-influence-poll-outcome/articleshow/81789168.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

They have also demanded the return of their examination fee as they feel that the online examination doesn’t cost as much as the infrastructure that the university needs to set up for an offline exam. Swapnil Patil, an engineering student, said, “They first said the examinations would be held in February and then it was postponed to April. There is no timetable as yet which hinders our preparation for the examination because we do not know which exams have an off-day before them and which don’t. We have not received any question bank. If we had got the question bank, we could have been better prepared, but the university’s officials have said they will provide this five days before the exam which does not help us much.”Rahul, a first-year MBA student, said while he has got a question bank from his college, he wishes the university too had uploaded its own question banks so that students could have been better prepared. “We are already stressed about the delay in examinations. This will stretch our first year which means even the second year will get delayed, which in turn will affect our internship and job prospects. The university not declaring the timetable is giving us anxiety. There are many unanswered questions another postponement and gaps in exams,” he added.Student activist Kamalakar Shete said the university should have been prepared better. “They should have declared all timetables on March 25 as promised and should have uploaded question banks at least 15 days in advance so that students have the time to prepare,” he added.GRAPHICS:First Semester StatisticsNon-Professional Course---StudentsBA---81,359BCom--1,16,656BSc---93,619MA--13,743MCom--15,073MSc--8,405Students Appearing for 3,28,855Professional Courses---Students Engineering---1,45,000Pharmacy---24,096Education---933Law---13,729Architecture---7,518MBA---28,837MMS----234Others----53,146Students Appearing 2,73,493For Exam---6,02,348||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/students-worry-about-question-bank-timetable-ahead-of-april-10-exam/articleshow/81789179.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Dehradun||Taken 1 dose of vax? For Kumbh, -ve report still a must, says High court||NAINITAL: A day after the state government issued an advisory asking those coming from 12 identified states where Covid cases were rising to bring their Covid-19-negative RT-PCR test report with them, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday said that people who have received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine will also need Covid-19-negative certification before visitng the Kumbh Mela. The court further directed the state government to increase testing in Haridwar to 50,000 per day after it was informed that despite its claims of conducting 55,000 tests per day in the holy city, the state was conducting only about 5,000 tests per day (including RT-PCR and antigen). The court also directed the state government to encourage people to take vaccines at designated centres at the Kumbh site. The HC added that facilities to keep people under observation after they are administered the vaccine should also be created and if someone develops reactions to the shots, they should be treated. The directions came from the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma while it was hearing a bunch of Public Interest Litigations (PILs) concerning the state’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Shiv Bhatt, the counsel appearing for one of the petitioners, said that the court also expressed its concerns as it was made aware about the conditions of the hospital as well as sanitation arrangements at the Kumbh site and directed the state to fill the lacunae. Meanwhile, the court has also observed that since Covid-19 cases are already on the rise across the country and even the Centre is worried about it, the government should ensure all SOPs released by both the Centre and itself are strictly followed. “The court has directed the government to publish all the data related to the number of tests, the number of deaths as well as the number of active cases online each day,” Bhatt added. The court has now listed the case for further hearing on April 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/those-who-have-taken-1st-shot-of-vaccine-will-also-need-covid-ve-report-to-enter-kumbh-ukhand-hc/articleshow/81786209.cms||Prashant Jha

The case was filed against Ulhasnagar resident Karan Udasi on a complaint by the BMC. The BMC issued a show-cause notice to Hotel Sai Leela Grand for violating the protocol by neither informing the civic body nor the police about Karan “escaping quarantine”, and also filed a non-cognizable offence against his sister Piyu for circulating a defamatory video against government officials. The hotel too filed a written complaint with MIDC police against Piyu over the video and sought action against her for damaging its reputation. In the video, Piyu, who claims to be a singer and music composer on her Instagram page, alleged that her brother was forced to pay Rs 10,000 by the hotel to avoid the mandatory quarantine. “My brother requested a test at the airport...Instead, they wanted him to undergo quarantine in a hotel and bear the expenses of medicines, lodging and boarding. It is unclear why he has to pay for medicines when he does not have any symptoms. He had done two tests which were negative before he landed in Mumbai,” she claimed in the video. Assistant municipal comm-issioner of K-East ward Prash-ant Sapkale said, “We have filed a police complaint against the flyer and an NC against his sister for the defamatory video.” DCP S Chaitanya, who is also Mumbai Police spokesperson, confirmed that an offence has been registered under IPC sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (negligent act) and under Section 3 of Epidemic Diseases Act at MIDC police station against Karan. If found guilty, he faces jail term for maximum six months. “Karan Udasi landed in Mumbai after a transit journey of Europe and Dubai. He was asked to undergo the quarantine...but he was not ready for it,” said an officer from MIDC police station. BMC’s show-cause notice to the hotel stated: “Why should your licence not be cancelled? Kindly clarify the same and in case of the same not being done in two days your establishment licence will be cancelled.” TOI has a copy of the notice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/25-yr-old-flyer-escapes-from-hotel-booked-for-violating-quarantine-rule-in-mumbai/articleshow/81792650.cms||Richa Pinto

Prima facie, the police suspect it to be a case of death by suicide and are investigating. The victim had been without a job for the last two years and was staying with his parents, police said. Senior inspector Sardar Patil of the Kondhwa police said on Wednesday, “The victim was earlier working with a private company but the firm closed down. On Tuesday morning, his parents realised that he had not come out of room for quite some time and his pet cat was crying out loud. They tried to check up on him but he was not responding to their calls.” Patil said, “The parents then called his friends and they broke down the door. They then found the victim hanging from a ceiling fan in his room. He had used his mother’s sari for hanging himself and did not leave any note behind. His grieving parents have not yet shared any information on what could be the possible reason behind him taking such an extreme step.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/engineer-hangs-self-at-kondhwa-home/articleshow/81789203.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees record 6.6 lakh new cases in March||MUMBAI: Maharashtra recorded over 6.6 lakh new Covid -19 cases in March, which is the highest addition of cases in a month since the pandemic began and a 400% jump from February, when 1.3 lakh cases were logged. It took the state over 3.5 months from mid-October to February to add 6.5 lakh cases. Mumbai added 83,457 cases in March, again the highest in a month since the outbreak started. On Wednesday, 39,544 cases were added in the state, the second highest daily addition so far, taking the total caseload to 28.12 lakh. It is nearly the same as Germany, which is the 10th worst affected country with 28.16 lakh cases. Worryingly, Maharashtra reported 227 deaths, a significant jump from 139 fatalities reported a day before. Wednesday’s toll is the highest in 146 days, since November 5 (256). In absolute numbers, the monthly fatalities are on the rise, but the case fatality rate is actually dipping. In March, the state added 2,495 deaths and reported a CFR of 0.4%, as against 1,072 deaths in February and a CFR of 0.8%. At its peak in September, the state’s fatality rate was 2.1% with 1,271 deaths. Though the state breached the September high in cases in March, deaths were five times fewer. Mumbai ended March with 200 deaths, higher than February’s toll of 127 but less than January’s 236. The city had reported the highest deaths in June last year (3,277). Members of the state task force said Maharashtra could continue to see the surge through April. “We saw in 2020 that cases surge for a few months before declining. Our silver lining so far has been the low fatality rate, both for Mumbai and Maharashtra. But we need to be mindful of rising deaths in absolute numbers,” said intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the Covid task force. Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death committee, said fatalities continue to be most common among the elderly and those with comorbidities, but there is a small percentage of young people who come to hospital late and succumb within 7-8 days. “The key here is to stay watchful even if one doesn’t have major symptoms so that any deterioration is treated promptly,” he said. The demand for private hospital beds kept growing in the city. A few major hospitals said they have a long waiting list of patients who want to be upgraded or shifted from smaller hospitals or government facilities. Dr Om Srivastava said it was stretching up to 80-90 in certain hospitals. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said there are enough beds in public hospitals, but the demand is for private beds. Dr Gautam Bhansali said over 100 private beds were added on Wednesday to push the private capacity to nearly 4,800. At the state level, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (9,941) added the highest cases while the Nagpur region recorded its maximum deaths (54). Palghar district’s tally crossed the 50,000 mark on Wednesday, even as it lifted the ban on weddings after April 15. Weddings can take place with 50 guests and police permission.

The official added, “The guest houses of the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam and other agencies are still closed. Thus, the visitors will not find accommodation or food facilities inside the park. In view of this, we are only giving permission to those tourists who are coming through registered trekking agencies at present. Other tourists and pilgrims can visit the park after the beginning of the Char Dham Yatra.” Established in 1989, the GNP is the third biggest national park of the country. It spans across 2,390 sq km. Meanwhile, the fresh Covid-19 SOP released by the state government has raised concerns for the trekking and mountaineering industry. Jayendra Rana, president of Garhwal Himalaya Trekking and Mountaineering Association, Uttarkashi, said, “After facing heavy financial losses in 2020, owners of trekking and mountaineering agencies were hoping for some recovery this year. But fresh cases of Covid-19 and the newly-released SOP have triggered panic among both tourists and tour operators.” He added, “Tourists coming from states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi have been asked to bring negative RT-PCR reports. This will demoralise them from coming to Uttarakhand and eventually affect the footfall.” In a similar vein, Manoj Rawat, secretary of Garhwal Himalaya Trekking and Mountaineering Association, Uttarkashi, said, “Trekking, mountaineering and other tourism-based activities are a major source of employment for most of us. Therefore, the government should take strong measures for the smooth flow of tourist activities while containing the spread of the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/gangotri-national-park-to-open-for-visitors-amidst-covid-19-threat/articleshow/81786264.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala

The BJP leaders stated that leaders who were present in the nomination ceremony were given space in the posters other than central party leaders and the state president. “Raje’s name in star campaigner list is most obvious being the senior leader from the state. I am sure she will not give any further space for any controversy and will soon roll out her campaign schedule,” said a senior BJP leader, who feels that her picture should have included in the main poster at least. Leaders close to Raje, says that it is a deliberate attempt to not highlight the former chief minister in polls.“The absence of pictures has happened at the behest of those who don’t see Raje as the tallest leader in the state,” said an MLA who is known as a trusted aide of Raje. Raje was quite expressive on social media chose not to share any content related to the nomination or the polls other than one tweet on March 26 congratulating all three candidates on her Twitter for being fielded by the party. Raje had chosen to campaign in limited seats in Lok Sabha polls and restricted her presence in seats that have her influence. In the nomination, most of the MPs and party functionaries have attended except Raje.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-names-raje-as-star-campaigner/articleshow/81792564.cms||---

Accused of raping and impregnating a minor girl at his village of Dattawali in Aligarh, Amit, it turned out, was not the father of the survivor’s child. In July 2018, Amit was home at Dattawali from Faridabad, where he had been working as a foreman for two years, to attend his elder brother’s wedding. After the wedding and the celebrations, he made his way back. But in February 2019, he was summoned again. His mother and sister-in-law had been detained. Amit rushed back and, soon, was arrested. “The survivors’s father and I had a dispute over a shared piece of farmland in 2017, after which we had cut off all ties,” Amit’s father Sajjan Singh said. Amit was charged with rape and under sections of the Pocso Act. Along with his elder brother Chandra Shekhar, he was charged with voluntarily causing hurt. With his younger brother Sunil and a distant relative Teekshan Pal, he was also booked for criminal intimidation and house trespass at the Barla police station. Chandrashekhar got bail, and Sunil and Teekshan’s names were removed from the chargesheet because there wasn’t enough evidence. Amit was taken to the Aligarh district jail. “I cannot explain how difficult it was. No one would believe me, even within prison,” he told TOI after being released. “You lose track of time inside. I would keep a count of days in my head. It took five attempts before the test could be done,” Amit said. “The first time was in March 2020. The survivor had not come that day. Only my samples and that of the child were taken.” But because three samples — his, hers and the child’s — were essential to the test, the first round of collection was scrapped. He was taken to the hospital three more times, but the survivor didn’t turn up. The fifth attempt was successful. Finally in July 2020, all samples were taken. The report came in March this year. The report said he was not the father of the child. “It is apparent that the (FIR) was lodged after considerable delay that too when pregnancy was detected and prosecutrix said the same to be result of rape committed by applicant but DNA report submitted in sealed envelope and opened before this Court reveals that applicant is not biological father of the fetus,” the bail order by Allahabad HC on March 19 said. “Considering all (the) facts and circumstances of the case, the nature of accusations, severity of the punishment in the case of conviction but without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, this Court is of the view that the applicant may be enlarged on bail with certain conditions.” Aligarh SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said police would seek legal opinion from the joint director of prosecution after going over the case diary. Amit’s counsel, Hariom Varshney, said, “My next step will be to apply for his discharge from all charges under which he was booked.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/in-jail-for-2-yrs-on-rape-charges-man-gets-bail-as-dna-test-proves-he-didnt-father-survivors-kid/articleshow/81784621.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Review IAS officer’s transfer to KTDFC’||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kochi bench of the central administrative tribunal (CAT) has ordered the chief secretary to review the transfer of senior IAS officer B Ashok from the cadre post of secretary to the government to a government company, the Kerala Transport Development Finance Corporation (KTDFC) as its chairman and managing director. In its order issued on a petition by Ashok, the CAT said the review should be conducted by May 12, 2021. Noting that the disposal of his representation against the allegedly irregular transfer against cadre rules and judgments of the Supreme Court, the tribunal asked the chief secretary to examine his submission against extant rules and regulations and pass speaking orders, failing which it will be taken up for adjudication. In his original application, Ashok had alleged that he was transferred 15 times in the last six years whereas the IAS cadre rules stipulate a two-year fixed minimum term in each post since its amendment in 2014. Not once had the procedure to transfer prematurely, including the mandatory recommendation by the state civil service board, been conducted, he said. He further contended that his latest transfer out of the post of secretary to the government was also against several extant judgments of the Supreme Court which mandate consent of the officer to be transferred out of cadre posts. Before the government moved him out as the managing director of SupplyCo, Ashok was serving as secretary (power and water resources). Presently, Ashok is also the president of Kerala IAS Officers Association. An analysis of the postings of senior IAS officers in the state cadre by TOI earlier had shown that the state government is facing an immense shortage of officers at the secretary rank and above. As of December last year, the state has at its disposal only 16 officers at the rank of principal secretary, who are holding 31 posts between them, of which at least 27 are cadre posts. There are only 18 officers of secretary rank holding 41 posts between them, of which at least 30 are cadre posts as per the cadre rules. Together, 34 officers are making good for 72 posts. On an average, every officer in the rank of principal secretary or secretary is holding two to three additional charges. The average tenure for the officers of the rank of secretary and above in a post has been only 11 months till 2018, while it has further dropped below 10 months in the period after that. Interestingly, such transfers of officers from the post are in complete violation of the rule as per amendments made in the IAS Cadre Rules, 1954, that was amended on January 28, 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/review-ias-officers-transfer-to-ktdfc/articleshow/81786352.cms||KP Saikiran

The gold was concealed in the same way as in the previous case booked. “Wireless portable Speaker & Karaoke” weighing 262 gram and another piece in cylindrical shape weighing 173 gram concealed in casted form of a head of “face massager” were recovered.” It took very long time to detach and recover the same from casted items with the help of electric cutter and other instruments by a government approved valuer,” added the official. On Wednesday evening, the passenger from Dubai was apprehended with 348 gram of gold valued at Rs 15.9 lakh which was yet again concealed in a radio. This was the third case in 24 hours.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka minister K S Eshwarappa says B S Yediyurappa ‘interfering’ in his ministry, writes to governor||BENGALURU: Alleging CM BS Yediyurappa’s “authoritarian interference” in his ministry, Karnataka rural development and panchayat raj minister K S Eshwarappa on Wednesday sought the intervention of the governor and party leadership for revocation of orders and restoration of “peace” in the administration. In a written complaint to governor Vajubhai Vala and BJP national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka Arun Singh, Eshwarappa accused Yediyurappa of direct interference in his ministry in violation of the Karnataka (Transaction of Business) Rules on division of power in the cabinet. A copy has been forwarded to PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief J P Nadda. The complaint brings to the fore resentment against Yediyurappa in the cabinet and growing discord against his style of functioning. Eshwarappa and Yediyurappa, both from Shivamogga in Karnataka, have had a love-hate relationship. Eshwarappa has been particularly critical after Yediyurappa became chief minister for the first time in 2008. Eshwarappa, however, said: “It is an internal matter. I am not unhappy with the CM and there is no question of resentment (against him). There is no need to attach political significance to a meeting I had with the governor to discuss issues related to my department.” In the letter, Eshwarappa accused Yediyurappa of a “unilateral style of administration” and alleged he violated multiple rules and procedures on more than one occasion in sanctioning department funds. He claimed the CM bypassed him while making allocations worth Rs 780 crore set aside in the 2020-21 state budget for developing 20,000km of rural roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mantri-says-bsy-interfering-in-his-ministry-writes-to-governor/articleshow/81801338.cms||---

Among those found Covid-19 positive on the day was Rashmi Rawat, wife of chief minister (CM) Tirath Singh Rawat. The CM’s wife was tested for Covid-19 after she complained of dry coughs. NS Bisht, physician to the CM, said, “CM’s wife has been put under home isolation. She is doing fine. Meanwhile, the CM, who tested positive for Covid-19 on March 22, is also recovering quite well.” Among the new cases on Wednesday, the maximum of 171 new cases were recorded in Dehradun, followed by 70 in Haridwar, 21 in Nainital, 16 in Udham Singh Nagar, seven in Pauri, two each in Chamoli, Tehri and Pithoragarh, and one each in Uttarkashi and Bageshwar districts. “On Wednesday, four more coronavirus-related deaths pushed the toll of the virus to 1,717 in the state. The state also recorded 118 people recovering from Covid-19 infection. The cumulative tally of cured cases now stands at 95,330,” said Abhishek Tripathi, officer of Covid-19 control room. Meanwhile, the health department has said that it will now focus on increasing Covid-19 testing at state borders and within the districts. Talking to TOI, secretary (health) Amit Negi said that all the districts have been asked to strictly follow the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and accordingly, increase testing at hospitals and on borders. “The cases are on a rise once again and thus, we are ensuring strict compliance of the ICMR guidelines. The Uttarakhand government has already issued a directive advising the people coming here from 12 Covid-sensitive states to carry negative RT-PCR reports. Also, district officials have been asked to increase testing,” said Negi. He added that health department staffers and doctors have been asked to be ready for Covid-19 duty and the officials of the hospitals dedicated for coronavirus patients have been asked to ensure that the maximum number of beds are available for infected patients. Dr Rajeev Dixit, district surveillance officer (Dehradun), said that random testing has been increased on border check posts like Asharodi and Raipur. “People coming from various states are also being randomly tested at railway stations and airports,” he added. Dr Bhagirathi Joshi, chief medical officer (CMO), Nainital, said that the district was already testing people at borders but random testing has now started at railway stations as well. On the other hand, the health watchers in Uttarakhand feel that the focus should be on RT-PCR tests. “I strongly urge the health department in Uttarakhand to make all efforts to conduct more and more RT-PCR tests across the state. Even the ICMR and the Union ministry of home affairs stress on conducting RT-PCR tests. We hope that steps are taken in this direction,” said Anoop Nautiyal from Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 pandemic in the Himalayan state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-cm-rawat-his-wife-tests-positive-for-covid-19-in-ukhand/articleshow/81786355.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘It wasn’t time for her to go, she went too early’||AHMEDABAD: Two weeks ago, Shweta Mehta Sahu, a 35-year-old accounts officer with the state agriculture department, developed a slight sore throat. Shweta and her husband Tapas — who is a pilot with the Indian Air Force — decided to stop drinking chilled water. In fact, the husband got a matka (earthen pot) for the summer. Sore throats disappeared and the couple went back to their routine lives filled with the hope of welcoming a child in their lives soon. Shweta and Tapas had been married for five years and she was pregnant with their first child. Last week on Monday, Shweta got diarrhoea. After three to four loose motions, the couple called their doctor at the Army Hospital. Shweta was called to the hospital to ensure she was not dehydrated. She was scanned for Covid-19 as routine protocol and she tested positive. From there, the couple’s life plunged into a downward spiral. “Shweta was hospitalized on March 23 and the next day she developed breathing problems,” says Tapas, the bereaved husband reeling from the shock of losing his wife who succumbed to Covid-19 this week. “Her condition worsened and the next day she was put on the ventilator,” says Tapas. “Once she went on the ventilator, she never came back. We shifted her to SVP Hospital where doctors diagnosed that she had developed complications of the GI tract and her heart too had collapsed,” Tapas adds. Hanging by the thread of hope, it was decided to remove the child which may have been putting pressure on her already compromised body. The child was delivered. “My daughter lived for only two hours. My wife did not get to see her or hold her,” says an emotional Tapas. After burying his daughter, the next day on March 29, the husband lost his wife and the love of his life. Shweta had been killed by corona. “She was too young to go…Shweta was different. She loved life, people and wanted to work for the world,” says the husband who is still grappling with the loss of his wife and daughter. “Nothing about her was selfish, she was a kind, pure woman. I was lucky she was my wife. But she went too early,” he says. Pandemic has caused death all around. Sometimes, the pain never dies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/it-wasnt-time-for-her-to-go-she-went-too-early/articleshow/81789387.cms||Radha Sharma

The government has agreed to give counter guarantee to the water resources department to secure a loan to the tune of Rs 2,746 crore for launching work under the drought mitigation scheme. The project is expected to bring potable drinking water to over 200 villages in seven assembly constituencies of Palnadu region. The project will be part of Godavari-Krishna-Penna river linking scheme. With water availability in Krishna river basin projects--Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar--getting dwindled by each passing year, the state government has decided to give big push to the Godavari-Krishna river linking scheme to mitigate drought conditions in Palnadu region. Majority of the villages in Macherla, Gurazala, Sattenapalle, Narasaraopet, Chilakaluripet and Vinukonda assembly segments are struggling to get potable water despite Nagarjuna Sagar Right Canal (NSRC) due to shortage of water in the main projects. The water resources department has readied a Detailed Project Report to divert Godavari water to Krishna near Prakasam barrage and lift water from the upstream of barrage at Vaikuntapuram village near temple town of Amaravati in Guntur district. Then, water would be taken to Nagarjuna Sagar Right Canal (NSRC) near Sattenapalle village to pump into the existing canals. Pattiseema lift irrigation scheme would be utilized to bring Godavari water to Krishna till the completion of the Polavaram project. “Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is realizing our decades-long dreams of getting clean drinking water to our region through YSR Palnadu drought mitigation scheme. The government’s decision to give counter guarantee will put the works on fast track,” said Gurazala legislator Kasu Mahesh Reddy. Irrigation secretary J Syamala Rao said that AP Water Resources Development Corporation (APWRDC) will execute electro mechanical and transmission works (Sub stations and Lines) and associated civil works of YSR Palnadu drought mitigation project with a cost of Rs 2,746 crore. Interestingly, the Rural Electrification Corporation of India (REC) has consented to grant soft loan to the APWRDC to take up drought mitigation projects in the state. It, however, wanted that the loan shall be guaranteed fully, unconditionally and irrevocably by the guarantee of the state government. “The guarantee shall specifically cover repayment of loan including interest and other costs. The enforceability of the same shall be ensured in line with FRBM Limit. The government guarantee shall be provided before first disbursement of the loan,” said REC in a communication to the WRDC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/state-govt-puts-palnadu-drought-mitigation-project-on-fast-track/articleshow/81821413.cms||Samdani MN

The move came on a day when GMC dean Dr Aruna Kumar was replaced by Dr Jitendra Shukla. Hospital services in the state capital’s largest tertiary care hospital could come to a standstill. Talks between government and the doctors are set to continue on Thursday. Doctors from two main departments – medicine and orthopaedics were upset after orders of the transfer of two professors was issued.

Dr KK Kavre, HoD medicine department has been undergoing treatment for a serious medical condition has also been transferred. Dr Gaur has been transferred to Shahdol and Dr Kavre to Chhindwara. “As per GAD rules, if a person is set to reach superannuation within a year, the employee cannot be transferred out of hometown. The rule has not been followed in the transfer of two senior doctors,” said CMTA-MP secretary, Dr Rakesh Malviya. “More talks with the government are likely on Thursday,” he said. According to sources, more than 250 medical teachers and 300 junior doctors have indicated to join the stir. En masse resignation of some doctors was declined by the government on Wednesday. According to sources, controversy began after a video conferencing with doctors of GMC and top state government health officials three days ago. Unconfirmed reports indicate that GMC doctors were in favour of continuing with non-Covid services and the government officials proposed increasing number of Covid-19 beds. Some doctors insisted that only very critical Covid-19 patients should be referred to the hospital.

No one from the opposition BJP was invited and the party expressed its annoyance with the MVA government. Leader of the opposition in the legislative council Pravin Darekar called the lack of an invitation to the opposition unfortunate. “The Maha Vikas Aghadi has not even invited former CM Devendra Fadnavis, who had helped the trust get land transferred for the memorial,” he said. He said to exclude Fadnavis, who is today leader of the opposition in the assembly, showed a petty mindset. Darekar said the government did not even send an invitation to MNS chief Raj Thackeray, nephew of the late Balasaheb Thackeray. The state government pointed to the Covid-19 crisis for the low-key bhoomi pujan. Before the programme, Shiv Sena minister Anil Parab said no invitation was printed for the event. BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said it would require a big heart to acknowledge that Fadnavis had ensured all formalities were completed and clearances obtained for the memorial. “Not everyone has a big heart ... but it is rather surprising that the government did not wait for its founder, Sharad Pawar, who is currently hospitalised. They could have held the programme a few days later after he had recovered. What was the hurry?” he said. The cabinet chaired by Uddhav Thackeray has approved Rs 400 crore for the project. The MMRDA is the implementing authority for it.

According to the District Health Office, 2.6 lakh beneficiaries have so far received at least dose across Pune rural — the number includes over one lakh elderly who have received their first doses. Ayush Prasad, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Pune ZP, said, “We have done exceptionally well in the vaccination of healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs). Coverage is 100% in these categories. We also brought on board many who had not registered for the drive early on.” Prasad said the creation of more sites helped officials reach out to more beneficiaries. “We included primary health centres (PHCs), sub-district and rural hospitals. We increased the number of sites in Pune rural to 150 and are now planning to add at least 300 more by using sub-centres. A proposal has been sent to the state government,” Prasad said, adding that if the plan is approved, daily vaccinations can cross 50,000 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rural-parts-record-impressive-coverage/articleshow/81789430.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The culprits then robbed their belongings, including Rs 10,000 cash and earrings. An FIR was registered by police on Tuesday after the woman lodged a complaint. One of the three suspects has been arrested. According to the FIR, the woman and her husband were on their way to her parents' house on their motorcycle when three men waylaid them and forcibly took them to a nearby jungle where they gang-raped the woman. Two accused have been identified as Gauri Rajput and Monu. All three accused have been booked under sections 376-D (gang-rape), 506 (criminal intimidation), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), under section 66-E of the Information technology Act (punishment for violation of privacy) at Etmadpur police station. In a video message, inspector general of police (Agra range) Naveen Arora said a serious incident was reported by a woman. Police teams have taken the help of forensic experts and a dog squad has been called. Strict action will be taken against the accused, Arora said. Local police said the incident took place near the Jharna channel. The “rape survivor” called the helpline number 112 after reaching their house around 10 pm. Initially, the couple informed the police about the robbery but did not mention about the gangrape, claimed police. The victim was told to report the incident at Chalesar Chowki as the alleged crime took place under its jurisdiction. Talking to TOI, SSP Muniraj G said the woman’s statement has been recorded under CrPC provisions. “No conclusive evidence was found in the external examination report, but the microscopic report is still awaited,” he said, adding that further investigation is on. “Three teams have been formed to nab the two absconding accused. Gauri Shankar, 27, who was arrested, has been remanded in judicial custody,” said the SSP. Meanwhile, local women staged a protest at Nunihai Chowk on Wednesday demanding justice for the victim.

The government has agreed to give counter guarantee to the water resources department to secure a loan to the tune of Rs 2,746 crore for launching work under the drought mitigation scheme. The project is expected to bring potable drinking water to over 200 villages in seven assembly constituencies of Palnadu region. The project will be part of Godavari-Krishna-Penna river linking scheme. With water availability in Krishna river basin projects--Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar--getting dwindled by each passing year, the state government has decided to give big push to the Godavari-Krishna river linking scheme to mitigate drought conditions in Palnadu region. Majority of the villages in Macherla, Gurazala, Sattenapalle, Narasaraopet, Chilakaluripet and Vinukonda assembly segments are struggling to get potable water despite Nagarjuna Sagar Right Canal (NSRC) due to shortage of water in the main projects. The water resources department has readied a Detailed Project Report to divert Godavari water to Krishna near Prakasam barrage and lift water from the upstream of barrage at Vaikuntapuram village near temple town of Amaravati in Guntur district. Then, water would be taken to Nagarjuna Sagar Right Canal (NSRC) near Sattenapalle village to pump into the existing canals. Pattiseema lift irrigation scheme would be utilized to bring Godavari water to Krishna till the completion of the Polavaram project. “Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is realizing our decades-long dreams of getting clean drinking water to our region through YSR Palnadu drought mitigation scheme. The government’s decision to give counter guarantee will put the works on fast track,” said Gurazala legislator Kasu Mahesh Reddy. Irrigation secretary J Syamala Rao said that AP Water Resources Development Corporation (APWRDC) will execute electro mechanical and transmission works (Sub stations and Lines) and associated civil works of YSR Palnadu drought mitigation project with a cost of Rs 2,746 crore. Interestingly, the Rural Electrification Corporation of India (REC) has consented to grant soft loan to the APWRDC to take up drought mitigation projects in the state. It, however, wanted that the loan shall be guaranteed fully, unconditionally and irrevocably by the guarantee of the state government. “The guarantee shall specifically cover repayment of loan including interest and other costs. The enforceability of the same shall be ensured in line with FRBM Limit. The government guarantee shall be provided before first disbursement of the loan,” said REC in a communication to the WRDC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-govt-puts-palnadu-drought-mitigation-project-on-fast-track/articleshow/81786061.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vijayawada||Chief minister releases Rs 254 crore YSR Bima for over 12000 families||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday released Rs 254.72 crore under YSR Bima to families of 12,039 deceased, who were eligible but were not covered and not registered under the scheme. The chief minister said the state government did not back out from providing financial assistance to families who have lost their breadwinner. The chief minister explained that there are about 1.4 crore ration card holders across AP, and the government started YSR Bima in October 2020 by paying a premium of Rs 510 crore to banks. “The state government continues the scheme despite Centre’s withdrawal,” he said. After Centre’s withdrawal, entire premium was paid by the state on humanitarian grounds to provide security for families in need. However, the Centre has put more clauses, closing the existing group insurance system and made a bank account mandatory for every person in the family. The Centre had put another clause of a 45-day cool-off period from day of account opening, where if someone dies within 45 days, the insurance will not be paid. The chief minister said that 62 lakh accounts were opened so far and the remaining 70 lakh accounts are yet to be opened. He added that any eligible person who was left out of YSR Bima can call toll free number — 155214 — to get registered and assured that the government will take steps to ensure that they get benefits. Under the scheme, insurance amount for accidental death and total permanent disability for people aged between 18 and 50 years is Rs 5 lakh and for those between 51and 70 years, Rs 3 lakh. Similarly, for natural death cases (18 to 50 years) Rs 2 lakh and for partial, permanent disability in an accident case (18 to 70 years), Rs 1.5 lakh assistance will be provided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-releases-rs-254-cr-ysr-bima-for-over-12k-families/articleshow/81786331.cms||Gopi Dara

For those who make short-travel plans for work or personal reasons, there is a breather. The RT-PCR report which outbound travellers from Gujarat got done for travel to states like Rajasthan, Maharashtra will be valid for 72 hours. This effectively means that the report can be used to enter Gujarat without getting a fresh report done if the individual is returning back to the state within the validity period of 72 hours. “For people travelling to states which have mandated a RT-PCR negative report and coming back the next day or within the validity period of 72-hours, the same report will be sustainable,” said Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary of the state health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rt-pcr-report-valid-for-72-hrs/articleshow/81789840.cms||---

The thick undergrowth and trees were burnt in the fire. The fire also destroyed some private plantations close to the forest, said forest officers. The forest officers were unable to douse the fire since it occurred in remote forest areas. Reaching the hilltops and interior areas was a difficult task. The strong heat wave compounded the problem. In areas like Palakkayam hills, the fire could not be doused and is still continuing, local residents said. Environmentalists allege that in many interior forest areas, fire lines to prevent the fire were not constructed in time this summer season. There were no proper systems to douse forest fire near human habitations too, they alleged. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fire-guts-1000-acre-of-forest-in-thenmala/articleshow/81786376.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Activists head to Dandi ‘for farmers’||Mumbai: A group of activists left for Dandi in Gujarat on March 30 to participate in the ‘Mitti Satyagraha Yatra’ that commenced from Dandi on March 31. This yatra is in solidarity with groups of farmers protesting the new farm laws. The Mitti Satyagraha Yatra is a national collective effort of various citizens’ organisations that have coined the slogan ‘Ek mutthi de do mitti/Kisan mazdoor janshakti (Give a fist of soil/Farmers, workers are people’s power)’. Drawing inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi’s 390km march in 1930 to Dandi to break the colonial salt law, the activists on Wednesday visited Sabarmati Ashram, from where the walk began. Having collected “mitti” (soil) from Dandi, the activists will move to Punjab, Haryana and Delhi’s borders. “Activists are bringing mitti from different parts of the country and it will be used to build memorials at their agitation sites on Delhi borders for the farmers who died during the agitation,” said Feroze Mithiborewala, an activist. “Our yatra is committed to the demands of the farmers and our andolan will continue till the three farm laws are repealed. During the yatra, we explain the details of the bills as well as the MSP, to the farmers and the people that we meet,” said Dr Sunilam, another activist. Gandhi’s march which lasted 24 days ended on April 6, 1930, as he picked up a handful of salt from the seashore bordering Dandi. “Today, a fistful of soil symbolises the very same strength, the very same values of peaceful resistance to secure our rights,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-activists-head-to-dandi-for-farmers/articleshow/81785145.cms||---

The committee, headed by retired judge B Seshasayana Reddy, said they inspected steps taken by the authorities in 203 acres of land at Moola Lanka which is being used as a dump yard for mud being dug from the project site. The panel members also asked for details of those who are yet to get relief and also sought reasons for the delay in making payments to them. They also inquired from forest officials whether there is a proposal to develop a plantation at the dump yard to minimise its impact on the environment. Expressing his disappointment that there is no plantation and greenery in the area, Justice Reddy said the NGT had made it clear that there should be no inconvenience for tribal habitats and BC colonies due to dumping yard in the area. People from displaced villages Patha Pydipaka, Kondrokotaa and Tallavaram submitted their petitions to the committee. Economist Pentapati Pulla Rao’s advocate K Sravan Kumar also submitted a 160-page petition to the NGT panel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ngt-panel-holds-public-meet-on-polavaram/articleshow/81786282.cms||Samson Raj

---||Pune||Positive test 102 days after 1st Covid bout is likely reinfection, says study||Pune: It can be a case of SARS-COV-2 reinfection if a recovered person tests positive for Covid again — either via RT-PCR or antigen test — after an interval of 102 days and with one negative molecular assay in between, a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research has said. The research has been accepted for publication in the journal, Epidemiology and Infection. Dr Samiran Panda, head of ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, said, “Genome sequencing has been an investigative criterion to confirm reinfection. But genomic evidence is resource intensive and not always feasible. Our objective then was to develop a comprehensive, working epidemiological definition of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection.” The study used data of suspected reinfection cases from several countries, including India. “A key takeaway is that people who’ve recovered from Covid need not take repeated RT-PCR tests to check if they have been reinfected. This is because there is a possibility of a swab test returning a positive result after detecting non-viable remnants of the virus, even when the infection has cleared from the system,” Dr Panda said. Non-viable virus remnants are dead particles that can no longer infect or transmit the illness. “Detection of these particles is not reinfection. However, if one tests Covid-positive again, 102 days after the first Covid episode, it can be considered as a new infection, provided there was a negative molecular test in the interim,” Dr Panda said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/positive-test-102-days-after-1st-covid-bout-is-likely-reinfection-says-study/articleshow/81789475.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Vijayawada||Overwhelming majority in ganja trade under 35||VIJAYAWADA: Police have witnessed a spike in the number of youngsters involved in ganja smuggling, sale and consumption in the last year across Krishna district. According to officials, of the 167 accused arrested under the NDPS Act, 107 are under 35. Krishna district police data reveal that as many as 53 cases have been registered from January 2020 till March 2021. Officials also point out that they have seized 780 kilograms of ganja during this period and noted that there were a significant number of ganja peddlers who were even below the age of 18. With the police conducting a state-wide anti-drug campaign, Krishna district cops announced that they have set up a special police control room and a WhatsApp number to tackle the drug menace. On November 22, 55 students were sent to Vijayawada Government General Hospital (GGH) for rehabilitation. Police sources said that the students are being lured by dealers on a referral basis. Officials point out that there are even kingpins who are as young as 25 years in the district, who have been lured by other dealers in the business. Interestingly, Krishna district did not see a noticeable decrease in ganja smuggling in 2020. Police said that compared to 2019, there was a marginal 6% decrease in cases and attributed the increase in enforcement to not just smuggling but also a substantial number of arrests in peddling cases. Officials also admitted that smuggling in the city is much higher when compared to the number of cases registered. According to data from the City Crime Records Bureau (CCRB), in 2005, Vijayawada police commissionerate limits saw just five cases of ganja smuggling. However, this number has risen substantially over time. In 2016, 32 cases were registered, while in 2017, the number witnessed a jump to 91. In 2018, a whopping 995 kilos of ganja were seized and 19 persons were arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/overwhelming-majority-in-ganja-trade-under-35/articleshow/81785850.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Rajkot||Rajkot: 112 investors lose Rs 5 crore to fraudsters||RAJKOT: In yet another fraud of gullible people being cheated with lucrative high-interest schemes, scamsters siphoned off around Rs 4.73 crore of nearly 112 people by floating three firms including a credit co-operative society in Rajkot. University police station sources said that most of the victims were daily wagers who lost their precious savings after investing in various schemes floated by the accused. Rajesh Vaghela, a resident of Parsananagar, who works in a showroom as well as a sweeper in the local civic body, lodged a complaint against Pradeep Davera, Divyesh Kalawadia and Hitesh Lukka after losing Rs four lakh. Pradeep Davera is a chairman of the Ashish Credit Cooperative Society and two other firms — Samay Trading and Sai Samay Trading. “The accused had floated various schemes like daily savings, monthly savings and yearly savings and lured small-time investors with the promise of high interest. They also promised 10% monthly return on investment in the share market. Most of the victims did not have any idea about the stock market. They were only attracted by the high returns on their investment,” said a police official. Vaghela had invested Rs five lakh in Samay Trading firm, an entity dealing in stock market, in 2018 and was promised monthly 10% return. However, when he started asking for returns, the accused told him that he would be given a consolidated amount after every three months. Later, the accused stopped responding to Vaghela’s phone calls and queries. When Vaghela demanded total repayment of his investment, he was given only Rs one lakh. “The complainant was in need of money and demanded all his money back. Since he did not receive it he finally approached police,” said an official. They were booked under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code including cheating and criminal conspiracy. This was the second such complaint in the last 10 days in Rajkot city where gullible investors were lured with the promise of high interest rates and big returns on their investment. Earlier, on March 25 the chairman and vice chairman of Parishram Credit Society, located on Nirmala Road in Rajkot, were booked for allegedly siphoning off around Rs one crore of investors’ money. The accused are still out of police reach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/112-investors-lose-rs-5cr-to-fraudsters/articleshow/81784782.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC questions ex-CP’s plea to probe Anil Deshmukh without FIR||MUMBAI: Following a marathon hearing, the Bombay high court on Wednesday reserved its orders on a public interest litigation filed by former city police chief Param Bir Singh seeking a CBI probe into his allegations of “corrupt malpractices” against state home minister Anil Deshmukh after the state objected to its maintainability. The HC itself questioned Singh’s plea for a probe by the CBI without a first information report (FIR) being filed. State advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni sought dismissal of the PIL, with exemplary cost. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni questioned the maintainability of Singh’s petition as a PIL, in the absence of an FIR, and said that as a police officer, Singh would know the CrPC well and would be “failing in his duty” if he didn’t file an FIR. “Simply writing letters to the CM won’t do…If any citizen finds an offence being committed, he is duty-bound to file an FIR. You are a police officer. If you find an offence has been committed, you are duty-bound to file an FIR. Why did you not do it?” asked the CJ. Singh, in an 8-page letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, had alleged Deshmukh had met subordinate police officers, including suspended API Sachin Waze, and asked for collection of Rs 100 crore. Deshmukh has denied the allegations. “What have you done for registration of FIR?...Did you approach state police?” the CJ asked, repeatedly stressing how, without an FIR, the criminal law cannot be set in motion. The bench asked senior counsel Vikram Nankani, appearing for Singh, to first satisfy HC on maintainability of the PIL and whether the court can direct investigation without an FIR in order to get interim relief. The interim relief sought is ‘safe custody’ of CCTV footage from outside Deshmukh’s residence. Nankani read out Singh’s letter and referred to the report by Rashmi Shukla, former commissioner (intelligence) to the Director General of Police to submit the issue is “related to interference by political masters.” He said Singh was not challenging his transfer order of March 17. The CJ also observed there was “no affidavit’’ either by any police officer to say the alleged demand was made in his presence. The bench asked Singh’s counsel if the ex-top cop had any first-hand information himself. Kumbhakoni said the plea was based on “hearsay” and contended that Singh came to court without clean hands and heart. He cited a judgment that warrants no relief to such petitioners. He also said that after Shukla’s report of August 2020 on a corruption racket in police transfers, the state had in September 2020 closed the file. Kumbhakoni said the ex-police chief had not revealed his “enmity” with the home minister. He also called Singh a “disgruntled” litigant and said his PIL was “motivated by personal vendetta”. Nankani said the issue raised is larger and of grave importance and if state has done nothing yet, HC is not powerless and can even convert a letter into a PIL. In his rejoinder to the AG, he said the state having appointed an inquiry panel headed by former HC judge K U Chandiwal shows the state too thinks it is a serious issue. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, for CBI, said it was willing to probe Singh’s allegations but left it for HC to decide in what form or by which agency. The CJ said, “Are police officers, ministers, politicians all above the law?” The bench said, “Do not view yourself so high, the law is above you.” In 1977 Lord Denning had immortalized Thomas Fuller’s words of over 300 years ago, “Be ye never so high, the law is above you.” The bench said if police commit a crime in presence of another police officer, what would it (police) do? Would it not register an FIR? Nankani, who appeared along with counsel Birendra Saraf and Sharan Jagtiani, cited judgments but HC asked him to cite one which says without an FIR, the HC can direct a probe. Nankani cited the landmark 2014 SC judgment in Lalita Kumari’s case which empowers police to even conduct a preliminary enquiry to ascertain if a cognizable offence is made out. The bench also said, “It is only in extremely rare cases that court can order an FIR to be registered.” It said HC cannot be reduced to a magistrate’s court which can direct police to register an FIR if police fail to do so. Subhash Jha, counsel for another PIL petitioner, advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay, who is also seeking a probe based on Singh’s letter, said the issue merited a probe against those running an “extortion racket”, which was akin to “loot and plunder”. The HC also heard submissions in another PIL filed by chartered accountant Mohan Bhide of Bhide Education Pvt ltd. His PIL, citing Singh’s letter, sought a CBI probe. Another city advocate, Jaishri Patil, the first to file a petition, not a PIL, on March 23, for a CBI or independent agency probe against Deshmukh and the role of Singh based on his letter, had also sought directions to Malabar police to register an FIR on her complaint made on March 21. Her complaint was based on Singh’s letter. Another bench had on Tuesday questioned her “locus” but recorded AG’s submission to seek clubbing of all related petitions with Singh’s PIL. She mentioned before HC on Wednesday that her complaint was pending. The CJ-led bench observed that earlier, it was not often that FIRs were “not registered”. Before 4pm, as the hearing continued, the HC called immediately for the station diary from Malabar Hill police station to know the status and action taken by them on her complaint. The bench asked the AG if any FIR was registered based on Patil’s complaint. The AG said none had been. He relied on the landmark SC ruling of 2013 to submit that police may take a while to ascertain existence of a cognizable offence by conducting a preliminary probe. The AG later said the inward register had an entry but not Patil’s name in the station diary. Nankani said lack of entry in station diary proves Singh’s point of the state not likely to take action. “This is a great example of state sweeping things under the carpet.” To HC’s queries on FIR, he said, “It would be Ceasar to Ceasar because police come under the home department.” The HC said even if complaints are made against ministers or CMs, CrPC provisions cannot be set aside. “Tomorrow if a PM or HM is involved, who will investigate…would you want a super power from outside to investigate,” the CJ wondered. Nankani said in such a case, there can be court-monitored probes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-questions-ex-cps-plea-to-probe-deshmukh-without-fir/articleshow/81795933.cms||---

He said that the price of buffalo milk has witnessed an increase from Rs 45 per kg to Rs 48 per kg from February till now. Similarly, the rates of cow milk have been increased from Rs 28 per kg to Rs 30 per kg. “In the testing times of Covid-19, keeping in view the economic downturn as well as the interests of milk producers, the price of milk being provided to them has been increased six times,” said Randhawa. The minister promised that the milk producers would continue to get good prices in future also to make dairy a profitable venture leading to the benefit of 2.5 lakh milk producers associated with Milkfed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/6th-price-hike-in-2-months-for-milk-producers-min/articleshow/81789522.cms||---

The cumulative case load has reached 3.07 lakh. There has also been a steady increase in the number of active cases with 4,665 such patients recorded on Wednesday. In the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits, cases are inching towards 200-mark, standing at 184 currently. The state positivity rate is 1.09%, which indicates that the rate of infection from one person to another is worrisome. At any given time, a positivity rate below 1% is ideal indicating a low threat of rapid infection. Experts say that people should be more concerned about the second wave as compared to the first. They say the second wave is coming at a time when public spaces are open unlike the first wave when people were cautious after a lockdown. “Since the second wave is happening after opening up of more spaces, there is a possibility that it can hit us hard. Not many people understand this and have kept their guard down, which will only worsen the situation,” said Dr Kiran Madala, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) certified researcher. Cases emerging in clusters is another cause of worry. Several cases are being reported from large public gatherings. With cases continuing to soar even in the city, certain areas have become worrisome. Kukatpally, for instance, is seeing more people testing positive.  Experts say that people in Hyderabad need to be more careful as the city has dense population and that there is every possibility of cases seeing a sharp spike. A possible second wave as seen in some other states is on the cards here too. Looking at the increasing number of cases, a Covid-19 ward is being readied in Gandhi Hospital, another 300 beds will be ready in King Koti hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-5-months-covid-cases-cross-600-mark-in-t/articleshow/81789556.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Out of seven trials taking place in the city, five are at St Theresa’s. Dr P Venkatesh sub-investigator, St Theresa’s Hospital, said, “We are doing SARS-COV-2 vaccine trials for Bharat Biotech — both dermal and nasal — Bilogical E and Zydus. Another trial is in the discussion stage.” Trials for the Covid-19 vaccine are also taking place at AIG Hospitals, NIMS, Apollo and Malla Reddy Narayana Multispeciality Hospital in the state. BBV152D is a whole-virion, inactivated vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech. In phase 1 and phase 2, intradermal vaccine was given to evaluate the safety, side effects, and resistance of the vaccine administered between the layers of the skin (intradermal) in healthy volunteers for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Apart from St Theresa Hospitals, AIG Hospitals, Gachibowli, also took part in the study. As per documents of Clinical Trials Registry, Biological E’s novel Covid-19 vaccine for protection against Covid-19 disease is also on at St Theresa’s. In Vizag, trials are on at King George Hospital. Kurnool Medical College, Government General Hospital, Vedanta Hospital in AP are also sites of clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine. Incidentally, Russian-made Sputnik vaccine trials are also on in the city. This is a multi-centre, phase 2 and phase 3 adaptive clinical trial to assess safety and immunogenicity of Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik). The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) had earlier granted permission to Bharat Biotech International Limited, Hyderabad, to manufacture Covaxin vaccine for restricted use in emergency in public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode. CDSCO granted permission to Serum Institute of India to also manufacture Covishield vaccine for restricted use in emergency situation. The two vaccines are being administered currently. Biological E’s vaccine will be the next vaccine that is likely to come into the market. Zydus vaccine is likely to hit market in May-June the company had earlier said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-hospitals-turn-vaccine-trial-centres-st-theresas-takes-lead/articleshow/81789618.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Court discharges three cops in Ishrat Jahan encounter||AHMEDABAD: A special CBI court on Wednesday discharged three accused cops — IGP G L Singhal, retired DySP Tarun Barot and assistant sub-inspector Anaju Chaudhary — from the 2004 Ishrat Jahan encounter case with the conclusion that the police action was in the line of duty. The court discharged these cops after the Gujarat government refused the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) permission to prosecute these cops under Section 197 of the CrPC. The state government said that with this, the controversial case has practically come to an end with Ishrat’s mother, Shamima Kauser, expressing before the court her disinclination to pursue the case in 2019, and the other litigant, Gopinath Pillai, the father of another deceased, Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, passed away a couple of years ago. All the police officers in this case now stand discharged, with IPS officers P P Pandey, D G Vanzara and N K Amin having been discharged earlier. One of the accused, then police inspector J G Parmar, died while the case was pending. The 17-year litigation began after a team of crime branch shot and killed four persons — Ishrat Jahan, Javed Shaikh, Jishan Zohar and Amjad Ali Rana — near the Kotarpur waterworks early on June 15, 2004. After the shootout, the cops dubbed them Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives who were out to kill the then chief minister Narendra Modi to avenge the 2002 riots against the Muslims. Ishrat’s mother moved the Gujarat high court within a couple of months for a CBI investigation. The CBI would later say that the encounter was fake. Special judge V R Raval observed in his order that the CBI sought prosecution sanction from the state government for Gujarat police officers and from the Union home ministry to prosecute four officials of the Subsidiary Intelligence Unit who were charged earlier. This shows that CBI also “accepts” that the act was committed by the cops while discharging their official duty. The court relied on the state government’s letters refusing prosecution sanction to state how the terror links of Ishrat and three others could not be ruled out. It said, “There is nothing on record even prima facie to suggest that the victims were not terrorists, the IB inputs were not genuine.” In concluding that Ishrat too had a terror link, the court relied on an affidavit filed by the central government insisting that the intelligence input about the movements of the four were concrete and genuine. Besides, David Headley’s revelation during interrogation by the FBI was also relied upon, according to which Ishrat was also an LeT operative and a suicide bomber. The court rejected the CBI’s objection to discharging the accused on the basis of refusal of prosecution sanction. The court said the CBI did not have “anything specific against the sanction order which also leads to believe the act of applicants/accused was in discharge of official duties”. Accepting the contention of the state government and the accused cops, the court said, “It is established that information received by Gujarat Police was based on sound, solid and correct information.” This observation was against the CBI’s contention that the cops built a false case after illegally detaining the accused and shooting them at Kotarpur when all four were blindfolded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-discharges-three-cops-in-ishrat-jahan-encounter/articleshow/81789932.cms||---
---||Kochi||‘Rule curve violated at major dams’||Idukki: No rule curve was followed at major dams in the state, including Idukki, during the 2018 August floods, said a study report by Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. If the rule curve was followed, the dams would have been able to hold the entire volume of water, the report added. The study report was prepared as per directions from the comptroller and auditor general (CAG). According to sources, the report stated, “The rule curves for Idukki dam were prepared in 1983. The simulations prepared by IISc as per the rule curves, checked whether the spills would have been lower than the actual spills during the flood period at Idukki reservoir, if those rule curves were followed starting with the storage at the end of June, as specified in the rule curves. The simulations showed that no rule curve was followed for reservoir operations during the flood period. New rule curves have been developed in 2019 after the August 2018 floods and updated in 2020. For major reservoirs of Idukki and Edamalayar, specific rule curves must be followed for operations, especially during the flood season.” “For no spills to occur from the Idukki reservoir during the flood period, the reservoir would have had to be prepared to hold back the entire volume of inflows. This, in turn, would require reliable forecasts,” the report added. The report also pointed out that there was negligence in operations of Mullaperiyar dam during the flood period. According to sources, the contribution from Mullaperiyar dam to the inflows at Idukki dam during August 14-18, 2018, was 2.58%, 27.93%, 36.92%, 30.32% and 35.95%, respectively. Mullapperiyar dam had a negligible flow on August 14, but its contribution to the inflows at Idukki reservoir was significant at over 25% during August 15-18, said the report. KSEB chief engineer (dam safety and DRIP) Supriya S said, “Earlier, big dams were constructed for irrigation and power-generation purposes. The state had never faced a flood situation before August 2018. But after the August 2018 floods, the central water commission (CWC) fixed the rule curve for major dams and made it mandatory.” “The new rule curve is set by CWC in consideration of the likely changes in monsoon and the rainfall pattern. The water level should not be allowed above the rule-curve level and the option of reducing the water level remained open. KSEB is strictly following rule curves after the 2018 August flood,” she added. The August 2018 floods caused large-scale damage to life and property in the state. There was a controversy that the opening of the dams, allegedly without taking proper measures, resulted in the massive flooding. Meanwhile, a study conducted by IIT-Madras said that the opening of shutters of various dams in Kerala cannot be the reason for the August 2018 floods in Kerala. The report also pointed out that extreme rainfall led to the floods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rule-curve-violated-at-major-dams/articleshow/81786467.cms||Sandeep Thomas

In 2019, 1,824 women went missing from the city. However, the number of children who went missing in 2020 declined by nearly 20% compared to 2019. In 2019, 409 children went missing from Ahmedabad city. These figures were provided by the state government in reply to a question by Dariapur Congress MLA Gyasuddin Shaikh. Shaikh said that in two years 4,722 women and 1,214 children went missing from Ahmedabad and Vadodara districts. The government reply mentions that of the 1,214 children in these districts who went missing, 92 were still missing. The government stated that special drives have been taken up with non-government organisations and photographs and details of such children are being posted on the missing persons portal. Sources in the home department said 2020 was the year with the lockdown and more women went missing while the number of children who went missing declined. Officials said domestic disputes were likely to occur during the lockdown and this led to more women leaving their homes. As most family members were at their homes, they could watch over their children more comprehensively and not many children could leave or go missing. He said among the children missing, the majority are teenage girls. Officials pointed out that between October 2019 and September 2020, the four major cities of Gujarat — Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot — saw 150 more suicides, according to data tabled in the Gujarat assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/more-women-but-fewer-children-went-missing-in-2020/articleshow/81789707.cms||---
---||Pune||Suspects made failed bids to siphon off money from account with Rs100cr balance: Cybercrime police||Slug: Bank Data Theft Case Strap: Chennai bank account with Rs78cr balance was also targeted, say cops Pune: Ongoing investigation by the Pune cybercrime police into the case of theft and trading of pan India data of dormant corporate accounts in leading private banks has now revealed that the suspects sold stolen data multiple times. Most of these accounts had large funds lying unused for more than a year or so and the suspects intended to siphon off these funds using stolen data, including account details, PIN numbers etc. Investigators also found that the data was leaked from banks and not from the data management centres, police said. One of the buyers of data attempted to siphon off money from a corporate account having Rs78crore balance in a Chennai bank but was unable to do so as it had an OTP setting, police said. “Like the seven bank accounts whose data was traded in Pune city, the account with the Chennai bank is also owned by a corporate company,” said deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake. “The suspects sold data of seven bank accounts to persons at different places across India. Two buyers even made an unsuccessful bid to siphon off money from another corporate account having Rs100 crore balance. Due to some reason they failed to siphon off the money and the bank server has registered the strikes,” said Navatake. All the 14 people arrested since March 16 from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana have been granted bail by a Pune sessions court although investigations are going on. “Our investigations revealed that the suspects, especially hailing from Hyderabad, had sold the data to several people based in various parts of the country,” Navatake said. “It has been also revealed that the buyers of the data tried to siphon off money from the seven corporate accounts having a collective balance of Rs216crore,” she added. Police have also identified two more persons based in Hyderabad who stole the data in form of computer screen shots and then traded it. The other group, active in Surat, also stole the data from a bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/suspects-made-failed-bids-to-siphon-off-money-from-account-with-rs100cr-balance-cybercrime-police/articleshow/81789691.cms||Gitesh Shelke

The arrest was made by the police on Tuesday evening in Delhi. The accused, Kingsley Anosodo, has been brought to Dungarpur and being questioned for his role in similar cases in the state and other states. Sudhir Joshi, who joined as SP Dungarpur in January this year, informed that the incident happened with a local resident between July 2015 and June 2016. The victim, Dilip Patidar, was lured by an email stating that he won a lottery of Rs 554 crore and to claim the sum he has to undergo certain procedures. Tracing the accused in a five-year-old was an uphill task which has been achieved with our in house cyber cell, said Joshi, while sharing that the accused were paid money through 14 transactions in different banks located in Delhi. “The details of all 14 accounts were collected to find that most of them were opened using fake documents. One account detail has helped us tracing a person who turned out to be holding a dummy account on behalf of the main accused,” said Joshi. The traced person informed that his account is being used by a Nigerian for transactions and provides him with a cut on every transaction. “The lead was good enough to trace the real and the co-accused. We have staged trap for them and arrested from Delhi,” said Joshi, who credited his newly recruited constables who efficiently carried out technical work.

According to the PMC’s solid waste management rule, any property with more than 50 houses or which generates over 100kg of garbage per day is supposed to have its own processing facility on the premises. The civic action follows warnings to the errant housing societies and big commercial establishments to process the trash on their premises. “Looking at the current pandemic situation, we will first focus on commercial establishments. But all the violators will have to eventually face the action,” Kunal Khemnar, additional commissioner of PMC, said. He said the civic body would not lift wet garbage, if during the field visit their squad comes across serious violation by the property owners. Looking at the ground reality, one more chance can be given to the property owners to comply with the norms, but only after charging the fine, Khemnar said.  “It is not feasible for many housing societies to construct the plants. Fine from such societies should not be charged,” said Suhas Patwardhan of Pune District Cooperative Housing Federation. According to civic officials, tax discount was offered to housing societies following eco-friendly practices.

---||Hyderabad||Brazil regulator denies certificate to Bharat Bio’s Covaxin facility||HYDERABAD: Brazil’s health regulator Anvisa (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária) has refused to grant a certification of good manufacturing practices (GMP) to Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, citing non-compliance with necessary standards. The move will delay export of Covaxin to Brazil, which has placed an order of 20 million doses. A GMP certification from Anvisa is a must for companies wanting to sell drugs or vaccines in Brazil. As per a translated version of the decision on Anvisa’s website, the regulator said its inspectors found 12 major and 14 minor non-conformities that indicate a significant risk to vaccine’s manufacturing and product quality assurance, implying a health risk for users. Bharat Biotech said: “The requirements pointed out during inspection will be fulfilled, the timelines for fulfilment is under discussion with the Brazil NRA (national regulatory agency) and will be resolved soon.” The company also said that the 20 million dose order from the Brazilian government is still active and that the agreement with Precisa Medicamentos will continue. Key areas of concern highlighted by Anvisa inspectors, who inspected the facility at Genome Valley, between March 1 and 5, were vaccine potency, viral inactivation, sterilisation and purity. The regulator said Bharat Biotech has not validated the method of analysis that proves that the virus was completely inactivated during manufacture, due to which live viruses may be present in the vaccine and may cause contamination of patients. It raised concerns over lack of usage of a specific control method to quantify antigen content and potency, which could result in variations in antigen content, compromising effectiveness. Anvisa also said the firm does not take all precautions to guarantee sterility of product, which being an injectable could cause bacterial infection. It added that in the action plan, deadlines proposed for completion of necessary studies and modifications, to guarantee industrial process will not have an impact on efficacy and safety, would end in July 2021. However, lots manufactured prior to this would not have guarantee of reproducibility with clinical lots and of safety of the product.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/brazil-regulator-denies-certificate-to-bharat-bios-covaxin-facility/articleshow/81789757.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Guns fired, candidates injured in Barrackpore ‘battlefield’||BARRACKPORE: The Barrackpore sub-divisional administrative office premises turned into a battlefield on Wednesday afternoon as a clash broke out between the supporters of Trinamool and BJP, with bullets flying and the mob hurling bricks at police. At least 15 people, including Trinamool’s Barrackpore candidate and filmmaker Raj Chakraborty, BJP’s Bijpur candidate Subhranshu Roy and three cops, were injured, while two vehicles were severely damaged. The candidates of the two parties—Chakraborty, Barrackpore’s BJP candidate Chandramoni Shukla, Bijpur’s BJP candidate Subhranshu Roy and Trinamool candidate Subodh Adhikari—had gone to submit their nomination papers when their supporters came to blows. A large police contingent, including RAF and combat forces, led by senior officers from the Barrackpore commissionerate, reached the spot; cops resorted to lathicharge to disperse the warring sides. Five persons were arrested and a revolver was seized from the spot. The candidates did manage to submit their nomination papers to the SDO office, where security arrangements were stepped up later. According to local sources, trouble broke out around 11am, when hundreds of workers from BJP and Trinamool converged on the area outside the Barrackpore SDO building, waiting for their party candidates to arrive. Soon after Trinamool’s Chakraborty, along with his wife, actor Subhasree, accompanied by party supporters, reached the SDO office, a scuffle broke out between the rival sides. BJP workers had gathered there for Barrackpore’s BJP candidate Chandramoni Shukla. “We took out a peaceful procession from Titagarh to Barrackpore SDO office, where I was supposed to submit my nomination paper,” said Chakraborty, who was injured in the scuffle. “BJP supporters had already gathered in front of the SDO building and deliberately attacked our workers. I got injured in my leg, which has swollen up. I somehow managed to enter the office and submit my nomination paper. Even I came to learn that the goons had opened fire, which is horrible. Police should have taken necessary action earlier to curb such hooliganism.” The situation took a turn for worse after Bijpur’s BJP candidate Subhranshu Roy and Trinamool candidate Subodh Adhikari reached the premises, accompanied by their respective trail of supporters. The workers from the two parties reportedly took up position on opposite flanks of SN Banerjee Road of the Barrackpore Cantonment area and hurled bricks at each other. While police tried to disperse the warring groups, a mob started pelting the cops with bricks and stones. The attack continued even when Roy left the office after filing his nomination paper. “Trinamool-backed goons were waiting for me. As I was leaving in my car, they hurled bricks at my vehicle and I also received injuries in my shoulder. The Trinamool men even opened fire. More than 10 BJP supporters had to be admitted to Barrackpore BN Bose Hospital after being attacked by Trinamool men,” Roy claimed. His vehicle was badly damaged. Barrackpore Police commissioner Ajay Kr Nanda confirmed the arrest of the five persons. “Supporters of the two parties suddenly engaged in a scuffle and resorted to violence during the clash. The crowd has been dispersed and the situation is now under control,” the commissioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guns-fired-candidates-injured-in-barrackpore-battlefield/articleshow/81789900.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

Subsequently, his accomplices went berserk. They smashed dinner plates and chairs in the dining room, damaged TV sets, and tore bedsheets and pillow covers in two rooms. “One of them went to the reception court and attempted to flash the receptionist. The production house later shifted the men to some other hotel. After it refused to compensate the loses, the hotel authorities on Tuesday filed an FIR against the suspects,” senior inspector Balkrishna Sawant of the Hinjewadi police said.The suspects have been booked for offences under sections 143, 147, 149 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 354A (sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code.When TOI visited the hotel on Wednesday, one of its senior officials said, “We shall share the details after the completion of the police investigation.”Sawant said the Mumbai-based production company’s shooting was going on in Pune last week. “It had kept its drivers and other crew members in the hotel in Hinjewadi,” he said.“After the shooting was over, all the suspects returned to Mumbai.

---||Jaipur||Greens oppose cruise tourism in Udaipur’s Pichhola Lake||UDAIPUR: The Udaipur Municipal Corporation's (UMC) move to launch double decker cruise at Pichhola Lakeis being severely opposed by the civil society as well as green activists here. Pichhola being one of the prime drinking water source for the residents, activists swung into action when they saw a private company launching a vessel in the lake on Sunday. Pichhola is an important birding area too and cruise tourism would greatly disturb the aqua-avian life here besides deteriorating quality of drinking water for the locals, environmentalists claimed. Before launching the cruise in water, neither its fitness certificate or license to run was sought from the transport department and hence on getting information, the DTO team went to the spot on Tuesday and penalized the company for flouting norms. Experts also said that before commencing cruise services permission from several departments including district administration, irrigation, water supply, pollution control board, forest, fisheries and lake development authority has to be taken but the UMC or the private firm which has the tender for cruise tourism has not sought any NOC from these departments. The UMC had in 2016 invited tender for cruise services at Lake Pichhola and in June 2018 granted contract to a private firm Ms MM Enterprises to conduct 150 seater double decker cruise services. In February this year, the UMC permitted the contractor to commence cruise service from March 15 onward after seeking necessary permissions from concerned departments. However, the contractor without taking permissions floated the large vessel in the water on the pretext of giving it the 'final touching'. “In December last year, the Lake development committee headed by collector Chetan Deora had decided that not even the diesel run motorized boats would be permitted to ferry in water bodies since they are homes to fishes, birds and aqua animals. In such a situation, its highly irresponsible on the part of the UMC to permit cruise tourism in Pichhola, we strongly object the move,” Tej Shankar Paliwal, a lake activist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/greens-oppose-cruise-tourism-in-udaipurs-pichhola-lake/articleshow/81792881.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Health services ready to vaccinate 45-plus from today, sets target of 3 lakh||PANAJI: The health services is geared up to begin the next phase of the vaccination drive. Starting Thursday, those over the age of 45 years can get the jab. The new phase expects to target a population of 3 lakh in the shortest duration possible in the state. So far the drive has been slower than anticipated. “In accordance with the guidelines of the Centre, the vaccination of people above 45 starts from Thursday. The vaccination facility is available at all government hospitals free of cost while people can get the vaccine shot at a private hospital that has been empanelled by us by paying Rs 250,” said a health official. “We don’t have a deadline to complete the target, but we have to finish vaccinating people in the shortest possible time,” he said. To reach maximum people, he said after a meeting with senior officials, it has been decided to start vaccination camps in industrial estates. “The vaccination programme will be conducted in industrial estates of Verna and Kundaim this week,” he added. As of Wednesday, 1,19,203 doses have been administered to healthcare workers, frontline workers, 60-plus and 45 to 59-year-olds having comorbidities. As many as 18,718 people in all four categories have been administered both doses. He said all those (45-plus) desirous of getting the jab can walk into any government hospital with an Aadhaar card copy and get the vaccination shot without prior registration. “People have almost stopped doing prior registration for the vaccination,” he said. With regards to healthcare workers, he said, they have completed vaccination of 80%, while frontline workers are still getting registered. The government’s concern has been senior citizens whose response to the vaccination drive has been unsatisfactory so far. “If people want to get a vaccination, they have to come on their own. We can’t drag them to a centre,” he said. He also said they have no plans to conduct camps in villages to cover people that may have refrained from getting jab on the account of having to travel a long distance. “We haven’t received any such request so far. Setting up a camp for 30 to 40 people in the village will lead to wastage of resource and our manpower unless there are 100 or more beneficiaries,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/health-services-ready-to-vaccinate-45-plus-from-today-sets-target-of-3l/articleshow/81792846.cms||Bindiya Chari

The SIT — probing the case in 11 districts of the state — is headed by IPS Sanjay Gunjyal. Meanwhile, the SIT headed by TS Manjunath which is probing the scam in Dehradun and Haridwar districts has said that it needs at least two more months to complete its investigation. The time extension has been sought by the two SITs through affidavit filed in the HC. The court has now directed the petitioners to file their replies to the affidavit and has listed the case for further hearing in mid-May. In October last year, the SITs had said that the investigation will be completed in the next six months. The affidavits, however, say that the SITs need more time as the scope of the investigation has been widened. As reported by TOI earlier, two SITs are investigating the cases related to the scholarship scam across the state. It was alleged that several people had produced fake income certificates to avail the scholarship money which was meant for students belonging to the SC/ST community whose annual family income is less than Rs 2.5 lakh. The scam took place for over 15 years. A high court-monitored investigation had revealed that hundreds of private and government-aided colleges forged Aadhaar cards and passed off minors, labourers and rickshaw-pullers as students to siphon off funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sit-seeks-four-month-time-to-complete-investigation-into-sc/st-scholarship-scam/articleshow/81786563.cms||Prashant Jha

District medical and health officer (DMHO) Sudhar Singh told TOI that that some people from Maharashtra had visited the village for a cultural programme a few days. Cases started rising after the visit. Singh, who visited the village, said as a precautionary measure, the two approach roads to the village had been barricaded. “Everyone who comes to the village will be asked about the purpose of the visit and they will be allowed to enter only if it is safe to do so,” the DMHO said. Sources said, a girl studying in a government school at Mahadevpur tested positive for Covid some days ago. She informed authorities she had attended a cultural programme. Medical teams then started testing and found some people positive every day, including 12 on one day. Disinfection of the village has been done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/29-test-positive-after-cultural-programme-village-sealed/articleshow/81789873.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

They are Gaffar Mohammed (49) of Bundi and Vishram Jatav (46) of Bharatpur. Congress leader Charmesh Sharma, who has so far facilitated safe return of over 400 Indians having been illegally stuck or held in Arabia in past, initiated attempt for their home return and lodged a complaint with the ministry of external affairs on March 20 and also wrote to the authorities concerned demanding immediate action for their safe return. Sharma said, both had gone to Arabia on work agreement which expired in November 2020 following which they requested their employer to send them back to home in India. Instead of sending them back to home in India, the employers of the company held them captive in abandoned quarter, deprived them of food and moreover subjected them to severely inhuman torture. They somehow managed to survive by eating foods thrown to them out of pity by other labourers of the company from nearby quarters, he said. Sharma said both managed to send him a video message narrating their plight following which he lodged an online complaint with ministry of external affairs on March 20 and wrote to foreign minister, home minister requesting them to facilitate their return. The MoE, acting on his complaint, directed for action to Indian embassy in Arabia that handed over the matter to consulate general of India in Jeddah Mohammad Alim, but no relief has been given to them. Jatav reportedly fell ill two days ago with one of his legs having turned inactive but he was not given any treatment, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-raj-workers-held-captive-in-saudi-arabia-for-4-mths/articleshow/81792926.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Nair resident doctors oppose total ‘Covidisation’ of hosp||MUMBAI: Resident doctors at Nair Hospital are against complete ‘Covidisation’ of the hospital, as it is leading to serious academic loss, especially for those from surgical branches. While they have lost eight months last year after the outbreak, they do not want to go through it again. Losing two crucial years of their three-year post-graduation programme will make them unskilled specialists, they claimed. As cases rise, junior doctors are demanding equitable distribution of work across civic hospitals and reactivation of Covid care centres. “We are not against Covid duty, but we are appealing for 50-50% distribution of Covid and non-Covid work. We lost crucial months of training last year; if it happens again, it will be distressing and demoralising. We have been collateral damage in Covid management that no one is bothered about. We cannot be shuffled to fill administration loopholes,” said a Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors representative. Another resident doctor said those at Nair are suffering the most compared to other civic hospitals. “Ours is a tertiary care centre. Our beds should be made available for critical cases and not those who can be treated at Covid care centres. The authorities have been told to increase capacity as cases rise in the city. Oral instructions have been issued to turn away patients for elective surgeries. The process of vacating beds has started on our campus. They are planning around 1,000 Covid beds,” said the doctor. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said public and private hospitals have been told to revert to their September-level capacity of Covid-19 beds. “Nair was our only Covid-19 hospital, and it will gradually slip back into the role over next few weeks,”' he said. When 90% of its Covid capacity is occupied, BMC will increase Covid-19 beds at the hospital by 50. Most beds at Nair Hospital, near Mumbai Central railway station, are now occupied by non-Covid patients. Nair Hospital dean, Dr Ramesh Bharmal, said the hospital has 350 Covid-19 patients. “As we get more patients, we will gradually increase our Covid capacity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nair-resident-doctors-oppose-total-covidisation-of-hosp/articleshow/81793049.cms||Yogita Rao

Health minister Rajesh Tope said Pawar was doing well and could go home in four to five days. The 80-year-old Pawar had to be hospitalised on Tuesday, a day before his scheduled surgery, due to abdominal and back pain.           View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Supriya Sule (@supriyasule)  He was diagnosed with gall bladder stones on Sunday and was scheduled to get hospitalised on Wednesday for an elective procedure. After several tests, his team of doctors advised around 8.30pm that the stone needed immediate removal. They found that while he had several small stones, one had slipped down the bile duct, causing the pain. He had also developed pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas. The endoscopic procedure was carried out at 10pm by gastroenterologist Amit Maydeo. He said the stone was stuck at the lower end where the pancreatic duct and the bile duct open.  “This is something where you cannot waste any time as it can become full blown pancreatitis. Soon as we removed the stone, the bile started to flow and his pain and discomfort was resolved,” he said. Pawar will also need to remove the gallbladder later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-emergency-op-on-pawar-to-remove-gall-bladder-stone/articleshow/81796271.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Coronavirus trips footfalls at Gujarat’s tourist destinations||AHMEDABAD: A surge in Covid-19 cases in Gujarat and other parts of the country has emptied out tourist destinations in the state. Estimates of tour operators and travel agents suggest that there has been a massive number of cancellations of bookings for the Statue of Unity (SoU). Tourist footfalls at Gir National Park have fallen by 50%. The tent city at the SoU has 61 operationalized tents.  “The traffic was good till mid-March. However, ever since cases began rising and the night curfew and curbs were imposed in the four major cities of Gujarat, the traffic began to subside,” said Nikhil Aggarwal, a partner at an event management firm which manages the tent city at the SoU. Aggarwal added: “We have received cancellations for at least 50% of the bookings at the tent city at the SoU.” Aggarwal went on to say: “Most weekends were fully booked and on other days occupancy was good. At this point, we’re looking at 30% occupancy in April.” About 65% of tourists visiting the SoU hail from Gujarat whereas the remaining 30-35% come from outside the state. Sources said that tourists coming from outside the state have shelved their trips given the rise in Covid-19 cases. As far as April is concerned, bookings were also impacted by the rule that made a negative RT-PCR report mandatory for visitors. Uncertainty and fear have been keeping tourists from outside Gujarat away from Sasan Gir as well. Well-placed sources confirmed that tourist footfalls have reduced by an estimated 60% at Sasan Gir. “About 15 permits are being issued daily,” said Dr Mohan Ram, deputy forest officer, Sasan (headquarters). This is against about 90 permits issued daily on weekdays and 150 over the weekend. One permit covers a vehicle that can accommodate six persons. Tour operators said that travel booking inquiries nosedived after Covid-19 cases spiked and the RT-PCR test was made mandatory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/coronavirus-trips-footfalls-at-gujarats-tourist-destinations/articleshow/81789933.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Over 1,000 will take ‘deeksha’ to become Naga sadhus during Kumbh on April 5||HARIDWAR: The ritual of initiating over 1,000 members of the Juna akhada as Naga sadhus will be performed on April 5 during the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. This ritual is one of the most important and awaited ones during the Kumbh. Other akhadas, such as the Niranjani and the Mahanirvani, will also impart ‘deeksha’ (initiation) to new members, but the dates are yet to be fixed. Commenting on the background of those who will be ordained as Naga sadhus, a spokesperson from Juna akhada said that a majority of them are people who have been seers for the past few years and have been strictly adhering to the spiritual path. Shrimahant Mahesh Puri of Juna akhada said it is not easy to become a Naga sanyasi. Before the commencement of the rituals, all disciples must follow the traditions of sanyas for at least three years under the guidance of senior seers at their respective ashrams after which only the deserving ones are selected for imparting ‘sanyas deeksha’. Describing the process of sanyas deeksha, Puri said, “After taking a holy dip in the Ganga, sadhus perform shradh and tonsure rituals. This signifies renouncing worldly pleasures and rebirth. Next, the Naga sadhu aspirants renounce their clothes and take the ‘kamandal’ (a special vessel stated to represent a simple and self-contained life) and perform rituals the whole night under the religious flag of the akhdra. They then take a dip in the Ganga in the morning, following which Acharya Mahamandaleshwar of Juna Akhada imparts deeksha to them.”=||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-1000-will-take-deeksha-to-become-naga-sadhus-during-kumbh-on-april-5/articleshow/81786759.cms||MS Nawaz

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Nandigram’s spirited fight, from Quit India to land stir||NANDIGRAM: The village, which was the epicentre of anti-land acquisition movement 14 years ago, was called “mini Pakistan” by BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari, who had himself led the protesters in 2007. But the tag seemed demeaning to the long tradition of Hindu-Muslim’s equal participation in any movement from Nandigram, including freedom struggle. After the Congress passed the Quit India resolution on August 8, 1942, 10,000 people marched to the Nandigram police station on September 30, 1942, to hoist the Tricolour there. The British troops fired at them, killing eight. Dictionary of Martyrs India’s Freedom Struggle (1857-1947) Vol 4, published by the ministry of culture and the Indian Council of Historical Research, unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 7, 2019, mentioned the eight martyrs, including Sheikh Alauddin (40), who was “actively participating” in the Quit India movement. Ajim Baksh and Sheikh Abdul, who were arrested and sentenced to imprisonment, died in Midnapore jail. “Tamluk, along with adjoining areas, were the only pocket in the entire country to gain independence from the British twice — once after the Quit India movement and again, on August 15, 1947,” said Raj Sekhar Basu, historian and professor of modern Indian history, caste movement and history of medicine at Calcutta University. The undivided Midnapore, then a Congress stronghold, witnessed mass mobilisation during Civil Disobedience Movement in the early 1930s and Union Board Boycott Movement in early 1920s. “The movements continued there for almost five years even after it lost steam in other parts of the country. This is because the leaders there hailed from the grassroots. The working class was suffering due to several restrictions, like free movement of boats and people that impacted residents’ livelihoods,” said Basu.  Now, parties were attempting to divide the people of Nandigram on religious lines to gain votes, experts said. Nandigram has always been a hub of cultivation of rice and vegetables, which explains the high population of Muslims there. Some Muslims are also weavers by profession. “Nandigram is also a centre of Baishnabs. When the police entered Nandigram in March 2007, there were special azaans from the mosques and prayers by Baishnabs. The farmers, irrespective of their religions, have always been united in Nandigram. It is sad to see that people are trying to vitiate the atmosphere for petty gains,” said Jharna Panda, a professor hailing from Nandigram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nandigrams-spirited-fight-from-quit-india-to-land-stir/articleshow/81789937.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Mumbai||It’s not often that FIRs are not filed, says Bombay HC on Singh’s plea||MUMBAI: The HC on Wednesday questioned Param Bir Singh’s plea for a probe by CBI without any FIR being filed. “Simply writing letters to the CM won’t do…If any citizen finds an offence being committed, he is duty-bound to file an FIR. You are a police officer. If you find an offence has been committed, you are duty-bound to file an FIR. Why did you not do it?” asked the CJ. Singh, in a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray, had alleged Deshmukh had met subordinate police officers, including API Sachin Waze, and asked for collection of Rs 100 crore. “What have you done for registration of FIR?...Did you approach state police?” the CJ asked. The bench asked senior counsel Vikram Nankani, appearing for Singh, to first satisfy HC on maintainability of the PIL and whether the court can direct investigation without an FIR in order to get interim relief. The interim relief sought is ‘safe custody’ of CCTV footage from outside Deshmukh’s residence. Nankani read out Singh’s letter and referred to the report by Rashmi Shukla, former commissioner (intelligence) to the DGP to submit the issue is “related to interference by political masters.” He said Singh was not challenging his transfer order. The CJ also observed there was “no affidavit’’ either by any police officer to say the alleged demand was made in his presence. The bench asked Singh’s counsel if the ex-top cop had any first-hand information himself. Kumbhakoni said the plea was based on “hearsay” and contended that Singh came to court without clean hands and heart. He also said after Shukla’s report on a corruption racket in police transfers, the state had in September 2020 closed the file. Kumbhakoni said the ex-police chief had not revealed his “enmity” with the home minister. He also called Singh a “disgruntled” litigant and said his PIL was “motivated by personal vendetta”. Nankani said the issue raised is larger and of grave importance and if state has done nothing yet, HC is not powerless and can even convert a letter into a PIL. He said the state having appointed an inquiry panel headed by former HC judge shows the state too thinks it is a serious issue. ASG Anil Singh, for CBI, said it was willing to probe Singh’s allegations but left it for HC to decide in what form or by which agency. The CJ said, “Are police officers, ministers, politicians all above the law?” The bench said, “Do not view yourself so high, the law is above you.” The bench also said, “It is only in extremely rare cases that court can order an FIR to be registered.” It said HC cannot be reduced to a magistrate’s court which can direct police to register an FIR if police fail to do so. The HC also heard two other PIL petitioners. City advocate, Jaishri Patil, the first to file a petition, not a PIL, had sought directions to Malabar Hill police to register an FIR on her complaint made on March 21. She mentioned that her complaint was pending. The bench observed that earlier, it was not often that FIRs were “not registered”. Before 4pm, HC called immediately for the station diary from Malabar Hill police station to know the status and action taken by them on her complaint. The bench asked AG if any FIR was lodged based on Patil’s complaint. The AG said none had been.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/its-not-often-that-firs-are-not-filed-says-bombay-hc-on-singhs-plea/articleshow/81793328.cms||Swati Deshpande

The posh ward of Jodhpur gets water ranging from 20 hours to 6.5 hours, while the other 47 wards get water ranging from 2.5 hours to 1 hour and 45 minutes. The government even conceded that it was supplying water through tankers on demand in Ramol- Hathijan, Behrampura, Sarkhej, and Maktampura wards of the city. The state government tabled the information in reply to a question of Anand MLA Kanti Sodha Parmar of the Congress. The government stated that in the areas where water was being supplied through tankers, the AMC has made provisions to lay water-supply pipe networks. However, within societies, residents have to set up their own networks. The government said that of the 47 wards, 24 get water supply for 2.5 hours, 14 for 2 hours, and the remaining wards for 1 hour and 45 minutes. The crucial pilot project for 24x7 Narmada water supply and water metering in the Jodhpur ward remains a pipe dream.

---||Chennai||Communist parties working like a team against the BJP||In Sunday, at a joint public meeting near Salem, DMK president M K Stalin urged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to take the lead and form a national-level alliance of opposition parties to take on the BJP/RSS combine in time for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. TOI spoke to R Mutharasan and K Balakrishnan, state secretaries of CPI and CPM, about such a move and their support for it. Excerpts:Q: What do you think about M K Stalin’s suggestion?Mutharasan: It is a politically significant statement that Stalin and Rahul Gandhi made in Salem. Today, the country under the BJP is heading towards a dangerous zone with dictatorship looming large on its horizon. Starting with one nation, one card, one election, we could well be heading into a one religion and one party regime. That is their last weapon, which is against the people and the principles of secularism. Considering the looming danger, all communist organisations should merge into one without wasting any further time. This is important to stop the fascist forces and to safeguard the Constitution. Today’s youngsters sport Che Guevara T-shirts, but they are not coming to us since they feel we are weakened. Only a merger can change that perception. The differences that led to the breakup of communists in 1964 do not exist now at the international and national level.Balakrishnan: This is a significant move. Today, the only danger looming over the country is the stranglehold of the BJP/RSS, which is keen to destroy federalism, social justice, multi-cultural society and secularism with a single-minded approach. Stalin has proposed the move and it is a good thing. All parties have to forget about their personal agendas and join hands nationally to stop the march of the BJP/RSS.Q: The CPI suggested a merger of all communist parties to strengthen itself for such a fight. Your view?Balakrishnan: Even though we are two parties, we are already functioning as a team. Our political objective across India is one. When we are already functioning as one, what difference will it make after becoming one. In fact, as two parties we are able to reach out to a larger number of people. More than the issue of merger, we could focus to work more closely. A merger could possibly happen in the future and we do not know now. Let it take its own course. There is a process and journey involved to warrant such a merger. I am not saying no.Q: What is your take on the TN assembly election?Mutharasan: Our Democratic Progressive Alliance will do much better than what the opinion polls are predicting. An alliance should have political strength and alliance strength. We have both. On the political front, the AIADMK-BJP combine does not have answers to the questions that we raise on the farm laws and CAA. We have not only retained the alliance partners from the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, we have added more parties. We see a big support among the people and they are yearning for change.Balakrishnan: Our alliance campaign is having a positive impact on the people and we can see a surge in support for us. There is discontent against the Centre and the state government. There is a wave of opposition against the BJP and the AIADMK. The wave will be visible for others only after the results are out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/communist-parties-working-like-a-team-against-the-bjp/articleshow/81799116.cms||---
---||Bareilly||UP: Interfaith couple’s bare bodies found in abandoned hut in Bareilly||BAREILLY: Married against her wishes six months ago, a 21-year-old woman was on Wednesday afternoon found dead with her lover under suspicious circumstances in Bareilly district, with local police claiming that they took poison and killed themselves. The couple’s bare bodies were found in an abandoned hut outside their village, with a sachet of rat-killer lying next to them. Police said that the post-mortem report “suggested the possibility of poisoning”. Their viscera samples have been preserved and will be sent for lab examination, a police officer said. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Bareilly, Rohit Singh Sajwan, told TOI, “Prima facie it appears that the couple has committed suicide because their families were against their relationship and the girl was married elsewhere. No one from their families has come forward to register a police complaint. But we are also investigating the possibility of foul play. We have checked their conversations and it is clear that they were in contact even after the marriage.” According to villagers, the woman’s family had forcibly married her to a man of her caste after they came to know about her affair with a Muslim man. The woman had returned home for Holi and went missing on Tuesday. Their bodies were found the next day. A relative of the youth, who didn’t wish to be named, told TOI, “Everyone in the village was aware about their affair. But it was decided in the panchayat that the woman should be married somewhere else. And my cousin was sent to Delhi. Their ways were parted but they never forgot each other. He spoke to me from Delhi and asked about her. I told him to move on in his life but he couldn’t.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/interfaith-couples-bare-bodies-found-in-abandoned-hut-cops-say-they-took-poison/articleshow/81784703.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Noida||45-plus vax drive from today; Noida, Gzb target 4L this mth||Noida/Ghaziabad: Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad will on Thursday kick off the fourth phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, which will cover people over 45 years of age. The Uttar Pradesh government has given Gautam BudhNagar a target of 1.62 lakh and Ghaziabad 2.16 lakh recipients for April. The GB Nagar health department will conduct the drive across 90 centres on Thursday — 40 in government facilities and 50 in private ones. “Following the government order of vaccinating all above 45 years issued on March 23, we have been given a target of 1.62 lakh for the month of April. Around 40,500 people will have to be vaccinated every week. This will include 10,000 vaccinations per day for Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays and 3,500 jabs for Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer in charge of Covid vaccination in GB Nagar. GB Nagar chief medical officer Deepak Ohri added that 10 nodal officers have been designated for Thursday’s vaccination drive. In Ghaziabad, to deal with the expected rush of recipients on Thursday, the health department has increased the number of vaccination centres from 77 to 93.  Officials said 16 health and wellness centres have been added in government set-ups. The 93 centres also include 36 private hospitals that have been given permission to conduct the inoculation drive. The health department had earlier planned to conduct a vaccination drive at 30 health and wellness centres, but due to lack of teams, only 16 centres will carry out the exercise. All these centres are in rural areas and have been given a target to vaccinate 100 people each per day. To meet its target, Ghaziabad will be required to vaccinate at least 14,000 people on the three major days and 4,000 on the remaining days. “Vaccination will still be carried out six days a week at 10 government centres, while the drive will be conducted at all 57 centres on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays. Private hospitals are free to conduct vaccination on all seven days,” an official said. To prevent chaos, the Ghaziabad health department has written to the SSP for adequate police arrangements at all centres. Officials said 300 people will be vaccinated daily in major government hospitals of the district, while CHCs, PHCs and other health centres will administer the vaccine to 200 people daily. There is no change as far registration for vaccination is concerned. Those eligible can register through the Co-WIN 2.0 portal or get on-site registration done at centres. Meanwhile, more than 2,000 people above 60 years and those aged above 45 years with comorbidities got their first doses of the Covid-19 vaccine at 31 vaccination centres in Gautam Budh Nagar on Wednesday. The district inoculated a total of 2,254 people on the day, including 223 healthcare workers and frontline workers. “Out of the 2,031 that got vaccinated in the third phase, 1,598 were in the age group of 60 years and above, while 433 were aged 45-59 years and had comorbidities,” said Dr Tyagi. In Ghaziabad, 2,571 people were vaccinated at 19 private hospitals and 22 government facilities. Of these, 1,940 recipients were above 60 years of age while 391 were aged 45-59 years. The district has now achieved 83% of its target for the third phase this month — it has given jabs to 77,475 people against the target of 93,480 recipients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/45-plus-vax-drive-from-today-noida-gzb-target-4l-this-mth/articleshow/81793280.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

His body, with multiple injury marks, was found inside a bag at an agri field near Govindpur Road, on Tuesday night. The deceased man, who worked as a tailor in Delhi, was a resident of Bilari, Moradabad. He went to his relative’s place in Bhavanipur village under Kotwali police limits to celebrate Holi, and later met his friend, who stays in the neighbourhood. Seeing them together, the girl’s family beat him up and then stabbed him to death. The man's kin later lodged a "missing" complaint with the police. The girl's father has been arrested, police said. Sambhal ASP Alok Kumar Jaiswal said, “A body was found abandoned in an agri field. The deceased was a resident of Bilari, Moradabad, who was on a visit to his relatives' place in Kotwali, Sambhal. During the investigation, it was found that the man had gone to meet his friend with whom he was in a relationship. The girl's family spotted him inside the house and attacked him on Monday night.” The ASP added, “They first thrashed him. He was then stabbed and strangled to death. There were multiple injury marks on the body. His hands were tied. Two suspects, including the girl’s father, have been arrested and the body sent for a postmortem.” Circle officer Arun Kumar said that an FIR has been registered under sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) of the IPC. "Further investigation is underway," Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-21-stabbed-to-death-for-meeting-girlfriend-during-holi/articleshow/81784718.cms||Maria Khan
---||Delhi||Delhi schools in doubt over offline classes||NEW DELHI: With the new academic session for schools set to begin, a certain confusion regarding offline classes for students promoted to classes X and XII is bothering many. While some private schools have decided that classes would continue in the online mode due to the rise in the number of fresh Covid cases, other schools have called in students for offline classes. However, according to a official in Delhi government’s education department, the earlier re-opening of schools for students of classes IX to XII was only for them to complete their practical’s and for remedial classes. Schools in Delhi were re-opened in February for the students of these classes. Attendance, however, was not compulsory and required prior approval from the parents. “For normal teaching and learning, offline classes permission is still not there,” the education department official said. “But since there has been no official circular issued regarding this, schools have taken decisions at their own levels.” At Mount Abu Public School in north Delhi’s Rohini, the school authorities have decided to call students who have been promoted to Class X and Class XII for offline classes. “The same procedure is being followed with staggered entry and exit for a small group of students. Students will still have to get consent form from their parents for attending the classes,” said principal Jyoti Arora. Schools like Tagore International, The Indian School and Springdales are continuing with online classes. A school in west Delhi has also decided to hold online classes for now. The principal of the school, who did not wish to be identified, said: “As Covid-19 cases began increasing again, we thought it would be best to continue classes in the online-mode. Moreover, senior teachers have different CBSE practical duties hence it would not be possible to hold offline classes.” However, this confusion remains only for private schools. For Delhi government school, the new academic session for the secondary and senior secondary students are yet to begin. While for students of nursery to those promoted to Class XI, learning will continue in the semi-online mode. “For higher class students, final exams are still ongoing, and the academic session will begin a little later,” said A K Jha, principal of Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Sector 8 of Rohini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/schools-in-doubt-over-offline-classes/articleshow/81789970.cms||---

The bear had entered a tunnel and was attempting to cross the track when it was crushed under a train. The fully grown sloth bear was found killed under a train heading from Margao towards Londa. The government recently permitted double tracking of a railway line inside the ecologically sensitive areas of Mollem’s forestsThe existing century-old railway track passing through Mollem’s forests has been found taking a toll on wild animals. “Earlier also sloth bears and leopards have lost their lives while crossing the track. After the double tracking of the railway line is completed, it will lead to more wildlife fatalities,” Animal Rescue Squad, Bicholim, president Amrut Singh said.

---||Chennai||Crass and class: A short history of political barbs||By R RangarajOne of the most forwarded messages on social media is titled ‘When insults had class’. A sample is an exchange between Nancy Astor, a British MP and the inimitable Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Astor: "Winston, if I were your wife I’d put poison in your coffee." Churchill: "Nancy, if I were your husband I’d drink it." A more bitter exchange between the two quotes Astor calling Churchill a drunk and Churchill calling her ugly.As anywhere else, politics in Tamil Nadu has had its share of class and crass — mostly the latter. It is not the first time in the history of the state’s politics that below-the-belt barbs have been made by the likes of DMK campaigners A Raja and Dindigul Leoni.In the 1970s and the 1980s, the DMK and the AIADMK engaged speakers who used vulgar, obscene narratives. At public meetings, generally held late at night in semi-urban areas, these speakers would reel out salacious stories, juicy episodes on the nocturnal activities of rivals, laced with humour and sarcasm, clearly aimed at titillating the audience. Most of the men who gathered at these meetings enjoyed the fare dished out, with their guffaws indicating approval. Women kept away from such events.These speakers were sometimes more in demand than the senior leaders. On odd occasions, even some women speakers were deployed. In the early days, DMK president M Karunanidhi (Kalaignar) and poet-laureate Kannadasan (Kavignar) would often be engaged in an ugly war of words. Once pushed to the wall, Kannadasan said he would be forced to reveal some "adventures" which he shared with Kalaignar. The next day the DMK asked its speakers not to target Kavignar. When Kannadasan died, Karunanidhi wept inconsolably.In his early days, Karunanidhi would make sexist remarks. He was said to have compared a file (the one with the red tape, used in government offices) to a petticoat, drawing widespread criticism. Later Karunanidhi took on a more refined role, although there was still the odd-remark against Hindu gods and goddesses. Karunanidhi himself was at the receiving end when it came to sexist remarks. When opposition leaders wanted to know who Dharmambal was (a reference to his second wife, Rajathi Ammal), Karunanidhi came up with the cryptic response: "The mother of my daughter Kanimozhi".BJP leaders, who today wax eloquent about the need for dignity in speeches, made disparaging remarks about Indira Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, and even called PM Manmohan Singh "impotent".Chief minister MGR and J Jayalalithaa were targets when opposition leaders referred to his 'Mundhaanai Mudichu' (meaning a knot with a pallu) and the many films in which he acted with a heroine. After three days, when it was his turn to reply to the debate, MGR said: "I have a ‘Mundhaanai Mudichu’, you people are upset that you don’t have such a 'mudichu'". The AIADMK MLAs thumped the desks with an accompanying roar.DMK founder C N Annadurai was dignified in making a political repartee, whether in Parliament, in the assembly or outside. In a debate on the need for Hindi as the national language because a majority of the people in the country spoke it, Annadurai pointed out that the tiger was the national animal and not the rat whose population ws bigger. Similarly, the national bird was the peacock and not the crow which was everywhere.Even when he used epithets like dogs, he did it in a suave manner. Where was the need for two doors — the door for the English language as communication was big enough for the dog to go through, and there was no need for a second door to provide for the dog.When a leader of the opposition hit out at Annadurai saying "Your days are numbered" (he wanted to say that the tenure of the DMK government would end soon, but it came when the CM was fighting cancer), Annadurai didn’t lose his cool. He said, "But my steps are measured".The verbal bouts between C Rajagopalachari (Rajaji) and communist leaders were also marked by high levels of repartees and quick wit. Once when Rajaji asked communist leader Jeeva why he was talking of the constituency Washermenpet in north Chennai when he usually talked only about the global situation, Jeeva remarked. "At least I have a constituency to talk about" (Rajaji was not elected to the assembly but was nominated to the Legislative Council). The remark drew guffaws in the House, and Rajaji laughed along.Chief minister Annadurai was reminded of his promise of three measures rice for one rupee, made before the 1967 general elections, and speakers said the people had been cheated. Annadurai said, "Moonru padi latchiyam, Oru padi Nichayam" (Three measures is the goal, one measure is a certainty).Annadurai was again criticised for introducing a government lottery scheme, as other speakers felt the people would be duped of their hard-earned money. Annadurai said, "Vizhundhaal veettukku, vizhaavittaal naattukku (If you win, the money goes to you; if you lose, the money goes to the state).(The writer is a veteran journalist)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/crass-and-class-a-short-history-of-political-barbs/articleshow/81799157.cms||---

This will result in a saving of Rs 9.6 crore for DTC, sources said. In addition, DTC will also earn Rs 2 crore annually from enhanced rent for land used for H-CNG stations for private vehicles.The agreement was signed in the presence of transport minister Kailash Gahlot. The two entities had signed a similar long-term contract in 2010. Under this agreement, IGL had set up dedicated CNG filling facilities at 44 depots of DTC across Delhi and Noida with a total compression capacity of 10 lakh kg per day. Gahlot said IGL shall continue to provide CNG for DTC buses and other vehicles in the same professional manner as it used to do earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dtc-to-save-rs-10cr-every-year-with-10-yr-cng-deal/articleshow/81790010.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Jaleel, supporters booked for Covid rules violation||Aurangabad: City MP Imtiaz Jaleel and his supporters and have been booked for violating the social-distancing norm late on Tuesday night, soon after district collector announced withdrawing the lockdown decision. “We have registered a case against MP Imtiaz Jaleel, 11 of his identified supporters and about 25 to 30 unidentified people,” inspector Sambhaji Pawar told TOI on Wednesday. The MP’s supporters gathered around his residence in large numbers, many of them without face-masks, and lifted him on their shoulders. A video of the gathering shouting slogans in favour of Jaleel went viral. Jaleel addressed a news conference and said he was not aware of the presence of a large number of people outside his house. “Everybody is equal before law and I am ready to face action for the inadvertent violations that took place last night.” Jaleel had criticised the decision to impose lockdown except for industries. Traders’ organisations and associations representing different fraternities came out in his support. The BJP, one faction of Congress, Shiv Sena and others too joined the bandwagon and opposed the decision to impose lockdown. An agitation was also scheduled for Wednesday. District collector Chavan on Wednesday morning said that an offence would be registered against Jaleel and his supporters for violating the social-distancing rule. Former MP Chandrakant Khaire said the district collector succumbed to pressure from Jaleel. “If no offence is registered against the MP, the collector should be booked and made to pay the fines from his pocket,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jaleel-supporters-booked-for-covid-rules-violation/articleshow/81784148.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Chennai||Madras HC slams politicos, says ‘freebie culture’ has made Tamil Nadu people lazy||CHENNAI: Slamming political parties for encouraging ‘freebie culture’ in the state, the Madras high court on Wednesday said it has caused the people of Tamil Nadu to become lazy. Locals refuse to work resulting in migrant workers taking over jobs, the court said. “One would not be surprised to see migrant workers would be owners of properties in due course and the sons of the soil will... (be) working under them,” a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice B Pugalendhi. The HC made the observation while hearing a PIL moved by M Chandramohan in 2020 seeking direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to convert Vasudevanallur assembly constituency into a general constituency. The bench raised a series of questions to be answered by the ECI while noting that serious steps must be taken by Parliament to amend the Representation of People Act to enable action against the political parties engaging in corrupt practices. The ECI is to answer question on steps taken by the Centre to bring in legislation on political manifestos, particularly the freebies promised in manifestos. The court also sought information on ECI vetting manifestos and actions taken against erring political parties. The court has also asked the ECI why political parties should not be made liable to pay at least 10% of the money required for implementation of election promises made by them and why the commission does not de-recognise parties that fail to implement their election promises based on which the voters are lured to vote the party to power. The court directed the ECI to answer the queries by April 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-slams-politicos-says-freebie-culture-has-made-tn-people-lazy/articleshow/81787031.cms||---

While Nepal officials said the tiger was killed by poachers in India, wildlife officials in India said that was “highly unlikely.” “We have spoken to Nepal officials to get details of all three tigers so we can match them against our database,” Dudhwa field director Sanjay Pathak said. On March 16, a male tiger was tranquilised in the Khata corridor, which connects Nepal’s Bardia National Park and India’s Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary which, in turn, is a link between the tiger habitats of Dudhwa and Kishanpur. A day later, another male tiger was tranquilised about 100m from the India-Nepal border on the other side. It had reportedly killed six people in Nepal, a source said, and had been caged. But on March 24, it managed to break free. It has not been traced since. On March 29, the carcass of a 10-year-old male tiger was found by Nepal Army personnel near the India-Nepal border. “There was an iron snare around it and its claws were missing. It must have been caught in a poacher’s snare in India. We had shared the information with officials of the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve to alert them,” Luv Bisht, a member of the buffer zone community forestry programme at Shuklaphanta National Park in Nepal, across India’s Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary, told TOI. Pilibhit officials, however, dismissed the poaching claim. “There is no possibility of ensnaring within the forests of Pilibhit. However, we will look into the matter,” field director of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve Javed Akhtar said. Deputy director of the reserve, Naveen Khandelwal, told TOI, “Yes, we did come to know about the matter and vigil has been stepped up. Our teams are combing the forests. But it’s highly unlikely that the tiger was ensnared in our forests. It usually happens on the other side.” Since the Covid-19 outbreak, joint patrolling with Nepal officials along the India-Nepal border has been suspended. “The rescue operations were conducted inside Nepal. We had been informed. These were conflict tigers that had killed humans and cattle in Nepal,” Pathak told TOI. “Movement of wild animals can’t be restricted. Migration is a natural phenomenon.” Wildlife expert Siddharth Singh said the growing tiger population of Pilibhit has necessitated the creation of a buffer zone. He added, “We have far more tigers than our limited habitats can support, which is why tigers are straying out. While doing so, they end up falling prey to poachers or in conflict with humans.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/3-tigers-wander-into-nepal-1-found-dead-declawed/articleshow/81784143.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: More pick home isolation||Aurangabad: The dearth of hospital beds, among other reasons, has resulted in more Covid patients opting for home isolation in Aurangabad. A total of 4,707 patients have chosen to isolate themselves at home, accounting for 43% of all active cases. The total number of patients admitted to private hospitals in Aurangabad is 2,406, while the number in the Covid care centres (CCCs) is 2,499. A private professional, who tested positive for Covid-19 along with five family members, said he chose the home-isolation option as he could not get beds for the entire family in one hospital. “My mother, who has serious comorbidities, first contracted the infection and was admitted to a private hospital where she died on March 25. Other members of the family were not exhibiting any major symptoms. Given the crowding and hygiene issues at many hospitals, we decided to opt for home isolation,” said the 40-year old preferring anonymity. The civic administration, which has encouraged home-isolation for patients who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, has already capped the charges of home-isolation treatment at Rs 2,000 for 10-days. Dr Santosh Ranjalkar, the president of the Indian Medical Association’s Aurangabad chapter, on Wednesday said the scarcity of hospital beds is driving more patients towards home-isolation. “The option of home-isolation is working most cases as doctors have an effective drug regime and experience to deal with Covid cases over the past year. Even slightly moderate patients are opting for home-isolation and are getting cured. Growing public awareness about containing the body’s viral load using home remedies is also proving handy,” he said. Meanwhile, a section of civic activists have raised the demand that patients opting for home-isolation be asked to share their Google location on a regular basis with the civic body’s Covid control room to avoid the possible free movement of active patients in public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-more-pick-home-isolation/articleshow/81784145.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Noida||Noida group moves SC against ‘so-called andolans’||NOIDA: Referring to the ongoing farmers’ agitation and the protest at Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) from December 2019 to March 2020, a Noida-based group has approached the Supreme Court to seek clear, unambiguous and transparent rules on “so-called andolans”. The petition filed by ‘Women on Making Nation’ demands strong punishment for these “so-called andolans” that have been “blocking roads, public places and parks for months together”. Mentioning the farmers’ protest at Delhi’s borders, which began in the last week of November 2020, and the Shaheen Bagh sit-in, the petition has urged the court to take into consideration why going on ‘andolans’ at public places and on the busiest of roads had of late become “a trend”. “That the design of these andolans are almost similar on one or the other way like blocking of roads, making anti-government slogans… obstructing day-to-day activities of taxpayers or the common citizen thereby indulging in anti-establishment activities on the ulterior motive to gain mileage in political field (sic),” reads the petition, adding the “hidden agenda of these agitations was to defame the government as well as the country”. Monicca Agarwaal, who works with an IT company and identifies herself as the president of the group, told TOI it would take her a maximum of 20-25 minutes to go from Sector 63 in Noida to Connaught Place in Delhi, which has increased to an hour now because of blockades due to the farmers’ protest. Besides wastage of time and money, she contends, this amounts to mental torture coupled with harassment and fear and affects women who “have to manage between home and office”. Talking about the farmers’ protest, Agarwaal told TOI, “It has surpassed 120 days and they have threatened to die of suicide. This is no way. I don’t know what problem they have but I am talking only about my problem. There may be many like me who have a problem. It is painful that you are not thinking about the country and citizens, whether it is the government or farmers.” BKU-Tikait, one of the groups spearheading the farmers’ protests, said many efforts had been made to defame the farmers’ agitation and this was no different. Spokesperson Pawan Khatana said, “Earlier too, such petitions have been filed. We have not blocked the road.” The farmers have been on a sit-in protest against the three new central farming laws, which they want repealed, at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders after they were stopped from entering the capital by Delhi Police. News agency ANI reported on Tuesday that the Supreme Court had sought a response from the Centre and the Delhi Police commissioner on the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-group-moves-sc-against-so-called-andolans/articleshow/81793335.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Chennai||TNPCB notice to 436 poultry farms in Namakkal dist||Chennai: Showcause notice was issued to 436 poultry farms in Nammakal district for not obtaining the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board’s (TNPCB) consent as mandated by the new green law, the board informed the National Green Tribunal. The NGT is hearing a case regarding pollution caused by poultry farms in the district. The case was originally filed against a private farm in Rasipuram for allegedly disposing waste in an unscientific manner and over exploitation of ground water in a region that is already facing water shortage. According to official data, 23 of 30 revenue firkas in Namakkal district are categorised as ‘over-exploited (>100%)’ when it comes to water scarcity. In August 2020, the NGT set up a joint-committee to look into the complaint and status of other farms in the region. During an inspection in October last year, the committee found that the Rasipuram unit used around 9,000 litres of water a day and since poultry farms come under allied-agriculture category, they were exempted from obtaining No-Objection Certification for withdrawing groundwater. The committee denied allegations that waste was disposed of improperly and recommended no penal action be taken against the farm. Meanwhile, the TNPCB amended Air Act, Water Act and Environment (Protection) Act, mandating the board's consent mandatory for all poultry farms with over 5,000 birds. The new rule came into effect on January 1 and the NGT sought an update. The committee, comprising TNPCB officials, during the March 22 hearing said only seven farms in Namakkal have obtained TNPCB consent. The panel said there were 1,175 farms in the district. The case was adjourned to April 28 after government counsel agreed to look into the discrepancy and submit a detailed report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tnpcb-notice-to-436-poultry-farms-in-namakkal-dist/articleshow/81787043.cms||Ram Sundaram

This leads to waterlogging in many areas like Vyttila, when it rains for a few minutes. The pre-monsoon cleaning drive, involving cleaning of drains and canals, has to be completed before May 15, as per the order of the high court. Though drain cleaning works started in some divisions, the work is yet to gather pace. Corporation officials say full-fledged works would start once the election is over. The local body is yet to complete tender procedures of many works and need to float retender for some other works. Many areas of the city, except the places where Operation Breakthrough works were completed, witnessed waterlogging due to clogged drains in the recent summer showers. “The local body will clean all the drains, including large and small ones. We need to reach an agreement with the contractor. Some works need to be retendered. We will complete the pre-monsoon drive before May 15, to abide by the high court order. The works will start in full swing once the election is over,” said an official in the engineering wing. Local body authorities said they are also taking steps to clean large canals in the city though such woks were undertaken under Operation Breakthrough. “Waterlogging issues have come up in some areas at Vyttila. We have cleaned drains in front of houses there. We have already given fund to councillors for drain cleaning works. An amount of Rs 3 lakh has been disbursed for small drains and Rs 5 lakh for medium and large ones. Residents should alert the respective councillor about waterlogging issue due to clogged drain so that immediate steps can be taken to address the issue. There are no officials to monitor the works now as all of them are engaged in poll duty,” said public works standing committee chairperson Sunitha Dixon. Meanwhile, drains at Panampilly Nagar get overflowed during high tide. “We have visited Panampilly Nagar to identify the reason for this. Roads in the area is in low level and need to be raised to address the issue. Once the election is over, engineers will take up the issue,” she said. Opposition leader Antony Kureethara said that tendering process of some works in West Kochi has not happened due to election. “Following the high court order, authorities have been asked to complete tender of all works related to drain cleaning. The works should be completed before the onset of monsoon. Otherwise, things will turn bad. I have asked the health standing committee chairperson to speed up the tender process,” he said. The high court had criticized the Kochi corporation and Operation Breakthrough team for trying to delay works to prevent flooding in Kochi, citing model code of conduct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/waterlogging-resurfaces-in-city-after-summer-showers/articleshow/81787047.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Forest department panels for women’s issues||NAGPUR: Stung by the criticism in the RFO Deepali Chavan suicide case, the PCCF (HoFF) G Saiprakash has issued directions to the subordinate cadre in the forest department to take series of steps to make the department offices a safer workplace for women employees. Though the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition & Redressal) Act, was enacted in 2013, and detailed guidelines have been issued since 2013, PCCF office issued series of directions on March 30, 2021, five days after the tragic incident in Melghat. The PCCF issued a circular directing to form various committees at different levels to inquire about complaints in respect of sexual harassment against women at the workplace. Instructions have been given to form committees and these committees have been asked to meet frequently. “The PCCF’s circular is not new. As per the state GR issued on June 19, 2014, the office of PCCF is supposed to send an annual report to the government every year, which is not being done regularly. No review of such cases is done in monthly meetings,” alleged forest union leaders. “Now it seems PCCF has pressed panic buttons by asking officials to follow the directions in the GR which already makes mention about grievance redressal and internal complaint committees, maternity leaves, human resource development training, conflict resolution and counseling. Had this been done regular, incidents like RFO Chavan could have been avoided,” said forest union leaders. Meanwhile, forest officers affiliated to the All India Range Forest Officers Federation (AIRFOF), an apex body of rangers at the national level observed a silent protest in all the states to demand justice to late Deepali Chavan. The officers sported black ribbons at work and demanded the strongest action against the culprits who were responsible for abetting the suicide of the woman RFO. The Uttar Pradesh officials observed Wednesday as the ‘black day’. “It is most shameful that frontline staff, which is the face of any forest department, is meted out such shabby treatment,” said Haryana Forest Rangers Welfare Association. Similar sharp reactions poured in from rangers associations in Jharkhand, Assam, West Bengal, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, and other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/forest-dept-panels-for-womens-issues/articleshow/81790098.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Police have leeway to do preliminary probe, says experts||MUMBAI: The police are duty-bound to register an FIR once they receive information disclosing a serious or cognizable offence, but they do have the leeway to conduct a probe to find if a complaint discloses a cognizable offence, said legal experts. Mumbai advocate Jaishri Patil had on March 21, on the basis of ex-Mumbai police chief Parambir Singh’s allegations, sought registration of an FIR at Malabar Hill police station against Anil Deshmukh. Her complaint in Marathi said “a plain reading of Singh’s letter clearly discloses a cognizable offence.”  There is a need to lodge an FIR and investigate the case, Patil said, else CCTV footage may get lost. HC CJ Dipankar Datta, while hearing Singh’s PIL, noted she was the lone citizen who lodged a complaint. The Malabar Hill police should have applied its mind to find if a cognizable offence was disclosed and if it was mandatory to register an FIR, said veteran criminal lawyer Shrikant Bhat. He said police ought to have made a station diary entry to launch a preliminary investigation to ascertain the nature of the offence. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda said, “Malabar Hill police could have initiated a preliminary enquiry since it is not connected intrinsically to his public duties.” Ponda added, “In matters of corruption, the law is well-settled. Police are not obliged to register FIR immediately. To prevent undue harassment to public servants, they can hold a preliminary enquiry, particularly if the act is not in due discharge of public duties of the public servant.” But if the allegation pertains to a public servant’s public duty or purported discharge of public duty, then as per Section 17 A of Prevention of Corruption Act in its 2018 amendment, police cannot launch even a preliminary enquiry unless they have prior clearance, Ponda noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-have-leeway-to-do-preliminary-probe-says-experts/articleshow/81793399.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||India||Is ‘centralisation’ limiting vax drive?||India’s race to stay ahead of the renewed Covid-19 surge with an accelerated vaccination programme is being hampered by perceived centralisation roadblocks, going by complaints from states that want to ratchet up the numbers but can’t do so because of reasons ranging from single-window registration to lack of flexibility in expanding the network of centres and inoculating willing citizens beyond the stipulated age bracket even when vaccines are available. In Tamil Nadu, where several health centres run by the Greater Chennai Corporation are believed to be unofficially vaccinating people above 18, senior government doctors said a dynamic system that allows states to widen coverage — depending on vaccine availability and registration density — was the practical way to prevent wastage. “Once opened, a vial has to be used within four hours. Chennai has the capacity to vaccinate 60,000 people. On a good day, we vaccinate about 35,000, but sometimes the number drops to 15,000. Why not offer the vaccine to willing young or healthy individuals?” said a doctor. Officials of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation said they were still awaiting the government’s permission to begin vaccination in 32 private hospitals that are currently not empanelled. Vaccination numbers can increase by around 10,000 a day if these proposed centres join the network. “Eleven of these hospitals had done a commendable job in inoculating healthcare and other frontline workers – so it’s not as if they aren’t fit for the exercise,” an official said. Some days ago, Nagpur district’s guardian minister Nitin Raut had directed the corporation and the zilla parishad to double the vaccination target to 40,000 a day by increasing the number of centres from the existing 160 to 300. Raut suggested that mobile vaccination centres be sent to residential areas to inoculate people in age-appropriate groups. The option of vaccination at home should be available for bed-ridden people, he said. But for all of this to be possible, the guidelines would need tweaking, something that states say they aren’t allowed to do yet. In Bengaluru and elsewhere in Karnataka, the topdown approach to vaccination is impeding execution on the ground, a senior civic official alleged. “The political bosses insist that we wait for directions from the Centre. The initial days of vaccination for senior citizens was chaotic as Co-Win was full of glitches. However, we allowed walk-ins without making any announcements and the situation stabilised. Even when it comes to implementing Covid-containment measures, we are told to wait as the state government has to get permission from the Centre.” Karnataka’s March 14 request to the Centre to allow vaccination teams to visit old-age homes and remote villages was shot down by the Union health ministry. “Since there is a BJP government in the state, the political honchos prefer a wait-and-watch approach,” the official said. Epidemiologist Dr Giridhara R Babu, who is a member of Karnataka’s technical advisory committee on Covid, suggests that offline and walk-in vaccinations should be encouraged instead of pre-registration and over-reliance Co-Win. “The Centre and the state governments should work on micro plans to increase the pace of vaccination,” he said. According to experts, over-centralisation of the drive has meant lack of initiative by state governments and local bodies to encourage the target population to register for vaccination. Earlier this week, at least 50 villages in Gujarat’s Rajkot wrote to the district administration, saying they wouldn’t allow health teams to enter their areas for vaccination. “We need to involve the RWAs and Anganwadi workers, and advertise the need for mass immunisation,” Dr Vinay Aggarwal, former national president of the Indian Medical Association, said. Andhra Pradesh’s Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rambabu said the administration’s wait-and-watch approach had negatively impacted the vaccination drive. The health department last week launched a campaign in villages to improve inoculation coverage. Gujarat’s relatively better vaccine performance of about 2 lakh people daily is speculated to be the result of unofficially bending the rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/is-centralisation-limiting-vax-drive/articleshow/81801651.cms||---
---||Chennai||Butterfly native to Lanka discovered in Western Ghats||Chennai: A butterfly species believed to be a native of Sri Lanka is now found to have a second home in the Western Ghats. The species discovered in the Agasthiyarmalai Biosphere reserve is known as Nacaduba sinhala ramaswamii and commonly named Ramaswami’s Six Lineblue.Ramasamy S R K, a researcher who identified the species, said, "I first sighted the butterfly in Tenkasi at the foothills of the Western Ghats in 2016." After a thorough study by researchers, the new finding was published in the ‘Journal of Threatened Taxa’ recently."Discovery of this new taxon of Lycaenidae butterfly belonging to the Nacaduba genus adds a new species to the butterfly fauna of the Western Ghats and the country," he said.Line blues are small butterflies belonging to the subfamily Lycaenidae. Their distribution ranges from India and Sri Lanka, to the whole of south-east Asia, Australia and Samoa in the Pacific. They are characterised by hairy eyes, anastomosis of veins 11 and 12 on forewings.Two individuals of line blues were photographed in 2011 in Agasthya hills, but they were paler in comparison to the other line blues that were mud-puddling with them on a damp patch on the ground. Similar pale coloured individuals were also observed and photographed later in January 2018 inTenkasi.Ramasamy said a few days later in the same month, the life cycle was discovered on young sprouting leaves from the cut stem of a tree. The larvae were raised, and details of the adults noted. The dissection of genitalia of male specimens were done and they were unlike any known Nacaduba from southern India and on further investigation they were found matching the Sri Lankan species Nacaduba sinhala, he said. The species appears to breed more during the northeast monsoon, though the breeding season extends from September to January, with the peak in October. The larvae are guarded by ants. This is the first record of the species N sinhala outside its endemic range in Sri Lanka. Lycaenidae are one of the toughest families and tougher are the line blues and among them the Nacaduba group are the most complex, this is one of the reasons why this species went unnoticed until now, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/butterfly-native-to-lanka-discovered-in-western-ghats/articleshow/81799270.cms||P Oppili
---||Delhi||Speeding tempo crushes scooterist and a homeless in Delhi; two others critical||NEW DELHI: Two men, including one who was homeless, were killed and two others stated to be in critical condition after a tempo crushed them near Nigambodh Ghat on Wednesday morning. Police said the vehicle was speeding from the direction of Yudhistir Setu and heading towards Nigambodh Ghat. The driver was arrested by a police team patrolling the area. According to police, around 6.15am, the racing tempo first hit a scooter and ran over its rider before climbing on to the footpath and mowing the people sleeping there. “A tempo of Eicher make driven by Ateek Ahmad injured three people sleeping on the roadside and a scooter driver identified as Vehram Khan. While Khan and a homeless man were brought dead at the hospital, the other two homeless are stated to have suffered serious injuries and are unable as yet to give any statement,” said Anto Alphonse, DCP (North). “The tempo is registered in the name of Ahmad’s mother and was carrying some plants and saplings. The 26-year-old driver was coming from Gajraula and going to Sarai kale Khan. A case has been registered.” While Vehram Khan was a civil defence volunteer currently deployed at GB Pant Hospital, there were no details about the other deceased or the injured. Khan’s family later took his body from the Sabzi Mandi mortuary. “His wife, Misbah, has gone to her maternal home during her pregnancy, so we gave her father the news,” said Zaidan Khan, the elder brother. “They will reach Delhi by Wednesday evening.’ Zaidan said Vehram had left home around 5am to drop his mother at Jafrabad from where she was to board a bus to Rampur. “Our mother was going there for our cousin’s wedding on April 2,” said Zaidan. Vehram had hoped to rush home, shower and rush to the hospital where he was on duty at the vaccination centre. When Vehram did not return home, Zaidan asked the younger brother, Hannan Khan, to go and check. Hannan disclosed, “I reached Jafrabad and was told my brother had left after dropping our mother. While turning, I saw people gathered on the road near the bridge loop. They said a scooter rider was killed. We rushed to the hospital to find our worst fears confirmed. Police told us he was hit from behind soon and the tempo ran him over too.” Maroof, who was sleeping just a few feet away from where the three were hit by the tempo, kept thanking god. He explained that the night shelter got packed and was filled with mosquitos, so a lot of homeless people preferred sleeping in the open. He added that a fourth person usually slept at the accident spot but had gone to buy beedi and survived. “Someone had told me to move from my normal place, but I am glad I did not change my location. I could have been the man under the tempo’s rear wheel,” said the native of West Bengal. “I was startled awake by a loud bang and ran to see that the truck had crushed the scooter driver and the pavement sleepers. Thirteen minutes later, a police patrol arrived.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/speeding-tempo-crushes-scooterist-and-a-homeless-two-others-critical/articleshow/81790139.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Arhtiyas oppose Centre’s directive on direct payment to farmers||BATHINDA: The arhtiyas (commission agents) are up in arms in Punjab against the Union food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal’s latest missive to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh that no more relaxation to be given to state regarding direct payment to farmers upon procurement of grains. Taking a cue from the farmers, the arhityas have decided to hold a mahapanchayat at Bagha Purana town in Moga district on April 5 where they will decide their future course of action against the central government directive. The arhtiyas may take some tough decisions and are expected to give a call for closing mandis and not to cooperate in the procurement process. The procurement of food grains in Punjab is held through arhtiyas. Going by the central government stand on direct payment to farmers in digital mode, the arhtiyas had decided to close the mandis from April 1 but decided otherwise after the state government deferred the start of wheat procurement from April 1 to April 10. In all 130 lakh tone wheat is expected to arrive in mandis for procurement which is purchased at minimum support price. The entire procurement is done through arhtiyas and in return they get 2.5% commission. The commission has not been discontinued but arhtiyas will still lose a foothold as earlier farmers got money from them (arhtiyas) after sale of grains and the arhtiyas had the liberty to deduct the loaned money from farmers after procurement. Now, arhtiyas feel when farmers will get money directly into their accounts, they will have to visit farmers to get back the loaned money. “The central government is trying to cause strain between relations of farmer and arhtiyas apart from causing loss to arhtiyas for strongly standing by farmers in their struggle against the three contentious farm laws. In other states, farmers might not have cordial relations with arhtiyas but here in Punjab both are inseparable. We will oppose the directive of the central government and want the state government also to oppose it vehemently. We have decided to hold a mahapanchyayat at Bagha Purana on April 5, where we will decide on the next course of action,” said Vijay Kalra, president of Federation of Arhtiya association of Punjab. Arhtiyas, too, have got support from protesting farm groups. Senior farm leader Jagmohan Singh says the central government is taking anti-Punjab stance and finding ways to cause loss to various sections of society. “We will oppose such moves of the central government,” he said. BOX Ground not fertile in Punjab: Jyani The BJP too wants the move to be deferred for a year in Punjab. BJP leader and ex-minister Surjit Kumar Jyani feels the ground is not fertile in Punjab for making this move applicable and it should be deferred by at least a year and till then all the relevant records of landholding of farmers should be updated and loaded on the portal. “I will take up the matter with Piyush Goyal and BJP national president J P Nadda to get the move deferred by a year. I will seek time from the minister to meet him at the earliest,” Jyani told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/arhtiyas-oppose-centres-directive-on-direct-payment-to-farmers/articleshow/81790152.cms||Neel Kamal

Immunization officer of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Dr Smita Nalgirkar said that fresh stock of the vaccines was expected to arrive shortly. “As the vaccination drive is set to cover all above 45 years of age, we were planning to increase vaccination centres. Such a move will be implemented once the fresh stock of vaccine arrives,” she said. Stating that the newly-added group of beneficiaries would start getting vaccine from Thursday along with previously identified beneficiaries, Nalgirkar said that citizens should prefer online registrations over walk-ins. “The crowding at vaccination centres is most likely with population getting vaccine coverage. However, many of these centres are also serving as Covid care facilities and testing centres. Therefore, beneficiaries of vaccination programme should avoid walk-in considering the current peak situation of the pandemic,” she said. AMC medical officer with government health centre at N-11 Dr. Ravi Sawre said that those above 45 years of age are not required to produce any documents except proof of age. “The vaccination is not only beneficial in improving the immunity of any particular individual, but also in increasing the heard immunity against Covid-19. All target groups should take vaccination considering it as social responsibility,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/shortage-of-vaccine-to-hit-immunization-of-above-45/articleshow/81784170.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu to operate over 3,000 special buses for whole of poll week||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu transport department seems to have learned its lesson the hard way. During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, state-run transport corporations did not operate enough additional buses ahead of the voting day. As a result, thousands of passengers climbed on top of buses and hung on to the rear grilles to reach their native places to vote. This attracted sharp criticism and put the ruling AIADMK in an awkward situation eight to 12 hours before the votes were cast. To avoid such embarrassment this time, the transport department announced in advance that it will be running 3,090 special buses from Chennai in addition to 2,300 regular services during poll week.  special buses will depart only from Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT) at Koyambedu between Thursday and Saturday. For the next two days, these buses will pick up or drop passengers at major transit points in the city — Madhavaram, K K Nagar, Poonamallee and Tambaram. Buses to Andhra Pradesh will leave from Madhavaram. Poonamallee bus stand will be the origin for buses bound for Hosur, Arcot, Arani, Cheyyar, Vellore and Kancheepuram. Buses to Cuddalore and Chidambaram will depart from K K Nagar. Tambaram will be the pick-up point for passengers heading to Thanjavur, Kumbakonam Tiruvannamalai and Neyveli. Other buses to Nagapattinam, Madurai, Trichy, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Kanyakumari, Erode, Tiruppur, Coimbatore and Salem will leave from CMBT. A total of 2,264 special buses would be operated from Coimbatore, Salem, Tirupur and Bengaluru to make sure that there is no congestion, said an official release on Wednesday. Similarly, the department will run 2,115 special buses to Chennai to facilitate the return journey. In other parts of the state, 1,738 moffusil buses will be operated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-to-operate-over-3000-spl-buses-for-whole-of-poll-week/articleshow/81787060.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Ghaziabad||A taste of the e-way from Delhi to Meerut||GHAZIABAD: Commuters driving from Delhi to Meerut will get the first full expressway experience beginning Thursday when the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) opens the remaining two of the four phases of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) to traffic for a trial run. If one is using the access-controlled lanes of the expressway — the six middle lanes, three on either side — the 82km drive from Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan to Meerut will take under an hour. Earlier, the drive between the two cities used to take at least two hours. The formal inauguration of the expressway will, however, take place in about two months. The expressway has been opened in phases since May 2018 but it’s only from Thursday that commuters can use the access-controlled expressway lanes to drive all the way from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to Meerut without having to take diversions into service lanes. The drive from Meerut to Delhi, however, will still not be an uninterrupted one because the lanes for Delhi-bound traffic are closed at UP Gate because of the farmers’ agitation. But before the formal commissioning of the DME, officials said, NHAI hopes to complete the testing of its automated toll collection system, which would eliminate the need for a toll plaza, and also stop jaywalkers especially on the Noida Sector 62-Indirapuram, Chijarsi and Vijay Nagar stretches by raising the height of barricades by 1.5 metres. Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI, said: “On Tuesday, after conducting the final tests, we gave a representation at the Union ministry of road transport and highways and got a go-ahead for officially throwing open the entire DME from April 1. The inauguration will, however, take place in about two months. But for commuters, the DME is now open.” The foundation stone for upgrading the expressway was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December 2015. The project, divided into four packages, was expected to be over by November 2019, but a series of impediments — from delay in acquiring land to pollution, Covid restrictions and farmers’ protest — delayed the project by nearly 16 months. “Of the four packages, the stretch from Sarai Kale Khan to UP Gate was made operational in May 2018 and the 22.2km stretch from Dasna to Hapur in September 2019. Two other stretches — 19.2km from UP Gate to Dasna and 31.8km from Dasna to Meerut — took a long time to complete due to issues like delay in acquisition of land and other restrictions that stopped the work completely,” said Garg. Of the 82km, 60km is part of DME and 22km (Dasna to Hapur) is part of NH-9. It is a 14-lane highway, of which six lanes in the middle are DME and the eight others are NH-9. “About 4,500 streetlights have been installed and the road will have 200 CCTV cameras. There will be two toll plazas — at Chhijarsi in Ghaziabad and Kashi in Partapur, Meerut — and a successful testing of automatic number plate reader to the FASTag system was done. For now, we will not be charging toll fees on phases 2 and 4,” Garg said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/a-taste-of-the-e-way-from-delhi-to-meerut/articleshow/81793347.cms||Abhijay Jha

Though Reddy’s suspension order was ready on Tuesday, top officials said it was held up for chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s approval. The state government issued it on Wednesday evening as per the powers conferred in the All India Services (Discipline & Appeal) Rules, 1969. Top sources said, “The delay was because the PCCF office here did not send a formal proposal on suspension of Reddy as there was no violation of All India Services (Discipline & Appeal) Rules. This is said to one of the reasons for the delay. Finally, the state took a decision on its own.” PCCF (HoFF) G Saiprakash did not respond to repeated calls by TOI whether the state had sought a proposal from his office before taking a decision to suspend Reddy. Till the suspension order remains in force, Reddy’s headquarters will be the PCCF office at Nagpur. He will report to PCCF (HoFF). This is the first case in the history of Maharashtra forest department wherein an APCCF rank officer has been suspended. There are cases of suspension of DyCF, CCF and CF rank officials. On March 25, RFO Chavan had shot herself with her service revolver following harassment by her boss DyCF Vinod Shivkumar, who has been sent to 14 days MCR by a Dharni court. Since then, there is pressure from all bodies and political leaders to make Reddy a co-accused in the RFO suicide case. Meanwhile, the anticipatory bail application filed by Reddy before civil judge senior division (CJSD), Achalpur, has been kept for hearing on April 3. On Wednesday, the court issued notice to the state asking why bail should not be granted to the applicant. The court has recorded that the applicant is not named in the FIR, and no criminal law is set into motion. There is no harm to the applicant at present therefore it is justifiable to hear the other side before granting interim relief and issued notice to the state. In another development, the member-secretary of Maharashtra State Commission for Women (MSCW) Anita Patil on March 29, has issued a notice to Reddy seeking clarification on the RFO’s suicide case in eight days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/apccf-ms-reddy-suspended-in-suicide-case/articleshow/81790182.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

It seems the animal birth control programme (ABC) is nowhere in the top priority list. The allocation for ABC programme, being implemented by the Kudumbashree, is less compared to previous years. Some local bodies have not even allocated fund for the programme in 2020-21. As many as 41 local bodies together allocated Rs 78 lakh for the programme in 2019-20. This has come down to Rs 40 lakh by 25 local bodies this year. Now the Kudumbashree is taking up works for which panchayats and municipalities had allocated fund in the 2019-20 budget. The local bodies told Kudumbashree that they don’t have fund for the ABC programme due to shortage in revenue and existing fund is being utilized for Covid-related works. Though some local bodies announced the project in the budget for 2021-22, the allocation of fund will be ensured in the next financial year only. “We have reached an agreement with Tripunithura municipality to conduct ABC programme in their limit for Rs 2.10 lakh as against Rs 5.80 lakh in 2019-20. They told us the municipality doesn’t have fund to allocate for the programme as it faces shortage in revenue due to the pandemic situation. Same issue has been raised by other local bodies as well,” said a Kudumbashree Mission official in Ernakulam. The official said many local bodies are not keen to check the proliferation of stray dogs with many allocating fund to sterilize only 10 or 20 stray dogs each year. “We have announced the project in the budget for 2021-22. But allocation can be done only after looking into the availability of fund,” said Maradu municipality vice-chairperson Reshmi Sanal. The municipality had allocated Rs 6.30 lakh for the programme in 2019-20. Meanwhile, Kochi corporation carries out the programme by their veterinary team. Continuing ABC programme since its launch in 2015 has helped the local body bring down stray dog menace in the city. “We used to sterilize around 250 stray dogs per month in the initial stages of the project. Now it has come down to 80 per month,” said Sonika, veterinary doctor of the corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fund-allocation-for-abc-programme-takes-a-hit-in-dist/articleshow/81787092.cms||---

The move is expected to end congestion around Yusuf Sarai Market on Aurbindo Marg. At present, surface parking rates are Rs 20 per hour, the same as automated tower parking.After being approved in the standing committee meeting, the proposal will be tabled in house for final approval. The decision to was taken after a team of traffic inspectors and SDMC officials surveyed Aurbindo Road and found that not even 40% of the automatic parking was being utilised. “A major reason for the automatic parking being under utilised is the Covid-19 pandemic, due to which most commuters have shifted from public modes of transport to private vehicles,” stated the proposal. “Illegal or free parking on Balbir Saxena Marg and equally priced surface parking that seems more convenient next to multi-level one is also another reason.” At Yusuf Sarai Road, there is parking space for 124 four-wheelers and 54 two-wheelers. Of this, 81 four-wheelers and 34 two-wheelers are on side of multi-level parking (near Gate 2 of Green Park Metro), so here, charges will be increased from Rs 20 to Rs 40, said an official.“We have proposed to enforce a ‘no parking’ zone on Balbir Saxena Marg and Yusuf Sari Market (beyond the permissible limit) by traffic police and zonal SDMC staff,” said Prem Jha, deputy commissioner at SDMC.Members of the deliberative wing stated that similar decisions might be taken at other places/ surface parking lots located next to multilevel parking in future, if these would not be utilised fully. “We had taken a similar decision for Hauz Khas and increased surface parking rates to Rs 30/hour, while keeping multi-level parking price to Rs 10 per hour,” said leader of the House Narendra Chawla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-doubles-rates-for-surface-parking/articleshow/81790230.cms||Vibha Sharma

One of the two thieves arrested on Wednesday in connection with the theft committed last month in Bijnor’s kotwali dehat area told police during the interrogation. Bijnor superintendent of police Dharm Veer Singh said two thieves broke into a public service centre owned by Nawab Haider on the intervening night of February 16 and 17. Following a complaint lodged by Haider that more than Rs 7 lakh was stolen from the centre, police had registered a case against the unidentified accused and launched a probe. On Wednesday, police claimed to have cracked the case with the arrest of two accused — Naushad and Ajaj, both in their early 30s— from Alipur under Nagina police station area. The SP said the accused were arrested from a restaurant on Wednesday with the help of a surveillance system. “The accused are habitual offenders and have several cases registered against them at different police stations. They confessed to have committed a robbery at the public service centre and fled with Rs 7 lakh cash and other valuables kept in an almirah. The accused told police that they had thought of mere thousands of rupees at the centre, but were overjoyed after getting the huge amount of money. They divided the money evenly. However, soon after the theft, buoyed Ajaj suffered a heart attack and was admitted to a private hospital. He had to squander a big chunk of the stolen money on his treatment. Naushad, however, spent the money in betting in Delhi,” said the SP. The SP added that police seized Rs 3.7 lakh cash and two pistols from their possession and impounded a bike that they had lifted from Phulsanda village. The SP, meanwhile, announced a reward of Rs5,000 for the police team for cracking the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/overjoyed-thief-suffers-heart-attack-after-seeing-huge-amount-of-stolen-money-spends-a-big-chunk-on-his-treatment/articleshow/81784178.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Interest waivers for Hry arhtiyas, industrialists||Chandigarh: A day before the Rabi procurement season starts, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced a major relief in outstanding payment of interest and penalties for the arhtiyas. They get a 40% interest waiver on default amount and 100% on penalties. The CM announced: “The two interest waivers are for those who hold plots in the grain and vegetable markets of the Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board (HSAMB) but are unable to pay their instalments on time for any reason. But they must clear the entire balance amount by June 15.” Khattar said the 2,421 allottees on the board’s defaulter list had an outstanding amount of Rs 1,131 crore, and after Wednesday’s announcement, they will get a benefit of Rs 370 crore. Haryana agriculture minister J P Dalal was present at the press conference where the CM announced a similar major relief in outstanding payment of interest and penalties for the manufacturers who owned plots of the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC). He said this was under the government’s ‘Vivaadon Ka Samadhan’ (dispute settlement) initiative. Khattar said the settlement scheme for dues will benefit more than 2,250 industrialists, and if they paid the outstanding plot cost and enhanced cost in one go, they’ll get a waiver 25% on overdue interest and 100% on penal interest. To freeze the interest liability up to March 31, they must pay the entire balance sum by June 30. The outstanding amount is about Rs 1,500 crore and the likely benefit Rs 225 crore. Extension fee rationalised The structure of the extension fee is rationalised with effect from April 1. The fourth and fifth year extension fee will be Rs 50 per square metre for the A category estates, Rs 25/sqm for the B category, and Rs 10/sqm for C. No extension beyond 6 years The industrialists will get no extension beyond six years, and the plot shall be put to mandatory auction through the HSIIDC. If the allottees surrender the plot, the HSIIDC will amend its refund rules to provide for a deduction of 10% of plot price (earnest money). With this, 50 % or 10% of the 90% balance amount paid by the allottee, whichever is less, will be charged. A maximum of 20% will be taken and the rest refunded. Getting occupation certificate simpler In cases where the requirements were complete but occupation certificate (OC) not issued on account of default in payment, the extension fee will be charged till the date of inspection, if done within six months from application. If the inspection came later or never, the extension fee will be charged till the date of application. The rule will come into force when the applicant clears the dues. Exit route for investors The amnesty scheme for the investors is extended till September 30. It is for those who made at least 25% of the proposed fixed capital investment, started commercial production, and paid all dues, including the extension fee. Discount for new plot holders New plot holders also get relief. If the pays the entire plot price within 60 days of the auction, they get a 10% discount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/interest-waivers-for-hry-arhtiyas-industrialists/articleshow/81790208.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Why homeless prefer pavements to shelters||NEW DELHI: The fear of theft, drugs and mosquitoes has been forcing several homeless to avoid night shelters and sleep on the pavements. The in-charge of the night shelter near Nigambodh Ghat where an accident took place on Wednesday morning said they accommodate about 80 people every night, but many prefer sleeping outside due to the heat. Deepak Pandit, a native of Varanasi living at the night shelter for the last three years, said those who do drugs avoid coming there and smoke and drink outside. “We get food twice a day at the shelter,” he added. However, Maroof, who was sleeping on the footpath when the accident occurred, said he didn’t like sleeping inside as people stole his belongings. “I am from Bengal. On my first day in Delhi, my mobile phone and wallet were robbed. That’s why I prefer sleeping outside. After a hard day at work, I barely manage to earn anything. If that is stolen, then there is no point in sleeping inside,” he added. When TOI reached the night shelter, 50-60 people were seen eating outside, while some were sleeping or eating inside. The night shelter was clean and the fans were functional. Ravi Kumar, the shelter in-charge, said, “I can’t force them, but arequest them to come inside or sleep on the inner side where there is no risk of traffic or vehicular movement. But they want to sleep on the footpath as the air blowing due to the movement of vehicles cools them in the heat. Some say they want to sleep outside because of the mosquitoes.” Bipin Rai, a member of Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, said there were 34,000 homeless people in Delhi and arrangements were there for 19,000-20,000. “Our aim is to ensure that people sleep inside the shelters, but we can’t force them. This problem doesn’t arise in winter. We also provide coolers when the temperature rises. The Kashmere Gate area is densely populated and around 30 night shelters are located there in a radius of 3-4 kilometres,” he added. Indu Prakash Singh, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed shelter monitoring committee, said there was a need for more deaddiction shelters too. “We need to have speed breakers where night shelters are situated. The government and civil society should also proactively engage with homeless people to ensure they choose night shelters over footpaths,” added Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-homeless-prefer-pavements-to-shelters/articleshow/81790198.cms||---
---||Delhi||North Delhi Municipal Corporation to revive pedestrianisation project at Karol Bagh, traders miffed||NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Tuesday issued an order for reviving its pedestrianisation project at Karol Bagh from April 1. “We have decided to start implementing the project from April 1 and also directed the officials concerned to talk to the market associations and convince them to support the concept, which will automatically benefit them in the long term. We have invested a lot in this project and can’t let it go just like that,” said north corporation mayor Jai Prakash. The order, which was issued on Tuesday, stated that the single-lane traffic movement on Ajmal Khan Road due to non-availability of public transport options and Covid-19 pandemic is hereby withdrawn with immediate effect. “The pedestrianisation of Ajmal Khan Road shall come into effect as approved by UTTIPEC in 2010 from Karol Bagh Metro Station to DB Gupta Road, along with one-way traffic circulation and parking management on various nearby streets,” it read. Earlier in January, north corporation deputy commissioner Himanshu Gupta had written to Delhi government in this regard. “To implement the scheme, the civic body will need services of 15 civil defence volunteers for traffic management in the area from 11 am to 9pm for three months,” the letter stated. However, the decision has not gone down well with the local traders. They claim that they have already been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and will face huge losses if the pedestrianisation plan is revived during summer. Murli Mani, president of Beopar Mandal, Karol Bagh, said that they were not in favour of the civic body’s decision. “We are not against the pedestrianisation project, but now is not the right time to revive it. We have still not recovered from the losses faced due to the pandemic. Shoppers will stop coming to the market if their vehicles will not be allowed inside it. Amid a recent spike in corona cases, people do not want to travel in public transport,” he said. Karol Bagh’s Ajmal Khan Road, which had for decades remained clogged with haphazard parking and encroachments, was declared a pedestrian zone in May 2019. The first-of-its-kind project had soon become an example for other congested markets like Chandni Chowk, Connaught Place, Lajpat Nagar, Kamla Nagar and Krishna Nagar. But in July, traders had removed the barricades to allow one-way movement of traffic on Ajmal Khan Road after taking permission from the civic body. They argued that the move was aimed at increasing footfall in the market post lockdown. “However, this resulted in coming back of traffic jams due to parking on both sides of connecting roads such as Padam Singh and Arya Samaj Roads. Unlike the plan, cars were parked vertically (not horizontally) and in two to three rows,” said Anita Sharma, a resident of Karol Bagh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-to-revive-pedestrianisation-project-at-karol-bagh-traders-miffed/articleshow/81790255.cms||Vibha Sharma

Police are on the lookout for the assailants. They identified the main attacker as Murugan, who owned a two-acre plot near the site where L&T recently commissioned a 100MW solar plant for Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) India Limited. L&T has condemned the murder and sought protection for its staff. Police said Murugan had gone to the site office twice earlier in the day and asked for accountant Thiyagarajan, 51, of Korattur in Chennai. In the evening, Murugan and some relatives again turned up at the site office. When they learned Thiyagarajan was present inside, Murugan and three others barged in and hacked him to death and injured his colleague Krishnan, 40, of Chettikulam village near Alwarkurichi. Thiyagarajan’s body was sent to the Tenkasi government hospital for autopsy while Krishnan was rushed to the Tirunelveli government medical college hospital for intensive care. A senior police officer said a few middlemen had bought land in the area for as low as Rs 70,000 to Rs 80,000 per acre and then sold it to the company at more than thrice the price (Rs 2.5 lakh per acre). The two acres land owned by Murugan and his family was their only asset and they were not ready to sell it for the price offered by the middlemen. The officer said the middlemen purchased the land surrounding Murugan’s land, leaving him with no way to enter it. The Tenkasi district Superintendent of Police (SP) G Suguna Singh visited the spot and conducted preliminary investigations. The Alangulam police registered a case and are on the lookout for the accused. In a statement L&T condemned the murder and sought protection for its staff. “A precious innocent life has been lost and to be under attack from lawless elements during these uncertain times is absolutely shocking and unacceptable,” said whole time director and senior executive vice president (utilities) of the company T Madhavadas. “We face huge difficulties when executing projects – the challenges of unforgiving terrains, harsh climatic conditions, the danger of uncontrolled lawless elements, the difficult of being miles away from home and loved ones – all to build infrastructure for the country… These are particularly difficult circumstances due to the strict COVID-19 safety protocols and at such a juncture, it is sad and shocking that we are under attack. We go out of our way to ensure the safety of our own people at our sites, but we seek the protection of the authorities and the police to keep our people safe. Such an incident should never have been allowed to happen,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gang-barges-into-lt-office-kills-accountant-injures-another-worker/articleshow/81799320.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab BJP members seek year’s trial for e-payment of MSP||CHANDIGARH: Punjab BJP members will meet Union minister of food and public distribution Piyush Goyal to seek one more year before implementing direct e-payment of minimum support price (MSP) of crops into farmers’ bank accounts, bypassing arhtiyas. Harjit Singh Grewal of the state BJP unit said on Wednesday that the agriculture sector needed reforms for sure but Punjab was not prepared fully yet to start this from the 2021 Rabi marketing season (RMS) on April 1. He said: “(Fellow party member) Surjit Kumar Jyani and I will attempt to convince Piyush Goyal to try out the e-payment system in two or three grain markets or districts first.” Grewal and Jyani mediate between the central government and the protesting farmers but since Jyani is unwell, the meeting with the Union minister will have to wait three days. Grewal reasoned that many small farmers across Punjab might not have bank accounts and even the arthiyas were unprepared for this change of system. He said: “The central government means to make the grain procurement system on MSP transparent, since a big nexus of politicians, government officials, and businessmen has looted hundreds of crores under the old system. We have seen how wheat and paddy is brought illegally from non-MSP states such as Bihar to sell it in Punjab for MSP.” The BJP member said that the e-payment of MSP into farmers’ accounts will also help identify the absentee NRI (non-resident Indian) farmers. Grewal said: “Every scheme has good and bad aspects, so we will request Piyush Goyal to first start it as a pilot project in Punjab to put the infrastructure and systems in place.” On March 27, Goyal had written a demi-official letter to Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh that it was in the overall interest of farmers and mandatory under Public Finance Management System (PFMS) since 2018 to get direct online payment but the state government had time and again sought extension of the implementation deadline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pb-bjp-members-seek-years-trial-for-e-payment-of-msp/articleshow/81790237.cms||Sanjeev Verma

One side voyage of 130 nautical miles takes nearly 13- 14 hours. The cruise vessel ‘Mumbai Maiden’ has the capacity of 300 passengers and will sail two round trips in a week. It has gaming lounge, VIP lounge, entertainment on deck and other modern amenities. “Compared to 139 cruise calls at the Indian ports in 2014, we have 450 calls now despite the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of tourists before 2014 was one lakh which increased to 4.5 lakh in 2019-20,” said Mansukh Mandaviya, union minister for ports, shipping and waterways (Independent charge), after inaugurating the service via video conference. Rajiv Agarwal, managing director, Essar Ports Ltd, “The ferry terminal at Hazira was commissioned in record time and it is part of our strategic plan to reduce congestion on roads, cut fuel consumption and limit air pollution. The new route to Diu will serve as an outlet for recreation for the people of Gujarat and boost the cruise and ferry sector in maritime space.” Under the Maritime Vision 2030, the central government is aiming for more than 350 cruise ships, 3,000 plus cruise calls per annum, more than three cruise training academies and five million cruise passengers by 2030, Mandaviya said.

---||Delhi||N corpn trying to make 5-storey homes possible||New Delhi: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has proposed to increase the height limit for residential plotted buildings by 2.5m under the new norms being formulated for Master Plan of Delhi 2041 so that five-storey structures can come up.Mayor Jai Prakash has made this proposal to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, who heads the advisory council drafting the new master plan. He has also written to Union ministry of housing and urban affairs in this regard.Under the existing revised Master Plan of Delhi 2021, the maximum permissible height for residential plotted housing is 15 metres. Additional relaxations are provided for features like stilt parking and solar panels, which reduce the burden on public utilities.A senior planning department official said the height increase approved by the empowered committee would depend on the capacity of common infrastructure utility services, sewage lines, etc to bear additional load from urban density.“The population density is increasing rapidly and the availability of land is becoming a serious cause for concern. We have proposed to raise the permissible height for residential buildings from 15m to 17.5m so that growing families can maximise the utilisation of land available with them,” said the mayor.Delhi is undergoing the fastest urban expansion in the world and the UN world urbanisation prospects state that the metropolis is set to become the world’s most populous urban agglomeration by 2028. MPD 2021 had projected that out of 1,483 sq km of Delhi’s geographical area, 920 sq km would be urbanised.According to the 2011 census, Delhi’s population was around 1.6 crore. However, it has crossed 2 crore in the last decade. “The pace at which the population is increasing, agencies do not have land to create new housing projects. There is no other way but to allow relaxation in building height norms,” said Prakash.A senior official said the proposal could only be made applicable in planned areas where there was scope for augmenting common services like sewage lines, parking space, water allocation, etc.“The number of dwelling units in any area is calculated on the services available there. New dwelling units will create additional load on the already crumbling infrastructure. There is already a massive demand-supply gap in water supply. Parking space shortage even chokes planned colonies at night. The increase should be allowed only after a proper study of these areas and unauthorised regularised colonies should not be made a part of the proposal,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-trying-to-make-5-storey-homes-possible/articleshow/81790281.cms||Paras Singh

---||Delhi||Students of municipal schools being denied dry rations, says AAP||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Wednesday alleged that the home delivery of ration scheme had been stalled by BJP only to harass the poor.Calling BJP an anti-poor party, Bharadwaj in a press conference stressed that despite Delhi government providing dry rations to North Delhi Municipal Corporation, it was only distributed to students in one school of the civic body. On March 19, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta, north corporation mayor Jai Prakash and other political functionaries had inaugurated the scheme.“After the inauguration, students of only one school were given the dry rations allocated by Delhi government. When our councillors raised this issue in the House meeting, they learnt that the tender process had not yet begun. I feel it is a matter of immense shame that the Delhi BJP chief inaugurated the scheme without even releasing the tender for it. This is the fraud and the truth of BJP,” said Bharadwaj.Under the midday meal scheme, students of government and civic schools were provided cooked meals every day. However, due to the pandemic, this became unviable. Delhi government then introduced a scheme under which the parents of students were called to the schools and given dry rations.Terming the allegations baseless, mayor Jai Prakash said it was false propaganda against the corporation. “CM Kejriwal had also inaugurated the dry ration programme under the midday meal scheme after which distribution started in government schools. Similarly, even we inaugurated the scheme. The process of procuring dry rations is on. Once that is complete, distribution will be done in all schools of the corporation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/students-of-municipal-schools-being-denied-dry-rations-says-aap/articleshow/81790313.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||2 lakh Haryana farmers not signed up for selling||JIND: While the procurement starts from Thursday, only 63.66% area under wheat and mustard in Haryana is on the agriculture department’s ‘meri fasal mera byora’ portal, registration where is mandatory for selling any crop. The farmers accuse the state government of harassing the protesters but the agriculture department denies it. Of the 85.31 lakh cumulative acres under rabi crop in the state, only 54.31 lakh acres is registered. Out of 8.17 lakh farmers, 6.35 lakh farmers signed up on the portal this year, accounting for 40.80 lakh acres, of which the department has verified 35.13 lakh acres. About 5 lakh acres remains to be vetted, while 36.34% area is yet to be on record. The portal annoys farmers even after registration, because it requires them to attach family IDs. Jind grain market secretary Sanjeev Jangra said: “We are ready for procurement and four agencies—HWC, DSFC, FCI and Hafed—are involved. The produce is expected to arrive from April 10.” Agriculture department director Hardeep Kadyan said: “In 300 mandis of the state, there is no impact of the farmer’s agitation on crop registration. The farmers have failed to upload their details for other reasons. The portal will reopen for two days on April 5 and 6.” Tehsildars and naib tehsildars have orders to help farmers upload their crop details. There’s a help desk at the gate of every mandi to assist the farmers with gate pass, lifting, and queries. The payment is promised be within 48 hours of lifting. The department has reported 1 lakh cases of bank account mismatch. Kadyan said: “It is being sorted out to enable direct money transfer without delay.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2l-hry-farmers-not-signed-up-for-selling/articleshow/81790266.cms||VIJENDER KUMAR
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Drone survey of key city areas soon||Thiruvananthapuram: The town planning department will conduct an aerial survey using UAVs/drones as part of implementing the local area plan (LAP) and town planning scheme (TPS) in the city. The chief town planner (CTP) has reported that the scheme areas have to be surveyed by UAVs/drones for preparing land-use maps and permission for conducting the aerial survey has been sought. The state government has constituted a committee comprising four members to monitor and supervise the survey as it will require the movement of a drone in restricted areas and taking of photographs and videos of special security zones in the city. The committee includes CTP (planning) as the chairman, AMRUT mission director, city police commissioner and ADGP (Intelligence, state special branch). As per a government order issued in this regard, the committee will entrust an agency for the drone survey and they should ensure the security of the installations and confidentiality of the content obtained through the survey. The committee should also direct the agency to give special care when surveying the areas where central government institutions are located. Thiruvananthapuram is one among the 25 cities in India which have been chosen for the implementation of LAP and TPS, as part of AMRUT project, on a pilot basis. The state high-powered steering committee (SHPSC) meeting had approved the proposal of chief town planner (planning) to make necessary amendments in the Kerala Town and Country Planning Act, 2016 for the formulation and implementation of LAP and TPS in the city. The CTP will submit proposal for making these amendments. The CTP had informed that the Act of 2016 has provisions for land pooling. But it requires certain amendments for preparation and implementation of TPS like inclusion of provision to prepare land pooling schemes for projects which are not included in master plans or DTP schemes and provision for developer entities to prepare land pooling schemes. LAP envisages redeveloping city areas which have got congested over time due to unscientific land use without adequate infrastructure or public facilities. Congested inner city areas, non-availability of road space and public spaces will be addressed with the implementation of LAP. TPS is meant to be implemented in areas identified for planned urbanization in the future. The planning process consists of merging and redistribution of land parcels in the urban expansion zone. The area of the TPS can range from 50 to 500 hectares or more. Palayam, Thycaud, Vazhuthacaud and Thampanoor have been chosen for LAP and Mulloor, Venganoor, Kottapuram and Vizhinjam have been chosen for TPS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/drone-survey-of-key-city-areas-soon/articleshow/81787147.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The city unit of the BJP has taken a decision in this regard. In the recent civic polls, the BJP had won on 69 seats even as the Congress got only seven. The BJP has decided to deny the post of the leader of opposition saying that the Congress had been completely rejected and had not even been able to decide on the party’s leader in the board. The BJP has also argued that the Congress had won less than 10% of seats in the VMC. The post of the opposition leader is a tradition followed by the VMC since several years now even as the municipal corporations’ act has no provisions for the same. The leader is also given a car and an office. The Congress has argued that there were no provisions for cars for any elected functionaries and the same yardstick should be used for both parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/in-vmc-bjp-denies-cong-opposition-leaders-post/articleshow/81786254.cms||---
---||Goa||In global appeal, rector of Basilica seeks support to replaster ‘deteriorating’ structure||Panaji: The rector of the Basilica of Bom Jesus has appealed to the faithful to support a move to re-plaster the world heritage monument. In a video addressed to ‘Goenkars around the globe’, Fr Patricio Fernandes has highlighted the deteriorating condition of the monument, which began with the removal of its plaster in the 1950s. A timely decision is required to protect the structure, Fernandes has said in his global appeal. Exposed and facing the onslaught of the monsoons, humidity for the last nearly 70 years, the laterite stone is beginning to show signs of deterioration with water now dripping inside the Basilica during the rains, prompting experts in the country and abroad to push for immediate lime plastering. It is the “only time tested solution to conserve it” and stop it from collapsing, Fernandes said. The rector said that he was once against the plastering, but changed his stand on seeing the decline of the structure — the way “the stone has been irreversibly damaged by weathering”, how in areas it “crumbles into powder upon touching it”. Fernandes also interspersed his appeal with history lessons on how the Basilica came to be de-plastered as a part of Portuguese prime minister Antonio Salazar’s propaganda exercise. “The red laterite look of the Basilica is a rather recent look. It was fully plastered like every other church in Goa for close to 350 years, right from its inauguration in 1605 till the 1950s,” he said. That is till Portugal sent an architectural mission to renovate monuments of Old Goa for the Exposition of St Francis Xavier in 1952. “The architectural renovations in Old Goa were a means to prove just how rooted the Portuguese presence in Goa was. Besides the Basilica, the plaster of the Arc of Viceroy was also removed, but the arc soon collapsed showing how important this coat of plaster was to the laterite stone,” Fernandes said. With these acts of political propaganda masquerading as architectural conservation carried out without so much as giving a thought to the harsh climatic conditions in Goa, the Basilica has been dying a slow death ever since, the rector said. Aware of the steady weakening of the Basilica, the archdiocese of Goa and Daman and ASI are seeking technical and scientific guidance, Fernandes said, adding that any re-plastering would be carried out in consultation and with the consent of the archdiocese. To arrest other problems, in the next phase, a study will have to be undertaken of the roofscape and unscientific structural changes undertaken in the 1950s, he said. However, Fernandes said that before taking any decision they would like to discuss it with the faithful as it is a very sensitive matter. He invited the public to come visit and take a look at the “precarious condition” of the Basilica for themselves and even send in suggestions via email.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-global-appeal-rector-of-basilica-seeks-support-to-replaster-deteriorating-structure/articleshow/81793397.cms||---
---||Pune||Mathadi issue persists despite series of meets||Pune: The arrest of two persons, purportedly belonging to a Mathadi workers’ union, on charges of harassing a transporter and demanding protection money has prompted industry bodies to raise the issue of harassment by a section of the union and its effect on small industries. The issues we generally see in the Hinjawadi area regarding the Mathadi workers’ unions are that they turn up to demand that their workers be employed, or that they be paid even though they are not required. The fact that a complaint has been filed in this regard is encouraging,” said Col Charanjeet Singh Bhogal (retd), chief operating officer, Hinjawadi Industries Association. Industry bodies said that harassment is rampant in manufacturing belts. “Many factory owners do not complain to the police as they feel no action will be taken by them, while they will continue to be at the receiving end of threats from goons employed by the unions,” said Dilip Batval, secretary, Federation of Chakan Industries. “An analysis of the purpose of Mathadi, Hamal, and Other Manual Workers’ Welfare Act of 1969 Act would indicate that it is meant to protect unprotected workers. The applicability of this act’s provisions will disrupt industrial activity across the state,” said Prashant Girbane, director general, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mathadi-issue-persists-despite-series-of-meets/articleshow/81790276.cms||---
---||Pune||JMFC likely to surrender in court today||Pune: A woman judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) from the Vadgaon Maval court, who is facing an alleged bribery case, is likely to surrender before a special anti-corruption court here on Thursday in accordance with a Supreme Court (SC) directive. Post-surrender, the special court may consider her plea for a regular bail on merits. On March 22, an SC bench had dismissed the JMFC’s special leave petition against the Bombay high court’s order of March 3 that rejected her anticipatory bail plea. The SC granted her two weeks to surrender before the Pune special court and said no coercive action be taken against her till then.  On January 14, the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) had trapped a woman on the charge of accepting Rs3 lakh from a dairy farmer “on behalf of the JMFC for managing decision in a criminal case in his favour”. On February 23, a Pune sessions court rejected the JMFC’s anticipatory bail plea. She then moved the HC. An ACB officer told TOI, “The Pune court will hear the case on Thursday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jmfc-likely-to-surrender-in-court-today/articleshow/81790327.cms||Vishwas Kothari
---||Chandigarh||SAD asks Capt to oppose DBT scheme||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday asked Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to oppose the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme for purchase of food grains on minimum support price (MSP) resolutely instead of seeking time to implement it. The SAD leaders also urged the Union government to reconsider imposing the scheme forcefully in Punjab. SAD spokesperson and former cabinet minister Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said Amarinder was at fault for agreeing to implement the scheme from the forthcoming Rabi season. “It is because of this acquiescence of the chief minister that the Union government is now compelling the government to implement the scheme immediately,” he added. Asking the chief minister to explain why he had not defended the state’s rights to dispense money for food grains purchased from farmers through arthiyas as per the age-old practice, Dr Cheema said the chief minister had even failed to meet the Prime Minister on this issue in the past one year. “Similarly, no effort has been made to take along all other political parties to form a consensus so that the move to infringe on the powers of the state as well as weaken the federal system could be stopped in its tracks,” he added. The SAD leader also asked the central government to reconsider implementing the DBT scheme in Punjab. He said a consensus had emerged in Punjab that the scheme would create further complications. “Farmers who take land on lease as well as NRIs would be affected and there are no effective safeguards to watch over their interests,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-asks-capt-to-oppose-dbt-scheme/articleshow/81790296.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: No extension in stamp duty waiver, Ready Reckoner rates unchanged for 2021-22||PUNE: The state government on Wednesday announced it would not extend the 2% stamp duty waiver on property registrations, a condition that had boosted the real estate sector after the pandemic-induced lockdown, but kept the Ready Reckoner (RR) rates unchanged for the 2021-22 financial year. On a brighter note, the 1% stamp duty waiver for women home buyers, as announced in the state budget on March 8, would come into effect from Thursday. The concession is only for residential units and not for plots of land. Besides, the concession will not be applicable if there is a male co-owner of the unit. The state government had in August 2020 announced a 3% waiver on stamp duty from September to December and subsequently a 2% waiver from January-March in 2021 to boost the realty sector during the pandemic. The waiver had led to a significant upswing in property registrations. The RR rates, which were revised six months ago, would be continued with for this financial year, stated the circular issued by the government on Wednesday evening. State revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat tweeted that the regular rates would be applicable from April 1. Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (Credai) national chairman Satish Magar told TOI that the government had announced the waiver as a short-term booster after the lockdown. “We had again approached the government for an extension of the concession for three months. The government has its compulsions and did not agree to the extension,” he said. State Inspector General of Registration and Stamps Shravan Hardikar said that according to the government’s direction, the Annual Statement Rate for 2021-2022 would be the same as it was in 2020-21. The RR rates for residential and commercial properties are announced on April 1 ever year. In 2020, the revised rates were announced in September because of the Covid-19 pandemic. On an average, the RR rates were increased by 1.74% last year. The highest average increase (3.91%) in the RR rates was registered in Pune district. In Mumbai, the average upward revision was 0.6%. Credai national vice-president Shantilal Kataria said they had demanded reduction in the RR rates as per the Maharashtra Stamp (Determination of True Market Value of Property) Rules, 1995. “We are, however, happy that the government has kept it untouched. A certain amount of buoyancy was witnessed in the market in the last 5-6 months,” he said. Suhas Merchant, immediate past-president of Credai (Pune Metro) and national chairman of Credai’s statistics and standards committee, said, “We are happy to see that our submission (on RR rates) has been considered.” Niranjan Hiranandani, managing director of Hiranandani Group and national president of National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco), said while Maharashtra had played a “stellar role” by announcing the stamp duty waiver last year, it could have continued the arrangement. “We will request the state to reconsider their decision, he said. Sachin Shingavi, president of the Association of Real Estate agents, said, “The decision will be beneficial to the builders and consumers. It will definitely have an impact on sales in near future.” Activist Shrikant Joshi said, “The government should have continued with the stamp duty concession for three more months.” THE BOOSTERIn August 2020, the state government decided to slash the stamp duty on sale deed documents registered between September 1 and December 31, 2020, by 3%.

---||Goa||Goa sees 200 cases a day, highest in 5 months||PANAJI: Goa reported its highest daily Covid-19 case count in five months after it saw 200 fresh infections on Wednesday. The quick spike, from 60-odd daily cases in the first week of March to more than twice that number now, has doctors pleading for caution. Goa’s positivity rate, too, is among the country’s highest with 8.5% as against the national average of 5%. State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar termed the rise “alarming”, and said the graph is set to rise further in the days to come. “What we see is a rising trend, and we really don’t know how much further it will go. Even last year, nobody could predict the upper margin,” he said. “Covid-19 has been giving us surprise after surprise,” Betodkar said. “The biggest surprise is what Maharashtra is going through right now. Most bigger states and cities are showing a rise. Looking at their graph, I think our cases will go up too, but the advantage we have is that all departments have the experience to handle the Covid-19 situation, unlike last year.” When Goa reported seven cases in March 2020, he said they believed Goa would have around 100 cases, but then a day came when Goa reported 700 cases in one day. However, he said much will depend on support from the public, he said, specifying that the biggest support people can offer is getting themselves vaccinated without delay. Health minister Vishwajit Rane too pleaded with citizens to observe Covid-appropriate behaviours. “In view of the rising cases in the state, it is my humble appeal to citizens to follow all SOPs of wearing a mask & following strict social distancing norms as per government directions,” he posted. “We will interact with the expert committee on further steps to be taken to keep the virus under control.” Betodkar, too, said, “Police and district collectors have been told by the government to crack down on people not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing in public.” On Thursday, the mortality count rose to 831, with the death of a 64-year-old man from Margao at Goa Medical College (GMC). Also, 36 persons were hospitalised on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-sees-200-cases-a-day-highest-in-5-mnths/articleshow/81793491.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tourists spots in city hope weekend will draw large crowds||Expecting large crowds this weekend, major tourist spots in and around the city have revamped arrangements so have a safe visit. While Madras Crocodile Bank has increased entry fee to control crowd, Muttukadu Boathouse plans to extend boating timings from 5pm to 7pm and has brought in more boats to maintain social distancing. “We have also computerised ticketing so people don’t have to wait in long queues,” said the manager of the boathouse. The crocodile bank has several edutainment programmes planned. Steffi John, the bank’s educational officer, said they will hold sessions on snakes, and explain how to respond to snake bites. “We will also bring out our baby anaconda,” said Steffi. The bank will hold virtual sessions on poisonous snakes like the cobras and vipers on their official social media page. All tourist spots, including the Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Vandalur and Mammallapuram, have also put in place strict Covid protocols with security personnel deployed to ensure visitors follow rules. At Mammallapuram, visitors will receive Covid safety pamphlets at the entrances. “We have set up sanitisers at every gate. Security personnel will also distribute masks to those who don’t have one,” said a Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC) official. “We get visitors from all over the country, hence we have to be stricter in implementing the norms.” The TTDC said more people will be deployed at tourist sites to ensure proper implementation of safety norms. Such moves may have convinced Lalitha Raghu, a maid who plans to take her children to Vandalur zoo. “We all need an outing,” she said. However, many are still skeptical about visiting such popular spots. Officials at these sites are hoping to see more tourists this weekend. “We need more visitors to cover maintenance and expenditure,” said the Muttukadu Boathouse manager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tourists-spots-in-city-hope-weekend-will-draw-large-crowds/articleshow/81787246.cms||Aditi R
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore North to see close contest||Coimbatore: It is all set to be a close contest between AIADMK and DMK at Coimbatore North constituency this year. While in 2016, AIADMK’s P R G Arun Kumar won by a small margin of 7,724 votes, the victory margin for big parties may shrink further.While DMK hopes it can claim the urban constituency based on the anti-incumbency factor, AIADMK aims to hold on to the constituency based on infrastructure it has created over the last decade.Considering the general satisfaction among the public in parts of RS Puram, Saibaba Colony and Vadavalli with infrastructure including re-modelled DB Road, Vadavalli bus stand, widened roads, closed drains, improved water supply from the Athikadavu–Avinashi scheme and adequate power supply, it would seem to be a cakewalk for the AIADMK candidate. However, it will be tough for Amman Arjunan to hold on to the constituency.Though Arjunan has been an MLA in Coimbatore South, he is considered a new face in the constituency, compared to DMK’s V M Shanmugasundaram, who has been the Vadavalli panchayat president for the last 15 years. “His wife was president for five years. His family is familiar to families in Vadavalli for the last three generations and most importantly, he lives here,” says Senthil Kumar, a hotelier. “He is easy to approach and helps us to solve issues like land conversion and layout approval. But we have not seen P R G Arun Kumar in our constituency frequently.”Arjunan is fighting against an undeniable anti-incumbency wave that is being seen across the state after 10 years of AIADMK rule. He is also hit by internal politics. There are growing rumours that a large section of party workers is not working to their full potential, because they are disappointed that a leader they favoured was not given MLA ticket. Luckily, him being from the naidu community is not expected to matter, because of the big migrant population in Vadavalli, devanga chettiar and north Indian population in R S Puram and Gandhipuram.While Arjunan, who is campaigning despite a fractured leg, has only been able to request people to look at his performance in Coimbatore South and the party’s performance, Shanmugasundaram has been focusing on critical infrastructure issues like growing traffic congestion in Vadavalli. “He has promised to construct a bridge from Lawley Road to Vadavalli Junction, improve drinking water supply in Vadavalli and set up a government arts college and polytechnic college at the Marudhamalai foothills by approaching the temple devasthanam,” said Sunderraj of Saibaba Colony, a retired businessman. While pro-BJP supporters among the upper middle-class neighbourhoods are expected to add to AIADMK’s vote share, the party also has to deal with the growing anger against GST among hundreds of small-scale industry owners and workers in Gandhimanagar and Ganapathy. “They have made it impossible for us to survive and do business by levying 18% tax on our products, forcing us to file returns within a month even when we don’t receive payment within a month and fine us Rs 50 per day for delay in filing returns,” says J James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises. While MNM candidate Thangavel is not a known face among seasoned voters, youngsters wanting change are expected to cut into AIADMK’s vote share in the constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coimbatore-north-to-see-close-contest/articleshow/81790390.cms||---

Chugh claimed the Congress government has deliberately blocked and scuttled the Centre’s scheme of direct payment to farmers’ bank accounts. He said the Centre launched the scheme in 2018 after consulting all states. While almost all states implemented it, Punjab has taken no initiative and deprived the farmers of the state of benefits, said Chugh. The BJP leader added that even Union minister Piyush Goyal’s suggestion to the chief minister to implement the scheme has not borne any fruit. “This has exposed the chief minister’s dual and deceptive politics,” he said. Chugh claimed Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been making all efforts to double the farmers’ income but the Congress chief ministers had been working against it to harm the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amarinder-harming-farmers-interests-chugh/articleshow/81790334.cms||---

Chodankar also said that the state has ignored the directives of the Supreme Court that every state should have its own police act. “The BJP government wants to use Goa police as a toy to harass the political opponents both at the lowest level and the highest level,” said Chodankar. Congress said that the Goa Police department is still dependent on Bombay police manual which leaves a loophole to allow criminals to go scot-free. He questioned why Goa police was not pursuing the matter with the state government. Chodankar highlighted the case of history sheeter and Delhi resident Ajju Sindolli who went to the high court and got the history-sheeter tag dropped on the basis that Goa doesn’t have a police manual. When questions veered towards the party’s internal affairs, particularly the criticism directed towards him by senior Congressmen, Chodankar said, “internal matters cannot be discussed with everyone.” Chodankar did say that the party’s ongoing membership drive is going well with candidates shortlisted for the coming assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-delaying-police-manual/articleshow/81793537.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Just a month ago, multiple traps were laid to catch straying big cats, but none of them could be caught. Confirming the development, divisional forest officer (DFO), Meerut, Rajesh Kumar said, “Our teams have been patrolling the forested Jaroda and Bhadoli villages where a big cat was sighted. Earlier, there were rumours of three leopard cubs being spotted. However, they eventually turned out to be kittens of a normal cat. Kithore area is quite closer to the natural habitat of leopards, so the animal would have strayed out into the human habitat. We are keeping a vigil.” In February, forest teams had camped for at least a fortnight to capture a straying big cat, but failed, and then it was assumed that the feline had moved out. According to Shiv Kumar, a villager, “Most of the residents in these villages are farmers and, at present, wheat and mango need their attention. However, with the looming threat of big cats, there is a panic. Last time also, we had alerted forest department authorities, but they could not capture the leopard. Later, they told us that it had moved out of the area. Now, it’s here again. It’s a responsibility of the forest department to allay our fear by taking some definite measures in this direction.” Notably, the possibility of spotting a leopard in this area is quite rare. In February 2014, Meerut had hit headlines when a leopard was found prowling in Cantonment Hospital at the heart of the city. Schools had to be shut for three days and Army was called in as the forest department had no means to capture the big cat. But, the leopard had escaped, injuring a few photojournalists. However, after three days of the sighting, the animal had left the city on its own.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/leopard-sighting-on-meeruts-outskirts-again-creates-panic-among-villagers/articleshow/81784199.cms||Sandeep Rai

Acting on a tip off that one Ajay Bhatt was transporting the contraband in a four-wheeler, the anti-narcotics cell of Nagpur police led by deputy commissioner of police Gajanan Rajmane laid a trap on outer ring road near Mahalgaon Kapsi. The police intercepted a Haryana registered SUV and detained Bhatt (Vikas Nagar, New Delhi) and carried out a search operation of the four-wheeler and found six sacks of ganja worth Rs 24.5 lakh. An offence was registered at Pardi police station. Along with seizure of over 160kg ganja, the police also seized two mobile phones as well as the SUV, in all estimated at Rs 31.26 lakh, said senior PI Sarthak Nehte. Police said Bhatt worked as a driver in New Delhi before the pandemic-induced lockdown. After lockdown was imposed, Bhatt lost his job. Later, he came in contact with the smuggler of contraband in New Delhi and started peddling drugs. The smuggler had assigned him a job to bring ganja consignment from Visakhapatnam. The deal was fixed at Rs 25,000 commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/driver-who-lost-job-caught-peddling-drugs/articleshow/81790357.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The corporation had set up seven collection points for this — at Kazhakootam ward committee office, Mudavanmugal Junction, Pipinmoodu Junction, Vanchiyur Junction, Putharikandam ground, Sreekaryam petrol pump and Kadakampally health inspector office. While 12,954kg of waste was collected from different collection points, 5,710kg of footwear and bag waste was collected from material recovery facilities. Sreekanteswaram and Kazhakootam health circles recorded the highest collection of 3,128kg and 3,000kg respectively. Among the 25 circles, only seven circles recorded collection with Kadakampally recording the lowest collection of 256kg. Over 2,000kg was collected from Sasthamangalam and Chenthitta health circles. This was the third collection drive organized by the city corporation in the recent past. Around 7,000kg of plastic waste and 11,145kg of glass waste were collected by the corporation authorities in the two separate collection drives held previously. The health team has now started work on segregation of the collected waste and their transportation to various recycling contractors. The collection system was disrupted mainly due to Covid situation and owing to differences that arose over payment to contractors. As payment was delayed citing technicalities, the contractors entrusted by the civic body had desisted from taking part in the collection drive. The matter was settled after the payment dues were settled and contract was extended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/over-18000kg-footwear-bag-waste-collected-in-a-day/articleshow/81787252.cms||---

They said even sealed kilns were functioning at night.The Coimbatore District Irular Samooga Nala Sangam president N Mallan said that kilns switch on floodlights at night, disturbing wild animals. “This will prompt animals to move to tribal villages and roads, leading to man-animal conflict.

This time he didn’t have to get in a queue at the police station to check the database for a possible match. Instead, he logged onto his “e-beat book” app and ran the photographs in the facial recognition software. One of his suspects was a history-sheeter with 65 criminal cases.If one goes by feedback from the junior constabulary and the supporting data, this mobile application has revolutionised the way boots on the ground function.On August 15, 2020, police commissioner SN Shrivastava launched the e-beat books. In the last seven months, beat officers have verified 72,000 tenants and 72,647 servants through this app. The figures were a little over half of this prior to usage of this software. The cops were also able to perform 18,968 facial scans on suspects during patrolling or at pickets.The app was conceptualised following Union home minister Amit Shah’s directive to maximise the use of technology in policing and becoming “Smart Police” in the true sense. “Each police station is normally divided into 10-16 beats and 3-4 cops handle the ground-level policing. E-beat books now cover all 178 police stations with 822 divisions and 1,752 beats,” said Shrivastava.“Now, a beat officer can have all relevant data in a handheld device without bothering to return to the police station to search for records. The system fetches near real-time information from data banks of Crime and Criminal Tracking System, 112 control room, Zipnet for missing children and people, dossiers of criminals and facial recognition database of Delhi Police,” added the top cop.The app’s application’s intuitive data analytics and extraction facilitates effective policing with crime prevention and detection and strategy formation. Hotspots appear on the dashboard so that patrolling and surveillance can be planned accordingly. The e-beat book also facilitates tenant and servant verification requests and redressal of local complaints.Police say the system facilitates mapping of an area to work out a tailor-made crime control strategy. There is near real-time access to crime and criminal data and search based on name, address and face matching on remote access from pickets and patrolling locations.The facial recognition system enables an officer to run a facial scan of a suspect and find his criminal history on the spot. So far, 42 criminals have been arrested with the help of this feature, while 18,968 facial scans were conducted till March 23. In all, 8,152 bad characters and 12,217 jail-bail release criminals were verified.An important feature is beat officers being notified of SOS calls made to the PCR (112) immediately, thereby ensuring a prompt response. The system can capture data at the beat level and has proven to be an extension of the CCTNS project. Moreover, the database is strengthened as cops keep feeding in updates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-e-beat-book-application-is-helping-in-smart-policing/articleshow/81790466.cms||Raj Shekhar

The firemen first attended a call from Narsing Talkies in central Nagpur. Though no loss of life was reported, fire brigade officials said the fire was triggered at a DP box and spread to the adjoining shoe shop. Soon it turned into a major blaze. Two fire tenders reached the spot and controlled the fire. Another fire broke out in Hasanbagh area where a fire engulfed a decoration firm godown. The firm, Shahnai Events, supplies decorative items and other material such as tents, speakers, generators and items required to erect temporary stage for a wide array of functions. There were eight horses also present. The firemen could rescue seven of them while one of them sustained burn injuries. The fire started at around 8.40am. The inflammable material stocked in the godown only helped the fire take a devastating turn. Dense and acrid smoke could be seen from miles as the fire destroyed bamboos, tents, mattresses and other material stocked there estimated to be worth around Rs50 lakh. The reason for the fire was not yet known. Four fire tenders – two from Lakadganj, one each from Kalamna and Sakkardara fire stations – were deployed which took almost an hour to douse the fire. Chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake, assisted by Lakadganj fire station officer Mohan Guddhe, who supervised the operation, told TOI that the godown was gutted in less than an hour. Uchake said, “We were able to restrict the fire to a limited area. There was no loss of life. However, loss of property is huge.” In another fire incident, an electrical DP box caught fire at Mominpura near Lal School at 9.30am. Fire tender from Ganjipeth fire station attended the fire call. No loss of property or life was reported. At 9.45am, the fire department attended another call at a house of one Anand Hiranwar, opp Shitlamata Mandir near Bole petrol pump. Household items worth Rs 20,000 were gutted after the fire broke out from a domestic cylinder in the house. A member of his family also sustained minor burns. Another fire erupted at a scrap vendor’s shop near Sangam Talkies square. Goods worth Rs 50,000 were gutted. The fire department also attended two minor fire calls from Besa Power House Chowk and Katol road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/alert-firemen-douse-fire-at-8-places-in-city/articleshow/81790474.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

GMC has 41 patients registered on its waitlist in need of kidney transplants. The liver and kidneys of the deceased donor were successfully retrieved. The liver was allotted to a patient at a hospital in Gujarat as Goa does not have other transplant facilities. “Kidney transplant is the only best option available for end-stage renal failure patients. In GMC, even post-transplant patients are provided medicines free,” said Dr J P Tiwari, head of nephrology department. The cadaveric transplants assume importance owing to the paucity of live donors. In most cases of patients suffering from end-stage kidney disease, transplant is the only hope of living a quality life sans regular dialysis. But that option doesn’t exist if a family member does not come forward to donate his/her organ. GMC has been rigorously promoting its deceased donor programme since it conducted its first cadaveric transplant in December 2020. GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar said they look forward to conducting more cadaveric transplants so that more patients could benefit. Bandekar said misconceptions are being spread among people that organs of the dead are harvested in the GMC morgue. “It is totally false. Once the patient is declared brain dead, the period till the organs are removed is very crucial, and a donor has to be given special treatment to maintain his/her organs,” he said. In the present case, the brain death certification was conducted by Dr Viraj Khandeparkar and Dr Teresa Ferreira. The Apnea test mandated by law requires two positive apnea tests performed six hours apart to declare a patient brain-dead. An intensivist plays a crucial role in maintaining the donor. “Brain death is an irreversible cessation of all neurological functions, which happens secondary to the catastrophic brain injury. We must understand that brain death is equivalent to the death of an individual,” said Ferreira, an associate professor of the neurology department, GMC. Dr Shirley D’Souza, head of the department of anesthesia, said maintaining the body’s homeostasis – blood pressure, cardiac output, and oxygenation — is very important. The functioning of the heart and lungs has to be maintained in order to preserve the organs. “This has to be maintained throughout even during the retrieval of the organs,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-41-waiting-for-kidneys-gmc-seeks-cadaveric-donors/articleshow/81793584.cms||Bindiya Chari

The cadres threw stones and sticks at the shops and cops stepped in to diffuse the situation, sources said.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath was in the city to campaign for party’s Coimbatore South candidate Vanathi Srinivasan. He was supposed to join Vanathi in leading the bike rally after visiting Puliyakulam Vinayagar Temple. But citing security reasons, he refused to join her in the campaign vehicle and left for the public gathering at Thermutti in Town Hall. Over 150 BJP members and Hindu Munnani cadres participated in the rally. When the rally was passing through Oppanakara Street, some cadres asked shopkeepers to close their shops. When the shopkeepers refused, a ruckus broke out. When cops tried to pacify them, some cadres threw stones and sticks at the shopkeepers, a police officer said. But the cops managed to pacify both the parties and made them leave the place.Police have collected CCTV footage and would book the accused, a police officer said.Meanwhile, Naam Tamilar Katch candidate for Coimbatore (South) Abdul Wahad sought action against Vanathi for disturbing communal harmony during the rally. “Right-wing cadres gathered in front of the mosque on Big Bazaar Street and passed derogatory comments against the people of Muslim community. They also forced us to close the mosque and shops. When shopkeepers refused, they threw stones at shops,” his petition to Coimbatore collector S Nagarajan said. The collector has forwarded the petition to the police department. MNM leader Kamal Haasan visited the area in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/right-wing-cadres-create-ruckus-force-shops-to-down-shutters/articleshow/81790426.cms||---

---||Goa||Just 10 e-buses running in Goa||PANAJI: Despite the ambitious launch of electric vehicles in the state last week, only ten of the 30 buses that are with the Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTC) are running on Goa’s roads. KTC officials have attributed the reason for the same to the shortage of adequate number of charging stations in the state to keep the rest 20 running. “We are in the process of setting up charging stations at each bus stand of the KTC. A transformer needs to be uploaded and there is a load factor to be considered for the charging. We can expect the rest of the buses to be running by the end of May or beginning of June,” KTC chairman, Carlos Almeida told TOI. A total of 50 vehicles are being handed to the state under phase 2 of the FAME India scheme. The KTC has received a total of 30 of the 50 buses and flagged off the vehicles in an inauguration ceremony on March 23. From April 1 onwards, the KTC was set to start operating these 30 buses and the pending 20 that are yet to be delivered by the Hyderabad-based manufacturer were to follow suit later. “All of these 50 buses will start operations only after we have all 24 charging stations installed. Presently, KTC has only two charging stations at the Margao depot. However, these are not enough to charge all the buses so currently we have only ten buses in operation,” said KTC managing director, Derek Pereira Neto. A tender for the infrastructure has, however, been opened. “We have just opened the tender for setting up of charging stations. It was delayed only because the tender was opened late. We had to wait until the code of conduct ended to take permission to float the tender,” Neto said. He further said that following the installation of the charging stations, the buses will be put on road in batches of five each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/just-10-e-buses-running-in-state/articleshow/81793572.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Kolkata||Fake surveys, bogus letters from netas flood internet||Kolkata: Manipulated letters and fake surveys have been flooding cyberspace in the run-up to the high-voltage assembly elections on Thursday. Termed as “leaked internal survey”, purportedly from an election strategist, a photograph with a snapshot of poll performance during the second phase circulated on the internet a day ago. The content of the photograph, which was posted on Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp on social media handles, pointed at Mamata Banerjee losing from Nandigram. The report, supposedly from Prashant Kishore’s Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC), claimed “the BJP is set to sweep the second phase as well just like phase I, getting somewhere around 23-24 seats…” I-PAC debunked the so-called survey. In a statement, the officials said, “Facing imminent defeat, Bengal BJP has now gone down to the level of using fake surveys in the name of I-PAC to keep the morale of their workers high.” Citing the image, which shows a desktop, it said, “In I-PAC, no one uses desktops, so at least, be smart in your effort to create fake survey.” Trinamool also rubbished the report. “Anticipating huge loss, Bengal BJP has resorted to what it does best — spread fake news,” the party posted on Twitter. Another undated letter, supposedly from Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh to national president J P Nadda, has also gone viral. The letter with a subject line, ‘Information regarding West Bengal polls, phase-I’, claimed the BJP estimated a win in three-four seats in the first phase. “In a bid to restrict Trinamool in the upcoming phases, we need to ramp up our efforts across districts to avoid a complete wipe out in the second phase,” the purported letter read. The BJP reached out to the public on Twitter from several accounts, including that of Ghosh, saying: “This is a fake letter being circulated in the name of Dilip Ghosh. BJP...”. An “internal report” of the RSS also went viral. It detailed the vote margin Trinamool candidate from Chandrakona, Arup Dhara, was expected to get. Faking reports and letters were not restricted only in the name of politicians and analysts, but state police and Intelligence Bureau had also not been spared. A supposed IB report, predicting the results of Bengal and TN elections are on social media. Debunked by fact-checking agencies, the report claimed Trinamool would win in 204-211 seats in Bengal. Another report, purportedly on a letter head of West Midnapore district police, gave details of a TMC candidate’s panchayat/town-wise margin. District police lodged a case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-surveys-bogus-letters-from-netas-flood-internet/articleshow/81790602.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Coimbatore||CPI leader assails Modi for failing to pass women’s reservation bill||Tirupur: A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused opposition parties including DMK, Congress and the Left for their ‘anti-women’ mindset, CPI general secretary D Raja on Wednesday questioned him for not passing the women’s reservation bill in Parliament.Speaking to reporters in Tirupur, Raja said that if the PM is really concerned about empowerment of women as he proclaims, he should have passed the women reservation bill that proposes 33% reservation for women in Parliament and state assemblies as his party enjoys majority in Parliament. “When he can pass anti-farm laws with huge support in Parliament, why can’t he pass the women reservation bill, which has been pending for a long time?”“A woman was brutally raped in Hathras and her body was forcibly cremated by police. Why did the PM fail to raise his voice for the victim or speak anything about the incident? He is just pretending that he cares for women,” Raja said.Referring to Modi’s speech in Dharapuram in Tirupur district on Tuesday, the Left leader said that the development that the PM mentions in his speech is not of the public or the country, but of the corporates. “It is in his tenure the gross domestic product and value of rupee witnessed a sharp drop and unemployment touched the peak.”Speaking about AIADMK, Raja said that the ruling party failed to safeguard the rights of the state. “It is no longer safe to leave the state in their hands. That’s why the DMK alliance will get a massive victory in the assembly election,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cpi-leader-assails-modi-for-failing-to-pass-womens-reservation-bill/articleshow/81790458.cms||---

Incumbent chairman Justice (retd) Satyendra Chauhan of the Allahabad High Court, was appointed directly in 2018 without the regular selection process through various committees, as retired judges can be directly appointed.The government recently constituted a selection committee under Justice (retd) Sarvesh Gupta of Uttrakhand High Court, under Section 85 of Electricity Act, 2003, with the approval of Delhi’s power minister Satyendar Jain. The government has decided to invite applications from interested eligible persons for appointment to the post of chairman and one member.As per the Electricity Act, the chairman and member shall hold office for a term of five years from joining or till attaining the age of 65 years. The incumbent chairman would turn 65 years old in July this year.According to sources, with the amended GNCTD Act giving more powers to the Delhi LG than the elected government, the selection process might face some delays. The selection started this month much before the GNCTD (Amendment) Bill got the President of India’s assent.The position of DERC chairperson was vacant from September, 2016 to June, 2018 after the Aam Aadmi Party appointee, Krishna Saini, chosen to succeed PD Sudhakar recused himself after then LG Najeeb Jung declared his appointment null and void because the government had not sought his prior approval.With DERC functioning under a single member, BP Singh, who was due to retire in September, 2018, Justice Chauhan was appointed as there is a provision in the Electricity Act under to appoint judges directly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-appoints-committee-to-select-next-derc-chief/articleshow/81790568.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The demand has come from the commuters who travel to distant places like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal as the trains are scheduled between 11pm and 4am and during these hours public transport is not available. “My family was travelling to Howrah by the train scheduled at 1.40 am. It is difficult for me to find public transport in the night so I decided to drop them at the station at 9 pm. But after we reached the station we came to know that we could not enter before 11.30 pm,” Ganesh Shah, who came from Sinnar along with his family, said. “I, along with my wife and two daughters, had to wait outside the station until they were allowed to get in,” he added. The railway authorities, however, said that they are following with the norms laid down by the railways. “There are no issues for people who have appropriate train ticket. The local administration also does not stop people who are travelling, so people can leave from their homes in time,” VK Gupta, divisional railway manager of Bhusawal division, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/relax-night-entry-rules-at-rly-station-passengers/articleshow/81784219.cms||---

The JERC has directed the department to expedite the process and submit an updated status on pre-paid meters installed throughout the state. The commission in its latest tariff order has directed the department to pay consumers interest on security deposit up to the financial year 2020-21. The department stated that interest on consumer security deposit for 2018-19 has been passed on to the consumers and disbursement of 2019-20 interest is under process. The power regulatory body also took “serious note” of the electricity department failing to submit audited accounts since 2017 and sought annual accounts by November 2021. The JERC directed the department to submit information on the fixed assets that have depreciated up to 90% and expedite the energy audit of the state. It noted that the department is yet to submit the energy audit reports for previous years despite repeated directions. Since 2012, the department has not submitted a systematic manpower study report with focus on manpower rationalisation.

Without judicial powers, how will the judge probe the charges of corruption against Deshmukh? When I was the CM, our government had set up a one-man commission headed by Justice D S Zoting to investigate allegations of land grab against Eknath Khadse. Justice Zoting’s appointment was under the Commission of Inquiry Act,” Fadnavis said. However, NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik said Fadnavis was “misleading” people over the appointment of Justice Zoting. “That notification was issued on June 23, 2016, while the notification about Chandiwal was issued on March 30, 2021. The wording of both is identical,” Malik said. Malik claimed nowhere in the Zoting notification was it stated Zoting had been appointed as per provisions of Commission of Inquiry Act. But a BJP leader said on November 10, 2016, a fresh notification was issued under Commission of InquiryAct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-appointment-of-probe-panel-an-eyewash-says-fadnavis/articleshow/81793774.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Nagpur||Bombay High court allows winding up of Wopolin, earlier known as Bajaj Plastics||NAGPUR: About 12 years after a plea was filed before it, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has allowed Wopolin Plastics Limited (formerly Bajaj Plastics) to wind up its operations. After suffering from heavy losses in 1998 and defaulting in loan payments, the company having an office at Empress Mills Colony had approached HC for winding up its operations under Section 433 of the Companies Act, 1956. It also prayed for appointing an official liquidator for the purpose. “I don’t see any impediment in directing winding up, as the company isn’t in a position to do business and it has no assets. The company is existing only on paper,” justice Rohit Deo said. While appointing the provisional liquidator to conduct the formalities, the judge directed the company to deposit Rs1 lakh within two weeks as payment. The petitioner company had borrowed substantial amounts as term loan and working capital from several institutions. Due to recession in automobile sector and labour issues, its entire capital stood eroded, forcing it to approach the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) for revival. On November 11, 1999, the BIFR declared it a sick unit under the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (SICA). IDBI Bank was appointed as the operating agency and the company was told not to alienate its fixed assets without BIFR’s prior approval. A few days later, ICICI Bank filed a civil suit against it for recovering Rs8.02 crore dues. However, the case was transferred to the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DBT) in Mumbai. On January 3, 2003, the bank issued a notice to it for recovery of Rs34.60 crore under the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Ordinance, 2002. Subsequently, IDBI Bank also initiated recovery proceedings under the same Act for recovery of Rs26.65 crore. Both banks assigned their rights to Assets Reconstruction Company (India) Limited (ARCIL). The company was, however, constrained to declare lock out from January 28, 2006. ARCIL then published a possession notice in which its properties and details of debts were mentioned. In view of the second proviso to SICA’s Section 15(1), the reference pending before BIFR stood abated. On September 7, 2006, ARCIL issued a public notice for sale of its assets. After receiving no dues certificates on May 20, 2008, the company approached the HC. “There doesn’t appear to be any dispute that the company’s entire assets were possessed by ARCIL and sold by inviting tenders. It’s also not carrying on any business for more than three years. The company has passed a resolution for winding up on the premise that it’s not in a position to do any business,” justice Deo said before disposing of the petition. WHAT HC SAID * Wopolin Plastics doesn’t have any assets now, it’s existing only on paper * No dispute that its assets possessed by ARCIL & sold through tenders * Co not carrying on any business since more than three years * Co passed resolution for winding up for all above reasons * No impediment in winding it up, as isn’t in position to do business||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-allows-winding-up-of-wopolin-earlier-known-as-bajaj-plastics/articleshow/81790608.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The novel coronavirus infected 361 people in the past 24 hours and claimed the lives of four, taking the caseload since the outbreak to 85,879 and deaths 1,211. Lucknow accounted for 29% of the total cases and 36% of deaths in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday. The number of recoveries was 142. In fact, daily recoveries have been continuously lower than then per day infections for over two weeks, resulting in spike in active cases to 3,138. However, overall, 81,530 (94.9% of the caseload) patients have recovered so far. Gomtinagar recorded the highest 45 cases, followed by Talkatora 38, Hazratganj 29, Aliganj 23, Indiranagar 22, Mahanagar and Chowk 15 each, Alambagh 13, Rae Bareli Road, Jankipuram and Madiaon 12 each, Thakurganj 11 and Chinhat and Cantonment 10 each. Experts say high complacency in public behaviour that ushered in post-January and decline in herd immunity developed during the peak months of August and September is responsible for the surge. 7 LU teachers positive: Lucknow University registrar VK Singh directed staff members and students to get themselves tested if they have come in contact with seven teachers, including a retired teacher, who have tested Covid positive. Five of them also hold administrative posts. These teachers included two each of English and Sanskrit and one each of physics and commerce. Condition of three teachers is serious and they are in hospitals, while the others are in home isolation. 84 RDSO residents positive : The residential colony on RDSO campus has been turned into a containment zone after 84 residents tested Covid-19 positive in the past five days. Officials said 13 tested positive on Saturday followed by others during the contact tracing drive. The patients include railway staff and their family members.

---||Patna||45 boys trafficked from Bihar rescued in Delhi||NEW DELHI: A total of 45 minor boys, including some as young as seven years of age, were rescued from bangle factories in northwest Delhi’s Jahangirpuri area on Wednesday morning. These boys had been trafficked to Delhi from Bihar in the last one year. An official from an NGO that carried out the rescue operation said that the trafficked children used to work in small, dark and dingy rooms and were barely paid anything for the work that they did. “The boys were not allowed to switch on the fans even in searing heat. They used to sit with folded legs for 12 hours straight and were locked up in rooms so that they couldn’t even escape,” said Mukesh Kumar from Prayas Childline team. TimesViewNCRB’s 2019 statistics shows that a child goes missing every eight minutes in India. Many of them are trafficked and forced into child labour. Cops must make this heinous crime a focus of their attention. The wide networks of gangs operating across cities, towns and interiors must be smashed. These criminals also exploit the deep poverty that haunts the nation's poorest. That fundamental issue needs to be urgently addressed too.Mukesh further said that when the employers got to know about the joint raid being conducted by the NGO and Delhi Police teams on their premises, they locked up some of the kids in bathrooms and some others were asked to cross over to the adjoining terraces. “Some kids were even injured in the process.

One of the kids even got burn injuries on his face after he started working at the factory,” the NGO official said. Another official from the NGO said that the rescued boys were in the age group of seven to 15. “The children are still in a state of shock and most of them have not been able to speak about their ordeal till now. As the investigation progresses, they will be asked about their families and their kin will then be called here to take them home,” added the official. Based on the duration of their stay here, the children will be compensated. No arrests were made till Wednesday late evening in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/45-boys-trafficked-from-bihar-rescued-in-capital/articleshow/81815713.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Delhi||45 boys trafficked from Bihar rescued in Delhi||NEW DELHI: A total of 45 minor boys, including some as young as seven years of age, were rescued from bangle factories in northwest Delhi’s Jahangirpuri area on Wednesday morning. These boys had been trafficked to Delhi from Bihar in the last one year. An official from an NGO that carried out the rescue operation said that the trafficked children used to work in small, dark and dingy rooms and were barely paid anything for the work that they did. “The boys were not allowed to switch on the fans even in searing heat. They used to sit with folded legs for 12 hours straight and were locked up in rooms so that they couldn’t even escape,” said Mukesh Kumar from Prayas Childline team. TimesViewNCRB’s 2019 statistics shows that a child goes missing every eight minutes in India. Many of them are trafficked and forced into child labour. Cops must make this heinous crime a focus of their attention. The wide networks of gangs operating across cities, towns and interiors must be smashed. These criminals also exploit the deep poverty that haunts the nation's poorest. That fundamental issue needs to be urgently addressed too.Mukesh further said that when the employers got to know about the joint raid being conducted by the NGO and Delhi Police teams on their premises, they locked up some of the kids in bathrooms and some others were asked to cross over to the adjoining terraces. “Some kids were even injured in the process. We have got one of them admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital, while one has been admitted to BJRM Hospital for further treatment. One of the kids even got burn injuries on his face after he started working at the factory,” the NGO official said. Another official from the NGO said that the rescued boys were in the age group of seven to 15. “The children are still in a state of shock and most of them have not been able to speak about their ordeal till now. As the investigation progresses, they will be asked about their families and their kin will then be called here to take them home,” added the official.

---||Delhi||SDMC to levy event fees from venues in illegal colonies||New Delhi: At its standing committee meeting on Wednesday, South Delhi Municipal Corporation approved the policy for registration and collection of permission charges for holding marriage and social functions in premises/vatikas in unauthorised colonies, special areas and villages. As per the proposal, the minimum booking rate for a plot area of 400 square metres will be Rs 6,000 per month. For premises with plot area between 400 sqm and 1,000 sqm, the charge per month will be Rs 7,000, while for plots more than 10,000 sq metre in area, the amount will be Rs 50,000 per month. In case of pucca construction, an additional charge at 25% of the ground-floor rate will be levied for holding functions. This, SDMC officials claim, will help generate additional revenue for the civic body.The project will, however, need approval from the House before its final implementation. So far, the civic agency does not charge anything from people holding social events at premises (temporary/permanent structure) in unauthorised colonies, village, and special areas, despite cleaning the waste generated at such social events. “Paying the charges and registering with the municipality will not give the right to the owner for permanent land use change or regularisation of properties without any policy or regulation made by DDA or Delhi government," the proposal stated. Leader of the House, Narendra Chawla, said vatikas in unauthorised colonies are frequently used for holding social functions. “Considering the court has banned social functions in parks, their use has increased manifold, which is why we have come up with this policy,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-to-levy-event-fees-from-venues-in-illegal-colonies/articleshow/81790629.cms||Vibha Sharma

Therefore, it would not have been prudent to implement restrictions at our level,” he said. Chavan said the Covid guidelines mooted by the government are expected to take care of different sections of the society. “It is argued that the disadvantaged sections may bear the brunt of any stringent measures. The new restrictions being worked out will make sure that no section of the society suffers due to measures aimed at arresting the spread of Covid-19,” he said. Aurangabad district, on Tuesday, reported 43 deaths due to Covid-19 — the highest — besides logging 1,116 fresh cases of the viral infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/curbs-deferred-awaiting-govt-norms-collector/articleshow/81784243.cms||---

The tragedy struck on Tuesday afternoon, but the family members of the children came to know about it in the evening when they spotted the crushed head of one of the children in the stockpile during a search near a railway line in Khurja area of the district. The children, among them two girls, had led a herd of goats to the spot where the poles meant for a mega government project of a freight corridor were kept. They were either resting near the poles or were playing when the incident took place, a police officer said. The boy, eldest among the lot, was 14 years old. The girls were 11 and 12 years old. Residents of nearby Sarawa Dadupur village, it was another outing of sorts for the children as the schools were shut. Their family members started the search when the goats reached homes, but the children did not. “These children had left home in the afternoon and did not return. We started searching for them in the evening and spotted the crushed head of a child in the pile. Later people from the village rushed there and the bodies were pulled out. This is carelessness of the authorities who did not keep these poles in a proper way. The children may have taken shelter under its shadow when it fell on them,” said Mehdi Hasan, a former village head. Station house officer (SHO) of Khurja Nagar police station, Dixit Tyagi, said, “Work for Dedicated Freight Corporation Corridor (DFCC) is in progress. These poles were put there for the electrification of the route. Villagers said that the children had gone there for grazing animals. They must have sat on the poles which led to the accident. The bodies have been recovered and sent for post-mortem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-kids-crushed-to-death-under-pile-of-electric-poles-kept-for-freight-corridor-in-ups-khurja/articleshow/81784240.cms||Sandeep Rai

Another option is to pre-register yourself on the CoWIN 2.0 portal to get the shot at the convenient time slot at the centre nearest to your home. You will only have to carry a government recognised photo ID with your date of birth (DoB). Earlier, the vaccination was open for senior citizens aged 60 years and above with photo ID and DOB as well as for people with comorbidities aged between 45-59.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sachin Waze got gelatin sticks placed in car near Mukesh Ambani house, says NIA||MUMBAI: Arrested assistant police inspector Sachin Waze procured the gelatin sticks that were found in a Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house on February 25, the National investigation Agency (NIA) has said. It suspects that the explosives were procured from Vasai, where gelatin sticks are usually used by quarry owners. There was a strong buzz that an Audi believed to have be used by Waze on the night Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was the owner of the Scorpio, had been killed had been found in Vasai, but NIA refused to confirm it. The central agency is probing both the explosives as well as the Hiran death cases. However, NIA clarified on Wednesday that Waze was driving the Scorpio (TOI in its edition on Wednesday reported that his personal driver was at the wheel of the Scorpio) when it was left outside Ambani’s house. Waze’s personal driver was at the wheel of the Innova that had tailed the Scorpio, officials said. The NIA claimed it has got CCTV footage to show Waze’s presence at the scene of crime. NIA has already seized the Scorpio and Innova, two Mercedes Benz, a Land Cruiser, a Volvo and a Mitsubishi Outlander in the two cases so far. Waze and arrested constable Vinayak Shinde are said to have travelled by an Audi to Thane on March 3, impersonated as one Tawde and called Hiran to Ghodbunder Road. Within an hour, Hiran’s mobile not reachable and his last mobile location showed him to Vasai. His body was found floating in a creek in Mumbra on March 5. In a bid to prove Waze’s movements, the NIA team will collect CCTV footage of the compound of the Mumbai police commissioner’s office and nearby areas. It is trying to ascertain if Waze destroyed any DVR of the police HQ and the nearby areas. Agency officials said they are collecting all possible evidence and recording statements of various witnesses to make the case strong. The NIA is also in the process of sending the laptop, printer, two hard discs, two CPUs, two DVRs that were recovered from the Mithi river at BKC to cyber experts in an attempt to retrieve data. Waze had reportedly damaged the laptop before throwing it in the Mithi, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-waze-got-gelatin-sticks-placed-in-car-near-ambani-house-says-nia/articleshow/81793883.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly polls: With defectors and fresh faces in the mix, Haldia & Tamluk offer an intriguing battle||HALDIA/TAMLUK: The high-profile contest between Mamata Banerjee and Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram has cast its long shadow on two adjoining constituencies, administrative headquarters Tamluk and industrial belt Haldia. But for the spotlight on Nandigram, the media focus would have been more on these two seats. Though reporters and cameramen from the national media have been staying at night in Tamluk town and Haldia for the past several days, these two constituencies have hardly received any attention as they rush to Nandigram every morning to camp the entire day. Haldia, the largest industrial town after Durgapur, has been a red citadel, primarily owing to presence of unions. Traditionally, whoever has won the seat has had a control over the powerful unions. Just prior to the election, Haldia witnessed a defection with sitting MLA Tapasi Mondal of CPM switching over to BJP. Mondal, who is contesting this election on a BJP ticket, will take on Monika Kar Bhowmick of CPI(M) and Swapan Naskar of TMC. When Mondal had been fielded in 2016, she was a fresh face. So is Bhowmick. The lack of experience will not be a hindrance as the Left has a strong support base here. With every seat crucial for TMC and BJP, both will be hoping to pip the other two to the post. TMC's Naskar, the former chairman of the board of administrators of Haldia municipality, is aware of the challenge given that TMC had not been able to win the seat the last time. In the Lok Sabha elections though, CPM candidate Sk Ibrahim Ali had been blown away as it turned out to be a two horse race that Dibyendu Adhikari of TMC ultimately won. With Adhikari now following brother Suvendu to the saffron camp, the equation could be very different this time. In Tamluk, TMC candidate Soumen Mahapatra is also the district president as well as a minister in the Banerjee cabinet. Mahapatra had to shift from Tamluk to Pingla in West Midnapore five years ago due to Suvendu Adhikari's insistence. Nirbed Roy who had contested from Tamluk in 2016 had lost to Ashok Kumar Dinda by a narrow margin. Like Haldia, Dinda has also shifted allegiance to BJP. However, the party has fielded popular doctor Harekrishna Bera against Mahapatra. And though the Left candidate, Goutam Panda of CPI, is as much a new face as Dinda was in 2016 when he won the election by a narrow margin of 620 votes, it seems to be a tough ask this year given the rise of BJP in the past three years. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP's Siddhartha Shankar Naskar trailed Dibyendu Adhikari in this assembly segment by merely 6,548 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/with-defectors-and-fresh-faces-in-the-mix-haldia-tamluk-offer-an-intriguing-battle/articleshow/81790647.cms||Suman Mandal
---||Lucknow||Online teaching in prominent schools for classes up to 8||Lucknow: In view of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the city, prominent schools have decided to switch back to ‘only online classes’ from class I to 8 when the institutions will reopen after extended Holi holidays on April 5. Schools had followed online mode for the teaching in class I to VIII after the outbreak of the pandemic last year. However, offline mode was resumed in phases in February and March with an option for those who don’t want to come to the campus to continue in the online mode. This was called a hybrid model. All the educational institutions closed for Holi holidays last week. The closure was later extended on the orders of the state government following a spike in infections. Now, these schools will resume online classes from April 5. Unaided Private Schools Association (UPSA) president Anil Agarwal said that all the 200 schools under UPSA have decided that no offline classes will be held for primary (Class I to V) and secondary (from VI to VIII) sections. However, he added, there are a few schools that can run offline classes for VI to VIII standards on alternate days. Further, he said, classes of the senior section (from IX to XII) will be held in hybrid mode - both offline and online. Only those students whose parents give written consent will be asked to attend offline classes, he added. Father Vincent Pinto of the Catholic Diocese of Lucknow said the majority of missionary schools will continue with online classes for standard I to VIII. Regarding classes of students of XI to XII, he said the classes will be offline. He also said that the new academic session in the missionary schools will begin on April 6. CMS to promote students from classes 1-8 sans exams: Around 35,000 students in class I to VIII studying in 17 branches of City Montessori School will be promoted to the next class without examinations, said a spokesperson of the school chain. “There will be no examinations - be it offline or online - for primary to classes VIII and promotion will be granted based on the child’s previous test performance,” he said. However, he added, offline exams for Classes IX to XII will take place as per schedule from April 1. Further, he said, the new session for classes of Montessori, nursery, KG 1 and 2 will begin from April 5; for classes III to IX from April 12 and classes X and XII from April 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/online-teaching-in-prominent-schools-for-classes-up-to-8/articleshow/81793945.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Telangana power utilities reached 13,688 MW demand, which is a record in the state. According to officials, the highest power demand recorded was 13,168 MW in February 2020. In the Greater Hyderabad limits, the power demand has touched 2,760 MW from 1,700 MW earlier. “Though we have received the highest power demand, our utilities met the demand without any problem. For the agriculture sector alone, 5,000 MW of power is being supplied,” Telangana Generation Corporation Limited (TGENCO) CMD D Prabhakar Rao said. He said the power utilities were ready to supply more power if the demand continues to rise without compromising on the quality of power. Telangana Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) CMD G Raghumareddy said power utilization is increasing in the GHMC due to rise in temperatures. “We are expecting the power load to touch 3,000 MW in GHMC limits. The discom is geared up to meet the demand,” the CMD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/peak-power-demand-in-t-due-to-high-temp/articleshow/81790642.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Nagpur||Tadoba buffer guides to get paid based on star rating||NAGPUR: Now guides in the buffer zone of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) will get ‘star’ ratings and enhanced fee depending on their skills and knowledge. Guides rated 3-star will get Rs 500, followed by Rs 450 for 2-star and Rs400 for 1-star guides. These stars will appear on their dresses like police and forest officials. A test will be held on April 7 (Wednesday), when tourism in the buffer zone is closed. The new system will be implemented from May 1, 2021. Deputy director (buffer) G Guruprasad said, “Though earlier such an attempt for rating Tadoba (core) guides was withdrawn owing to resistance from the guide association, we are keen to implement it. There will be no loss of job even if the guide is poorly rated.” “Guides from some seven gates, like Dewada, Agarzari, Junona, Kolara, Alizanja, are opposed to the move but the opposition is out of fear that if they fail they will be removed, but we have no such plans,” said Guruprasad. Earlier, in July 2019, such an attempt to grade guides according to their knowledge was resisted by guides association apprehending incompetent guides will lose their jobs. The rating exercise will be done every year and those getting a low score can compete with others next year. Guruprasad said, “This is the first such scheme to be implemented in any tiger reserve buffer. The upgradation of guides is necessary considering complaints from tourists about etiquettes and knowledge of flora and fauna in the area.” “There will be 100 marks for the test. Out of this, 50 marks will be for their communication skills and 50 for technical knowledge. All the guides have been told to remain present for the test. Those not appearing will not be removed, but they will continue to get only Rs300 as guide fees,” said Guruprasad. A four-member committee of experts like naturalists, wildlife biologists, one member from BNHS will evaluate the guides and also verify the feedback forms filled by the tourists. State wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre says, “This is a good move and in the interest of guides. Today they get Rs350 as guide fee but they can get Rs500. The fears that they will be removed are unfounded. Tadoba is on the global map and we also need to improve our hospitality by upgrading the skills of these guides. It will also bring a good name for the park and better opportunities for the guides.” Naturalist Anirudh Chaoji welcomed the move. “A knowledgeable guide and one with poor skills are rated at par at present. There is a need to incentivize knowledge and quality by introducing a rating system. In the end, tourists are the sufferers for poor knowledge and lack of communication by guides,” Chaoji said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tadoba-buffer-guides-to-get-paid-based-on-star-rating/articleshow/81790645.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Khar murder: Blood on shirt not mine, accused told 2 men in Mumbai||MUMBAI: In the early hours of January 1, 2021, when psychology student Jhanvi Kukreja, 19, was killed in a Khar building, murder accused Shree Jogdhankar, 22, told two men, who enquired after him when they found him walking unsteadily in Khar, that the blood on his clothes did not belong to him. He also refused a lift to a hospital. The statement of these men, now part of the police chargesheet in the murder case against Jogdhankar and Diya Padalkar, 18, added that they were driving to Goregaon after 2am, when they slowed down on seeing an unsteady Jogdhankar. They saw his shirt was torn and stained with blood. They assumed that he had got into a scrap at a New Year’s party. After asking after him, and his name and place of residence, they left. As news about the murder and the arrests spread, they realised Jogdhankar was the man they had encountered. Both witnesses gave their statements in March. The Khar police chargesheet mentions that Jogdhankar met another set of friends later that night and sought treatment at Sion Hospital. A doctor at the hospital has told cops that when Jogdhankar came for treatment with injuries on his head and arm at about 3am on January 1, he was aggressive, complained about the delay in treatment and boasted that he knew people in ‘Delhi’. The doctor opined that despite being drunk, Jogdhankar answered questions lucidly and claimed he had fallen on the road at Mahim at midnight. Jogdhankar and Padalkar, both close friends of Kukreja, are accused of assaulting her on the staircase and murdering her after they attended a New Year’s party on the terrace of a Khar building. The chargesheet said Padalkar stayed back in the house of the host with a cut lip, claiming she did not know how she suffered the injury. Kukreja’s blood was found on the bed where Padalkar slept. The chargesheet also contains the statement of a building resident who found Kukreja’s body near the staircase on the ground floor when she was returning after dropping off friends. The woman said she initially thought the victim had been sexually assaulted and murdered. Kukreja’s final post-mortem report said there were no signs of sexual assault, but she had suffered 48 injuries, many of them grave. Witnesses present at the terrace party said they had seen Padalkar drunk and getting cosy with Jogdhankar. A friend of Kukreja’s told cops at 1.32am, the victim had called her and cried about Padalkar getting “physically close” with Jogdhankar. Another Kukreja friend, who attended the party, claimed Jogdhankar and the victim had been in a relationship since 2018. The witness said Kukreja had told her about his temper and violent streak, and how only she could calm him down. Jogdhankar’s friend, who was also at the party, agreed that he was aggressive. He recalled that Jogdhankar had broken a paan-seller’s nose when told to come later for a cigarette. A case was registered at Vakola and he was suspended from college for a year. He also remembered a violent fight with a cab driver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/khar-murder-blood-on-shirt-not-mine-accused-told-2-men-in-mumbai/articleshow/81794051.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Shetti met state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Monday and citing the plight of the farmers during lockdown announced last year, he said that the farmers will be forced to commit suicide if lockdown is imposed again. “Currently, with just the fear about lockdown the prices of vegetables have collapsed. The farmers are resorting to let their produce rot in farms. The farmers have already suffered losses due to the lockdown,” he said. “This time however, we will oppose if any such decision is taken as it is the issue of life and death for the farmers. Already the restrictions in cities have led to less demand of farm produce especially vegetables which are grown mainly by small farmers,” Shetti added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/well-oppose-lockdown-says-shetti/articleshow/81784280.cms||---

Following the incident, the company was not allowed to function since October 2020. The single bench of Justice S P Sharma also quashed the FIR registered by Bhiwadi police station SHO on October 12, 2020 and set aside further proceedings initiated against the petitioners in the name of investigation by the police. The court issued the order on six criminal miscellaneous petitions assailing action by Bhiwadi police, alleging that an illegal raid was conducted on the premises of the factory of Golden Bottling Company, which produces and bottles Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) as well as country liquor. "The investigation, seizure and entry into the factory premises by the concerned local SHO Jitendra Solanki, Bhiwadi police station, was without authority and he has abused his powers available under the Police Act. He could not have acted like an excise inspector, more so, when the excise officer was available," the court held. The overzealous attempt by the SHO, supported by his superior officers, is found to be illegal and such exercise of power by police officials is found to be an action of harassment, atrocity, the court held. The arrest made by the police is clearly illegal. No notice under Section 41 CrPC was served on the petitioners before arresting them, said the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/illegal-closure-of-factory-raj-hc-asks-police-dept-to-pay-rs-10l-fine/articleshow/81794044.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly elections 2021: Choppers make unusual noises over Nandigram’s political skyline||NANDIGRAM: Nandigram has never seen such a busy skyline. Helicopters are ascending and descending every now and then. If it is Amit Shah in the morning, Mithun Chakraborty in the afternoon and Mamata Banerjee in the evening — the high frequency of movement of choppers underlines how prestigious and high profile the poll battle here. Nandigram has as many as five helipads, where helicopters of different sizes and shapes are descending frequently. In contrast, the same Nandigram has a rickety public transport system, some stretches of bumpy road — a few buses, a few totos and mechanised vans to ferry passengers — highly inadequate compared to the demand. “I have never seen so many helicopters in my lifetimes,” said Abu Basar, a septuagenarian farmer of Gokulnagar. “I was almost swept off my feet by the gust of the chopper blades,” he chuckled. He is now used to the noise of an ascending or descending chopper. Earlier, he used to think of a ‘pralay’ (disaster). But the younger generation is not as wide-eyed as Abu Basar. Gurupada Khatua, a resident of Reyapara said, “If these choppers come frequently to Nandigram, we might have to buy potatoes at Rs 100 a kg. I can never board a chopper, but I will expect a decent public transport in Nandigram.” He rued the fact that Nandigram bus terminus never assumed the speed at which the five helipads were built there. “We really don’t know when the bus terminus will be complete.” Chandan Ghorui, a resident of Boropool, was equally cynical. “These helipads were built on farmland. They will lie unused next five years. Hope the owners of farmland will be dismantled to resume farming there.” The five helipads are located at Tekhali, Boyal, Haripur, Buttola, Shib Mandir. The helipads are divided by the political line. Recently, the BJP got commissioned two helipads at Haripur and Boyal as there was a beeline of star campaigners like Amit Shah, Dharmendra Pradhan, Smriti Irani, Yogi Adityanath, Mithun Chakraborty. Trinamool Congress, on the other hand, has built a helipad at Reyapara Shib Mandir, close to the place where Mamata Banerjee has been camping at Nandigram. “Apart from Mamata, Abhisek was the other star campaigner, who came to Nandigram by chopper,” said Abihiram Basak, a trader at Tekhali. Children and women of Nandigram were most excited to catch a glimpse of ‘the stars descending right from the sky.’ “We run to the helipads, every time the noise of the chopper catches our ears,” one of them said. Mithun Chakraborty’s chopper at Haripur helipad attracted the largest number of women and children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/choppers-make-unusual-noises-over-nandigrams-political-skyline/articleshow/81790781.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Kolkata||Land-stir arrest: Relief for 14 TMC leaders as HC orders status quo||Kolkata: The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday ordered “status quo” on the arrest warrants issued by the trial courts in East Midnapore against 14 Trinamool Congress leaders in connection to the 2007 anti-land acquisition stir. The leaders, including Trinamool’s Nandigram president Swadesh Das, were in hiding after sporadic police raids at their homes to arrest them. The HC in its order said the status quo “as of today” be maintained till April 8, unless the court gives any order before that. The Supreme Court had on March 26 stayed the Calcutta HC’s March 5 order, reviving 14-year-old criminal cases against Mamata Banerjee’s election agent Sk Supian, who, along with these party leaders who moved HC on Wednesday, was also a part of the Nandigram protests against land acquisition. A bench of justices Indira Banerjee and Krishna Murari said the HC passed the order without hearing him. The Apex court had said its stay order will operate for two weeks or until the high court hears the plea. Citing this Apex court order, the 14 leaders had moved high court seeking relief. In a petition moved before the HC, the 14 Trinamool leaders said that courts had disposed of the cases against them after they were withdrawn by the state under 321 CrPC. However, a petition was moved in the HC against it with a political motive to restrict them from working for their party in the Nandigram polls. The HC, the petition said, had stayed the disposal of the cases against them and asked the lower courts to deal with the cases appropriately. Subsequently, the lower courts had reissued arrest warrants against them. The 14 leaders said that after the Apex court order came to their notice, they wanted to plead before the HC seeking relief, at least till the poll process is over. The counsel for the 14 applicants, Ayan Bhattacharyya, moved a bench of justices IP Mukerji and Aniruddha Roy citing urgency because Nandigram goes to polls on Thursday. The bench was initially not inclined to hear the matter and urged the matter be heard by a regular bench on April 5. The counsel then pleaded again mentioning that Nandigram will go to polls in a few hours. The bench then heard the issue in the afternoon. After hearing the case, the HC, citing the Apex court matter, said that status quo be maintained for now. But before the HC order, BJP had moved the Election Commission urging that the arrest warrants be executed immediately. Senior leaders had argued that since the HC had refused to hear the matter, there was no stay on the arrest warrants. But that was before the HC’s order on the issue. Trinamool did not react to the developments immediately. A Trinamool leader said, “The HC order is being formally communicated to the East Midnapore district police, the Nandigram police and the EC police observers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/land-stir-arrest-relief-for-14-tmc-leaders-as-hc-orders-status-quo/articleshow/81787778.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

LMC officials shared that 35,861 daily wage earners were given the Rs 10,000 loan till Wednesday, March 31, while Hyderabad provided loan to 35,245 vendors. Union ministry of housing & urban affairs had launched PM Street Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) scheme last July to empower street vendors by providing loans to them and helping in their holistic development and economic upliftment. Collateral-free working capital loans of up to Rs 10,000 for a year were given to approximately 50 lakh street vendors across the country, to help them resume their businesses. “The PM SVANidhi scheme offers incentives in the form of interest subsidy at 7% per annum on regular loan repayment and cashback up to Rs 1,200 per annum for using digital transactions,” said DUDA project manager Nidhi Bajpayee. “Initially, we focused on street vendors registered with LMC, but later the government made relaxations and included all jobless from weaker sections who want to run small businesses. We added rag pickers, scrap dealers, tailors, rickshaw pullers and others. We also organized special Aadhaar camp and arranged a letter of recommendation from LMC for the vendors to open bank accounts and avail loan.” Vinod Mishra, lead bank district manager Lucknow said, “Among the top 10 urban local bodies in the country, seven are from UP for active participation in disbursing loan to street vendors, with Lucknow at top and including Kanpur, Varanasi, Agra, Allahabad, Meerut and Ghaziabad.” Additional municipal commissioner, Rakesh Yadav said, “Over 70,000 vendors had applied for the scheme out of which we approved nearly 40,000 and disbursed amount to 35,861 daily wage earners.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-beats-hyd-indore-to-top-in-pm-scheme-loan-disbursal/articleshow/81794049.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Nagpur||Nagpur district records 78000 cases, 3rd highest in country, in March||NAGPUR: The district registered 78,437 Covid-19 positive cases in March, which was higher than all the monthly figures in the year-long pandemic. The district has seen probably third highest cases among all districts in the country in the last 31 days. The state’s public health department (PHD) said total cases in the district surged to 2,30,187 by the end of March. The 78,437 cases in March are more than Thane (59,258) and Nashik (50,732), even though these districts have higher population. Only Mumbai (88,856) and Pune (1,26,441) were ahead of the district. The district civil surgeon (CS) said there were 76,250 cases in March, which were less than those stated by PHD. Similarly, total cases were 2,26,038 as per CS as on March 31. The cases in March were over 1.6 times those registered in September last year (48,457) and 3.25 times August (24,163). The district witnessed peak of first wave in last two weeks of August and entire September last year. Therefore, cases in September were highest till March. The district has started to witness second wave from third week of February and surge in cases from beginning of March. Ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) had announced detection of double mutated variant in 20% of samples sent from the district. Also, National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, detected UK variant from swab sample of a woman from Wardha, who probably contracted the disease in the city. Till March 16, the highest number of cases registered in a day were 2,343 on September 13 last year. The severity of infection in the district in March can be gauged from the fact that the daily average of cases in March comes to 2,460. Test positivity rate (TPR) in March was 20.11% and more than all months, excluding September (24.63%). The TPR also surged in March despite record number of tests. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Zilla Parishad (ZP) along with private laboratories conducted 3,79,143 tests in March, double the number in all months. There had been 1,96,722 tests in September last year. Daily average of tests in March was 12,230. With spike in cases, the deaths did not rise from beginning of March. Fatalities started to increase from third week. Deaths were above 50 for last five consecutive days. The 763 fatalities registered in March were more than all months, excluding August (919) and September (1,465). The case fatality rate was 1% in March, which is less than all months. It is the result of high number of cases in March. The district witnessed shortage of beds as well as oxygen supply in March despite pandemic becoming an year old. The same situation prevailed in August and September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-district-records-78k-cases-3rd-highest-in-country-in-march/articleshow/81790965.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Kolkata||West Bengal polls 2021: The TMC game has come to an end, says JP Nadda||KOLKATA: Nandigram was in the back of his mind when BJP president J P Nadda held rallies in Hooghly on Wednesday. He predicted that chief minister Mamata Banerjee will lose the election in Nandigram when the results are out on May 2. “Khela aar hobe na. Khela sesh (the Trinamool game has come to an end). The Bengal CM knows it better whether her campaign on a wheelchair helped her, but the people have decided. Mamataji is going to lose Nandigram,” the BJP president said. Nadda began the day by offering prayers at Belur Math. He was accompanied by the BJP candidate from Bally —Baishali Dalmiya. Later, Nadda attended a roadshow there. Nadda made an oblique response to Banerjee’s allegation on people crowding upon her at Biruliabazar in Nandigram, causing her leg injury. “Did she come over to Nandigram to contest the polls or did Suvendu Adhikari go to Bhaowanipore? It is quite clear that she had left her home constituency and come over to Nandigram to take on her former Cabinet colleague,” Nadda said at a rally in Dhaniakhali.  The BJP president exuded confidence over his party’s getting 200-plus seats. Nadda, while referring to the “high polling” in the 30 seats that went to polls in the first phase, said: “The average polling in the first phase was 79%. It saw people coming out in large numbers to cast their votes. If 79% people have come out to vote, it means they have decided to vote against Trinamool. The Election Commission ensured a violence-free poll.” Nadda was optimistic about a further swing in favour of the BJP from the third phase onwards. “The crowd at the rallies shows which way people’s mandate is swinging,” the BJP leader said though the BJP public meeting at Tarakeswar turned out to be a poor show.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/the-tmc-game-has-come-to-an-end-nadda/articleshow/81787782.cms||Rohit Khanna

Initial inquiries have revealed that the vehicle in question was registered as Tata Winger ambulance with the Barabanki RTO on December 21, 2013, and had a fitness validity up to January 31, 2017, as per the details available with the mParivahan mobile application. Highly placed sources confirmed that the Uttar Pradesh Police have already launched a probe into the ownership details of the ambulance and the circumstances in which it is operating in Punjab. Sources said that the vehicle in question is registered with a hospital in Barabanki district. However, investigators had failed to trace the owner of the vehicle on the basis of the address mentioned in the registration document, till late on Wednesday evening. “District police and administrative officials have been roped in to trace the owner,” a said a senior officer supervising the discreet probe. He said there were reports that the same ambulance was used to once ferry the gangster turned politician to Delhi for a court hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mukhtar-reaches-punjab-court-in-ups-ambulance-probe-ordered/articleshow/81794067.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal CM urges non-BJP leaders to devise ‘plan of action’||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday wrote a letter to 14 leaders of non-BJP parties, including six chief ministers, urging them to chart a “plan of action” after the assembly polls to thwart attempts by BJP to dilute state governments “to municipalities” and establish a “one-party authoritarian rule in India”. The CM wrote that BJP does not want other parties to exist. “The enactment of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill by the two Houses of Parliament is a grave development as it is aimed at snatching away all the powers of a democratically elected government of Delhi vesting power in the hand of the Lt Governor, a nominee of the Centre, to act in proxy,” the CM wrote. The CM described the new enactment as a mockery of democracy as it disempowers the people of the NCT. “It violated a Supreme Court verdict of 2018, which upheld the pre-eminence of Delhi’s elected government in all matters other than police, public order and land,” the CM wrote. She also wrote: “The BJP led Centre has been vindictively misusing CBI, ED and other institutions against leaders and functionaries of non-BJP parties for its political gains.” Banerjee lashed out at the Centre for disbanding the National Development Council, the Inter-State Council and the Planning Commission. She also questioned the Centre’s policy of “reckless and wholesale” privatisation of the nation’s assets. Banerjee has written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, NCP president Sharad Pawar, DMK leader M K Stalin, SP leader Akhilesh Yadav, RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, chief ministers Uddhav Thackeray, Hemant Soren, Arvind Kejriwal, Naveen Patnaik, Jagan Reddy, K S Reddy, Farooq Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and Leftist leader Dipankar Bhattacharya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-urges-non-bjp-leaders-to-devise-plan-of-action/articleshow/81787786.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Cabinet nod for women policy, new tourism rules||JAIPUR: The state cabinet on Wednesday approved the draft of the New Women Policy, 2021, for the overall development of women and girls. The policy will help to establish better coordination between various departments for the welfare of women and girls while ensuring their safety and empowering them. It addresses important aspects in the life of women such as birth, survival, health, nutrition, education, training, livelihood, housing, property ownership, political and social empowerment, etc., and has been formulated in line with the Sustainable Development Goal-2030. The policy also calls for special focus groups to set separate targets and make plans for their welfare. The cabinet also approved the Rajasthan Tourism Business (Facilitation and Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2021, for selection, training and licencing of new tourist guides. This will enable the entry of trained and skilled guides into the tourism industry and create 6,000 self-employment opportunities. As per the new rules, aspirants only require minimum educational qualification and do not have to undergo an interview. The age limit for selection has been relaxed and there are provisions for reservation, bonus points, training among other changes. To increase employment opportunities in the tourism sector, the cabinet also approved a Guest House Scheme under the Rajasthan Tourism Policy, 2020. The scheme will be applicable in all urban areas of Rajasthan, and enables prospective entrepreneurs to provide accommodation facilities to tourists at their homes. The maximum number of rooms for such a guest house has been fixed at 20. The owner or lessee of the residence will be required to reside in the guest house with the family. This scheme will be different from the Paying Guest Scheme of the tourism department. The cabinet also gave its nod to Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Prevention and Control Rules, 2021, to prevent the spread of HIV-AIDS epidemic in the state. This will enable the appointment of an ombudsman to take decisions under the Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Prevention and Control Act, 2017, as well as on matters related to violations of the provisions of the Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cabinet-nod-for-womenpolicy-new-tourism-rules/articleshow/81794060.cms||---
---||Kolkata||A day ahead of polls, Suvendu stays away from party office||Nandigram: For more than four months since he held his first meeting at Tekhali Bridge, Suvendu Adhikari was in a haste — meeting people, visiting temples — trying to bring about a change in the Nandigram narrative from the anti-land acquisition stir days in 2007. On Wednesday, a day before Nandigram goes to polls, Adhikari stayed indoors, gearing up the BJP vote machine for the mother of all battles on Thursday. Adhikari came to the BJP Reyapara party office at 2pm and spent 10 minutes with the party workers before he went out. BJP Tamluk vice-president Pralay Pal was at the party office, within 30 metres of the Biruliabazar house where CM Mamata Banerjee has been staying for the last three days. “He told us that he will be back in the night. He will stay at the party office for the night,” said Pal. BJP organizers said their leader will offer prayers to the Shiv Mandir where the Bengal CM paid a visit before starting her Nandigram campaign. “After the puja, he will cast his vote at the Nandanayekbar polling booth before he starts visiting other booths,” Pal said. The frequent visits by Mamata Banerjee to the temples and majhars spread over Nandigram is an indication that religious polarization was at work. In 2007, the divide was between the ruling CPM and the Trinamool and black flags hung in villages against the carnage. Fourteen years later, the same Nandigram dons different flags — the three-cornered saffron flags with the “Om” embossed on it and the usual party flags at Maheshpur and Gopalnagar, villages with Hindu majority in Nandigram Block I. At Nandigram II, party flags of Trinamool, BJP and CPM were seen all over. Villages with Muslim presence — Garchakraberia, Mohammadpur, Kalicharanpur — had mostly Trinamool flags. The scare was palpable particularly in Nandigram I. A tea stall owner from Gokulnagar said: “People are scared. They are getting indirect threats.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-day-ahead-of-polls-suvendu-stays-away-from-party-office/articleshow/81787797.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Just before ending her life, the victim sent selfie videos to the accused and her family members informing them about her decision to commit suicide. The victim, D Aishwarya, 20, committed suicide at a PG Accommodation on Road Number 3, Banjara Hills on March 29 night by hanging herself.

On February 20, 2020, they married at a temple in Hayathnagar without informing family members. “After the marriage, elders from both the families discussed about their future. As they were financially not independent, we took Aishwarya home. However, later Aishwarya got a job in a hospital at Sainikpuri in July 2020 and started staying in a hostel there,” Aishwarya’s father D Ram Kumar mentioned in the complaint to police. During this period, Asher used to frequently meet Aishwarya.In January 2021, Aishwarya joined an infrastructure company as a business executive and started living with Asher at a room in Khairatabad.

---||Mumbai||Standing panel seeks judicial probe into Sunrise fire; BMC doesn’t renew licence||MUMBAI: Opposition corporators in BMC’s standing committee on Wednesday hit out at former municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi for granting a provisional Occupation Certificate (OC) to Bhandup’s Sunrise Hospital in Dreams Mall and incumbent chief Iqbal Chahal for ignoring the building proposal (BP) department’s report to review the provisional OC. They demanded a judicial probe by a principal secretary rank officer, instead of deputy municipal commissioner Prabhat Rahangdale, into the fire that broke out in the mall on March 26. The hospital is located on the third floor of the mall. Even as Chahal said he would not comment on the proceedings of the standing committee meeting, the BMC did not renew the nursing home licence of Sunrise Hospital on Wednesday. The BMC said it did not extend the nursing home licence, which ended on March 31, since the hospital management did not submit a fresh no-objection certificate from the fire brigade and permanent OC from the BP department. “They will have to shut down the hospital unless they comply with these requirements,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health). Raising a point of order in the standing committee meeting, Congress corporator Ravi Raja, who is the opposition leader in the BMC, said people had died in the hospital fire due to BMC’s negligence. “The entire paper trail shows that the office of the municipal commissioner is involved in this. This phenomenon of issuing permissions on WhatsApp groups is unheard of...The current municipal commissioner has not even briefed the standing committee when lives have been lost. There are many unanswered questions and the finger is pointing directly at the current municipal commissioner,” Raja said. He demanded a judicial probe since senior IAS officers are in the dock over the incident. “The documents, which are now in public domain, show that there was blatant misuse of power in granting a provisional OC by Pardeshi. There is no such thing as a provisional OC and this is a violation of the Development Control Rules. The BP department’s report was submitted in August 2020, but the provisional OC was not revoked, so this shows complete neglect on the part of Chahal too,” claimed Samajwadi Party corporator and MLA Rais Shaikh. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra demanded that the kin of the deceased be given Rs 10 lakh each. “The chief minister apologised, but actually Chahal must apologise. The BMC has not taken any responsibility so far. The officials responsible must be booked for criminal negligence and an FIR must be filed against them...” he said, adding that if a high-level probe is not initiated, the BJP will move the Bombay high court seeking a probe into the fatal hospital blaze. Last August, the BP department had raised a red flag stating that the grant of provisional OC to Sunrise Hospital must be reviewed and that it wasn’t proper to delink the irregularities of Dreams Mall from the hospital. However, despite a detailed report from the BP department the BMC did not review or revoke the provisional OC. BMC officials said after the report was submitted, the hospital had made a fresh representation seeking a regular OC. Chahal had then instructed the BP department to str-ictly go by the law while processing the representation and take necessary action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-standing-panel-seeks-judicial-probe-into-sunrise-fire-bmc-doesnt-renew-licence/articleshow/81794095.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The collector has asked health officials to start activating the centres anticipating the outbreak of Covid cases in coming weeks. The district has lesser cases currently as compared to other districts in the state, but if not controlled the number would go up drastically. Desai is holding meetings with various departments of the administration on a daily basis. The CCCs set up during the first wave have been shut down as they were set up at places like hostels, badminton halls, marriage halls and other multipurpose facilities. The ventilators, beds and even the electricity supply cables have been removed and therefore it will be a hectic task for local authorities to convert these facilities back to CC “Tehsildar and nodal officers have been asked to activate the centres. This time the centres must have a capacity to accomodate at least 100 symptomatic patients. All the infrastructure needs to be in place as soon as possible. Also this time we have asked the local authorities to set up isolation units at village level so that the asymptomatic patients are lodged into such units,” Desai said. “Covid positivity rate is increasing across Kolhapur. I have asked the authorities to ensure tracing and testing at least 30 contacts for every positive patient that will help bring down mortality as well as break the chain,” Desai added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-collector-activate-upgrade-cccs-at-taluka-level/articleshow/81784327.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Knife attack in Gomtinagar home, woman dies||LUCKNOW: A carpenter allegedly stabbed to death a woman in her house in a fit of rage after asking her for money to start a business, in Gomtinagar on Wednesday afternoon. The murder created a sensation in the locality with residents locking themselves inside their houses fearing for safety. Police later arrested the accused, Gulfam, after a chase. He is being questioned. The deceased was identified as Ruchi Agrawal (38) of Vishwas Khand. She suffered injuries on her chest. Doctors who examined her suspect that her heart was punctured in the knife attack and excessive bleeding caused her death. The body has been sent for postmortem examination. Gulfam, 34, a resident of Thakurganj, had been working in the victim’s house for the past two months. He was engaged in wood work on the ground floor of the two-storey house, said ADCP east Qasim Abidi. “We got a message in the control room about the incident around 4pm on Wednesday. A team consisting of field units reached the scene. We were told that carpenter Gulfam had committed the crime. The woman was rushed to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital where she was declared brought dead,” he said. According to Abidi, Gulfam had gone upstairs to demand money from Ruchi for a business he wanted to start. Ruchi was talking to her husband Harsh Agarwal on the phone and asked Gulfam to wait till she ended the conversation. This infuriated Gulfam and he attacked her brutally. Ruchi’s pet dog came to her rescue but Gulfam attacked it too. Harsh heard her screaming on the phone and immediately informed his neighbours who reached the scene. However, Gulfam had fled by then. “On the ground floor, Gulfam was intercepted by his co-worker Tasleemuddin, whom he also threatened to kill. At this, Tasleemuddin also ran out,” said Abidi. ACP Gomtinagar Shweta Srivastava said that Gulfam was picked up while trying to flee and a knife and hammer used in the attack were recovered from him. “During interrogation, Gulfam disclosed that he wanted money from the Agarwals and had asked Harsh in the morning before he left but was not given an assuring response. He said he wanted to threaten Ruchi into giving him money by showing the knife and hammer but got angry and attacked her,” said Srivastava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/knife-attack-in-gomtinagar-home-woman-dies/articleshow/81794080.cms||---

The reason: As many as 41 government doctors who had been working on deputation in the institute since 2019 were sent back to their parent cadre after completion of their term on Wednesday. The five departments which are expected to be hit due to the crisis are medicine, gynaecology, ophthalmology, ENT and paediatrics. After the exit of these 41 doctors, RMLIMS now has 180 teachers-cum-doctors who will take care of both teaching and patient care. Institute spokesperson Prof Srikesh Singh said that contractual appointments on 34 posts out of 41 which have fallen vacant will be done in the next five days. Till then, the existing faculty members have been asked to work extra for the sake of patients, he added. Besides, he said, the process to recruit 93 faculty members across the institute is also underway and will be completed in three months. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital was merged with RMLIMS in 2019. Around 43 doctors of the provincial medical services (PMS) working in the hospital at that time were allowed to continue on deputation till fresh recruitments are made. Two of these 43 doctors have gone to court seeking extension. The rest were relieved on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/term-of-41-docs-ends-at-rmlims-5-depts-face-crisis/articleshow/81794118.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||March showed worst of Covid in Vidarbha, ends on promising note||NAGPUR: More than 1.55 lakh new cases, a lakh recoveries, and 1,455 deaths in 31 days, the month of March has shown a never before Covid-19 scenario to Vidarbha. While March 2021 marked the first anniversary of Covid-19 in the region, the month brought restrictions almost like the March 2020 lockdown for some days in Vidarbha. Rising cases and crisis for health facilities brought back memories of the September 2020 peak. Similarly, increased deaths, especially in last week of the month, brought a scary picture of the pandemic back to the region. The more infective variant of the virus, careless behaviour of citizens, and poor preparation of administration could be the foremost reasons. However, there are many positive developments too. Covid-19 testing capacity in Vidarbha is being used to its optimum level in March. The region, which used to conduct less than 20,000 tests per day earlier, is now conducting about 45,000 tests daily. This has ensured a good contact tracing and early detection of patients. Secondly, deaths due to Covid-19 are very few as compared to the number of patients in the first wave of September 2020. The case fatality rate of March is less than 1%. The same was above 3.5% in September. This means, fewer patients died in March. More infectious, but less fatal variant of virus, growing awareness about Covid-19 in common people, and the health facilities developed during first wave are proving to be handy. Vaccination began for the common people above 60 years of age, and 45+ with comorbid conditions from March 1. Being the most effective method to protect people from Covid-19, vaccination gained pace in this month. With highest 3.59 lakh doses given in Nagpur district, more than 12.20 lakh jabs have been delivered in Vidarbha. District collectors in all 11 districts are now focusing on promoting vaccination. Division-wise Covid-19 scenario of Vidarbha shows that five districts in Amravati division had gone through the worst phase of Covid-19 in March. Including Amravati, the curve of new cases in all five districts is now almost flattened. In Amravati, the curve has started moving southwards. In Nagpur division, Nagpur and Wardha reported similar kind of surge especially in third and fourth week of March. Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gondia and Gadchiroli have reporting more cases and deaths in last week of March and people need to be extremely careful here as a similar surge can be witnessed here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/march-showed-worst-of-covid-in-vid-ends-on-promising-note/articleshow/81791155.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

A complaint in this regard has been registered at the MIDC Waluj police station. Inspector Madhukar Sawant said that a case of cheating in addition to relevant sections of Information and Technology Act has been registered against unidentified suspects. “Either the email id was hacked for collecting all details before creating a look-alike email address or it is has been done by someone familiar with the transactions,” said Sawant. According to police, Vinayak Devlankar (54) would often purchase raw material from a South-Korean company for manufacturing high quality electronic circuit boards. The transaction, including placing of orders to the foreign company, used to be carried out through a man named KL Jung. Investigation officer and inspector Prashant Potdar said that sometime in September 2020, Devlankar had placed an order for the required raw material. On October 23, he received an email from a look-alike email address informing him that the placed order is ready and bill of Rs 18.28 lakh must be cleared so that the consignment is shipped. “The suspect created an email address which just had an alphabet different from the original email address of the foreign-based company’s representative. The suspect even attached a forged invoice bearing account number of a UK-based bank to trap the victim,” saidPotdar. Falling prey to the trap, Devlankar immediately deposited the amount and awaited shipment for next few days. Things came to light only after he contacted Jung for the delayed shipment who informed the victim that neither he nor the company received any payment from Devlankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/electronic-circuit-board-manufacturer-duped-for-over-rs-18-lakh/articleshow/81784344.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Patna||Only 2L residents give feedback for city cleanliness as voting ends today||PATNA: Around 2 lakh residents have voted and given feedback for Patna under the Swachh Survekshan, 2021, though 40 lakh people living in the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) area have installed Swachhata app in their mobile phones. As per the figures, Patna is lagging far behind other cities in the country due to the comparatively less engagement of people. Citizens’ feedback plays a key role in better ranking of the city under Swachh Survekshan. The feedback process started on January 1 and will conclude on March 31. “Around 2 lakh people have given their feedback on sanitation and other civic issues in PMC till date. It is encouraging for us,” Patna municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma said on Tuesday. “Last year, we got 1,552 marks out of 6,000 and this year we expect 3200-3500 marks. We are trying our level best to achieve the target,” he added. Sharma said the citizens’ awareness has improved, which was evident with the increase in the number of people giving feedback for the civic body. “More than focusing on gaining the maximum feedback, we are concentrating on improving civic services and overall sanitation in the city. If our work is good, it will be reflected in the city and people will automatically consider our efforts and will give feedback,” Sharma said. He added: “We cannot make claims about our rank, but we have improved a lot as compared to last year, which itself is an encouragement for us. Things take time to fall in line and we are heading towards it with each passing day. Hopefully, we will succeed in the coming years.” While giving the feedback under Swachh Survekshan, seven questions are asked in the Swachhata app. PMC officials said around 300 people are involved in promoting the app and appealing to people to give their feedback. “We are continuously promoting Swachhata app and submitting feedback through it via different methods, including social media or campaigns. We collaborated with a musical band, which performed in different city areas to increase awareness among people,” PMC’s public relations officer Harshita said. She added: “We are also organising nukkad nataks (street plays) on the theme, ‘Patna ki Beauty Hum Sabki Duty’ for making people aware about the Swachh Survekshan and voting for the city.” Residents, on the other hand, gave a mixed response to the campaign. Vikash Kumar of Boring Road said: “"There is great progress in the city. PMC is doing a good job and I hope our city’s ranking will improve this time.” Businessman Sanjay Sinha said: “Garbage vehicles play jingles while collecting the waste from households with PMC commissioner's appeal to give feedback. They are making people aware about the importance of giving feedback under the Swachh Survekshan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/only-2l-residents-give-feedback-for-city-cleanliness-as-voting-ends-today/articleshow/81765627.cms||---

However, the reopened the shops after one-and-a-half hours as the NMC assured them that the manpower would be increased to speed up the process.“We have over 100 mobile phone shops here and there are more than five customers at a time in each of the shops. Two NMC employees came here during the opening hours and started collecting the Rs 5 entry fee from the customers,” said Bharat Patel, the owner of one mobile shop. “As a result, there was soon a long queue of the customers waiting to pay the entry fee. It took at least 10 minutes to issue one coupon with details like name of the customer, the time and other details,” said Patel.“The process was slow as there were not enough NMC staff members here. Some customers did not want to wait in the queue and left. As this affected our business, we shut our shops in protest,” said Patel. Pappu Shah, another shopkeeper, said they are not against the entry fee, but oppsoe the slow pace of the collection process. “We want the NMC administration to increase the manpower for collection of the entry fee,” he said.NMC to set up online market entry fee collection systemMeanwhile, the NMC administration has decided to introduce an online system for collection of entry fees for shoppers who want to enter the markets. The NMC is creating a mechanism to allow people to buy the coupon online. They may then carry the soft copy of the coupon when visiting the markets. There are half-a-dozen locations where the civic body has introduced the concept of a market entry fee of Rs 5. Each coupon is valid for an hour and if people overstay, they will be penalized.NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav said the new online system will be in place within two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mobile-store-owners-protest-slow-entry-fee-collection/articleshow/81784348.cms||Tushar Pawar

Taking cognizance based on reports published in various newspapers on Wednesday, commission member Ujjwal Kumar Dubey asked the DM and the SSP of Bhagalpur to submit a report on the death of Sanjay Kumar Akela alias Sanjay Yadav, before the commission by April 28. Sanjay, an employee of the minor water resources department, was allegedly picked up by police from his home at Mayaganj locality of Bhagalpur town on Monday night. Residents on Wednesday told a visiting delegation of opposition leaders that Sanjay was brutally thrashed by policemen under their custody at Barari police station. Sanjay’s family members told the delegation that he was taken to the JLNMCH when his condition deteriorated. Sanjay died at the JLNMCH around midnight of July 29 and 30. He was posted at Banka but he had come home for Holi. “The incident seems serious. Prima facie, it appears to be a case of human rights violation,” the commission member Dubey said in his order. The commission has also asked the Bhagalpur DM to send a separate report on the financial status of the deceased’s family. A delegation of Mahagathbandhan leaders comprising district-level leaders of RJD, Congress, CPM and CPI-ML on Wednesday visited Mayaganj and inquired from locals about the incident. The delegation members also talked to Sanjay's family and neighbours. CPM Bhagalpur district secretary Dashrath Prasad, who was part of the Mahagathbandhan delegation, told TOI over the phone that a delegation of opposition leaders would meet the Bhagalpur DIG on Thursday and submit him a memorandum seeking action against police officers responsible for the custody death of a government employee.

The first trial train was flagged off through video conference by managing director of Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL) Ravindra Kumar Jain. With this, a 641km section from Palanpur to Rewari will be commissioned. After inaugurating the corridor, Jain said that the 335km section will connect three important ports including Kandla, Mundra and Pipavav with parts of North India. Besides milk and vegetable, other material too will be sent by this route which will be faster as the maximum speed on these tracks is 100 kmph, he added. A train with 58 wagons left for the new Mandar Junction near Ajmer from New Palanpur Junction on Wednesday. The New Madar to New Rewari section of 305km has already been commissioned. Officials of DFCCIL said at present the average speed of a goods train of the Indian Railways (IR) is approximately 25kmph where for DFCCIL it will be 75kmph. The maximum speed of goods trains will be 100kmph. This will also reduce wagon turnaround time and utilization will increase, said a senior officer. Officials said the section commissioned is fully electrified with 2×25KV lines, while IR has just one 25KV line. Also, the train length on DFC will be 1.5km, with double stacking. Officials said they intend to start RO-RO service soon (roll-on and roll-off service for transporters) shortly from New Palanpur to Rewari. The officials said Ro-Ro service will entail loading entire trucks at the DFC station. The trucks will be manned during the journey by drivers thus reducing transit time, wear and tear, toll tax, fatigue of drivers, theft of goods and fuel consumption, said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/palanpur-madar-dfc-section-opened/articleshow/81784822.cms||---
---||Ranchi||H’bag akharas defy govt ban, take out pre-Ramnavami procession||Hazaribag: Defying a ban imposed by the state government on public gatherings and religious processions in the state, a few akharas in Hazaribag on Tuesday took out the first mangalwari julus (pre-Ramnavami processions held on Tuesdays) ahead of Ramnavami on April 21. On being informed, the police team under SDO (sadar) Vidya Bhushan Kumar and SDPO (headquarters) Mahesh Prajapati visited the busy Jhanda Chowk where the congregation of akharas took place for taking out a procession. Traditionally, the procession marks beginning of Ramnavami from the traditional Bara Akhara Mandir in the Boddom Bazar locality. On seeing police, the crowd shouted slogans and protested for stopping their procession. The district administration then warned the crowd of police action if they tried to defy Section 144 clamped in the area by going ahead with the processions. Talking to TOI, Kumar said, “Taking out a procession was a violation of the circular issued by the Government of India and the state disaster management department in view of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic.” Explaining in details, he said that the central peace committee meeting, which was attended by the officials of civil administration, police and prominent citizens belonging to all communities agreed that this year no procession during Ramnavami, Sarhul, Easter and other festivals will be allowed to be taken out. “Tuesday evening, some rigid members of the puja committees started arguing with the administration and threatened that at any cost they will take out the procession like other years. At this point, we prevented them from going ahead and due to heavy police arrangements, the procession was forced to disperse,” he said. Kumar added, to control the situation, additional forces and RAF were deployed. Asked if the administration has lodged an FIR or arrested the violators, the SDO said no punitive action has been taken as yet. “A strong warning was issued to everyone and if the violation continues, proper cases will be lodged against violators,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hbag-akharas-defy-govt-ban-take-out-pre-ramnavami-procession/articleshow/81787795.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Encounter fear prompts goon Safelkar to ‘surrender’ before City police||NAGPUR: Kamptee’s alleged top don Ranjeet Safelkar, unnerved by rumours of his ‘encounter order’ from city police chief Amitesh Kumar, made a dramatic surrender at the Police Gymkhana late Tuesday evening, when the CP was chairing a meeting there. Safelkar was formally arrested on Wednesday afternoon by the crime branch following sustained overnight grilling to ascertain his role in the murder of Manish Shrivas in 2012. Safelkar, paraded in full public view from Akashwani Chowk to district court on Wednesday, was alarmed after cops started shadowing him round-the-clock after Kumar named him a key conspirator in Shriwas and also Eknath Nimgade murder case. The latter case is being investigated by the CBI since 2016. On March 21, Safelkar had dodged the trailing police team by a whisker and fled into the forest with the help of an aide at Bhandara. He was also forced to abandon his car. Safelkar rode through forest for almost 50 km on an aide’s bike before taking a truck from Katangi in Madhya Pradesh.CP Kumar had asked SP Seoni (MP) to block traffic and sent his chasing team behind Safelkar but he again fled by jumping off the truck. He even left behind his trousers and a bag, including his passport, Aadhaar card, PAN card, two ATM cards and some cash. Safelkar, who was allegedly trying to flee to Nepal, had again escaped through the open fields and farm lands. It is learnt for several days, Safelkar was running in lungi as cops managed to seize all his belongings. Safelkar’s family too was reeling in fear after a senior crime branch officer, known for his strict ways, told them that running away from police would not augur well for the don and his ‘speeding car may meet with an accident too’. Coincidentally, Safelkar’s car did meet with an accident in Bhandara, left the family members scared. “We certainly resorted to some pressure tactics but cannot divulge more,” said the CP. After playing a cat and mouse game for around a fortnight, Safelkar had filed a petition in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Tuesday through counsels Devendra Chauhan and Prakash Jaiswal. He contended he could be eliminated in a fake encounter, a possibility expressed in a newspaper report, and also expressed keenness to surrender before Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The petition was set to be heard on Wednesday. Without even waiting for the court to hear his petition, Safelkar landed at the Gymkhana along with another person, from where he was taken to crime branch. The high court too disposed of the petition. The top cop had got Safelkar’s close aides like Bharat Hate, his brother Kalu and Hemant Gorkha arrested earlier this week. Cops also seized his three cars and one two-wheeler. Fearing an encounter, Bharat too had jumped from the first floor twisting his leg. The magistrate court remanded Safelkar to custody till April 7 and Hate brothers till April 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/encounter-fear-prompts-goon-safelkar-to-surrender-before-cp/articleshow/81787902.cms||Soumitra Bose

Hockey India announced the decision in a notice that was also tweeted through its official handle on Wednesday. A total of 28 teams were expected to participate in the tournament, which was to be hosted for the first time by Simdega. The district had successfully organised the sub-junior women’s national hockey meet last month. Of the 12 testing positive, five players and a coach are from Hockey Chandigarh and six players from Hockey Jharkhand. After being apprised of the development, chief minister Hemant Soren virtually interacted with Hockey Jharkhand players who tested positive. Soren first asked them, “Although you have tested positive, are you scared of it and how are you?” One of the players replied, “Sir we are fine despite being positive.” He also spoke with Chandigarh players on a video chat and said, “You all needn’t worry as you will be properly taken care of here.” He assured the players that he will interact with them again in the future. The Chandigarh team was the first to arrive here on Tuesday and soon their samples were collected. Samples of Hockey Jharkhand players were also sent for RT-PCR test the same day. The infected persons have been shifted to a Covid care centre while the astro-turf stadium where the matches were to be held has been sealed. The rest of the players have been quarantined in a building located on the stadium premises on Tuesday night itself. The organising committee comprising officials of the district administration, Hockey Jharkhand and Hockey Simdega held an emergency meeting on Wednesday under Simdega DC Sushant Gaurav. In a press briefing, the DC said, “Under such a situation, the organising committee has decided to shelve the tournament for the time being.” Hockey India President Gyanendro Ningombam said: “In light of the rising number of Covid-19 cases and after advice from the local state authorities, Hockey India in consultation with the host, Hockey Jharkhand, have arrived at the decision to postpone the 11th Hockey India Junior Women National Championship 2021, which was due to begin on 3rd April, 2021. Hockey Jharkhand received tremendous support from the state government to host the recently concluded 11th Hockey India Sub Junior Women National Championship 2021, however, with new protocols and guidelines in the state to combat the rapid rise of cases, it was in the best interest of the players that this decision was taken. For Hockey India, player safety is paramount.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/natl-hockey-meet-in-simdega-called-off-after-11-players-test-ve/articleshow/81787645.cms||K A Gupta

Meanwhile, officials posted at a camp set up at Bokaro railway station are finding it hard to screen everybody as most passengers arriving from various states are giving the Covid tests a slip, forcing the civil surgeon to seek help from the railways. A statement issued by the Ranchi public relations office said health teams will be deployed at Ranchi and Hatia railway stations and ITI and Khadgarha bus stands. Deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan issued a slew of directives to the administrative officials on Wednesday evening, immediately after health secretary Kamal Kishore Soan chaired a meeting of the district officials to take stock of the situation in the state capital. To check efforts of Covid-19 patients to dodge home isolation, directives were issued to all private laboratories to verify the contact numbers and document of residential addresses of people who come into their facilities to get tested. DSP (city) Amit Kumar Singh was directed to furnish daily reports of contact tracing exercises of new Covid-19 patients. In the meeting, Ranjan also asked the administrative officials to convene a meeting with all city-based private hospitals to get a clear picture of the number of Covid-19 beds available at present. Earlier in the day, Soan directed officials to ensure that travel history of infected patients and their contacts are maintained for records. He also asked district officials to ensure asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, co-morbid and serious patients are identified and priorities be set accordingly in case of hospitalisation. The district officials have been asked to take up area-wise vaccination drives and concentrate on inoculating people in areas which are witnessing a rise in cases. In Bokaro, the administration has begun mask-checking drives on roads and public places. “We have increased Covid-19 testing to 1,500 persons per day to keep a check on the virus,” said civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak. However, the railway station is the primary focus of the health department where they have launched a testing drive. Earlier, the thrust was to test passengers arriving in the Dhanbad Allapuzah (Alleppy) Special train and Ranchi-LTTE Special (train), but from Wednesday, the administration has set a target to test passengers arriving in all trains. “Earlier we took 100-150 samples a day at the station, but from Wednesday, we increased it to 500-600,” said a health department officer. On issues being faced in testing passengers, a health worker said, “When a lot of passengers arrive at the same time, many ignore and walk away. Many passengers also hide in the crowd and escape.” Pathak said, “We do not have many technicians and the test takes some time. While some passengers are patient, others give it a slip. People need to understand that the tests are being conducted for their safety.” With 68 active cases in the district as on Tuesday, Bokaro General Hospital has reopened its Critical Care Unit for Covid and augmented beds to accommodate a surge in the number of patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/swab-sampling-booths-make-a-comeback-at-ranchi-bokaro-stns/articleshow/81787519.cms||---

In September last year, Jharkhand had tested over 13.39 lakh samples (highest during the pandemic) through rapid antigen tests (RAT), TrueNat and RT-PCR machines. However, with the number of cases declining, the testing rate had reduced considerably. While 4,11,527 tests were conducted in January this year, the figures dropped to 2,93,451 in February. However, the testing rate has once again been ramped up and in March, 3,52,145 were tested for Covid-19. “With stringent contact tracing guidelines being put in place once again, we are expecting the testing numbers to go up. The district administrations are being sent out revised testing targets based on the number of new infections being reported from their districts,” state surveillance officer Dr Rakesh Dayal said. As per estimates, as many as 10 people are screened in contact tracing exercises for one Covid-19 positive patient. On March 21, health secretary Kamal Kishore Soan directed the deputy commissioners of all 24 districts to identify clusters which have reported at least three new cases within 24 hours from separate houses within a 50-metre radius. As per the new directive, health workers are to visit 100 houses within the vicinity under the contact tracing exercises. The district administrations were also directed to survey markets, shops and milk booths in proximity to such clusters and screen customers and sellers for possible infection. The DCs were also directed to ensure people, who met Covid-19-infected patients and are showing symptoms, are put through rapid antigen tests and then sampled for RT-PCR tests. “The testing figures declined because the contact tracing exercises, aggressive in the early days of the pandemic, declined with the drop in the number of cases,” a senior health official said on condition of anonymity. “Earlier, there were containment zones where every household were put through tests. Plus, people arriving from outside the state had to get themselves tested upon arrival. Authorities became lax and consecutively, the testing rate dropped,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ramp-up-order-to-arrest-cov-testing-plunge/articleshow/81787780.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Only night curfew imposed by the state government will be imposed in the city and adjoining towns. With orders of restrictions lapsing on midnight of Wednesday, guardian minister Nitin Raut held a meeting with officials in the afternoon. “All restrictions imposed by us in district will stop from April 1. Restrictions or decisions taken by the state only will be implemented here. I thank all people of the district for supporting restrictions imposed here to contain the spread of the disease,” Raut said. The state order dated March 27 had imposed restriction on the districts from taking any decision related to curbs. The state had made it mandatory for districts to seek prior permission from chief secretary if they require any type of restrictions. Therefore, Raut and officials have reportedly decided to discontinue the restrictions. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “All shops, restaurants etc can run up to 8pm. No activity, excluding medical and emergency services, will be allowed between 8pm and 7am as per directives of the government,” he said. The government and local authorities had allowed physical classes for Std V-XII and coaching classes. The district had imposed restrictions on these with spike in cases from February 23. Now, there are reportedly no orders from the state for restricting physical classes. Sources from NMC and collector office said whatever classes were allowed by the state earlier can open from April 1. Radhakrishnan said, “Educational institutions should consult education officer for more clarity or any confusion. Our order is very clear that whatever decision is taken by the government will be in effect in the city.” Weekly markets, gyms, libraries, gardens etc can open from April 1 along with marriage ceremonies in lawns, hotels etc. State had restricted attendance in marriage ceremonies to 50 people and 20 people at funerals. Religious places can also reopen with standard operating procedures (SoPs) from respective organizations. The restrictions were imposed in the city and adjoining towns from February 23 and continued till March 31. There were stricter restrictions, including on movement of people, for a week from March 15 to 21. Raut said, “Vaccination is the only solution to contain the spread and control deaths. All people above 45 years must get vaccinated. People should ensure Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.” Raut took suggestions from home minister Anil Deshmukh, and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis online. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari was present for the first time in the meeting called by Raut and gave suggestions. Raut also reviewed situation of beds, oxygen and medicines. “Patients of rural parts of the district are not getting admission immediately due to lack of coordination. NMC additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma has been appointed as nodal officer for the city. Similarly, sub divisional officer has been appointed for respective tehsils. GMCH will increase beds on daily basis. I have given directives to GMCH and IGGMCH to take service of all doctors in Covid. Directives were also given to cancel leaves, excluding medical and emergency, of all doctors,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-restrictions-except-night-curfew-in-city/articleshow/81787974.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The e-auction committee for the SEZ land has decided to proceed with the e-auction through the National Informatics Centre (NIC) but while doing so, the committee has decided that the PPP cell will call the shots during the process. The five-member committee that was constituted to select a property consultant to help auction the SEZ will just monitor the process, the industries department said. “The committee also decided that the director of the PPP cell will provide hand-holding support in e-auctioning process, including preparation of an auction document. GIDC regional manager Girish Priolkar will be the liaison officer to interact with the PPP cell on behalf of the GIDC,” a document signed by principal secretary (finance) Puneet Kumar Goel and industries secretary J Ashok Kumar stated. Suresh Shanbogue is the director of the PPP cell that is headed by chief minister Pramod Sawant. The GIDC had called upon various banks to give a presentation regarding their e-auction platforms, modalities of the auction process and the cost involved if an initial tranche of five lakh sqm of SEZ land was to be auctioned. Though all the banks were asked to submit detailed proposals, the committee felt the NIC’s e-auction portal was the best. “The NIC has been providing its platform to conduct e-auctions for state and central governments departments. The e-auction platform is in compliance with government regulations and guidelines along with enhanced security. Considering the above parameters, including the enhanced safety and security features of the platform and the minimum charges by the NIC, it is proposed to proceed with the e-auction of SEZ land through through the NIC,” the committee said. Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Bank of India and Bank of Maharashtra also attended the meeting. The banks’ representatives pointed out that other than Punjab National Bank, none of the others their own platform to conduct e-auctions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govts-ppp-cell-to-call-shots-for-e-auction-of-sez-land/articleshow/81791692.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Power plants in city need to strictly follow norms to control toxic emissions: Report||NAGPUR: More bad news for the city – particulate pollution has been found to be significant in Nagpur, with winter and post-monsoon seasons being critical due to high concentration of particulate matter (PM) 10. Scientific analysis of data has also brought to the fore the fact that power plants in and around the city are acting as one of the major contributors of air pollution. This was revealed in the latest Environmental Status Report prepared by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) for Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). The analysis of pollution data shows that vehicular emissions and construction activity are major contributors to ambient air pollution in the city. The study further suggests that the rest of the toxicity in the city’s air is being caused due to emissions from coal-fired power plants. “Koradi and Khaparkheda thermal power plants need to strictly follow emissions norms and adopt control options as per the National Clean Air Programme,” the report stated. Scientists have made use of manual ambient air quality data collected by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) of monitoring stations at Civil Lines, North Ambazari Road, MIDC Hingna and Sadar. Apart from this, data from monitoring stations of Neeri at MIDC Hingna, Neeri premises and Maskasath (Itwari) has also been analysed. “Annual average of PM10 concentration is highest at residential site followed by commercial. At both sites, it has exceeded permissible limit of 60 micrograms per cubic meter prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board . Although residential site has relatively less activity, but during the study period, construction activity near it was observed,” the study stated. The study further highlighted how during the lockdown period, the concentration of four major pollutants – PM10, PM2.5, sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) reduced significantly. “This suggests the significant contribution of traffic emissions, commercial activities, small–scale industries and construction activity on ambient air quality of the city,” it stated. “In summer, air in the planetary boundary layer (the lowest part of the atmosphere) is warmer and lighter, and rises upwards more easily. This carries pollutants away from the ground and mixes them with cleaner air in the upper layers of the atmosphere in a process called ‘vertical mixing’,” said Dr Sameer Arbat, Interventional pulmonologist “During winters, the planetary boundary layer is thinner as the cooler air near the earth’s surface is dense. The cooler air is trapped under the warm air above that forms a kind of atmospheric ‘lid’. This phenomenon is called winter inversion. The effects of inversion are stronger at night, which is why air quality levels drop overnight. This is also why experts ask people to refrain from early morning walks, as they could be exposed to much higher pollution levels at that time,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/power-plants-in-city-need-to-strictly-follow-norms-to-control-toxic-emissions-report/articleshow/81791949.cms||Manka Behl

Sardinha said that in light of the increase in Covid-19 cases, the state should not use the money for events and celebrations as it would lead to a larger spread of the virus. “The funds sanctioned by the Centre should be used to establish a full-fledged cancer institute in Goa because cancer is rapidly increasing and because people have to either go to private hospitals where the charges are very high or they have to go to Mumbai,” said Sardinha. He said that there 2 lakh sqm of land is available the government at Macazana where the two institutes could come up. “We don’t have a virology institute and if anything has to be tested after post mortem we have to send to Pune,” he said. He also demanded that the state government appoint an impartial committee to study the feedback received from gram sabhas and NGOs regarding the Goa CZMP “We want a white paper on this. Please appoint a committee to go into the suggestions and then study the CZMP plans,” said Sardinha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/utilise-funds-from-rs-300cr-sanctioned-to-set-up-cancer-hosp/articleshow/81792042.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Rane says no coal block allotted, but website announces bid date||Panaji: Denying allegations of the opposition members, industries minister Vishwajit Rane on Wednesday said the government has not allotted the Dongri Tal-II coal block in Madhya Pradesh to any agency. Rane also termed the allegations levelled against the government in the House on Tuesday as “false”. “We postponed the question I-A. I don’t want to discuss the procedure as it was done in accordance with the rules of the House. Whatever allegations that were made against the government were false. Till date, we have not allotted the coal block to any agency, so casting aspersions on government’s the decision was not right,” the industries minister told reporters. The minister appears to have got some things wrong as he tried to defend the government. Rane said that the request for quotation (RFQ) for the coal block itself has not been floated. “The whole idea of the opposition was to attack the government when the RFQ is not floated and mine developer cum operator is not brought on board. It appears as a theory of the opposition to defame the government,” Rane said. Contrary to what Rane said, the PPP cell and GIDC floated the RFQ prepared by aXYKno Capital Services on March 5. The bid document on the PPP cell website clearly shows the schedule for bids to be received and even specifies that April 15 is the last date to submit bids. TOI had reported on March 6 that GIDC had floated a tender seeking bids from mine developers to operate the Dongri Tal II block on behalf of GIDC. Rane also justified the selection of aXYKno Capital Services on a nomination basis saying that the state was running out of time. GFP MLA Vijai Sardesai and independent MLA Rohan Khaunte, during Question Hour on the last day of the Goa legislative assembly, accused the government of a Rs 1,000 crore scam in the coal block allocation, after their question on the issue was postponed to the next session, even as the reply to the question was provided. They alleged the government was doing it to hide information, and the appointment procedure of Nagpur-based consultant aXYKno Capital services Pvt Ltd by the public private partnership (PPP) cell to explore the coal block had bypassed the bidding process. The industries minister said the steering committee had considered every point while selecting aXYKno Capital Services Pvt Ltd, and added that people having doubts can access the minutes of the meeting and check the facts. “The company does not have any case pending against it, and it was selected based on its undertaking they had submitted. All points are noted in the minutes of the steering committee meeting,” Rane said. The allocation of coal block-II has been delayed due to the pandemic as the government was busy with Covid management. The opposition on Tuesday attacked the government, pointing out that a request for quotations (RFQ) was not floated and a mine developer was not brought on board. “Still, they made allegations. It was not right. It was a theory of the opposition to defame the government,” he said. In the past, Rane said, 22 files relating to the coal block were taken by the CBI investigating the coal block scam. Files have not been returned yet, he said. This government doesn’t want to make a mistake, and the consultant was appointed on a nomination basis since the government was running out of time and didn’t want to lose on the coal block, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rane-says-no-coal-block-allotted-but-website-announces-bid-date/articleshow/81792155.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
