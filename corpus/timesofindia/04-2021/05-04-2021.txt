While attacks have continued unabated in Afghanistan, the insurgent Taliban has rarely taken responsibility since the formal start of peace talks and an agreement with the United States last year. Kabul police spokesman Ferdaws Faramarz confirmed the casualties in Sunday's bombing in the Paghman district of Kabul and said the numbers could rise. The Taliban, in a statement, claimed that 45 Afghan security force members had been killed or injured in the blast. The insurgent group also issued a warning against what it called continued air strikes in a number of areas of Afghanistan, saying that they violate an agreement between the Taliban and the United States. That agreement envisages the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan by May 1 in exchange for peace guarantees from the Taliban and peace talks with the US-backed Afghan government. Sunday's attack comes as Washington looks to inject life into the slow-moving peace talks. It has proposed the holding of a conference in Turkey later this month and the forming of an interim government to include Taliban representatives. Western capitals have called for a ceasefire by the Taliban, saying that meeting the May 1 troop withdrawal deadline will be difficult if the level of violence does not fall in Afghanistan. The Taliban last month threatened to resume hostilities against foreign troops in Afghanistan if they did not meet the withdrawal deadline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/three-security-personnel-killed-in-taliban-car-bombing-near-kabul/articleshow/81902125.cms||---

The operation was part of a tactical move to take on CPI (Maoist)’s guerrilla force, People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army battalion No.1 (PLGA-1) led by ‘most-wanted’ commander Hidma. The assessments were discussed at a review held by home minister Amit Shah on Sunday. He said the fight against Maoists would be further intensified and the deaths would not go in vain. The shootout took place in the ‘core’ Naxal area and was also intended to pre-empt the annual tactical counter offensive campaign (TCOC) in which Maoists launch targeted strikes on security forces between March and June. CRPF DG Kuldiep Singh told TOI that security personnel not only inflicted heavy casualties on the Maoist cadres, who carried back their dead and injured in four tractors, but also that they managed to retrieve bodies of two security personnel and recover arms and also brought back all the injured as well as a dead woman Naxal’s body, covering a distance of 10km in extreme heat. “Yes, we suffered casualties, but our men fought bravely for four hours. By alleging that the casualties may have happened due to a lapse or failure, we will be underestimating the capabilities of our personnel to hit the Maoists in their core areas,” Singh said. The CRPF DG said the fight against the Maoists in their ‘den’ would be intensified in the days to come. Shah on Sunday evening held a review meeting to take stock of the incident and discuss strategies. In fact, Shah made it clear earlier in the day that Saturday’s reverses would not dilute the fight against CPI (Maoist). Chhattisgarh DGP D M Awasthi, when contacted by TOI, said there was prior intelligence that PLGA-1, which is known to be active in Sukma region, was in the Bijapur area. “The idea was to fight them in the ‘core’ Maoist area before they started hitting at security forces’ camps as part of the TCOC they are known to launch annually from March-end to June, when shedding of leaves in the forests offers good visibility for operations. It is a good time for counter-operations as well, for the same reason,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/reds-took-back-their-dead-in-4-tractors-crpf-chief/articleshow/81902900.cms||Bharti Jain

However, all exams for Class 10 and 12 shall be held as per the schedule. Keeping in view the likelihood of young children getting infected and transmitting infection in large numbers, the executive committee on Sunday decided to take precautionary measures and also, put a ceiling of 200 persons on all kinds of social and customary gatherings and functions, subject to strict adherence to Covid protocol already in place in this connection. Death rate and Covid-19 cases in J&K have shown an upward trend in the past two weeks forcing the UT administration to re-activate all containment facilities including testing centres that were put in place last year when Covid griped J&K. Meanwhile, in view of surge in corona positive cases, Government Medical College, Jammu, conducted RAT SWEEP tests for its staff and hostel students and found six students positive. “Isolation of all Covid positive students has been arranged at the Maternal Child Hospital in Jammu and it has been decided that the RAT SWEEP test will now be done periodically in routine,” a hospital official said. J&K on Sunday recorded 573 fresh Covid-19 cases, including 105 travellers, taking the tally to 1,33,012, while three more deaths due to the virus raised the toll to 2,008, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/spike-in-covid-cases-jk-govt-orders-closure-of-schools/articleshow/81903004.cms||M Saleem Pandit

A CoBRA commando is still missing. On Sunday, when reinforcements reached the encounter site on Sunday, police found injured jawans, who tried to take refuge in abandoned huts, had run into Maoists lying in wait for this. Wounded troops were stabbed, shot and hacked to death. A fierce battle raged in the jungles of Bijapur district for hours on Saturday. The area is a stronghold of dreaded Maoist commander Madvi Hidma, whose name has cropped up in every major attack in these parts since the massacre of Congress leaders in Jhiram Ghati in June 2013.

The operation was part of a tactical move to take on CPI (Maoist)’s guerrilla force, People’s LiberationIn Saturday’s ambush, Maoists triggered blasts and then rained bullets and shells on the troops from well-camouflaged positions, inflicting heavy causalities. One of the survivors of the encounter said that they were attacked by over 400 Maoists from three sides. The ambush lines stretched over 2km near Tekulguda village. Running gunfights broke out near Tekulguda, Jonaguda and Jeeragaon villages as the forces fought back hard to break out of the ambush. Read AlsoWill take our fight against Naxalites to the end: Amit ShahGUWAHATI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday cut short his final leg of campaigning for the third phase of elections in Assam and returned to Delhi in view of the Naxal attack in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma in which 23 security personnel were killed. Shah skipped his scheduled programmes in the stateSome jawans carried their injured colleagues into the deserted Tekulguda village, only to run into a trap where Maoists pounced on them with daggers. Some locals who reached the spot before police told TOI, “Blood-soaked bodies of security personnel were scattered over 1km and we could clearly see signs of their desperate struggle for life. Bullet-riddled and stabbed bodies were found in an open field and huts in Tekulguda. A few of the bodies were without trousers.” Villagers said the Maoists had set up firing positions on a hilltop, a field and in spots inside the village. “The jawans were completely surrounded. All the 50-60 houses in Tekulguda were vacant as per the Maoists’ plan. Bullets and country-made mortars were recovered from the site,” they said. Home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu said that around 2,000 troops had gone on the operation, deep in the jungles of Bijapur, on information that a large number of Maoists were holding a meeting there. Confirming that the troops were ambushed, Sahu said: “Our forces fought valiantly and both sides used mortars and other sophisticated weapons.” News of the ambush got out late Saturday afternoon when the gunfight was still on. Till that night, police had confirmed only five deaths. It took almost 24 hours for a rescue party of 500 cops to reach the encounter site in the dense forests of Tekulguda, close to the border of Sukma and Bijapur districts, with drones keeping watch on possible Maoist ambush parties. Quickly, the body count rose. Bastar range IG P Sundarraj said that the uniformed body of a woman Maoist commander, Madvi Manoja, had been recovered along with an Insas rifle. Maoists looted weapons and even shoes from martyred jawans, a police officer said. Sundarraj said that Maoists suffered heavy casualties — 12 killed and 16 injured — and that the insurgents had carried them in two tractors towards Jabbamarka and Gomguda villages. Seven of the dead jawans and 16 injured are commandos of the CRPF’s commando unit, CoBRA, which is the spearhead in most major operations. Eight personnel from District Reserve Guards, six from STF and a Bastariya Battalion jawan were also killed. The injured include 10 DRG personnel and five STF jawans. A CoBRA jawan, Rakeshwar Singh Manhas, is still missing. The injured troops are being treated in hospitals in Raipur and Bijapur. “The 13 jawans, who are undergoing treatment in Raipur, are now out of danger,” said chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who is on a tour of Assam. Union home minister Amit Shah called CM Baghel and discussed the situation in Bijapur. CRPF DG Kuldeep Singh, who arrived in Chhattisgarh on Sunday morning to take stock of the situation, said the Maoists looted seven AK47s, two Insas rifles and an LMG. “There’s no point in saying that there was some kind of intelligence or operational failure. Had it been so, forces would haven’t gone on an operation and so many Naxals would haven’t been killed,” the CRPF chief said, adding: “Three tractors were used to carry injured and dead Maoists from the site. It is tough to say right now how many of them were killed, but it shouldn’t be less than 25-30.” President Ramnath Kovind, PM Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, CM Baghel and Sahu have expressed deep condolences. PM Modi tweeted: “My thoughts are with the families of those martyred while fighting Maoists in Chhattisgarh. The sacrifices of the brave martyrs will never be forgotten. May the injured recover at the earliest.” “I bow to the sacrifices of our brave security personnel. We will continue our fight against these enemies of peace and progress,” Shah tweeted, assuring all support to the state in battling the Maoist menace. CM Baghel said the morale of security personnel in Bastar is high. “We will win the fight against Naxalites,” he said. This is the second major attack since March 24 when Maoists blew up a bus carrying security personnel, killing five policemen and injuring 13 in neighbouring Narayanpur district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chhattisgarh-23-jawans-massacred-in-maoist-ambush-finds-rescue-team/articleshow/81903146.cms||Rashmi Drolia

India recorded 1,03,844 fresh cases on Sunday, led by a massive spike in the pandemic in Maharashtra, which added a record 57,074 fresh infections. Sunday's national case count was more than 5,000 higher than the previous peak of 98,795 cases reported on September 17 last year, as per TOI’s Covid database collated from state governments. With this, the second wave of the pandemic in India, which started just around 52 days ago, has already seen a higher peak in cases than the first wave. The seven-day rolling average of daily cases has increased seven-fold, up from 11,364 on February 11 to 78,318 on April 4 — the sharpest rise since the start of the pandemic. Sunday also saw a record single-day increase in the country's pool of active cases, which rose by over 50,000. Active cases crossed 7 lakh, just three days after going past the 6-lakh mark. Coronavirus live updatesIndia recorded 5,48,625 fresh coronavirus cases in the current week (March 29-April 4), the highest since September 28-October 4 (when the count was 5.5 lakh). The current week's count was 1,55,569 higher than the number recorded in the previous seven days, which is the biggest jump in cases seen since the beginning of the pandemic. Read AlsoWeekend lockdown: Maharashtra shuts eateries, malls, curbs travel amid Covid surgeThe rapid spread of Covid-19 finally forced the Uddhav Thackeray government to announce lockdown-like restrictions across the state from 8pm on Monday. On weekends, a complete lockdown will be imposed. A state government notification issued late on Sunday said all shops except essential servicesDeaths too registered the steepest ever week-on-week increase. There were 2,974 fatalities recorded during March 29-April 4, a record 1,099 more than the count in the previous week (1,875). This week's Covid toll was the highest since November 30-December 6. While fatalities have risen sharply during the second wave, the numbers are still far less than the toll witnessed when daily cases were around the current levels in the first wave. While this could be due to a lag often seen between the rise in cases and deaths, fatalities need to be carefully monitored in the coming weeks. On Sunday, India recorded 477 deaths from the virus. The daily toll has been over 400 in the past five days, touching a high of 514 on Saturday. While Maharashtra breached the 50,000 mark in daily cases for the first time on Sunday, Mumbai's tally was also at an all-time high of 11,206. Maharashtra total case count went past the 3 million mark, nearly three-times higher than the next worst-hit state, Kerala, which has recorded over 1.1 million cases so far. Besides Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh (3,178 cases) and Gujarat (2,875) also posted their highest daily cases till date on Sunday. Twelve other states, led by Uttar Pradesh (4,164 cases) and Delhi (4,033), registered their highest single-day surge in infections this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/grim-milestone-india-is-second-country-after-us-to-cross-1-lakh-cases-in-a-day/articleshow/81903406.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

The government said a severe decline in compliance with safe practices such as wearing masks and maintaining physical distance could be the reason for the sharp rise in cases. The PM directed central teams comprising public health specialists and clinicians be sent to Maharashtra in view of high caseload and deaths, and also to Punjab and Chhattisgarh due to a disproportionate number of deaths, an official release said. On the question of vaccine supplies, the statement said, “It was informed that vaccine manufacturers are ramping up production capacity and are also in discussion with other domestic and offshore companies to augment. It was highlighted that all efforts are underway to secure adequate quantities of vaccines to meet rising domestic requirements as well as to meet the genuine needs of other countries in the spirit of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’."

India recorded 1,03,844 fresh cases on Sunday, led by a massiveModi reviewed Covid-related issues, including the ongoing vaccination drive, rising cases, deaths due to the infection, health infrastructure, logistics as well as vaccine production status. The review noted that Maharashtra contributed 57% of total cases and 47% of deaths in the last 14 days. Besides, the total daily new cases in the state touched 47,913, more than double its earlier peak. While the share of Covid-19 cases in Punjab and Chhattisgarh is still relatively lower, the number of deaths reported from these two states has raised concerns. Punjab has contributed 4.5% of the total number of cases in the country in the last 14 days. However, it has contributed 16.3% of the total deaths, which is a matter of concern. Similarly, though Chhattisgarh has contributed 4.3% of total cases over the last 14 days, its contribution in total deaths has exceeded 7% in the same period, the Centre said. The 10 high burden states and UTs are contributing 91.4% of total cases and 90.9% of total deaths in the country. Apart from Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh, other states like Karnataka, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have also shown an upward trajectory in daily new cases over the last three weeks. On Saturday, 93,249 new cases were recorded across the country, taking the active caseload to 6.9 lakh. Besides, 513 new deaths due to Covid-19 were reported across the country during the day. Of this, Maharashtra alone accounted for 277 deaths. In better news, India logged 30 lakh vaccinations for the second day on Saturday. In total, 7.6 crore doses were administered till 8.30 pm on Sunday. Of this, more than 6.5 crore people received their first dose while around 1 crore people were fully vaccinated with second doses. During the review, the PM stressed on the need to ensure availability of beds, testing facilities and timely hospitalisation to reduce fatalities. Underlining the importance to continue “Jan Bhagidari and Jan Andolan” for Covid-19 management, the PM said the five-fold strategy of ‘testing, tracing, treatment, Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination’, if implemented with utmost seriousness and commitment, would be effective in curbing the spread of the pandemic. The statement said while the exact contribution of mutant strains to the escalation of cases in some states remained speculative, the measures to control the pandemic remained the same. The PM also highlighted the need to ensure effective implementation of containment measures, besides involvement of community volunteers in active case search and management of containment zones. “He exhorted that all states need to take required stringent measures with comprehensive restrictions in places witnessing high surge to curb the spread,” the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-reviews-situation-government-to-launch-special-anti-covid-drive/articleshow/81903467.cms||Sushmi Dey

Importantly, the commission said it was being examined if the events of April 1 merited action under Sections 131 and 123(2) of the Representation of the People’s Act (RP Act) and the model code of conduct. Section 131 of RP Act deals with disorderly conduct in or near polling stations and Section 123(2) is about disturbance in the conduct of elections. Banerjee and former aide-turned-BJP nominee Suvendu Adhikari are the contenders in Nandigram. The EC’s sharp letter drew an angry response from Trinamool leaders. “We have lodged 1,460 complaints with the EC. Till date, we have received responses to only three complaints. And we are a recognised political party. Do we still have to say with what motive and how this Election Commission is working?” Subrata Mukherjee asked. Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien said, “We do not think it is necessary now to respond to the media on this. Let them first respond to a hundred, two hundred more.” The EC's rejoinder to Banerjee's hand-written note, penned while at the Boyal polling booth amid wide coverage by the electronic media, was dispatched on Saturday. The poll panel on Friday evening received a detailed report from special observers Ajay Nayak and Vivek Dube on the incident, and found the allegations to be unsubstantiated. The commission said the media “showed dozens of audio-visual shots of your be ing in this polling station and literally hurling avalanche of allegations on some officials working in the government of West Bengal itself, paramilitary forces and eventually at the EC”. The EC said it noted with “ deep regret” that a “media narrative was sought to be weaved “hour after hour to misguide the biggest stakeholders, which is the voters, by a candidate who also happens to be CM of the state”. The commission said the events at Boyal could have an adverse impact on law and order. “And all this was being done when the election process was on.

It also set out steps taken by poll authorities to verify and address the complaints. It said there was no mention in reports of officials at various levels “of either outsiders or guns and goons capturing the said booth”. On the allegation that the Trinamool election agent was denied entry to the polling booth, the EC said the report of the district officers mentioned the great lengths to which the local administration went to ensure his presence but that he refused to come despite being assured of police escort. “The EC cannot force anyone unwilling to work as a polling agent,” the commission said, adding that agents of other parties, including BJP and CPM, were present through the entire polling process. The EC said in spite of the candidate’s presence at the polling station for a considerable length of time, the polling process was not disrupted. “Barring a few people shouting slogans for and against Mamata Banerjee, there was no report of any violence, nor was there any intimidation of voters,” the EC’s letter said. It added that there was no evidence to suggest that the BSF jawans on duty at the polling station indulged in any inappropriate behaviour or did not allow voters to go inside the booth. Banerjee had on April 1 complained that she was “surprised” to see the role of central forces along with officers on election duty, and that “no genuine voters are allowed to enter booth No. 5/7, Boyal area of Boyal Mak tab Primary School”. “Only the outsiders of BJP party along with guns and goons captured the booth in front of police officers,” she claimed in her note to the EC, which was reviewed by TOI, adding that several complaints went unheeded. “I am as a candidate sitting outside the room in my wheelchair to seek justice for peaceful, free and fair election but nobody from the village are allowing (sic) to enter the voting booth including the election agent,” she said. “The outsiders, goons are shouting with arms.

The EC, meanwhile, also made it a point to share with the chief minister a chronicle of its “epistolary” exchange with the CM/Trinamool Congress during the current polls, in the form of letters and memoranda submitted to EC and the latter’s response, saying that it shall “remain perennially grateful for this”.

The accident shook three others in the group so much that they consumed poison and committed suicide. The youths, who hailed from Kundi village in Bhilangana block of Tehri district, had gone to hunt wild fowl in the Cholah Tok forest near their village on Saturday evening, Kuldeep Shah, in-charge of Ghansali police station, said. Disaster struck the group when one of the youths, Santosh Panwar, 19, was hit by a bullet which was accidentally fired from a muzzle-loading rifle carried by another youth, Rajiv Singh, 22. “Rajiv is believed to have lost his balance and fell down, and in the process, the bullet went off, killing Panwar on the spot.” sub-divisional magistrate of Ghansali, PR Chauhan told TOI. Providing further details, Chauhan added that seeing their friend dead, the other youths went into a state of panic. “First, they brought back Santosh’s body from the jungle to a cowshed near the village. They were so stricken with grief and a sense of guilt over the incident that they decided to shoot themselves as well but then changed their plan. Three of them —Arjun Singh, 23, Pankaj Singh, 24, and Soban Singh, 23, consumed pesticide. They were taken to Baleshwar community health centre, where they were declared brought dead,” he said. Meanwhile, Rajiv Singh who was carrying the gun has gone missing. Two others, Rahul and Sumit, who were part of the group returned to the village and were being questioned by a team of officials from the revenue department under whose jurisdiction the area lies. Gram pradhan of Kundi village, Kuldeep Pawar told TOI that all seven youths were friends and were currently unemployed. Tehri district magistrate Iva Ashish Srivastava said “a post-mortem is being conducted and the incident is being probed from all angles.” When asked whether the weapon brought by Rajiv Singh was a licensed one, SDM Ghansali said, "As per our records, the weapon did not belong to either him or his father. Further details will be known once we recover the rifle or are able to get hold of him."

Sun also called for stepping up communication, saying the border dispute could only be resolved through dialogue and negotiations and that an incident like the deadly Galwan clash last year should not be repeated. On the recent Quad summit, Sun said building small circles in the name of multilateralism was only “group politics”. India had urged China last week to expedite disengagement in other areas as well in eastern Ladakh after the Pangong Tso settlement. The government had said this would lead to de-escalation and create conditions for progress in the bilateral relationship. “Against this backdrop (Pangong disengagement), we should implement the consensus reached by the two leaders and strictly abide by the existing agreements, step up dialogue and communication, and improve border management and control mechanisms to further ease, stabilise and control the border situation, avoid relapse and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” Sun said even as he reiterated that the “rights and wrongs” of the border flare-up last year were clear. Sun's remarks came in a conversation with Sudheendra Kulkarni, who was in the Vajpayee PMO and later fell out with BJP. “The lesson of last year's border incident is profound and such incident should not be repeated,” he added. On the Quad, Sun said selective multilateralism was not the right choice. “True multilateralism means upholding the UN-centred international system and the international order based on international law. It means openness and inclusiveness instead of closeness and exclusion,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pangong-pullback-to-help-build-mutual-trust-chinese-envoy/articleshow/81904125.cms||---

Shah skipped his scheduled programmes in the state on Sunday, including a rally at Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s Jalukbari constituency and another public meeting in Bhawanipur in lower Assam. But he managed to address a rally earlier in the day in Sarbhog. Read AlsoChhattisgarh: 23 jawans massacred in Maoist ambush, finds rescue teamTwenty-three security personnel were killed and 33 injured on Saturday in one of the deadliest Maoist ambushes ever in Bastar. A CoBRA commando is still missing. On Sunday, when reinforcements reached the encounter site on Sunday, police found injured jawans, who tried to take refuge in abandonedChhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who was also campaigning in Assam, continued with his programme and addressed two rallies in Bongaigaon and Barpeta districts before concluding his trip. Baghel, who is the AICC observer in the state, left Assam only in the evening, attracting criticism from BJP leaders. A mammoth rally had been organised by BJP in Sualkuchi in Himanta’s Jalukbari seat. Shah returned from the helipad itself. He told reporters, “I pay homage to the martyrs and assure their family members and the nation that the sacrifice of the jawans won’t go in vain. We will fight with more strength and intensity against the Naxals.” “As far as the numbers are concerned, both sides have suffered losses and exact casualty figures cannot be ascertained immediately,” PTI quoted Shah as saying. Shah on Sunday held a top-level meeting with senior officers on the Bijapur encounter at his residence in Delhi, ANI reported. Home secretary Ajay Bhalla, director IB Arvind Kumar and senior CRPF officers were present in the meeting. “Our fight against Naxalites will continue with strength, perseverance and intensity and we will take it to the end,” Shah said during the meeting, as per IANS. This came even as BJP chief J P Nadda hit out at Congress over Naxalism saying there have been “questions” of it taking a soft line on Naxalites, PTI reported. Condemning the killing of jawans, he asserted that the Centre would stand by the families of the soldiers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-take-our-fight-against-naxalites-to-the-end-amit-shah/articleshow/81904251.cms||Kangkan Kalita

They just have a bundle of photos of men who could be Hidma. All that’s known is that Hidma is perhaps 53 years old, short, and heads PLGA battalion number 1 as well as the Maoists’ south sub-zonal command. In every major Maoist attack in Bastar, Hidma’s shadowy figure creeps in. Tekulguda village, where Maoists ambushed security personnel on Saturday, killing 23 jawans, is next to Puvarti, which is believed to be Hidma’s native village. Carrying a bounty of Rs 45 lakh, Hidma is accused in at least 26 attacks, including the 2013 Jhiram Ghati massacre of frontline Congress leaders and Burkapal ambush of April 2017 in which 24 CRPF personnel were killed. Also called Deva, Hidma hails from Jagargunda area of Sukma. If there’s anyone security forces desperately want in Bastar, it is Hidma. A surrendered Maoist leader, Pahad Singh, had told police in September 2018 that Hidma’s arrest would break the backbone of the insurgent network in one of their last remaining strongholds. Hidma mostly confines himself to south Sukma region, which is his base, and moves around with four layers of security, say police sources. Security forces have stepped up the pressure on him in recent times, raiding many of his camps on intelligence inputs about his movements. “It is difficult to penetrate his multi-layer security because his bodyguards engage our troops while he escapes. However, many of his close aides have been killed while covering his escape, which has weakened his support system. It’s only a matter of time,” said an officer posted in Bastar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/operation-aimed-at-hidma-but-he-is-a-bundle-of-photographs/articleshow/81904357.cms||Rashmi Drolia

The Navy will this year get at least three of the 24 heavy-duty helicopters, equipped with multi-mode radars and night-vision devices as well as armed with Hellfire missiles, MK-54 torpedoes and precision-kill rockets, under the Rs 15,157 crore ($2.13 billion) contract inked with the US in February 2020. The 140-warship Navy is currently grappling with just a handful of old anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters like Kamov-28s and Sea Kings when the presence of Chinese nuclear and diesel-electric submarines is only going to further increase in the IOR. “All the 24 MH-60R helicopters, which will operate from frontline warships including aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, will be inducted by end-2023 or so. It will somewhat plug the critical operational gap on this front. The team of pilots and technicians for training and induction of the MH-60Rs will be going to the US in May-June,” said a defence ministry source. ASW choppers typically fly ahead of warships to “dunk” their sonars into deep waters, “ping” for enemy submarines, and then fire missiles, torpedoes and depth charges to clear the path for the fleet during hostilities. They can also undertake anti-ship strikes, over the horizon network-centric operations and electronic warfare missions. The Navy, in fact, has also projected a long-term requirement for another 123 naval multi-role helicopters (NMRHs), after the 24 MH-60Rs, but the proposed “Make in India” project for them is still nowhere on the horizon. The MH-60Rs are a replacement for the older Sea King 42/42A helicopters that were retired in the 1990s. The case for the 24 choppers, incidentally, began way back in 2005. Manufactured by Sikorsky-Lockheed Martin, the MH-60Rs will be the third type of iconic US helicopters to be inducted by Indian armed forces. The IAF has already inducted 22 Apache attack (for Rs 13,952 crore) and 15 heavy-lift Chinook (Rs 8,048 crore) choppers, both produced by Boeing. The Army, in turn, is slated to get six Apaches under a Rs 5,691 crore ($796 million) deal, which was also inked during former US President Donald Trump’s visit to India in February last year. Overall, the US has bagged Indian arms deals worth over $21 billion just since 2007. Several more are in the pipeline. These include the $1.8 billion acquisition of six more P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft, which will add to the 12 such planes already contracted for $3.2 billion earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indian-team-to-visit-us-for-induction-of-key-naval-choppers/articleshow/81904360.cms||Rajat Pandit

Well-placed government sources, however, ruled out any tweak to the formula in either of the cases — raising annual wages or notifying state-wide wages based on change in Consumer Price Index (agricultural) there. “These issues were settled with great care by framers of the Act. We don’t expect any change on these fronts,” a senior government source said. The parliamentary standing committee on rural development, in its report on demand for grants for 2021-22, termed the varying MGNREGS wages across states as “wage disparity”. “It is still beyond comprehension as to how it is possible that a single scheme has different yardsticks when it comes to payment modalities across the length and breadth of the country,” the panel said, even arguing that Article 39 of the Constitution guarantees equal pay for equal work. “Hence, there can’t be different wages for different states under MGNREGS... the committee recommends that MGNREGS beneficiaries must be paid wages without disparity in order to bring equality in wages across states/UTs,” it said. Sources said uniformity of wages across states was not “practical as states’ economic levels and expectations from MGNREGS were different”. An official said minimum wages could not be paid under MGNREGS because it guarantees work to all who seek employment, as against agriculture or any activity where demand decides employment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/house-panel-moots-uniform-mgnregs-wages-in-all-states/articleshow/81904455.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

You have no authority to instruct state officers. When elections are underway, you are giving instructions to state officers. What do you think of yourself? Are you God or superhuman? He peddles lies everyday,” the CM said during a rally in Hooghly’s Khanakul. “If I start instructing your officers, will it be correct? No, it would not be. So, first handle Delhi and your officers.” Read AlsoElection Commission junks Didi claim, studying if April 1 events merit actionThe Election Commission has rubbished allegations levelled by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee regarding entry of outsiders and booth capturing at a polling station at Boyal in Nandigram on April 1 as “factually incorrect, without any empirical evidence whatsoever and devoid of substance”.Mamata also accused Union home minister Amit Shah of getting police officers transferred daily, using the Election Commission. “This home minister is changing officers daily. They transferred four officers even yesterday. What will you gain out of it? You think you are picking officers close to BJP, but I believe all officers will work impartially. And those who will work for you should be ready to work with you in future too. I have no problem with it,” she said. She even referred to an officer who was sent to Cooch Behar ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, and has now been sent to Alipurduar. “A few people”, she said, “are listening to BJP and acting on their behalf. They may be thinking that they will follow Delhi’s instructions for a while.... You (Delhi) had repatriated 125 officers. You had removed them.... BJP’r ek mash (BJP is only for a month). After that, we will remain. They have lost completely. They will lose their deposits in many places. First, let them get 50 seats.” Addressing the minority community, the CM alleged that BJP was trying to “divide you”. “To divide minority votes, they are fomenting trouble and making communal statements. I do not do communal politics. I work with Hindus and Muslims together. It is my responsibility to ensure your security and the well-being of your society. All these rotten people can never do that. They have sold themselves to BJP.” To Hindus, she said: “BJP goes to homes and says that we are Hindus and they are Muslims. When a tiger steps out of the forest and we chase it, do we see who is Hindu or who is Muslim? When floods ravage our homes, does it differentiate between Hindu and Muslim homes? Am I not a daughter of a Brahmin family? Am I not a Hindu? Stay together, fight together and do not create divisions among yourselves. Years back, it was a Muslim youth who saved my life.

This comes three weeks after police arrested Vikas Mishra, brother of Vinay Mishra, who has been implicated by both ED and CBI as one of the key accused in the case. On Sunday, BJP, citing an audio tape conversation, alleged that the “real” beneficiaries were political patrons (Trinamool Congress leaders) of those being probed. Trinamool Congress dubbed the allegations “unverifiable and wild” and “an act of desperation”. The CBI, which too is probing the case, has already questioned the Bankura police officer. The ED had earlier summoned him twice, but he cited health reasons for not appearing before the agency. Three weeks ago, Ashok reached New Delhi for treatment. On Saturday, the agency asked him to appear at its office in New Delhi. After questioning him for more than seven hours, the agency officials arrested him. The ED has sought six days’ custody of Ashok, until reports last came in. Incidentally, Vikas too was arrested in New Delhi. The cop is related to the Mishra brothers, sources said. ED sources indicated that Ashok’s name came up during Vikas’s interrogation. Agency officials have reasons to believe that the cop may have helped the Mishra brothers in operating the illegal coal trade. They claimed they also came across evidence that the three had spoken to each other several times in the past. Anup Majee, also a key accused in the same case, had moved the Supreme Court challenging CBI’s powers to probe the case since the Bengal government had withdrawn its general consent in 2018. The SC granted him interim protection from arrest. Majee had earlier moved the Calcutta High Court. A little over 12 hours after the arrest, BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, citing a purported conversation between two persons — one, who Suvendu claimed, was a businessman questioned by central agencies in this case — alleged that senior Trinamool leaders were the real beneficiaries of these crime proceeds. “He (Ashok Mishra) was earlier posted at Diamond Harbour,” Suvendu said. “There are several other officials in West and East Burdwan, Bankura and Purulia who are also under the central agency radar,” he added. Citing the audio tapes, Suvendu alleged that many facts relating to the “involvement” of senior Trinamool leaders had now been brought to the fore. Amit Malviya, Bengal BJP co-in-charge, alleged, “Chief minister Mamata Banerjee looked the other way.” Trinamool reacted sharply. “The audio tapes are unverified. They have two persons talking to each other but there is nothing to prove their identity. Neither is any media taking responsibility of the veracity of these audio tapes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-arrests-cop-in-coal-case-bjp-uses-tape-attacks-tmc/articleshow/81904573.cms||Falguni Banerjee

He said when Rahul told reporters that the Left has not done anything to oppose RSS and BJP, the comment could have evoked laughter of ridicule even among those who don’t support the Left. On Rahul’s remarks that central agencies were not properly interfering, the CM said, “We have only one stand. We are going forward by giving befitting responses to such interferences. That too can be seen here. Here, there is a Kerala-level cooperation among the party of Rahul Gandhi, league and BJP.” When asked about the practicality of a scheme like Nyay, Vijayan said, “The welfare pension was Rs.600 then. Even that was not given for more than 18 months... How will people believe such promises of a group which didn’t even have the will to give away pension?” The CM said public opinion favouring the LDF government formed on its own. “One of the major achievements of the government was redefining the earlier concept that people do not have any role in governance apart from using voting rights every five years. Every year we published a progress report updating people about the extent to which we were able to fulfil the promises made in the election manifesto,” Pinarayi said. The CM, during a press conference at Kannur press club, also countered the allegation that the state was in debt and said in the financial year 2019-20, the debt of Kerala was 31.2% of internal revenue. He added that when UDF left power in 2015-2016, the debt was 29% despite not including various debts. The CM said the KSEB allegation was also baseless as similar purchases have taken place in other Congress-ruled states as well.

Since there is no discernible Muslim consolidation in favour of a particular front, akin to the 2019 Parliament elections, the contests will be close in many seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/as-muslim-votes-split-its-down-to-wire-in-malabar/articleshow/81904584.cms||---

Reflecting the divergent views among CPM leaders over calling chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan as ‘captain’ rather than comrade, Jayarajan wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday that as far as CPM is concerned, the party is the captain. In a carefully worded post that on the surface appears to justify the ‘captain’ remark as an innocuous display of affection by people, Jayarajan, however, points out that it was not individuals but the CPM and the LDF that are the surety (Urappu) of the people. In 2017, CPM state secretariat had criticized Jayarajan for ‘glorification’ attempts citing a six-minute video music album that extolled him. The album brought out by the Purachery Grameena Kala Samithi had praised Jayrajan as ‘star of Kannur’ and the ‘protector of red bastion’s honour and the upholder of the truth of the red flag’. “Many people are perturbed over the increasing popularity of Communists among the people. It is the LDF that upholds people-oriented and welfare-oriented politics. When we stand with people, they express their affection through various means. Some will express affection by penning songs, some by placing photos, and some through tattoos. But Communists don’t immerse in a personality cult,” he added. Jayarajan added that as comrade Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had said, in this party, all are ‘comrades’ and the party is the captain. “So the right-wing and the media need not get disturbed over the popular support received by the CM,” Jayarajan said. When asked about CPM supporters and even the party daily using the term captain to refer to him, Pinarayi Vijayan told the media that people use several terms as per their interest. “Attempts to create an issue or create confusion over it will not have any impact,” he said. However, CPM acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan justified the ‘Captain’ remark and said that it can be viewed as a response from the public towards Vijayan’s leadership skills. “Pinarayi Vijayan is one of the most respected leaders in Kerala and there are several respectable names given to him by the people. It is election time and comrade Pinarayi Vijayan leads the election activities in the state. People like him and use various respectable names,” said Vijayaraghavan. Meanwhile, CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran said that both CPI and CPM used to call their leaders as only comrades.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/kerala/comrades-debate-over-captain-title/articleshow/81904588.cms||---

The report, submitted recently to the UNFCCC, however, underlined that the country would use coal “responsibly” through clean coal initiatives and said its per capita coal consumption was still lower than most developed countries and other emerging economies. The remarks on coal use in the report, carrying details of India’s climate action , assume significance as there is considerable pressure on India to raise its mitigation (emission reduction) goal by pledging either ‘net-zero’ (emission minus removal amounts to zero) target or ‘peaking year’ of its emission ahead of the 26th session of the UN climate conference (COP26)in November. Though it is not yet clear whether India will actually deviate from its stated position of not announcing its next climate action target before 2023 when a global stock-take of collective targets of all countries happens, its report to the UN body drops enough hints that it won’t fall in line keeping in view its national circumstances. The report also shows what it thinks about the role of big historical polluters such as the US, the European Union nations and the UK among others. “Unlike those countries who are proactive in planning phase-out of coal, only to replace them by oil and gas, India is transparent in its need for coal,” India’s third biennial report to the UNFCCC said. Referring to the necessity of the country’s dependence on coal, it said, “This is in keeping with India’s claim to a fair share of the global carbon budget and India's significant underutilization of this share thus far.” But this doesn’t mean any deviation from what India pledged as part of its climate action under the Paris Agreement. As against its target of 40% electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based sources by 2030, the share of non-fossil-fuel-based electricity generation has already reached over 38% in November 2020. In 2015-16, the India had set a target of achieving 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 which was later enhanced to 450 GW by 2030 – it means nearly five-times increase in next 10 years from 92.97 GW in February this year. Record shows that the power generation capacity share of renewables in India grew from 4.98% as on March 2006 to 23.92% by September last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coal-integral-part-of-energy-requirement-india-tells-un/articleshow/81904592.cms||Vishwa Mohan

It will generate investment, trade and jobs,” he said. The development of the north-east is seen to be directly connected with India’s foreign policy, particularly the Act East policy of the government. The north-east, he said, “connects us to one of the most economically dynamic and politically significant geographies of the world – ASEAN and Indo-Pacific.” The MEA, Shringla said, would link Sikkim and north-eastern universities with international institutions. They would launch the Kanchenjunga Dialogue, a Track 2 dialogue, to improve the standing of states in the region including Sikkim as an “education and knowledge hub”. Shringla said that under the India-Japan Act East Forum, the two countries were working to enhance the overall development of the north-east “by way of projects on connectivity, water, sanitation, forest management and skill development.” Pointing to the Sikkim Biodiversity and Conservation Management Project, the foreign secretary said, opportunity beckoned for people in the region, “in hospitality and tourism sector or entrepreneurship in export of organic food, floriculture and horticulture.” Flagging the newly recrafted internship program in the foreign ministry, Shringla promised to tap more talent from the north-east.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/links-with-our-neighbours-to-boost-economy-of-ne-shringla/articleshow/81904594.cms||---

Rekha Kulal’s objective is to shore up the admission rate at Nuliggere Higher Primary School in Hosanagar, about 80km from Udupi, and ensure that once her underprivileged students complete Class X, they have something to fall back on for the rest of their education journey. It all started seven years ago when Rekha first offered the gift to five students who had joined Class I that session. She has so far sponsored 63 students. Hobbled by financial difficulties throughout her schooling days, Rekha had banked on scholarships and a benevolent high school teacher named MS Nagaraja Rao to complete her education and join the teaching profession herself. “Ensuring students get guaranteed returns on a bank deposit is one small way of helping students in higher education. It’s also a way of paying back to society that held me in my time of crisis. The initiative is supported and appreciated by members and president of the school development management committee and school headmaster K Ganesh and other employees,” she told TOI. “Bond Madam", as she is called by students and parents, travels nearly two hours one way to reach her school in Hosanagar, which is about 50km from her house near Shankaranarayana. Besides writing articles and short stories, she is also a voiceover artiste. “I will continue to invest in bonds for little ones as long as I am in service,” she said. Rekha, whose husband Prabhakar Kulal is a range forest officer, once could not afford a new sari while doing her diploma in education from Kumuda Umashankara Teachers’ Training Institute Kokkarne, Udupi. She now aspires to help government schools be on a par with private institutions. Venkatesh, a daily wage-earner, is among those grateful that three children are studying in Rekha’s school. His daughters Umadevi and Preeti have received the private scholarship.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/how-bond-madam-fights-dropout-crisis/articleshow/81904600.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

With more than 90 elections to his credit as an independent contestant, Ambedkari — a senior member of the erstwhile All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation (Bamcef), founded by Kanshi Ram before the BSP came into being — is among one of the most experienced political candidates in the fray.  Ambedkari says he fights the elections on the ideology of Bharat Ratna Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar. On Sunday, Ambedkari’s wife Shivdevi Surma (68) also filed nomination as an independent candidate for Agra district council member from ward 29. She also filed a nomination for the post of gram pradhan from Kheragarh subdivision.  Since 1985, Ambedkari has contested a total of 93 elections to various bodies, including the Lok Sabha and state assembly from different seats, but never ever got the mandate. In 1988, his nomination for the post of President of India was rejected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bhim-follower-in-poll-fray-for-93rd-time-eyes-agra-civic-body-seat/articleshow/81904603.cms||Deepak Lavania

The “Bikes of Bijnor” scheme utilised 100 refurbished bicycles left behind by migrant labourers, which would have become junk by now. This experiment in the past one month involving government officers and civil society has received appreciation from central government agencies and even Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari. He pointed out in Parliament that this was an affordable model to promote non-motorised transport in urban areas. These bicycles are currently available to riders without any charge but soon users would have to pay a token Rs 5 for a four-hour ride and Rs 10 for 12 hours. The scheme was conceived by Vikramaditya Singh Malik, a 2018 batch IAS officer, who took charge as SDM in the district last August. Malik said he spotted a number of bicycles lying at a police post when he was on a tour in October and their conditions had deteriorated. These cycles belonged to migrant labourers who were returning home during the lockdown. Bijnor lies on the way from Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand and several migrant labourers on cycles took this route to reach their homes in eastern UP and Bihar. The administration had made arrangements to provide food and shelter and to send them to their homes in special trains and buses. Hence, they left their cycles in Bijnor.  “For months, these cycles were stacked up at various centres facing severe wear and tear sometimes. Around 400 cycles were lying abandoned. So, we planned how to utilise them before they became junk,” Malik told TOI. These cycles were brought to the district headquarters and an independent valuation assessment was done, which was worked out at Rs 600. The district administration tried to reach out to the actual owners to find if they want to take back their cycles or would take Rs 600. Very few owners took back the cycles. The price for each cycle was paid from the DM Covid Relief Fund. A society was formed and contributions came from different groups to operationalise the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/junked-bijnor-bicycles-get-new-life-cycle/articleshow/81904602.cms||Dipak K Dash

Scoring just 51.2 points out of 100 (14 points below the global average), India ranked 19 out of 21 countries in the National Privacy Test conducted recently by global VPN service provider NordVPN. Only Turkey and Japan featured below India in the study, which surveyed 48,063 respondents from 192 countries on their digital habits, privacy awareness and digital risk tolerance. European nations topped the chart with Germany (71.2 points out of 100), Netherlands (69.5/100) and Switzerland (68.9/100) in the top three spots. Big tech major United States (68.5/100) came in fourth. Indian respondents were found to be most reckless when it comes to getting their hands on online bargains and on social media use. “51.8% of respondents said they would buy a Netflix or Spotify account if they found it offered on eBay at a lower price [such accounts are typically stolen accounts] than the official one compared to only 11% who would do such a thing,” the research note said. Indians scored 65.2% in awareness of what to do when facing threats such as exposure of personal data compared to Germany’s 90.2%. Almost one-third Indians said they would engage in a conversation or give in to the demands of bad actors claiming they got their device infected with malware. Globally, only 4.5% of people would fall for that type of scam. “All of the countries pay little attention to the terms of service in apps and services they use. But India is worst among them regarding this issue,” the research finds. As a result, Indians scored just 37% in the section that evaluated digital habits.“Indian citizens should also reconsider their digital habits. While many global corporations outsource tech-related roles to India, the country’s overall score is 14 points below the average,” the study said.When it comes to theoretical knowledge of cybersecurity, Indians scored 57.6%. Indian respondents particularly scored strong in knowing how to set strong passwords at 78% score. But the country lags in social media use, the study notes, as Indians scored low (36%) on awareness of information that should not be shared on social media platforms. The study evaluated digital habits as the way people understand digital terms of service and app permissions, privacy awareness was assessed based on how people use digital devices and passwords, and the digital risk tolerance was judged based on how people react to phishing emails or online blackmail. Globally, digital security awareness has a long way to go, the study adds, adding that almost half of respondents polled globally believe that deleting the browsing history wipes out their digital footprint. “Websites, internet service providers, and even governments can monitor your browsing data long after you’ve cleared your history,” it notes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-fails-in-cybersecurity-literacy-test-study/articleshow/81901542.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Allahabad||04 April 94 lost lives in two months of this year||Prayagraj: The death of 94 persons in 196 cases of road accidents in January and February this year has once again brought focus on rash and negligent driving that continues to claim more lives on the highway and streets of Sangam city. The Prayagraj district has topped the chart of road accident deaths in the Prayagraj range which includes Prayagraj, Fatehpur, Pratapgarh and Kaushambi districts. Statistics revealed by the range police on Thursday showed that as many as 94 people lost their lives and 125 others sustained injuries in 196 cases of road accidents in Prayagraj in January and February this year, while the numbers for road accident deaths in Pratapgarh, Fatehpur and Kaushambi in the same period stood at 47, 60 and 32 respectively. Data also revealed that 81, 77 and 49 cases of road accidents were recorded in Pratapgarh, Fatehpur and Kaushambi districts respectively in the first two months of this year. In Prayargaj district, 101 and 95 cases of road accidents were recorded in January and February months respectively wherein 49 and 45 people died in road accidents and 60 and 65 were left injured respectively. According to the data, a total of 1178 cases of road mishap cases were reported in Prayagraj district last year (2020), whereas Pratapgarh, Fatehpur and Kaushambi districts recorded 430, 581 and 368 cases of road mishaps, respectively. Data also claimed that while 531 people were killed in separate cases of accidents in Prayagraj last year, the number of persons who were killed in road mishaps in Pratapgarh, Fatehpur and Kaushambi stood at 286, 366 and 203 respectively. While 759 persons were injured in road accidents last year in Prayagraj, the number of injured persons in Pratapgarh, Fatehpur and Kaushambi stood at 271, 299 and 211 respectively. The increasing graph of fatal road accidents in Prayagraj district has baffled the senior range police authorities who have asked traffic police officials to chalk out an effective strategy to minimize the cases of road accidents. An action plan to continuously monitor road safety measures as well as reviewing the status of accident-prone areas, also known as black spots, has also been pressed into service. In Prayagraj district, data for last year revealed that there were 127 road accident cases reported in January, while 116, 104, 26,81,96,74,76, 91,117, 133 and 137 cases were recorded in February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December respectively. In Prayagraj district alone, 52 people died in January last year while 47, 47, 7, 41, 45, 37, 39, 52,46, 61 and 57 people lost their lives in February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December months of 2020, respectively. Similarly, as many as 759 people sustained injuries in separate cases of road mishaps in January (85), February (82), March (64), April (21), May(47), June (65), July (50), August (45), September (46), October ( 76), November (85) and December (93) of last year. IG ( Prayagraj range) K P Singh said “Sincere measures are underway to implement road safety norms strictly for road users. Senior traffic police authorities have taken up a series of awareness and educational activities among heavy vehicle drivers to promote road safety measures to bring down cases of road mishaps and accidents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/04-april-94-lost-lives-in-two-months-of-this-year/articleshow/81901908.cms||---

The kin of the patient alleged that he died after plasma of wrong blood group was administered to him by error as there was no such requirement. The BHU administration has constituted a committee to probe the incident and has sought report within 72 hours. According to reports, the elderly patient Ramesh Singh, a resident of Mangari village, was admitted to the ICU on March 25 and was on bed number 4. His family members said his condition was improving and he was likely to be shifted from the ICU. The attendants alleged that the doctors administered plasma of blood group A on April 2, while his blood group was O. Before administering the plasma, the doctors did not even inform the patient’s attendants about any such requirement of plasma. “The plasma was meant for some other patient, and was administered to him mistakenly. His condition started deteriorating after plasma infusion,” the family alleged. The attendants lodged a complaint with the medical superintendent Prof SK Mathur in this regard. BHU spokesperson Rajesh Singh said that the medical superintendent received the complaint on Saturday in which the attendants alleged that their patient was administered plasma while they had not been told about any such requirement. The medical superintendent has constituted a committee to probe into this matter and furnish its report within 72 hours, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/man-dies-at-ssl-hosp-kin-allegemedical-negligence-of-docs-in-icu/articleshow/81901925.cms||---

It will switch over to online classes until further orders. Teachers and non-teaching staff of the university and all its allied units would report to their duties as usual, but students have been advised to stay home. The heads of postgraduate departments and college principals have been directed to ensure proper sanitization of their respective institutions and follow the Covid-19 protocols. The decision to hold online classes has been taken to check the academic loss of students owing to suspension of regular classroom teaching. PU students’ welfare dean N K Jha told the newspaper on Sunday that boys and girls residing in different hostels of the university would stay there by following the safety norms like social distancing and proper sanitization. Hostel superintendents have been asked to take care of all their boarders and keep constant vigil on their movement. He said the process of allotment of hostel accommodation to newly admitted PG students was to be completed by April 10, but now it would be delayed owing to disruption of normal campus activities. The PhD course work examination of PU will, however, be held as scheduled on April 8 and 9 with Covid-19 protocol. More than 1500 scholars are to take the examination at Magadh Mahila College centre, he said. Meanwhile, Nalanda Open University on Sunday announced that all its examinations of 2020 commencing from Monday would be held as scheduled with full safety measures. The venue and timing of examinations would remain the same. However, no student would be allowed to take the examination without wearing face mask, according to an NOU notification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-university-to-switch-over-to-online-classes-from-today/articleshow/81901252.cms||B K Mishra
---||Vijayawada||AP HC reserves verdict in pleas challenging SEC notification on MPTC, ZPTC polls||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Sunday reserved judgment in the petitions filed challenging the notification issued by State Election Commission for conducting elections to MPTC and ZPTCs across the state. The high court had already heard the arguments of the petitioners on Saturday. While senior counsels P Veera Reddy and Vedula Venkata Ramana argued on behalf of petitioners stating that the notification issued by the SEC was in violation of the Supreme Court judgment, senior counsel C V Mohan Reddy who argued on behalf of the SEC said that the election process has been resumed according to the Supreme Court judgment only. Mohan Reddy also contended the argument of the petitioners that Model Code of Conduct (MCC) should be in force for four weeks according to the Supreme Court judgment. He said there is no upper time limit to impose MCC according to the rules and as the election process resumed from where it was stalled, there is no need for four weeks mandatory imposition of MCC. He argued the petitioners have not submitted any document pertaining to their age to prove that their right to contest is being denied. He said the filing of nominations and withdrawal process has been completed and only polling and counting of votes remains, for which four weeks is not necessary. He said once the election process was set in motion, courts should not interfere in the process. Though the petitioners argued they are not seeking to stall the elections, the postponement of elections will imply stalling of the process, he said. In response to the arguments of the counsel for SEC, senior counsel P Veera Reddy said the petitioners have submitted all requisite information pertaining to their proof of age. He said the Supreme Court has given a well thought out judgment saying the imposition of MCC prior to four weeks as the entire process will take place four weeks to complete from issuance of notification to declaration of results. The counsel for Jana Sena, V Venu Gopal Rao, challenged the notification on different grounds. He said the SEC wrote a letter to the Union home ministry stating large-scale violence took place during the filing of nominations, resulting in unprecedented unanimous elections. When the SEC raised doubts over the purity of election process, the election commission cannot go ahead with the process from where it was stopped without addressing those concerns, he said. Considering arguments of all sides, Justice U Durga Prasad Rao reserved judgments in petitions with similar plea.

Nalanda civil surgeon (CS) Dr Sunil Kumar and four others tested positive for the virus on Saturday. The number of active cases in the district jumped to 52. Sheikhpura had 21 active cases. On March 17, the number of active cases in Nalanda was just 10. Nalanda DM Yogendra Kumar Singh on Sunday said various steps, like sanitising the areas reporting Covid cases, identification of micro containment zones, awareness campaigns for the use of masks and social distancing, were being taken. “Each person should use mask and avoid unnecessary social gatherings,” the DM appealed. Nalanda CS, who is under home quarantine, has also appealed to all those who came into his contact in the last one week to get tested for the virus. A doctor couple and a health worker, who had received two dozes of vaccine, and three ANMs among others have tested positive. After almost two months, the first positive case in Sheikhpura district was reported on March 28. He was a medicine shopowner and died on April 1 during treatment. Sheikhpura administration on Saturday reopened one quarantine centre and admitted five patients for close monitoring as two home quarantined persons died during treatment last week. Nalanda administration is yet to reopen any quarantine centre. However, a massive mask-checking drive was conducted in Biharsharif and Sheikhpura, yielding Rs5,700 as fine on Saturday. Biharsharif SDM Sanjay Kumar Singh said the drive will continue till everyone starts wearing a mask. Meanwhile, since the launch of vaccination for people over 45 years on April 1, around 8,000 people in that category have been inoculated in Nalanda. Over 21,000 beneficiaries of all age groups have been inoculated till Saturday. Nalanda MP Kaushlendra Kumar received the second shot of the Covid vaccine on Saturday while special vaccination camps were organised at Biharsharif court and block resource centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fivefold-rise-in-covid-cases-in-nalanda/articleshow/81901279.cms||Farrukh Nadim

The district administration has deputed 75 teams of health workers to move in every ward and keep watch on crowded places like markets, bus stands, auto stands and malls and ensure use of masks and social distancing. District magistrate (DM) Dr Chandrasekhar Singh said permissions given earlier for eight public functions at Gyan Bhawan, S K Memorial Hall and other venues were cancelled on Sunday in the light of the state government’s direction issued Saturday. “The number of beds in the Covid ward of Patna Medical College and Hospital will be increased from 36 to 100 from Monday. Of the 1,550 Covid cases detected in Patna during the second wave, 1,250 were from urban areas thus necessitating regular monitoring and mass awareness campaign,” the DM said. “Among the worst affected localities are Kankarbagh, Shashtrinagar, S K Puri, Rupaspur, Phulwari and Danapur. Altogether 52 micro containment zones have been created in these areas,” he added. The Patna Municipal Corporation has been asked to sanitise apartments, houses and lanes falling under the micro containment zones. The 75 teams of health workers have been assigned to trace the contacts of all positive cases from among their neighbouring flats, houses and offices. The administration has deputed 20 vehicles with public address system as part of its awareness campaign. The DM said free tests were being done at 65 places in the district. “The vaccination of 45+ category people is being done at 165 health facilities, including 37 private hospitals, in the district.

Last month, the public sector bank had announced a special offer valid till March 31, wherein home loans were available starting from 6.7%. This indicates that the best rate for home loans has increased by 25 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point). According to SBI’s website, home loans are available at 40bps above the external benchmark-linked rate (EBLR). The EBLR, which is linked to the RBI’s repo rate, is currently 6.65%, which would mean that home loans are available at 7%. However, loan proposals that have a woman as one of the applicants are entitled to a 5bps discount, which makes it 6.95%. In February, SBI had said that its home loan portfolio of Rs 5 lakh crore was the largest among various businesses of the bank and that it was a market leader when it came to individual home loans. The lender had said that it would grow its portfolio by speeding up the turnaround time for loan applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-home-loan-rates-now-start-from-6-95/articleshow/81903235.cms||---

He was 89. As the socialist leader had pledged his body to King George Medical University, party sources said last rites of Singh will not be performed. To offer his condolences on the demise of Bhagwati Singh, SP national president Akhilesh Yadav visited his River Bank colony residence. He offered floral tributes to the moral remains of Bhagwati Singh who was seen as a close confidant of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. “May God give peace to the soul and strength to the family to bear the loss. His death has come as an irreparable loss to the party and his contribution will continue to inspire for decades to some,” Akhilesh said. The SP chief also postponed a scheduled press conference as a mark of respect to Bhagwati Singh. A SP member of the Rajya Sabha from July 2004 to 2010, Bhagwati Singh joined the socialist movement following inspiration from the socialist ideologue Ram Manohar Lohia. “Strengthening SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav all through his stint in active politics, Bhagwati Singh was a member of Mulayam cabinet and later stood by Akhilesh Yadav when he was elected as the SP national president. He led the management of Chandrabhanu Gupta Agriculture College in Bakshi ka Talab,” recollected SP secretary and chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary who had worked closely with Bhagwati Singh. SP state president Naresh Uttam Patel, former minister Arvind Singh Gope, MLCs Jagjeevan Prasad, Anand Bhadauria and Suneel Singh Sajan and a host of other party leaders paid floral tributes to Bhagwati Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-founder-member-bhagwati-singh-passes-away-at-89/articleshow/81903242.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Lucknow||‘Families linked with Ayodhya temples deserve better deal’||LUCKNOW: Attacking the ruling BJP for relocating scores of families associated with Ayodhya temples under the government’s move for the beautification and development of the temple town, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav said effort should have been made to ensure peaceful co-existence of people associated with these small temples and maths and shops instead of uprooting them from where they have existed for decades. “Instead of relocating these families the government should have come out with a plan that would have ensured peaceful co-existence of all. Once the Ram Temple construction is complete, people and clans associated with smaller temples and shops in Ayodhya will also benefit from the increased footfall of pilgrims,” he said, addressing a delegation of traders’ association and members of the Nishad community from Ayodhya which called upon the former UP chief minister at the party office on Sunday.  “The government must come out with a plan that can help these families associated with temples and maths and create employment opportunities for them. Authorities should resolve the deadlock amicably rather than taking decisions which hurt the common man. Consensus will only help to make life of people of Ayodhya better,” he said. Interacting with the representatives of the Nishad community from Ayodhya, Akhilesh said working as boatmen for generations the community has not only ferried people from one place to another, but have saved innumerable lives by extending a helping hand at times of boat tragedies. Such contributions of the Nishad community need to be acknowledged and respected,” he said. Members of the trader association told the SP chief that the government is set to demolish shops in front portions of the temple compounds facing the main road in Kajiyana in Terdi Bazaar, old bus stop, Hanuman Garhi intersection, Sringar Ghat, Shastri Nagar, Babu Bazar and Naya Ghat, to lay a four-lane road. This will deprive hundreds of shop keepers and their dependent families of their livelihood. In a detailed memorandum that the traders handed over to the SP chief, it was stated that around 4,000 to 5,000 shops will be demolished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/families-linked-with-ayodhyatemples-deserve-better-deal/articleshow/81903217.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Her head was smashed by some heavy object. Working quickly on the case, police later arrested the key accused, Sandeep Jain, 28, from MP where he had fled after committing the crime. As per the complaint lodged by the father of the deceased Avtar Vanshkar, a labourer who lives in the locality with his family, his daughter had gone to fetch milk at 6.30 am but did not return. After a long time when she did not return, Avtar went out to find her and saw some blood strains in a nearby vacant plot. On further probe, he found her body wrapped in a cloth. He immediately raised an alarm. After some time, police arrived along with the dog squad and forensic experts. The blood stains led police to an adjacent market place where some more blood stains were found. “Within hours of investigation and statement of Avtar, it was established that the key accused is Sandeep, who by that time had absconded from the place. His brother Hero, who is the caretaker of the marketplace, was interrogated for leads. He told the police that he was working here for quite some time and lived in a room in the backyard of the marketplace,” police said. A few months ago, his brother Sandeep came from Tikamgarh and started living with him. DIG Jhansi range Jogendra Kumar, who also visited the crime scene, said: “We have arrested the main accused, Sandeep Jain, and are interrogating in relation to the crime. An FIR has been lodged against him under sections 302 and 201 of IPC and under SC/ST Act. We will also invoke NSA against him. The body of the deceased has been sent for postmortem. Once the report comes we will decide on the future course of action.” On whether the girl was sexually assaulted or not, police stated that “anything could be conclusively said only after the postmortem report is received”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/8-year-old-girl-murdered-in-jhansi-one-held/articleshow/81890977.cms||---
---||Patna||‘Need to create awareness, punish sr officers for effective liquor ban’||PATNA: At least 35 persons have died allegedly of hooch poisoning in six districts in the last two months. The 16 deaths in Nawada recently gave the opposition an opportunity to attack the state prohibition policy again and demand action against the senior officers of the districts. Liquor is banned in Bihar since April 5, 2016. Experts say the government needs to launch awareness and rehabilitation programmes to meet the purpose of liquor ban in the state. As per the official data, 94.9 lakh litres of IMFL and 51.7 lakh litres of country liquor have been seized since prohibition law imposed till January 31, 2021. More than 2.55 lakh FIRs have been registered, 3.39 lakh people arrested and 417 convicted for violating the ban. Besides, 37,484 vehicles were seized and 3,482 of them auctioned. Altogether 619 police personnel are facing departmental proceedings, 348 have been booked and 186 were dismissed from service. A senior IPS officer, preferring anonymity, said severe crackdown on IMFL smuggling in the last few months led to massive country liquor manufacturing at village level. “Those engaged in the crime either started smuggling spurious country liquor from across the state border or getting it manufactured in villages with the items like methyl alcohol, which is harmful for humans,” he said. A senior police officer said more than ten liquor smugglers were arrested from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal recently. “Their arrests crippled the IMFL smuggling chain in the state,” he added. Sociologist DM Diwakar said the state government needs to revive the rehabilitation centres. “Most of the the people dying after consuming spurious liquor belonged to poor families. Rehabilitation centres and social awareness programmes need to be continued for several years. Addiction doesn’t vanish in just a few months,” he said. RJD’s Shakti Singh Yadav alleged that the liquor smugglers have been running a parallel economy in the state. “Prohibition is a complete failure. No action has ever been taken against any DM or SP for prohibition law violation. Only SHOs or chowkidars are suspended. Action must be taken against Nawada DM and SP as they tried to cover up the matter,” he said. Yadav recalled the raid on JD(U) leader Chandradeep Sen’s residence at Harnaut in Nalanda for liquor smuggling four years ago. “What happened? The excise officer who conducted the raid and recovered liquor was himself arrested,” he alleged. JD(U) spokesperson Dr Suheli Mehta said there was still lack of awareness among villagers and people of lower strata about the dangers of liquor or drugs. “The state government is putting efforts to create awareness, but there are shortcomings in the system due to which such hooch deaths are taking place. These loopholes need to be plugged,” Mehta said. Mehta said prohibition is for the betterment of people. “Those entrusted with the task to enforce prohibition need to work honestly,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/need-to-create-awareness-punish-sr-officers-for-effective-liquor-ban/articleshow/81901040.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Chandigarh||Pb farmers not keeping bonded labourers: Capt||Chandigarh: Responding to the Union ministry of home affairs’ (MHA) statement that illegal human trafficking syndicates exploited migrant labourers and Punjabi farmers in border districts hook them to drugs, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has said all 58 cases alleged by the Centre have been investigated thoroughly and nothing as alleged has been found. Attacking the central government on Sunday for “spreading misinformation about state’s farmers indulging in bonded labourer system in their fields”, Capt Amarinder alleged it was yet another conspiracy to defame Punjab’s farmers, whom the Centre and the ruling BJP had been continuously trying to malign by dubbing them terrorists, urban naxals and goons with an aim to derail their agitation against contentious farm laws. He termed the MHA’s letter written on March 17 as a bundle of lies to undermine farmers’ protest and denigrating the Congress government in Punjab. The CM said after careful analysis of the whole episode, it came to fore that a highly sensitive information pertaining to the national security regarding the arrest of some suspicious persons by the Border Security Force (BSF) from close to the volatile Indo-Pak border has been “unscrupulously twisted on baseless conjectures to malign the farmer community”. “The MHA letter talks of Abohar also while the fact is that there is no case of Abohar or Fazilka districts,” said Amarinder, adding none of the conclusions of the Centre were borne out by facts in the MHA letter. The chief minister claimed none of the persons apprehended has made any allegation of being forcibly kept as farm labourers under inhuman conditions even before the courts. Nothing on record suggests that these persons were forcibly infused drugs to keep them working for long hours and it was incorrect to conclude that the intellectual disability of these persons was drug induced, he added. 16 detainees were mentally disabled Of the 58 persons detained by the BSF in 2019 and 2020, four belong to different areas of Punjab and were found near the Pakistan border. Amarinder said 16 of the 58 detainees were intellectually disabled, four since childhood. The investigation found that 14 persons had come to Punjab only a few days or weeks prior to their apprehension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pb-farmers-not-keeping-bonded-labourers-capt/articleshow/81902866.cms||---

Officials claimed that this was particularly prevalent in Ajmer and are now looking to involve NGOs at the local level to take measures to deal with this kind of situation. Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights (RSCPCR) told TOI, “Every district that we visited had different set of issues which are being faced by children and recently when we went to Ajmer, we found a unique problem of ‘Nata Pratha’ due to which after the mother leaves the child with the extended family, he/she is not looked after properly. Even if such children who are somewhat orphaned despite having the mother alive, while admitted to government schools only go for the meals and are otherwise neglected. This is the first time that we have come across this issue and I have spoken to school teachers to take measures regarding it. At our level also we will also look at constructive steps which can be taken to resolve this problem.” ‘Nata Pratha’ is a practice in which two persons can enter into a relationship similar to marriage without any legal and religious/social obligation, though it does not mention anything about the children. Apart from this, officials found that child marriage was an issue prevalent in Nagaur as well lack of education, especially in minor community while sexual assault was a major concern in districts like Tonk and Sawai Madhopur. The campaign called ‘Aayog Aapke Dwar’ will gradually be taken to all the districts in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nata-pratha-an-issue-being-faced-by-children/articleshow/81902038.cms||---

To woo over 2 lakh voters in the state’s mining belt for 2022 election, chief minister Pramod Sawant in his budget speech had announced the setting up of the Goa Mining Corporation through auctioning of leases. “The government will sign an MoU with the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL)... And that will help the state government start the process for e-auction,” Sawant had said. Mining in Goa came to a halt three years ago following the decision of the Supreme Court quashing second renewal of 88 mining leases. Since then the government and the mining companies are trying to restart mining activities in the state. While it’s currently unknown if the industry would restart this financial year, but Sawant has set a target of mopping up Rs 550 crore from the industry.  Of the state’s 40 constituencies, ten have substantial areas dependent on mining, four in south Goa -- Sanvordem, Curchorem, Sanguem and Quepem and six in north Goa -- Poriem, Valpoi, Bicholim, Sakhali, Mayem and Tivim. Eight of these are represented by BJP MLAs.  Two mining companies have approached the apex court for extension of the mining leases till 2037.  The companies had filed special leave petition after the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed their petitions challenging the Goa, Daman and Diu (Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987.  State government before the apex court had said that the mining companies had made representation to the mines department contending that under the amendment to Section 8 A of the mines and minerals development act, they are entitled to extend their mining leases up to 2037 but it will abide by the decision of the court. The state government has also filed a review petition in the apex court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ordinance-to-set-upmining-corp-soon-cm/articleshow/81903653.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Vijayawada||AP: Transco to link Rayalaseema with coastal region||VIJAYAWADA: The AP Transco is working on developing power infrastructure to connect Rayalaseema and coastal regions to transmit excess solar power generated by AP Green Energy Corporation (APGECL) solar parks. The Transco has proposed a 400 KV line from 400 KV Talaricheruvu substation to 400 KV Podili sub-stations which interconnects the Rayalaseema and coastal regions. In a press release on Sunday, the AP Transco stated that the government has proposed addition of solar power in Rayalaseema region by APGECL, where the demand for power is less than the generation, due to which more power has to be exported to Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL) network. To avoid this, the Transco proposed to interconnect Rayalaseema and coastal regions to transmit excess solar power generated by APGENCO solar parks between the two regions. The Transco also stated that bus reactors were commissioned at 400 KV substations at Hindupur of Anantapur district, Podili of Prakasam district and Rachagunneri of Chittoor district to address over voltage problems of the 400 KV lines. This in turn helps in reducing the inter-state reactive power draw and will avoid the penalties on that account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/transco-to-link-rseema-with-coastal-region/articleshow/81901391.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar: Fresh guidelines may hit wedding plans, business||PATNA: The latest restrictions allowing maximum 250 guests at a marriage function in light of the fresh surge of Covid cases in the state has cast a shadow on the wedding season slated to start later this month. The latest guidelines issued by the state government on Saturday have made people jittery about wedding plans, which, in turn, will affect the business of banquet halls, wedding planners and other people associated with such events management. Nitika Manraw, whose brother is getting married in June, said they have started shortlisting their guests to comply with the government guidelines. “A grand wedding was planned. But that doesn’t seem possible now. We are shortlisting the guests and the venue, which should have enough space for them to maintain distancing norms,” she said. Sandhya Singh, who is to get married in May, said her family had already restricted the number of guests even before the government’s fresh guidelines came. “We knew that the pandemic is still there. Now that the government has issued guidelines for 250 guests only at a wedding function, we are going to strictly follow the same,” she said. Rakesh Bansal, the owner of a banquet hall at Kankarbagh, said the clients were confused. “They are either cancelling wedding or postponing the dates. We were looking forward to recover all our losses of 2020 with weddings this year, but it seems our difficult days are not over yet,” he said. Gyanesh Pratap Singh, who owns a hotel at Kankarbagh, said he was following every guideline issued by the government. “We are accepting the bookings as per the government guidelines though our revenue has already fallen by around 50% due to the pandemic,” he said. Wedding photographer Ashwini Sharma said many of his clients have cancelled the dates. “Payments are being delayed and people are also reducing the number of camera persons for the wedding ceremonies,” he said. Megha Agrwal, a jewellery shop owner, however, said they are not facing huge losses as people still buy jewellery even if they postpone their weddings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fresh-guidelines-may-hit-wedding-plans-business/articleshow/81901266.cms||---

After the completion of inquiry before the commissioner of inquiries R P Sisodia on Sunday, Rao said that desperate attempt was made to implicate him in the alleged case, and he submitted evidence pertaining to fake documents. Drawing parallels to Y S Vivekananada Reddy death, he said the allegations levelled against him are as true as Vivekananda Reddy died in accident. A conspiracy has been hatched out to frame him in the case and now fake documents also created to justify the allegations. Rao alleged that baseless charges have been made against him without any substantial evidence to prove the same. He said those who do not have any idea about laws and rule position have framed charges against him and the charge sheet prepared against him was with full of factual errors. During the inquiry, Rao cross examined 21 witnesses. While Rao did not disclose what transpired during the cross examination and what kind of documents were created against him. Sources close to Rao said that witnesses were coerced to give false statements against Rao and the same was exposed by him during the cross examination. The inquiry was taken up on daily basis after the Supreme Court directed the state government to complete the process within a month. The inquiry was concluded on Sunday the report will be submitted to the government for further action.

The two carried a reward of Rs50,000 each on their heads. The police also recovered two countrymade pistols, five live cartridges, two cellphones and a bike from their possession. The two are accused in at least a dozen murder cases in Purnia besides separate cases of loot and extortion. The duo is also suspected to be involved in the murder of the accountant of a brick kiln in the village on January 26 this year. Police said they had cut him into pieces and threw his body parts inside the burning kiln. Raghuvansh Nagar police outpost in-charge Mahadeo Kamat said Bhushan had enmity with one Bucchan Yadav (58) of the same village. “Bhushan suspected Bucchan had killed his father three decades ago. Since then, Bhushan has been running a gang to take revenge from Buchhan. Akhilesh later joined Bhushan’s gang after his three relatives were killed by Bucchan’s gang in March, 2019,” he said. Kamat said Bhushan and his gang members had attacked Bucchan’s convoy with bombs when they were returning home after inaugurating a programme on Saraswati Puja in 2019. “Bucchan’s one leg was blown up. His son Saurav Yadav (27), driver, bodyguard and several others were injured in the attack. Buchhan had died during treatment. The triple murder of Akhilesh’s relatives was in retaliation of attack on Bucchan. Saurav started running the gang, but STF arrested him from Patna,” he said, adding there were 25 murder cases against Bucchan. Kamat said Bhushan’s associate Arun Yadav was also shot dead on February 12, 2019 by Bucchan’s gang. “Arun’s wife was shot dead on January 6 this year before she was to depose before a court. Within an hour, Bhushan, Akhilesh and his associates shot dead Bucchan’s aide Rukhisi Yadav,” he said. Kamat said the brick kiln whose accountant was killed belonged to Bhucchan but is now owned by his wife Neelam Devi. “She is mukhiya of Gauripur panchayat,” Kamat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2-wanted-criminals-held-in-purnia/articleshow/81901050.cms||---
---||Patna||Summer fires claim 12 lives in a week||PATNA: With recent major fires in three villages in three districts claiming 12 lives, including those of nine children, there are apprehensions that this year’s summer with more than normal mercury reading and strong westerly winds might lead to recurrence of such incidents in the days to come. Two of the three separate incidents of fire occurred on April 2, claiming six lives, including three members of a family in one case and three other children of another family in the second case. The first fire incident on April 2 had occurred at Chakkantoli village under the Kalyanpur police station in Samastipur district. In yet another incident that occurred in Harijan Tola of Babura village in Dhankund block of Banka district, three children belonging to a family were killed. Two girls ere charred to death in a thatched hut and a two-year-old succumbed to the burn injuries at Sanhaula primary health centre (PHC) in Bhagalpur district. The summer fire at Kabaiya village under the Palasi police station area in Araria district had claimed the lives of six children. They were playing in a hutment when the fire hit the village and its leaping flames engulfed it. There is a forecast that the summer temperature this year would be slightly more than the normal and the strong westerly winds would also lash the state. Officially, three months from March to May are marked out as the ones which are most likely to see the occurrence of major fires in villages. According to an estimate of the Bihar State Disaster Management Authority (BSDMA), fires in the villages recorded during 2010 to 2015-16 resulted in the loss of 750 human lives. According to BSMDA sources, the poor who live in hutments are more vulnerable to summer fire. Around 4,500 villages in the state have a population in the range of 200 to 1,000, while 83% of the total villages in the state have population in the range of 1,000 to 9,999. Every village is a mix of thatched and pucca houses, but the poorer sections live in clusters of thatched hutments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/summer-fires-claim-12-lives-in-a-week/articleshow/81900939.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Bhagalpur residents write against ‘extortion’ at cremation ghats||BHAGALPUR: Some of the residents have lodged a complaint with the DM, SSP, Bhagalpur municipal commissioner and Sadar SDO against the pathetic condition of cremation ghats and high cost of performing last rites of those dying in the town. In a symbolic letter addressed to ‘Yamraj’ and a copy of it sent to the officials, they requested the god of death to keep the ‘death warrants’ postponed due to high cost of cremation as the ‘Dom Rajas’ were also charging exorbitantly for performing the rituals at Bararai and other ghats. They also alleged lack of even drinking water facility at the ghats. They have highlighted the pathetic condition of electric crematoriums on the bank of river Ganga and demanded proper arrangements of light, water, safe embankments and security for performing hassle-free last rites rituals. Social activists Kamal Jaiswal, Anand Kumar Mishra, Vinay Kumar Sinha and Abhay Kumar Ghosh, in the letter, alleged that the families of deceased persons face forced demand of huge amount up to Rs 30,000 by the keepers at ghats. “The families are even insulted if they refuse to pay the amount,” Jaiswal alleged. “We have also drawn the attention of DM, SSP, municipal commissioner and Sadar SDO towards the pathetic condition of cremation ghats as well as the extortion from family members of the deceased by the keepers,” he said. According to sources, Rs 3,000 is provided by the state government as a one-time grant under Kabir Anteyeshti Anudan Yojana to a BPL family to perform the last rites of a family member. But the social activists claimed that hefty demands by people managing the ghats are demanded to make arrangements. Accordingly, they have “written to Yamraj” that they don’t want to die as their families will have to face financial burden. Senior lawyer Rajesh Chandra Jha said the judiciary in many cases have interpreted that the right to have a decent burial is part of Article 21 of the Constitution. “It is a very sensitive and emotional issue that needs to be addressed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bpur-residents-write-against-extortion-at-cremation-ghats/articleshow/81900921.cms||Kumar Rajesh

Bubna was shot by three bike-borne youths when he was returning home after closing his shop under Salmari police outpost in Katihar. As the news about Bubna’s killing spread, Tejashwi tweeted, “Nitish ji, you have become so insensitive that such incidents don’t affect you.” Tejashwi alleged that the criminals backed by the ruling dispensation were attacking people anywhere anytime. “The way the Katihar trader was killed shows the law enforcing agency has virtually surrendered before the antisocial elements,” he alleged. The opposition leader said 27 bullets were sprayed on the businessman. “For how long people of the state will witness the ‘tandav’ of the antisocial elements?” he asked. RJD state president Jagadanand Singh also took a dig at the state government over the deteriorating law and order situation. He expressed his concern over the murder of half a dozen people in a group clash in Madhubani district recently. Terming the Madhubani incident as a carnage, he said, “There is no rule of law. The state government is shirking from its responsibility to protect the life and property of people,” he asserted. Jagadanand also attcked CM Nitish Kumar over the death of 16 people in a hooch tragedy in Nawada and demanded action against those responsible for the incident.

---||Business||Lodha’s Rs 2,500 crore IPO opens April 7||MUMBAI: Macrotech Developers (formerly Lodha Developers) is launching the second-largest real estate sector IPO in India on Wednesday through which the city-based company is targeting to raise Rs 2,500 crore. The IPO will be open between April 7 and 9, and the price band is set at Rs 483-486 per share. At the upper end of the IPO price band, Macrotech will have a market capitalisation of about Rs 21,750 crore. DLF with a market cap of Rs 72,205 crore and Godrej Properties with Rs 38,679 crore are currently valued more than Macrotech’s estimated valuation. Of the amount being raised through the IPO, Rs 1,500 crore will be used to reduce the company’s debt, Rs 375 crore for acquiring land and land developmental rights, while the rest will be kept aside for general corporate purpose spends. This is the third time that the company has tried to get listed, after withdrawing its prospectus in 2009 and then again in 2018. Given the grey market premium on some of the popular websites for primary markets, the stocks look fully valued at the current IPO price. The 26-year-old developer is a major player in the residential real estate market with its business mainly concentrated around the Mumbai metropolitan region. In 2019, it entered the logistics and industrial parks segment as a developer, the company said in the IPO document. Axis Capital, J P Morgan and Kotak Investment Banking are among the 10 merchant bankers that are managing the offer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lodhas-rs-2500cr-ipo-opens-apr-7/articleshow/81903160.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||In Ahmedabad, conservation files turn antiques, heritage icons shaky||AHMEDABAD: The icons of the legacy of Ahmedabad, a World Heritage City, are tumbling because of monumental delays in issuing restoration clearances and the lack of an awareness programme on conservation schemes.  In July, Ahmedabad will mark its third year as a Unesco World Heritage City. Yet, files that should move swiftly to hasten preservation are languishing as antiques of apathy. A case in point was a haveli in Sheikh no Pado. Its owner, Dipak Gupta, was unaware of the fact that he was eligible for a transfer of development rights (TDR) certificate with which he could raise Rs 32 lakh for repairing the haveli. Heritage haveli owners of the Walled City can sell TDR certificates to builders in other parts of the city. Gupta’s TDR certificate could have been bought by a builder in, say, Bopal who wanted the FSI (floor space index) to construct a few extra floors. Gupta’s haveli had been deemed a Grade 2B heritage building. The AMC had feared that the structure would collapse. It recently approached Gupta with a letter advising him to have his haveli repaired with the facility. The move came too late. “Before I could proceed, my haveli crumbled 15 days ago,” Gupta said. “I had no idea that I could sell TDR to raise funds for repairs.” As of now, 2,236 residential heritage buildings in the Walled City are eligible for TDR certificates. The buildings could collectively draw Rs 536 crore for repairs. That, in fact, is a 2014 AUDA calculation. But so far the owners of only 25 of the 2,236 buildings have managed to get valid TDR certificates. “The bulk of the file work is cleared by the AMC’s heritage cell. That includes drawing conservation estimates and plans,” said a senior AMC officer of the Central Zone. “But the clearance from the town development office takes months.” In February this year, a new batch of 12 haveli owners sought restoration permissions and TDR certificates from the AMC. In early January 2020, a team of AMC officials from the Central Zone had reported that about 10% of the listed World Heritage City properties had been lost. Experts warn of added developmental pressures on conservation efforts because of the bullet train station conceived for Kalupur. The project was announced in October 2020. An underground metro station to come up in the area will intensify the pressures, the experts say. “High net worth individuals who travel by the bullet train will like to experience the traditions of your city,” said Rajiv Patel, a heritage entrepreneur and member of the City Heritage Centre. Patel added: “By staying in havelis or exploring 600-year-old streets, people will get a sense of the city’s history. That’s how it has been in Europe.” Patel went on to say: “Moreover, people will not like to stay in generic buildings if they have history-steeped options. Therefore, we need to focus on conservation or we will lose our World Heritage City status.” Patel’s concern echoes in the AMC’s January 2020 report on the sites of 489 listed historical properties visited by the heritage department. The report noted that 38 of those buildings had been demolished, 11 sites were just vacant plots, and 50 had been amalgamated with modern buildings. Further, 34 heritage structures were in poor condition. “We need to get together as a city to save our heritage from fire disasters, traffic congestion, pollution, and migration owing to the commercialization of the Walled City residential zones,” said Jagdip Mehta, a Khadia resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-abad-conservation-files-turn-antiques-heritage-icons-shaky/articleshow/81902627.cms||Paul John

The 83-year-old Deepa is survived by son Sougata and daughter Poulami. Born in February 1938, Deepa was an ace badminton player who helped badminton enthusiasts pursue their dreams. Poulami described her as the “strongest person she has known”, both as a “mother” and a “woman”. “After marriage, she won the Bengal championship. She was a sportsperson and believed in not giving up without a fight. She once got a coolie from New Market with tuberculosis to stay at our Lake Temple Road house till he recovered,” she said. Deepa had introduced her children to art, painting, sculptures, music and dance. “Her sense of aesthetics was refined. She practised Ikebana, managed my father’s career and founded the theatre group Pratikriti,” she said. At Chatterjee’s memorial service last year, Chandrabindoo frontman-turned-director Anindya Chattopadhyay narrated excerpts from his interview of Deepa. “There was a lot of fondness when she recalled how he had proposed to her over the phone and their first date at the Barrackpore Dhobighat,” Chattopadhyay had said. The couple tied the knot in 1960 — a year after his debut in ‘Apur Sansar’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/soumitras-wife-passes-away-after-kidney-failure/articleshow/81901957.cms||---

The health ministry has appealed to people to avoid the three Cs — crowded places with many people nearby, close contact settings, especially where people have close range conversations, and confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. “Limit time in enclosed spaces. When possible open windows and doors for ventilation. Maintain at least one metre distance from others and wear a mask,” the ministry urged people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/active-cases-cross-2000-for-first-time-since-nov/articleshow/81903667.cms||---

The proposals submitted by the GVMC include continuous ambient air quality monitoring systems, dust suppression and extraction system, pollution monitoring machines, electric vehicles, development of greenery, heavy vehicle management and water sprinkler systems in dusty areas, etc. Visakhapatnam is one of the 13 non-attainment cities of Andhra Pradesh identified by the environment ministry under its National Clean Air Programme. A non-attainment city is one that does not meet the national ambient air quality standards prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The NCAP is aimed at reducing air pollution levels in the identified cities by decreasing the PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations by about 20 to 30% by 2024, taking 2017 as the base year. The Union government has already released Rs 36.5 crore as the first instalment to Vizag, while the city is expected to get another Rs 36.5 crore in the second tranche based on its performance, totalling to Rs 73 crore. As per proposals sent by the GVMC, two additional continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations will be set up at a cost of Rs 2 crore. Six more air quality monitoring machines would be procured with Rs 2 crore. Rs 4.5 crore has been earmarked for electric mobility. In addition to the existing four road sweeping machines, four more would be deployed in the city with about Rs 10 crore. New mini transfer stations would be set up with about Rs 10 crore. For the second tranche of funding, the GVMC has proposed providing end-to-end paving of important roads with Rs 20 crore. Altogether, about Rs 12.6 crore has been allocated for greenery development in Kapuluppada dumping yard. Speaking to TOI, GVMC Mayor G Hari Venkata Kumari said that the civic body will focus on reducing pollution levels in the city. “The civic body sent several proposals under the National Clean Air Programme to address the pollution issue in the city,” said Hari Kumari. Andhra University (AU), Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board and GVMC recently signed a tripartite MoU under the same initiative. As per the MoU, AU will act as a technical partner for the GVMC in implementing the NCAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-sends-rs-73cr-proposals-for-pollution-control-in-vizag/articleshow/81901350.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Summer showers bring relief, but heatwaves likely in April & May||VISAKHAPATNAM: Several parts of Andhra Pradesh are likely to face severe heatwaves over April and May, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said. This March has already seen a steep rise in maximum temperatures. Temperature rise over the next two months will be crucial, said S Stella, director, IMD, Andhra Pradesh centre. According to Andhra Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority (APSDMA), 19 out of 670 mandals in 13 districts registered heatwaves on Sunday. A number of places in Chittoor, Prakasam and Nellore were on high alert for heatwaves this week. Referring to the sudden rains on Saturday across many parts of the state, Stella said these are temporary in summer. Rainfall in summer can generally attributed to weather patterns such as cumulonimbus clouds and entry of southerly winds with moisture from the sea. “Rains on Saturday in places like Visakhapatnam were also the due to the change of weather conditions. These rains can temporarily give relief from the heat,” Stella told TOI. Data with the Cyclone Warning Centre (CWC) show that Vizag city registered 50.3 mm of rainfall at Waltair and 2.8 mm of rainfall at Visakhapatnam Airport between Saturday evening and Sunday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/summer-showers-bring-relief-but-heatwaves-likely-in-april-may/articleshow/81901406.cms||V Kamalakara Rao

This has raised a major concern among forest officials as the sanctuary houses rare, near-extinct animals like the Alpine musk deer, Himalayan tahr (bovines found in Himalayas), Himalayan griffon (a vulture native to the Himalayas), Himalayan black bear (a subspecies of the Asian black bear found in the Himalayas) and snow leopards as well as trees like oak, birch and rhododendron. As per data provided by the forest department, a total of 9,550 trees have been gutted till now in the fires which began in October last year and forest ecosystems spread over 1,359.8 hectares have been adversely affected. Meanwhile, the Centre on Sunday directed use of two IAF choppers to help in dousing the flames as well as National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel to be deployed in the hill state. The state government had written to the defence ministry on Saturday citing “a worsening situation of forest fires” and had asked for two IAF helicopters, one each to be stationed in Garhwal and Kumaon. Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday tweeted about the Uttarakhand forest fires, saying “The central government has issued an order for immediate deployment of two choppers and NDRF teams in Uttarakhand to arrest the fire and curb destruction of life and property”. Chief minister Tirath Rawat had spoken with the home minister earlier in the day, apprising him of the forest fire situation in the state. “While one chopper would be stationed at Tehri - to cover areas under Garhwal region - the second one would operate from Almora and Nainital and cover the Kumaon region,” the CM told TOI. The CM also held a meeting with senior officials from affected districts as well as police and disaster management departments. Officials have been asked to distribute kits of torches and firefighting equipment at the block level, so villagers can also be roped in to fight forest fires. Four human and seven animal deaths have been officially recorded till now due to the forest fires. Head of forest force (HOFF) Rajeev Bhartari said, “IAF helicopters were the need of the hour as our teams cannot reach remote areas. Our entire workforce is using the latest equipment and acting on war footing, leaving no stone unturned to douse the flames. We are co-ordinating with other departments and if needed, will seek support of more expert personnel.” Leaves of all forest staff have been cancelled for the next two months and 10 senior IFS officers have been tasked with reviewing the wildfire situation in as many hill districts, he added. Divisional forest officer (DFO) of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (KWLS) Amit Kanwar meanwhile said that he believed the fires were due to human intervention. “Last year due to the lockdown, no one was allowed to enter the forest and as a result, there wasn’t a single instance of wildfire in KWLS. Dry winters, lack of rains, strong winds and an increased fuel load of dried pine needles on the forest floor — there are excessive this year as last year’s pine needles have accumulated too — are turning the smallest of sparks into blazing fires.” Watch Wildfire guts 1,300 hectare forest cover in Uttarakhand||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/1300-ha-forest-cover-gutted-in-ukhand-blaze-reaches-kedarnath-wildlife-sanctuary-torches-500-trees/articleshow/81901337.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Business||Godrej Consumer on market expansion drive||MUMBAI: Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) has embarked on a go-to-market (GTM) mission to increase its overall distribution footprint to 1.5 million direct coverage outlets, from 1.2 million, and enhance indirect coverage to 7 million from 6 million in 2-3 years. The objective is to achieve a vision of growing consistently in “strong double-digits over 3-4 years”, the company’s CEO (India & Saarc) Sunil Kataria told TOI in an exclusive interview. As part of its new GTM strategy, GCPL is leveraging emerging channels and using technology as a key differentiator to “stay ahead of the curve as changes disrupt the GTM ecosystem”, said Kataria. The shifts in consumer behaviour since the pandemic have accelerated the move by GCPL to transform its GTM and make it future-ready. “Today, the consumer is experimenting with buying across channels and we want to be sure we have an omni-channel strategy. We are reinventing the way we operate in our existing channels in both urban and rural. While we are expanding coverage and going deeper in penetration in rural, we want to improve the quality of expansion in outlets in urban,” said Kataria. Even as eB2B has come into play, the biggest change that’s happening is the emergence of an omni-channel consumer. “This is the consumer who will shop across all channels. A consumer could read about a product and get detailed reviews on an e-commerce site and could end up ordering it there or go to a neighbourhood store and buy it. The consumer may even end up ordering the same product on a different grocery channel on an app or walk into a modern trade store and buy it. This is where the big shift will happen for all brands in GTM,” he said. While there will be overlaps currently, Kataria said in 18-20 months one would be able to reckon which channel — general trade, modern trade, e-commerce — will omni-channel get indexed towards. Since data will become the key differentiator in an omni-channel environment, GCPL is invested in building an analytics backbone. E-commerce, a key channel, is an independent business unit for GCPL in India and has a separate P&L accountability. The objective, said Kataria, is to be agile in a fast-growing channel. “Two years ago, e-commerce was 2% of our business. This year, it should grow to 5%. Going forward, I expect e-commerce to contribute 8-10% of our business,” he said. GCPL is also building its chemists’ network and has appointed over 400 distributors and has acquired 50,000 chemist outlets. It is also creating a technology backbone for the pharma channel. “We were earlier under-leveraged in the chemist channel. Now we have the portfolio to leverage the chemist channel,” said Kataria. Riding on Godrej Protekt brand, GCPL now has a comprehensive range of hygiene products, which include handwash, health soap, disinfectant sprays, surface and skin wipes to push through the chemist channel. The company has also expanded the rural counter sub-stockist network by 30% by adding around 3,000 in the last one year. The village coverage has gone up to around 70,000 which, Kataria said, will go up to one lakh in a few years. GCPL is also making a pronounced transformation of its distribution software by converting it into cloud-based, where everything is controlled centrally, and data is real-time. GCPL has started tracking tertiary sales in rural, which Kataria claims makes it the first to do so in FMCG. Further, in a pilot project, GCPL has moved around 90 salesmen in Mumbai on third-party rolls for better control over market execution. This is based on a key learning from the pandemic, when suddenly there was a shortage of sales people. Based on what GCPL learns from this pilot project, it plans to extend the same to other top metros as well. Kataria expects the GTM transformation to contribute 2-3% delta within the double-digit growth rate aspiration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/godrej-consumer-on-market-expansion-drive/articleshow/81903213.cms||Namrata Singh

Speaking on the occasion, the leaders of the trade unions and Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porara Committee said that VSP has achieved net profits of Rs 6 crore per day for the last 120 days and the profits speak of the hard work and dedication and performance of the plant’s employees. VSP will achieve more milestones if the plant is allotted a captive iron ore mine and if the bank interest rates are lowered, they said. The agitators also said that the public is united in its support against the Union government’s decision. “We are gearing up for bigger agitations in the coming days to protect the steel plant, which is the pride of Vizag and of Andhra Pradesh,” protestors added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/fight-against-privatisation-of-vsp-will-go-on-activists/articleshow/81901467.cms||---

Churches drew large numbers of devotees who participated in a special mass marking the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Vijayawada Catholic Diocese Bishop Telagathoti Joseph Raja Rao offered Easter service at St Paul’s Cathedral Church in Benz Circle. At Gunadala Church, throngs of devotees lined up from the wee hours to offer special prayers at the Easter service. “Jesus Christ was resurrected three days after the crucifixion. The whole world celebrates his resurrection as Easter Sunday. The month-long fasting came to an end on Good Friday on which believers commemorate the death of Jesus Christ on the Holy cross. People celebrate the rebirth of Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday,” said Brother M Deva Sahayam, an Evangelist at Jesus Power Ministries. Worshippers burst crackers at Gandhinagar, Pejjonipeta and Wynchipet on Sunday morning as a part of Easter celebrations. Believers at Lutheran Church sang hymns to mark the resurrection of Christ. In keeping with the prevailing pandemic situation, police ensured Covid-19 guidelines at churches were strictly implemented. No devotee was permitted into any church without masks.

SP, a minority shareholder of Tata Sons, had claimed that Mehli received “huge benefits” due to his personal relationship with company chairman emeritus Ratan Tata. “I’m happy that my name has been cleared by the Supreme Court. This was important, especially for my wife and daughter, and after the attacks on my integrity,” Mehli said. SP had sought an independent audit into the transactions between Mehli and Ratan Tata/Tata companies. Cyrus had alleged that Mehli received dredging and shipping contracts from Tata Power without proper tendering procedures. He also raised questions over an apartment in Bakhtawar, in the plush south Mumbai locality of Colaba, that was given to Mehli by Forbes Gokak (a former Tata company). The SP scion also dragged Ratan Tata’s reimbursement to Mehli in lieu of the transfer of an agricultural land in Alibaug. The SC, however, in its judgment dated March 26, observed that there is nothing to indicate that Ratan Tata got enriched at the cost of Forbes Gokak. The court pointed out that the Bakhtawar apartment transaction happened in 2002 but the allegation was raised in 2016. The apex court also held that the Alibaug agricultural land deal was a “regular transfer that took place in 1993”. About the dredging and shipping allegations, the court observed that the contract was awarded in 1993 and was renewed five times between 2002 and 2014. Cyrus, who was a director of Tata Power from 1996 to 2006 and from 2011 to 2016 did not raise any objections then, the SC said. On the allegations that Mehli received favours due to his close relationship with Ratan Tata, the SC said that the only document that the petitioner filed and relied on was an email by Mehli addressed, among others, to S Padmanabhan of Tata Power. Mehli and Cyrus’s mothers are sisters but the relationship between the cousins soured after the latter became the chairman of Tata Sons in 2012.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mistrys-cousin-relieved-as-sc-says-tata-did-him-no-favours/articleshow/81903278.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The order has been issued to regional directorates of education across the state to identify fake applicants and also take action, and if needed, also file police complaints. The issue was highlighted by TOI when three schools initially, and some more later complained to the education office of Pune zilla parishad regarding parents from well-off economic backgrounds submitting bogus income certificates to claim seats in top private schools in the city. The director of education has also sought a report on the action taken against such applicants.The ZP officials had come across at least 100 cases in three schools during their probe where RTE seats in some reputed private schools were cornered by well-to-do parents for their children. After a TOI report on February 6, some more schools approached the education department regarding similar cases in their schools. The city unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had demanded a change in state’s policy in the 25% reservation scheme for admission to private schools. Following these developments, the state directorate of education in an order last week to the education offices across Maharashtra said, “The officers must take appropriate action against defaulting parents and applicants and a consolidated report should be sent to the directorate.”Director of education, Dattaray Jagtap, said, “The review with education offices across the state revealed that such cases have been noticed in several regions especially in the urban areas. However, unlike Pune, no other schools from other districts had given written complaints in the matter so there was less scope for action. The Pune case has now enabled us to initiate the enquiry in all districts of the state.”As per the RTE guidelines, students from poor families whose parents have an annual income of less than Rs one lakh are eligible to apply under the 25% reservation quota in private schools. The Pune ZP found that some parents had businesses and some owned two houses, one of them on lease, and some were government officers.BJP Pune city secretary Sunil Mane said, “All such persons must face strict action. The seats are being grabbed using wrong means and the deserving are being left out as a result of this malpractice. The education office must follow up with this matter very closely and ensure that not a single seat is taken away or grabbed by those who do not deserve it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crackdown-against-applicants-for-rte-seats-with-bogus-income-docus/articleshow/81902874.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The official death figure is 15. The suspensions were ordered on Saturday night after the special team constituted to probe into the incident found spurious liquor as the prima facie cause of deaths in Gondapur, Kharidi Bigha, Budhaul, Kanhai Nagar and New Area under Town police station area of Nawada. When asked, Nawada SP Dhurat Saayli Savlaram told TOI over the phone on Sunday that action against the SHO was taken after she submitted a report to Magadh range IG Amit Lodha on the overall scenario, recommending his suspension. “The SHO failed to check smuggling as well as manufacturing of country liquor in his area. Besides, there were some old complaints against him, too,” she said. The SP said inquiry was on against at least five more police officers posted at Town police station as they had been given specific role to keep an eye on liquor smuggling on Holi. “Action may be taken against them, too, soon. Raids are going on to nab those who had manufactured and sold the poisonous hooch,” Savlaram said. The SP said death reports started coming on March 31. “Several of them were already ill by then and were undergoing treatment at different places. Some were ill since March 28 and a few deaths had also taken place on March 29,” the SP said. “Had police come to know about their illness on time, steps would have been taken for the treatment of those who had consumed liquor,” she said. Savlaram said police came to know about four to five deaths on March 31. “Then we started looking into the incidents,” she said. Savlaram said at least two persons have developed partial blindness and were undergoing treatment outside Nawada. “Some suspects are being quizzed about th manufacturing of liquor,” she added. Town SHO (incharge) Uma Shankar said seven persons, including some women, have been detained from interrogation. “Eleven plastic pouches from which liquor was consumed were seized from the house of one Manti Devi of Budhaul. She is also among those detained,” Shankar said. Meanwhile, Mithilesh Pandey, whose close friend Sanoj Mishra also died of poisonous hooch on March 31, told TOI over the phone on Sunday from Nawada that action should be taken against the DM and SP over the hooch deaths. “Both kept covering up the hooch deaths by citing different reasons like diarrhoea or other illnesses. They are the biggest culprits. They must be removed. Action has been taken only against small fish,” he said. Pandey said common people in Nawada were continuously venting their anger on social media against the DM and SP. Excise SI suspended An excise department sub-inspector, Nagendra Prasad, was also suspended on Sunday over the hooch deaths in Nawada where he was posted. Excise department deputy commissioner Krishna Kumar said Prasad was suspended on the recommendation of Nawada DM. He said Prasad was the in-charge of the town area in Nawada for prohibition enforcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sho-chowkidar-axed-in-nawada-hooch-deaths-case/articleshow/81901001.cms||Debashish Karmakar

They poured petrol into the house through a window and set it on fire. The house belongs to one Pavan working as a traffic constable in Gudivada town. No one from his family was present at the time of the incident and the house was locked. Neighbours noticed smoke coming out of the house and informed Pavan and fire officials who rushed to the spot and put out the fire. All furniture in the house was gutted by the time firemen controlled the flames. They noticed from the nature of the fire that petrol may have been used. However, the exact substance is yet to be ascertained. Cops registered a case and launched an investigation into the matter. They are gathering feed from surveillance cameras in the vicinity to identify the miscreants. Police said once the perpetrators are identified, they would pinpoint the motive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/miscreants-set-on-fire-cops-house/articleshow/81901362.cms||---

Saturday vigil, midnight mass and special morning Easter service followed by lighting of candles and singing of hymns marked Easter celebrations at city churches. According to Father Prem Prakash SJ, the Vicar General of Patna Archdiocese, Easter is the most important festival for followers of Christ. “The Christian faith is based on the resurrection of Christ. Easter is a reminder of the sacrifices Jesus made for humanity. It signifies victory of good over evil,” he said. As per the New Testament, Jesus died on the cross on Good Friday and came back to life three days later. His resurrection is celebrated on Easter Sunday, which also marks the end of Lent, the 40-day period of fasting which begins on Ash Wednesday. Easter is the celebration of victory over death, a celebration of new life. Ayush Bhatti, a resident of Sabzibagh, who attended the midnight Easter Vigil Mass at the St Joseph’s Pro-Cathedral, said, “Church visit is a must during the holy week. This year, we attended the mass on Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Sunday,” he said. For Phebina Sam, a 25-year-old IT professional, Easter was about friends and family reunion. “We dressed up in new clothes, cooked traditional dishes and put up a huge spread for all our relatives,” she told this newspaper. Some people also share food and clothes with underprivileged families on Easter. “We prepare additional dishes and distribute those along with clothes and money among the people in need,” said Ishaan Michael, a student of NIT-Patna. Mettina Varghese, a resident of Boring Road, said she made 26 items for the Easter spread. “The Easter egg cake was the main dish made of dark and white chocolate. The plum pudding and the carrot cake is also my family’s favourite,” she said. For kids, exchanging Easter eggs is the most fun part of the celebrations. “My mother makes Eater eggs at home using chocolate melts and coloured sprinkles. Elders distribute the chocolate goodies among us equally,” said 12-year-old Aarush Shand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/easter-celebrated-amid-pandemic/articleshow/81901283.cms||---

Goods and services tax (GST) is triggered whenever there is any such supply. However, as such services were rendered as a ‘pure agent’, their value would be nil. This appellate order was given in the case of a Noida-based private company Ion Trading, which is a subsidiary of a UK company. The company submitted that the facilitation of parking spaces between its employees and the building authorities does not amount to supply of services as this activity is not in the course of furtherance of its business of software development. The AAAR did not agree with this stand. But it agreed that the company was not utilising the parking charges collected from employees for its own benefit and the entire sum was passed on to the building authority. Hence, it qualified as a pure agent and the value of services provided by it would be nil. In other words, there would be no GST sum to be collected from employees. The pandemic has resulted in a large number of employees (who do not work from home) using their own vehicles — be it two- or four-wheelers. This, in turn, results in the employer having to provide for parking space. In this context, this order given by the UP bench of the AAAR is pertinent. Sunil Gabhawalla, founder of a CA firm, said, “This ruling is in contradiction to an advance ruling in the case of Posco India, where the health insurance expenses for parents recovered from employees was not held to be a supply of service.” “However, as the AAAR in this case has held that the act of collecting parking fees was performed in its capacity of a pure agent, the ruling may be well-received by the industry, as most of the recoveries from employees are at cost,” he adds. It should be noted that advance rulings only have a persuasive impact during assessment of similar cases and do not set a judicial precedent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/parking-fees-from-staff-to-face-gst-but-at-nil-value/articleshow/81903174.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: First vax Sunday sees low turnout at pvt hosps; govt sites fare better||KOLKATA: Vaccination sites at private hospitals across Kolkata saw a low turnout but there was a decent crowd at state hospitals and centres on Sunday. Private hospitals had made arrangements for a large number of recipients for the first Sunday vaccination, but didn’t meet the target. However, KMC-run centres had about 6,000 recipients across 80 sites. At Peerless Hospital, just 72 took the jab on Sunday compared to Saturday’s 391. “People were probably not aware vaccines are now available on Sundays. We didn’t expect such a low attendance, however. It should improve on subsequent Sundays since now we are inoculating the working population, for whom Sunday is the best option,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) saw the number of recipients tumble to 80 on Sunday from 300 a day earlier. “We plan to publicize that we are now vaccinating on Sundays. We will reach out to complexes and other residents in our area,” said zonal head R Venkatesh. Eighty-four-year-old Shanti Dutta, a resident of Sree Colony, took the jab sitting in a wheelchair at the KMC-run Layelka vaccination centre. Her son said she had been excited about the shot and hoped there wouldn’t be a crowd on Sunday. Several KMC vaccination centres, however, had long queues. According to a KMC health department official, besides the 45-59 age group, a considerable number of senior citizens were also getting the jab. At the Layelka centre, 90 applicants had been registered by 1.30pm. In the next hour, the number crossed 100. A civic official said of 80 KMC-run vaccination centres open on Sunday, at least 30 had to deal with heavy rush for registration since morning. “Over 50% of around 6,000 recipients vaccinated on Sunday at KMC-run centres got their shots at 30 most sought after sites — most of which are in Behala, Tollygunge, Jadavpur, Garfa, Kasba, Garia, Girish Park, Bidhan Sarani, Hatibagan, Raja Manindra Street and Taltala. We will engage additional manpower at some of these centres,” the official said. “We had long queues at urban primary health centres since morning. Though we had manpower ready on a holiday, a section of our officials and paramedics was under pressure when the queue grew as the day progressed,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/first-vax-sunday-sees-low-turnout-at-pvt-hosps-govt-sites-fare-better/articleshow/81901919.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||School teachers pulled up for poor e-performance||KOLKATA: Though school administrations feel some students have taken it easy with online classes by switching off their cameras and lazing off, not every teacher has been proactive either, even if most have adapted to the new mode of teaching. Annual assessments have been made of teachers in many schools and school heads have considered complaints from parents. It has been found that some teachers would switch off their cameras, assign classwork and walk away during class. Some would play recorded sessions and not be “present” and children were expected to pick up the lessons from the video. There were even those who would download academic videos and play them for long stretches without giving lectures. Such teachers have been told the online mode is here to stay and their performance was unacceptable. Teachers have been told that the load of correcting exercise books was off now and they have to only correct exam answer scripts. This gives time to focus on online lectures. In the new session, schools have asked teachers to share links and passwords with the administration so there can be surprise checks. “It is easy to say kids have been sleeping with cameras off in class, but have all teachers not done similar things?” said Supriyo Dhar, secretary of La Martiniere schools. Some schools, like St Augustine’s Shyamnagar and Barrackpore, have found that a few teachers did not take attendance correctly at times, have taught with cameras off, have not interacted enough with children or have played power-point presentations without intermittent face time. “We are taking these very seriously,” said school head Janet Gasper Chowdhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/school-teachers-pulled-up-for-poor-e-performance/articleshow/81901943.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Lucknow||UP to appoint nodal officer for each Covid hospital||LUCKNOW: Stepping up preventive measures in the wake of spike in coronavirus cases, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday directed the state health department to appoint a nodal officer for each Covid care hospital. UP recorded 4,164 cases in the past 24 hours. Yogi also directed the officials to constitute nigrani samitis at the level of every gram panchayat and municipal ward. For this, members of Yuvak Mangal Dal, chowkidars, civil defence and NGOS will be engaged. He instructed officials to keep a strict vigil in Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Ghaziabad and GB Nagar. The CM said that the beds in SGPGI, KGMU and Ram Manohar Lohia should also be increased for Covid patients. He also warned of strict action in case of any callousness. Additional chief secretary, health, Amit Mohan Prasad said nodal officers will be appointed for both government and private hospitals. The officials will ensure that the infected people get quality treatment and the hospitals have adequate arrangements. “The officers will also address complaints, if any, of the people admitted in these hospitals,” he said. Prasad announced that on April 7, which is the World Health Day, the state government will felicitate gifts to four to eight people, in all districts, who have been administered both doses of vaccine. The beneficiaries will be selected through lottery with the help of serial number of vaccination card given to those vaccinated. “This is being done to encourage people to get the second dose of vaccine,” he said. Prasad said the government will ensure strict implementation of Covid safety protocols, including demarcating containment zones. In one case, the containment zone would be of 25 metres radius, while in case of a cluster (more than one case), the containment zone would cover 50 metres radius. Over 19k cases in UP in 24 hoursUP recorded a total of 19,738 active cases in the past 24 hours. Of these, 10,665 patients were in home isolation while others are in hospitals. A total of 6,01,640 patients have recovered from the infection in the state so far. Prasad said the government conducted tests of 1,77,695 samples. “The idea is to identify and isolate the infected people as soon as possible,” he said. On Saturday, 1,66,110 tests were conducted in the state. Till date, 3,54,13,966 tests have been done in the state. The ACS said surveillance has been scaled up in the wake of Covid surge. He said that 3,17,06,947 houses have been tracked to cover more than 15 crore people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-appoint-nodal-officer-for-each-covid-hospital/articleshow/81903322.cms||Pankaj Shah

The last week of the campaign focused on sensitising Delhiites about the benefits of electric vehicles and the Delhi Electric Vehicles Policy. The government said that students and activists came out in large numbers to support the drive and help spread the message to the rest of the city’s youth to make their first vehicle an EV. Vrikshit Foundation, an environmental organisation led by students, organised a wall painting event to spread awareness on EVs. Youngsters came together and painted a wall at Ashok Vihar on the message of the Switch Delhi movement. “We can set an example for the rest of the country to make sustainable choices. I am taking the Switch Delhi Pledge that my first vehicle will be an EV,” Vaibhav Madhani, member of Enactus Hansraj, Social Entrepreneurship Society, said. Student environmentalist Aditya Dubey said the transportation sector was one of the main sources of PM 2.5 emissions in Delhi and contributes to around 22% of air pollution.  “EVs are environment-friendly, futuristic and have a low total cost of operation as compared to petrol vehicles.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/switch-campaign-ends-as-youths-pledge-to-make-e-vehicle-their-first-ride/articleshow/81902048.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||SAD stir theatrics, says Amarinder||Chandigarh: The planned protests of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) was theatrics by the Badals to revive their party’s fortunes, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh charged on Sunday. These desperate tactics would not work as Akalis have completely lost face in the wake of their humiliation over the contentious farm laws, he claimed. Ahead of the upcoming state assembly elections early next year, the SAD was trying hard to get back into people’s good books despite losing its moral right to face the people due to their double-speak on many vital issues, including the ongoing farmers’ agitation, said Capt Amarinder. A day before SAD’s protests against the state government’s failure on several promises, the chief minister termed SAD claims of rising power tariffs, higher taxes on fuel and law-and-order situation as ridiculous. He said it was the SAD that had plunged Punjab into such a mess during their 10-year-rule, in collusion with BJP. However, he said, Punjab has improved the law and order as well as its fiscal situation in the past four years of the Congress rule. The record implementation of 85% poll promises by the Congress government cleared the progress made by the state over the past four years and nails the lie of SAD allegations, he added. Responding to the SAD’s accusation of withdrawing postmatric scheduled caste scholarship, Amarinder said either the Akalis were falsifying facts to mislead the people or did not want to expose their own role in the affair. “They were part of the central government when the latter pulled out of the scholarship scheme,” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-stir-theatrics-says-amarinder/articleshow/81902875.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Petrol pumps to remain closed on April 10||JAIPUR: Over 6,000 fuel pumps will be on a one-day strike on April 10 across Rajasthan due to the high VAT imposed on diesel and petrol. The fuel pumps will be shut from 6am to midnight on the same day. The petrol pump association claimed that because of the high VAT, the sale of fuel in the state has reduced considerably as compared to the neighbouring states like Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and others. Sunit Bagai, president, Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers Association said, “On April 10, all the 6,700 petrol pumps across the state will remain shut from early morning to midnight as a protest against the high VAT in Rajasthan. Due to the high cost of fuel in our state, we are selling 34% less petrol and diesel in Rajasthan compared to other states like Punjab. Petrol pump owners are facing huge losses because of which some of them had to close down permanently.” The association has also written to the state government regarding the same stating that the high prices are having such adverse effect that even in border districts like Dholpur, which has heavy vehicle movement, not even 1,000 litres of diesel is being sold on a daily basis. “There should be standard fuel price across the country and we have no problem with the same, but at present due to the difference in the prices with other states, criminal elements are indulging in smuggling of fuel. They get fuel from neighbouring states and sell it in black market here. At least 12 districts like Churu, Udaipur, Sriganganagar, Bharatpur and others have high fuel prices and black marketers are taking advantage of this. Along with us, even the allied services are getting adversely affected.” While there is 36% VAT on diesel, the same tax is 26% on petrol and the stakeholders warned that if no action is taken by the state government to reduce the tax after April 10 protest then they would go on an indefinite strike from April 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/petrol-pumps-to-remain-closed-on-april-10/articleshow/81902040.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||‘Pb getting power cheap, charging consumers high’||Chandigarh: The Congress government in Punjab has been exposed by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) report stating that though it was purchasing electricity at much lower rates than neighbouring Haryana and Delhi, it was providing electricity to its consumers at much higher rates than these two states, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) claimed on Sunday. SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said the CERC has released a report regarding purchase of electricity by different states based on calculation of average power purchase cost (APPCC) rate at the national level. The report for financial year 2020-21 clearly stated that Punjab was purchasing non-renewable energy electricity at an average cost of Rs 3.65 per unit and the state had purchased 50,883 million units of power during last year. He said Punjab has been ranked a poor 15th and shockingly it was purchasing cheaper power than Haryana and Delhi who were providing much cheaper electricity to their consumers. After inclusion of transmission charge, the cost came at Rs 4.93 per unit whereas the Punjab State Power Supply Corporation (PSPCL), state government power utility, was supplying power to consumers at rates ranging from Rs 9.50 to Rs 11.50 per unit. Cheema asked the Punjab government to reply to the factual report disclosed by the CERC “exposing the Congress government on its claims of cheaper power”. He said the state government should accept that it "minted money all these four years".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pb-getting-power-cheap-charging-consumers-high/articleshow/81902870.cms||---
---||Pune||Rapid rise in dry eye cases among children too||Pune: Dry eye, which was primarily seen among adult professionals till recently, has hit children too due to increased screen time in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and resultant restrictions. Besides, fast-progressing nearsightedness (myopia) is another health concern fast catching up with Pune’s paediatric population, doctors have said. “Since children are spending long hours in front of computers, tablets, cellphones and television sets, many of them are complaining of discomfort in the eyes, including burning and gritty sensation. These symptoms prompt them to rub eyes frequently All these are symptoms of dry eye also called the computer vision syndrome,” eye surgeon Jai Kelkar said. Dry eye is commonly seen in computer professionals spending long hours in front of the screens. Its incidence among children had always remained minimal as compared to adults prior to the pandemic. “But nowadays, children too are being diagnosed with a dry eye very commonly. The percentage has shot up from 3% prior to the pandemic to 67% now,” Kelkar, who is also the director of the National Institute of Ophthalmology, said. Eye surgeon Vardhaman Kankariya said with the Covid pandemic, learning has moved from the classrooms to the online world and workplaces to laptops at homes. “This means that children and young adults are having to put in many more hours in front of the screens than they ought to,” he said. But why are screens so harmful to the eyes? “The answer to this is multifactorial. First, most people use smartphones and tablets, both of which amount to near tasks. In children, it has been seen that prolonged near tasks can cause an increase in myopia (nearsightedness). We are seeing this phenomenon in a big way now. Some children who had stable refractive error before pandemic are suddenly showing worsening of spectacle numbers,” Kankariya, who is the founder-head of the Asian Eye Hospital, said. Secondly, he said, when people are watching screens, their eyes are focussed at a fixed distance for a long time. “While in everyday life, we are focusing on objects at a near or intermediate or far distance, and our focus keeps changing. When watching a screen, everything is happening at a fixed distance. This can cause eye muscle fatigue and weakness. This may also lead to headaches,” he said. “Thirdly, when watching a screen, we get very engrossed and forget to blink enough. This is particularly true for children and it causes the eyes to become dry and then reflex watering to start,” Kankariya said.  Last week alone, Kankariya said, he has seen around 10 cases of children with issues of blurring of vision, dry eyes and headache. When probed, they found to be indulging in a high amount of screen time at home. There are certain non-ophthalmic effects of increased screen time too, including reduced attention span, hyperactivity and cervical spondylosis. CARE FOR THE EYES For children in early learning classes or ages 3-5 years, 1 hour should be the limit, in 3 stretches of 20 minutes each For children in the age group of 5-15 years, screen time may be further increased beyond 1 hour For individuals aged 16 years or above, no such limit exists but any unnecessary screen time should be avoided Wear Glasses, if prescribed, and always watch screens in a well-lit room Take regular breaks Take nutritious diet Do eye check-up regularly (Source: Asian Eye Hospital, Pune)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rapid-rise-in-dry-eye-cases-among-children-too/articleshow/81902885.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Jaipur||Activists cry foul over deemed permission for repair in Mount Abu||JAIPUR: Recent order of Directorate of Local Bodies — to form a committee in Mount Abu that will look into the matter of permitting material entry for buildings’ restoration and repair — is being criticised by activists in the region. The order dated March 16, 2021states that if the file for material entry is not approved by the three-member committee in 15 days, then it will be deemed to be approved. This deemed approval is said to be a back-door entry, that will enhance illegal construction in the town. Mount Abu being an Eco-Sensitive Zone, new construction is completely banned as per the orders of the National Green Tribunal. The three-member committee includes sub-divisional magistrate, chairperson of Mount Abu municipality and executive officer of the municipality. The file has to go to the committee for its approval and all the three members have to agree on the proposed repair or restoration. According to the notification of environment ministry on June 29, 2010, a monitoring committee is to be formed in Mount Abu that will look into the approval of any repair work but the committee formed earlier is not functioning any more. Bhanwar Singh, former councillor of the municipality said, without consultation with the environment ministry, DLB is trying to dismantle the notification. “The 15 days’ time-period involves technical and land examination by an understaffed municipality followed by a committee meeting, which makes the task of getting permission either a hasty or an impossible task. Hence, deemed permission order has a potential to harm the fragile ecology of Mount Abu,” said Singh. Saurabh Gangadia, a member of monitoring committee dismantled in 2020 said that the order itself has many loopholes. “Earlier, the examination of the land is made by a junior engineer who will then allow specific quantity of material to the owner of the property. This order doesn’t specify how much material a person will be allowed to bring into the town. The order can lead to reckless construction,” said Gangadia. However, director of DLB Deepak Nandi said, this order was taken out after demand of the public representative as the backlog of files in the municipality is impacting people. “Earlier, for months files were kept in the municipality while public used to suffer. In state assembly, the minister announced that they will bring in some change in the approval process and I believe that this will be beneficial for the people who are forced to run pillar to post for minor repair approval,” said Nandi. Reacting on the argument of state assembly’s recommendations, Arun Sharma, another activist from Mount Abu said that the assembly can give recommendation, but cannot supersede the ministry of environment’s order. He said that a petition will be soon filed in the Rajasthan High Court to get stay order against it, as it will destroy the town in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/activists-cry-foul-over-deemed-permission-for-repair-in-mt-abu/articleshow/81902044.cms||---

According to the Met office, rain, thunderstorm and hail are likely to occur in the hilly districts of Uttarakhand from April 5. The intensity of the rain spells is likely to increase on April 6 and 7. "Uttarkashi, Chamoli and Pithoragarh districts will start witnessing a change in weather conditions with showers on April 5. The mid-level hills and the foothills will also receive rainfall on April 6 and 7," said Rohit Thapliyal, scientist at the regional meteorological centre.

---||Delhi||CM: Being punished for backing farmers||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday alleged that he was paying the price for supporting farmers protesting against the agri laws with the Centre “punishing” him by amending the Government of NCT of Delhi Act, which gives all powers to the lieutenant governor instead of the elected government. Kejriwal stated this while addressing a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Jind in Haryana, adding that he would continue to support farmers no matter what price he had to pay. He said he had asked all his MPs and MLAs to serve the farmers at Delhi’s borders just like ordinary citizens without wearing the party’s cap, carrying its flag or taking the name of AAP or Kejriwal. “Delhi government has arranged for food, water and washrooms. Free Wi-Fi is also being provided at the borders,” said the CM. “I’m glad that even after four months, the farmer’s protest is still going on. BJP was not able to do anything about it. That is why it is upset with me and now it has amended the GNCTD Act in Parliament to punish me. We have incurred a huge loss for supporting the farmers’ protest. We are punished for backing and supporting the farmers,” said Kejriwal. Asking if this was why everyone fought for Independence, Kejriwal further said, “We fought so that citizens could gain power, vote for their representatives and elect their government who, in turn, would work for them. What sort of a law is this that the government that was given 62 out of 70 seats by the people at one instance and 66 in another has no power but the LG does?” “I would like to tell them that 300 farmers were martyred. Even if I lose my life in this protest, I’m not scared of your punishments. It’s the responsibility of each citizen and patriot who claims to love India to support the farmers. A person who is with the protesters is a patriot and the one against is a traitor,” said Kejriwal. The CM said that he entered politics to serve the people and the country. “In the six years that AAP has been in governance in Delhi, it has established schools, hospitals, provided free electricity, water, travel for women in buses and constructed roads. While AAP has been working for the development of Delhi, BJP has been trying to take away our power every 6-8 months,” he added. “I have only one dream — to make India the number one nation in the world. Delhi has transformed in five years. It was in a terrible condition, but now people are so content that last time they gave AAP 66 seats and this time 62. I have transformed Delhi and I will not die before seeing India as the world’s number one country,” Kejriwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-being-punished-for-backing-farmers/articleshow/81902083.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The wedding was held at a hall near Kala Talao. The attendants at the venue were found without masks and were not maintaining social distancing either. Sources said that after a video of the wedding went viral, Mahatma Phule police booked three persons including Vayle, his relative Suresh Mahatre and hall manager, Ramesh Singh, under Indian Penal Code sections 188 (disobedience of order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 and 270 (negligent and malignant act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) and under different sections of the Disaster Management Act. Singh was arrested and later released on bail. The video also triggered backlash against Vayle on social media with several citizens demanding stricter action against the Shiv Sena leader. “Is the law meant only for the common public,” commented one social media user, while another said, “Due to such politicians, Covid-19 cases are increasing, and due to these people, common people will have to suffer. Is chief minister Uddhav Thackeray going to take any action against his own party’s leader?” In a similar incident reported in Kalyan last month, hundreds of people had attended the wedding of a Shiv Sena leader’s relative. Kalyan-Dombivli is the second worst affected area in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) after Mumbai. For the second day on Saturday, the twin cities recorded the highest single day Covid-19 case tally of 1,244 and a death toll of four. The total case count is 82,423, including 1,266 deaths so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-ex-sena-neta-booked-for-huge-crowd-at-daughters-wedding/articleshow/81902895.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Delhi||Some schools hike fees, parents say move unjustified||New Delhi: With the beginning of the new academic session, many guardians whose children study in private schools have started getting increased tuition fee bills. The parents are now confused if the April 2020 order of Delhi government barring schools from increasing tuition fees and collecting other charges is still in place. Laxman Public School in south Delhi has sent a notice stating that the directorate of education (DoE) has approved a 15% hike in the tuition fee. According to it, “DoE has granted this hike after rejecting our fee hike proposal for the years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The fee bill from April 2021 will be given after consideration of 15% hike in tuition fee granted by DoE. It means an increase of only Rs 677 to Rs 700 at different class levels on a monthly basis.” However, a senior official at the education department said, “The approval was given to the school in March 2020. But with the April 2020 order, the approval became ineffective. If the school is asking for increased fees on the basis of the March order, it’s illegal.” The head of the school did not respond to the call and the email from TOI. But a notice on the school website reads, “You are requested to cooperate with the school... The last time the school hiked its fee was in year 2015-2016.” The recommendations of the seventh pay commission were announced in July 2016, with effect from January 2016, “but because of shortage of funds and in absence of any fee hike, the school could not implement” the recommendations, it adds. The school managing committee in a meeting on February 26, which was attended by the district education nominee, passed a resolution to implement the hike from April 1. “Despite the school charging only the tuition fee on a monthly basis since April 2020, more than 25% parents have always been defaulters, resulting in delay of payments of salaries to the staff,” it reads. Another school in south Delhi has also increased the tuition fee by a few hundred rupees, prompting parents to question its validity. “We are also paying hefty internet charges and for gadgets like laptops for online classes,” said a parent. “When many parents are in a difficult financial position, even an increase of a few rupees is painful,” he said, adding that they hadn’t come across any DoE or high court order permitting any hike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/some-schools-hike-fees-parents-say-move-unjustified/articleshow/81920552.cms||Shradha Chettri

All the documents of children and teachers, along with the furniture of the school, were turned into ashes. Fortunately, no casualty was recorded in the incident as the school is closed for students in the wake of Covid-19. However, the school authorities are now struggling to find the details of the students. KS Rawat, Pauri DFO, confirmed that the school was gutted in the blaze. “The school is located at a distance from the forest area but the fire spread through bushes and reached the premises.” Rajendra Uniyal, one of the villagers who spotted the fire in the school and informed the administration, said, “An animal shelter home is located close to the school but with the help of villagers, the animals there were evacuated in time.” Out of all the 13 districts of Uttarakhand, Pauri is most hit in terms of devastation due to raging fires. It has already lost 340 hectares of forest area to 232 wildfire incidents. Pauri is followed by Almora which has lost 163.75 hectare forest cover, Pithoragarh (153.5), Bageshwar (128.92), Tehri (108.32) and Dehradun (102.45).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-govt-school-gutted-in-wildfire-pauri-remains-most-severely-affected/articleshow/81901372.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Pune||Pune: Hundreds of dead fish found in Indrayani river at Alandi||PUNE: A large number of dead fish were found at numerous locations along the banks of Indrayani river in Alandi over the last few days due to a drop in reduced dissolved oxygen level. The river originates in Lonavla and passes through Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) before reaching Alandi. “A thick layer of hyacinth is floating for a few kilometres on the river, making the water stagnant. Hyacinth reduces dissolved oxygen level significantly, which is hazardous for fish. Thus, we notice such instances often during summer,” said Nitin Shinde, sub-regional officer (Pune rural) of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). “Sewage water from PCMC areas as well as other towns and villages is released into the river,” said officials from the Alandi Municipal Council and MPCB. Shinde added that untreated sewage water has disturbed the river’s ecosystem. MPCB’s requests to villages and PCMC to put sewage treatment plant (STP) in place have gone in vain. “Our field officers have collected water samples from various sites for testing. The test results would reveal the contents of the river water,” Shinde said. The river is the only water source for Alandi. After treating the water at a STP, the council supplies it through taps for domestic use/purpose. “Often there is a foul smell to the river water. Many residents prefer not to use it even for domestic purposes,” said activist Vilas Kate. Sandesh Abhang, a resident of Alandi, said that people buy water for drinking purposes and those who cannot afford to buy water, go to nearby villages to fetch water from wells or handpumps. Ankush Jadhav, chief officer of the municipal council, claimed that he had brought up this issue before the district administration and urged them to install STPs in the villages located by the riverside. “We will to write to the divisional commissioner as well as respective sub-divisional offices again, requesting them to take concrete steps to address the issue,” Jadhav added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hundreds-of-dead-fish-found-in-indrayani-river-at-alandi/articleshow/81902893.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Delhi||How unsuspected flyers become drug mules||NEW DELHI: A syndicate called the “Kasaragod Network”, which uses unsuspecting individuals to smuggle drugs from India to middle-eastern countries, is currently being tracked by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). The authorities at airports in Qatar arrest 10-15 Indians with narcotics every month and a majority of such cases are linked to this network. Intelligence reports have revealed that the key members of this network are based in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kerala and Bengaluru and communicate through VoIP. The developments have resulted in NCB director general Rakesh Asthana ordering a crackdown on this syndicate. The mastermind of the Kerala module is believed to be lodged in Qatar jail. KPS Malhotra, NCB deputy director, said this module had placed narcotics in the baggage of a young Indian couple after gifting them a honeymoon package in 2019. The couple was acquitted on March 29 after Indian authorities pursued the case for two years. The syndicate operates from 6-7 airports across the country. At least 100 members of this syndicate are under NCB’s scanner, sources said. “The members are present in Wayanad (Kerala), Madikeri, Mangalore and Kodagu (Karnataka), Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Goa and Delhi,” said an official. In fact, Delhi has emerged as the major sourcing point with intelligence suggesting that hashish is stocked here after being smuggled from J&K, Nepal and Himachal Pradesh. Similarly, cocaine and other psychotropic substances are sourced from syndicates involving African mules active in west Delhi and other areas. In the case of the young couple that was jailed in Doha, NCB has arrested six key operatives till now, including Munees KP, a top member of the network. His brother, Mohsin KP, is the kingpin of the Kerala module and is believed to be in Qatar jail. Two other key members, Ashraf and KK Bro, are also lodged in Qatar jail. Ashraf is one of the top players, while Bro is a Nigerian who handles African-origin mules and their operations in India. NCB said it was in touch with Qatar authorities to get specific details about the syndicate members based there. “Indian drug traffickers use the Kasaragod Network from various airports in south and west India,” Malhotra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-unsuspected-flyers-become-drug-mules/articleshow/81902103.cms||Raj Shekhar

On Sunday, CM Thackeray summoned a special cabinet meeting to discuss measures to curb the surge in Covid-19 cases. The urgency to impose restrictions was hastened after the state reported over 57,000 new cases, the highest since the pandemic came to the state last year. After the cabinet meeting, deDy CM Ajit Pawar said: “The entire state had opposed a total lockdown, but health experts cautioned us about the increasing number of Covid cases.” While issuing new guidelines, the state has changed its tag line from ‘Mission Begin Again’ to ‘Break the Chain’. Thackeray decided to impose stricter curbs after speaking to representatives of the state task force for Covid, the medical sector, the film industry, business houses, and various political parties. So that the economy is not affected, the state allowed industrial units to remain operational without restrictions. It said workers should not be fired and contractors should take care of such workers who get infected by the coronavirus. The new guidelines said a residential building will be declared a ‘containment zone’ if more than five cases are found. Health minister Rajesh Tope said weddings could be held with 50 participants and a Rs 10,000 fine will be imposed for failure to follow norms. Only 20 people will be allowed at a funeral. Newspaper production and distribution will be allowed. While all vendors have been asked to get vaccinated, inoculation is currently on for only those in the 45-plus age group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-vaccination-to-continue-on-all-days-board-exams-to-be-held/articleshow/81906762.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

Dr Kalpana Shah was conned a day after she called on a number she got after searching online for car showroom details on March 31. The man claiming to be a sales executive told Dr Shah that he would send her details of the car through email and asked her to call back whenever she wanted to book the car. However, the next day he called Dr Shah again from another number asking her to book the car online so that she can get the delivery within a week. She told the man that she will prefer to wait till her accountant arrives as she was not familiar with the online process. But the accused insisted her on downloading two applications on her mobile phone through which it would be easy for her to book the vehicle herself. The two applications which Shah downloaded gave the cyber fraud remote access to her mobile phone. Before she could realize what was transpiring, Dr Shah received three text messages informing her about money getting debited from her bank account. Police said that an amount of Rs 1 lakh was siphoned off from Shah’s account. She called back on the number from which she had received the call, but the accused had switched off the phone by then. After receiving the transaction details from her bank, Shah lodged a complaint of cheating and under Information Technology Act on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/doctor-loses-rs-1l-in-online-car-booking/articleshow/81902095.cms||---

---||Guwahati||Amid surge, Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma says needn’t wear mask||GUWAHATI: Amid a countrywide Covid-19 surge, Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has triggered outrage and ridicule on social media by claiming that wearing a mask in public is no longer necessary “in the context of Assam as currently there is no Covid in the state”. He made the claim on Saturday during an interview with a online Hindi news portal and followed it up with a tweet on Sunday, defending what he had said. Times ViewCovid-inappropriate behaviour is a key reason behind the alarming jump in the number of cases. Taking note of this, the Centre is even launching a special campaign to raise public awareness. The very purpose of such measures is defeated when a senior state politician of the ruling party adopts a cavalier, indeed roguish, attitude towards the importance of wearing a mask. He should be immediately taken to task for such an irresponsible remark, which certainly endangers public health. “Those who are making fun of my statement on mask, must come to Assam and see how we have contained Covid-19 in comparison to the states like Delhi, Kerala and Maharashtra along with impressive recovery of our economy.We will celebrate Bihu (Assamese new year starting on April 14) also with same enthusiasm,” tweeted Sarma, who has been campaigning for BJP across the state and routinely mingling with supporters without the safety of a mask.  Asked on Saturday whether his stand on Covid protocol in the capacity of health minister wasn’t contradictory to the Centre’s directives, Sarma had said, “Why wear masks unnecessarily and create panic. When the situation demands, I will inform the people to wear masks. I have to revive the economy…how can beauty parlours function if customers wear masks? They have to survive.” Assam on Sunday reported 69 new Covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/amid-surge-assam-health-minister-says-neednt-wear-mask/articleshow/81904614.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Delhi||Vax turnout jumps to 81.5k as officials ramp up efforts||New Delhi: A huge jump in the turnout for Covid-19 vaccination was witnessed in Delhi on Monday with 81,545 people turning up to get the jab till 6pm as against 59,125 on Sunday. The jump is largely driven by people belonging to the 45-59 years of age group who have been allowed to get the Covid shot from April 1. Meanwhile, the district authorities have intensified their vaccination awareness campaigns throughout the city. Multiple teams of healthcare staffers — ASHA workers and civil defence volunteers — are visiting residential areas, including slums, to find out if the eligible people have received the jab. The teams explain to residents the process, stress upon the efficacy of the vaccine and how easy it is to get inoculated to guard themselves against novel coronavirus. The turnout has now been good across the capital, including from slum areas. The districts are also involving residents welfare associations in the awareness campaigns. At the beginning, more people from upscale and middle-class areas were coming forward, prompting the district authorities to run more awareness drives especially in unauthorised areas and slums. “The teams visit different areas and also help many in registration. In most of the cases, they explain to beneficiaries that registration is not mandatory for vaccination because walk-ins are also allowed,” said an official in East district. Now that Delhi government has permitted 24-hour vaccination, many more people from the economically weaker sections may find it easier to get the vaccine because they are busy to earn a living in the day. The 3pm-to-9pm time is earmarked for walk-in inoculation while the period before that is meant for registered vaccination. In case a registered person faces some technical issues like difference in spelling of name in the Aadhaar card, a fresh on-the-spot registration is being made and the person is allowed to get the jab. When there is a low number of registered people, the centres also allow more walk-ins provided they meet the eligibility criteria of age. According to a government report on the vaccination till 6pm on Monday, 70,935 people got the first dose, which included 46,676 people belonging to 45-59 age group and 23,266 people above 61 years. Only 546 frontline workers and 447 healthcare workers got the vaccine while 10,610 people became fully vaccinated against novel coronavirus with the second dose. “The number of turnout is likely to increase further because the vaccination is going on till 9pm,” said an official. Among 81,545 people, only three cases of minor adverse events were reported. The percentage of adverse events has substantially come down leading to an increase in confidence among people regarding the vaccine. The vaccinated people are also working as agents of publicity regarding the efficacy of the vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-turnout-jumps-to-81-5k-as-officials-ramp-up-efforts/articleshow/81920619.cms||AlokKNMishra

A case was registered in Sushant Golf City police station on Sunday after UPMSCL general manager Shoaib lodged a complaint. The UPMSCL GM said on February 8, 2021, a representative of a Panipat-based company sent a purchase order detail on UPMSCL’s letter-head along with a letter addressed to SHO Gomti Nagar, for verification. “The purchase order was signed by GM (purchase), a post which doesn’t exist in UPMSCL. The total bill for PPE kits was Rs 9.62 crore. On examining the e-mails provided by the supplier, it surfaced they were tampered and that the firm had taken part in the tender conducted by UPMSCL but was out of race in the first round itself,” he stated. As per the invoice provided by the supplier, PPE kits were supplied at CHC Gomti Nagar, Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) and at UPMSCL warehouse on Rae Bareli road. “In internal investigation, we found many discrepancies, like PPE kits are not supplied directly to any hospital and UPMSCL has no warehouse on Rae Bareli road and so the PPE kits supply invoice was fake,” he said. The accused committed the act for wrongful gain with a mala fide intention and intended to malign the image of UPMSCL. “A fraud was committed by issuing supplier a supply purchase order of PPE kits and the name of UPMSCL was used,” he said. SHO Vijyendra Yadav said the accused misused the name of UPMSCL on the purchase order and so an FIR against unidentified persons was registered on charges of punishment for cheating by personation, cheating and dishonesty, forgery of valuable security, forgery for purpose of cheating, and fraudulently or dishonestly using a genuine document.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/invoice-for-ppe-kits-of-rs-9-6cr-found-bogus-fraud-case-lodged/articleshow/81903405.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Rani Devi of Rudrapur Bail village in Chaubepur block of the district, says she has entered the poll fray with the sole objective to ensure development of her village. After filing her nomination papers for Block Development Council (BDC) member on Saturday, she told reporters, “At this age, neither I have greed for any post, nor I am here to at the behest of any political party. I have decided on my own to contest the poll for overall development of my village,” she said. “My village does not have even basic facilities like a road network, proper drains and drinking water supply. Garbage continues to pile up, mosquitoes breed in stagnant water and overflowing drains are a common sight due to lack of arrangements for proper sanitation,” she added. “Most leaders promise the moon before the elections, but never come back after winning. So, I have decided to contest the panchayat election to improve the lives of the people of my village,” she said. “If elected, I will also try to do a bit for the people of my age group,” Devi added. “We made several representations to people’s representatives and government authorities, asking them to develop our village and solve problems by providing basic civic amenities,” said Abhijeet, her grandson, who had accompanied her to the block office for filing nomination. “Since the previous BDC members failed to do anything for our village, my 81-year-old grandmother decided to file nomination to develop our village,” he added.

The footage also shows the film’s lead actress Meena Kumari in a different avatar as compared to the time of the film’s release. The 18-minute footage, titled Pakeezah: Rang Berang, includes a much younger Meena Kumari in the dance sequence of the song Inhin Logon Ne, in monochrome and differently choreographed to the version that was released in 1972. That dance sequence was one of the earliest to be shot as the clapper board reads July 16, 1956. The footage is also testament to the arduous journey of the film. The movie took nearly 16 years from the shooting floor to the premiere at Maratha Mandir, on February 4, 1972. The footage also includes a Mohammad Rafi song that was not included in the final version of the film. “The footage that we received is very interesting. A music records company released a small part of the footage, where Meena Kumari is part of the earlier shot sequence of Inhin Logon Ne, but this includes about three minutes of that. The condition of the 16mm-reel, however, has a lot to be worked on. There are scratches and the colour has considerably faded. We will try and find out ways to restore and digitize the film,” said NFAI director Prakash Magdum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nfai-discovers-footage-detailing-pakeezah-journey/articleshow/81902913.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Nagpur||With glitches continuing, calls grow to oust Promarc||Nagpur: With miseries continuing to pile up for Nagpur University students for Winter 2020 examinations, calls are growing to oust Promarc Limited, the company handling exam work. The agency has been under the scanner since the last few years over several gaffes in the pre and post examination works. Last year, it had messed up the Summer 2020 exams with inadequate preparation and poor technical support that led to crashing of its servers. Amravati University had blacklisted it when it repeated the mess with it while Gondwana University also ended its contract with it a few years ago for same reason, NU statutory members said. On Wednesday, a delegation of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) cordoned off NU Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable over various issues faced by the examinees that led them to missing the exams. They also questioned the fate of over 3,000 students who missed out on exams due to technical glitches and connectivity issues, which were reported by TOI on Wednesday. “We had earlier requested NU authorities to take precaution so that last year’s issues shouldn’t be repeated. But the same sort of problems are being faced by the students now also. NU should immediately cancel the contract with Promarc for the next session,” the ABVP said. On Tuesday, a delegation of Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) submitted a representation demanding action against the Promarc along with other exam related issues. “Students are suffering only because of the agency's mishandling. Despite repeated requests to the NU administration, they defended the company ignoring all its past blunders that led the examinees to suffer in summer and winter exams. Even on March 25, same technical glitches continued that led to cancellations of that day’s papers. NU is playing with the life of students to benefit the company,” said city president Parendra (Vicky) Patle. VC asks ABVP, BJYM to provide solution Reacting to allegations levelled by ABVP and BJYM against Promarc, VC Subhash Chaudhari asked them to provide a solution instead of complaining. “If we terminate the company's contract, who will conduct the exams? Except for the first day, we have received over 95% submissions in all exams. Those left were due to issues like slow connectivity. So, it’s unfair to blame Promarc for the issues faced by 5% students. Still, we told them to contact their principals and teacher with their grievances and we would take decisions after verifying their data.” Adding that social media wasn’t a platform to resolve such issues, the VC advised examinees to approach proper forum for all exam related issues. “The students who failed to submit their queries within stipulated one hour shouldn’t think their paper is wasted. They are getting the message as they couldn’t complete full 40 questions quota in one hour.” Earlier, BOEE director assured ABVP delegation that no student would be deprived of the examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-glitches-continuing-calls-grow-to-oust-promarc/articleshow/81902922.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||India, Qatar join hands to ward off narco challenge||NEW DELHI: The recent case of a young couple jailed in Qatar on drugs-related charges and now exonerated through efforts over two years by Union ministry of external affairs (MEA) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has led to India and Qatar initiating the process of signing an memorandum of understanding for better coordination and cooperation in crackdown on international narco cartels. The move comes in the wake of revelations that international drug traffickers have been using innocent passengers to unknowingly carry drugs in their luggage and the possibility of them being jailed. MEA and NCB are at the end stage of drafting a proposal to have a structured dialogue mechanism between the two countries on drugs-related issues, sources said. The MoU, NCB sources said, is aimed at having a faster mechanism for coordination and information sharing and appointing nodal officers for direct communication on narcotics-related issues. This will also help prove and rely on the investigations conducted in either country. Rakesh Asthana, NCB director general, is learnt to have formed a special team under deputy director (operations) KPS Malhotra in this regard. In July 2019, Oniba Kausar and her husband Shareeq were presented a honeymoon package to Qatar by a relative and requested to take along a bag of zarda (tobacco). At Doha airport, the authorities seized 4.1kg of hashish and jailed the couple for 10 years and fined them 3,00,000 Riyal each. NCB got information about the arrests from the woman’s father and began an operation to get the couple acquitted from the foreign country’s jail. “We mounted surveillance on the syndicate and conducted multiple operations, which resulted in arrests and seizures. Interrogation of the accused blew the lid off the conspiracy and proved the couple’s innocence,” said Malhotra. After collecting evidence, NCB approached the authorities in Qatar through MEA. The ministry ensured that all evidence was submitted before the judiciary in Qatar through the Indian Embassy after translating it in Arabic. “The evidence was proved by NCB through the Indian Embassy. The judiciary in Qatar then acquitted the innocent Indian citizens,” Malhotra added. During this investigation, MEA realised that there could be other innocent Indians lodged in jails in Qatar and asked NCB to explore the possibility of a proper framework through which their cases could be pursued. The idea of signing an MoU was considered with the primary objective of presenting such cases in Qatar judiciary and ensuring admissibility of evidence collected in India. “Though there are other provisions of law, including letter rogatory and mutual legal assistance treaty, this MoU will be a step ahead of both provisions. The process of information sharing and admission and sanctity of evidence will be much easier and faster,” said a senior NCB officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/india-qatar-join-hands-to-ward-off-narco-challenge/articleshow/81902139.cms||Raj Shekhar

The teams comprised of 20 senior doctors and professors from Medical College, Baroda associated with the state-run SSG Hospital and GMERS Hospital, Gotri. “Inspection of private hospitals has started. We will enforce the notification for admission of Covid-19 patients and divert others for home-based Covid care under the Sanjeevani Abhiyan,” said Dr Vinod Rao, officer on special duty for Covid-19 in Vadodara. “Those hospitals who violate the guidelines will face action under the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act,” he said. “We have decided to form a committee of expert doctors to check if patients admitted in private hospitals really required such admission or whether they have been given beds despite being asymptomatic. Such asymptomatic (patients) will be discharged and those who really require beds will be admitted in hospitals,” Patel had said after conducting a review meeting in Vadodara on Saturday.  Patel had said that it had come to light that some private hospitals were admitting patients unnecessarily. “Patients have mediclaims or their companies foot treatment bills. Hospitals keep such patients unnecessarily to inflate bills. Not all may be involved in the practice, but there are some who are doing so,” Patel had said on Saturday.  SETU, the Association of Private Hospitals of Vadodara, also issued an appeal to all its members to comply with the notification issued by the VMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/scan-of-hospitals-starts-for-unnecessary-admissions/articleshow/81901409.cms||---

All the market places will have fixed entry points from where entry pass will be given free of cost and it will be mandatory for people entering the markets to return within an hour after taking the entry pass. Those failing to return in an hour will be fined Rs 500 each. Deputy police commissioner Amol Tambe said they had already barricaded the Main Road market area for regularized entry. The road towards the Dahipool has also been barricaded, apart from the barricading at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) and City Centre Mall area. Barricades have also been put in other market places like Kalanagar in Indiranagar, Ashok Nagar in Satpur, Nashik Road market and the Pawan Nagar market. Commissioner of Police Deepak Pandey said, “The barricading is not in preparation for the lockdown. We aim to regularize the flow of people in the market places. If the rush in market places is regulated then the spread of Covid can also be controlled. However, at any point of time if we find that the rush continues to be as usual in the markets, then we will be forced to implement the system of Rs 5 as entry fee.” Considering that the barricading would hinder the flow of vehicular traffic, the police will also come out with traffic diversion plans by Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/police-in-nashik-put-up-barricades-in-marketplaces/articleshow/81900937.cms||Santosh Sonawane

A little less than 26,000 people were vaccinated on Saturday.Yogesh Sale, the district health officer said, “April-end has been set as the target for completing vaccination of over 10 lakh citizens above the age of 45 years. The vaccination drive will be held on public holidays. However, we have learnt that the health employees are complaining about working on public holidays. We will find some solution to this concern.”Sale said the state government has written to the district administration stating that the administration can hire back the personnel, who were hired during the first wave of Covid. The staff is experienced in handling Covid patients so preference can be given to them over hiring new healthcare workers.“We have the list of the experienced staff we hired last time. Once we get the approval of the government, we will issue orders for them to join. Slowly we are making all CCCs ready,” said Sale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vaccination-on-holidays-puts-strain-on-healthcare-staff/articleshow/81900922.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Malls, restaurants and theatres to shut till April 30, full lockdown on weekends||MUMBAI: The rapid spread of Covid-19 finally forced the Uddhav Thackeray government to announce lockdown-like restrictions across the state from 8pm on Monday.

So that the economy is not affected, the state allowed industrial units to remain operational without any restrictions. The government said workers should not be removed from work and contractors should take care of such workers who get infected by the coronavirus.

The jeweller lodged a complaint on Friday, stating that his photo had been morphed to tarnish his image. The 39-year-old has claimed that he had received a friend request on Instagram from a woman which he assumed was from a prospective business associate. The two also exchanged cellphone numbers. In his complaint, he has claimed that he got a message showing him in the nude with another woman. The person demanded Rs 2.5 lakh to refrain from circulating the photo to his contacts on social media. The jeweller flatly refused to pay up, said the police. “He says he blocked the account after this,” said an officer from Bandra police station. The jeweller claimed that the person had threatened to circulate the photograph to all 255 people in his contact list. “After this, the person sent the objectionable photograph to the jeweller’s wife and to a woman friend of the jeweller,” said the officer. “It has been sent at least to his wife and his school friend.” The jeweller says that he strongly suspects that the problem started after he accepted a friend request from the account ‘sinhasimran51641’. The police said they have sought details of the account to track down the internet protocol (IP) address to know from where it has been created to track the accused. A case of criminal intimidation has been registered against an unidentified person besides sections of the Information Technology Act, said the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-morphed-images-of-bandra-jeweller-sent-to-his-spouse/articleshow/81902932.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

According to the builders, the realty sector, which supports 250 different sectors, will severely be affected if a fresh lockdown is imposed. The jewellers said the focus should be on online business and pre-appointment to customers. Nashik cloth merchants also said new restrictions will affect them. “The builders have started planning for new projects after the introduction of the new unified development control promotion and regulation (DCPR). Some builders have already submitted their building plans, while others are in the process of filing the same,” said Umesh Wankhede, an office-bearer of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) Nashik and chairman of real estate committee of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MACCIA). “The builders have made commitments to customers, but the ongoing projects will be delayed if a lockdown is imposed,” said Wankhede. “Many have raised funds through loans and they will have to pay the EMIs even if a lockdown is imposed. Construction workers will also start leaving, which will add to the costs,” he said. Digvijay Kapadiya, the president of Nashik Cloth Merchants Association, said: “After the setback after the outbreak of Covid-19 last year, our businesses has revived over the past two-three months. Moreover, the wedding season is set to begin in a month. We will again lose business if the fresh lockdown is imposed.” Chetan Rajapurkar, senior member of the Nashik Jewellers Association, said that they have to spend a fixed amount on maintenance of the shops, including salaries and other expenses. “Big jewellery showrooms will also be badly affected. Instead of a lockdown, the government should look for other measures that will save the jewellers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/builders-jewellers-worry-about-biz-impact/articleshow/81900940.cms||Tushar Pawar

The organisation has granted licence to eight private firms in Telangana to manufacture indigenous masks (IS: 9473:2002; BIS specification), according to BIS Hyderabad head, KV Rao. “BIS has specifically directed manufacturers to manufacture IS:9473 (N95/FFP2) masks with two parameters including filtration efficiency and breathability,” Rao told TOI. “We are using a five-layer non-woven fabric-50 GSM for manufacturing N95 masks, which avoids 95% of viruses and germs from getting in and an aluminium nose bridge for easy breathing. All the masks are sterilised in UVC befroe tertiary packing,” said Dr Akash Chakravarthy, director of Saritha Pharmaceuticals at Sainikpuri, a BIS licencee. A proposal was being examined to manufacture resonance masks, meant for life-long usage without replacement, he added. Rao also clarified that to check FFP2 masks, BIS-recognised or empanelled private/government labs across the country, will test samples. Rao also suggested BIS licencees set up in-house testing facilities. Till December 2019, masks were used by doctors and healthcare workers. Then, people started to realise that wearing masks is mandatory to protect their life, after the first spell of Covid-19, observed 76-year-old citizen Venkata Ramana. Another resident of Jubilee Hills expressed doubts on quality of masks and which were better for health. A private hospital doctor replied that poor-quality masks would filter only 60%-80% of 0.3-micronparticles, which puts people at high risk of infection. BIS has also granted licence to a firm in Telangana to manufacture medical textiles and surgical face masks. Another firm was granted a licence to manufacture coveralls as per BIS specification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/8-t-firms-get-bis-licence-to-manufacture-masks/articleshow/81902936.cms||Sunil Mungara

While the new cases, which were around 169 cases per day on an average in February have increased to 1,082 new cases per day in March. On the contrary, the CFR of the city continued to drop further. The CFR, which was 1.28% on February 28, has now reduced to 0.96%, which is the lowest since April last year. According to Rajendra Trimbake, the acting medical superintendent of NMC, Covid is highly infectious and this is the reason the number of cases has increased significantly. “But at the same time, we have increased the number of beds to treat Covid patients. We have increased tracing of suspected Covid patients and increased testing too. Hence, recoveries of patients are also on the rise. This is the reason the CFR of the city has reduced significantly,” said Trimbake. The city had registered the first Covid case on April 6 last year and the first Covid death was reported on May 5. The city had 10 deaths and 234 cases by May 31 last year and the CFR was 4.27%. The CFR had increased to 4.81% by June 30. By July 31, the CFR reduced to 2.92% and by August 31, it was 1.92%.

The victim, Ram Singh, had lost the vision in one eye due to the disease and doctors had advised him to get his both eyes operated on as the disease was spreading to the other eye as well, said his kin, adding that Singh was worried that he would soon lose his eyesight and if he borrowed money for the surgery, he would not be able to repay with just nearly 3 bighas farm at his disposal. Rambali, a relative, told TOI, “Singh had neither a medical card nor did have the money for his surgery. He used to sit under a fig tree outside the village for hours worrying about his future without eyesight. On Sunday, he left home in the morning and was found hanging from the same tree a few hours later. The government has promised a medical card to all of us, but most of us don’t have it.” Singh is survived by five minor children, four sons and a daughter, and his wife Madhuri. His death, meanwhile, sent a shock wave across the village and locals thronged his house to mourn his death with the bereaved family. Dr Ajay Nagar, a member of the autopsy team, told TOI, “The victim was suffering from a chronic eye disease and had lost vision in the left eye. His eyes were swollen. However, the reason for his death is hanging.” Sehramau (South) police station SHO Dhananjay Singh told TOI, “Ram Singh was extremely disturbed for the past a few days because of his failing eyesight and ended his life by hanging himself from a tree using a piece of cloth. The revenue team will ensure that compensation is provided to his family under a relevant government scheme.” On Saturday, an elderly farmer had similarly ended his life in Hazara area of neighbouring Pilibhit district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/unable-to-bear-cost-of-surgery-of-his-falling-eyesight-marginal-farmer-ends-life-by-hanging/articleshow/81900950.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

They have sought the NMC to increase screening and testing of the suspected Covid patients “NMC had increased the screening and testing of suspected Covid patients across the city during the spike in cases last year. It had also involved public representatives in this drive. But that is lacking this time due to the lethargy of the civic administration,” said Sudhakar Badgujar, a senior corporator and city unit president of Shiv Sena.“If there was already a projection about the second wave of Covid, then the NMC administration should have recruited the health staff and reopened all the CCCs in the city,” said Badgujar. “Even though Cidco houses maximum cases, there is no CCC in the division,” he said. Rajendra Trimbake, medical superintendent of NMC said the Cidco division is densely populated. Moreover, a section of the city residents is not following the Covid safety protocols, he said.He said they are in the process to set up two CCC — one at Sambhaji stadium and another one at Thakkar’s dome.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cidco-division-reported-highest-number-of-cases-in-10-days/articleshow/81900947.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Nagpur||Renewal of old vehicle regn set to cost more from Oct 1||Nagpur: The ministry of road transport and highways is all set to increase the fees for the renewal of registration of old vehicles.MoRTH, which stated that it would implement the revised fees from October 1, 2021, has invited suggestions and objections.According to a MoRTH gazette notification, the renewal of registration of a two-wheeler will be Rs1,000, three-wheelers (Rs 2,500) and light motor vehicle (Rs 5,000). The renewal of registration fee for imported vehicles too will see a sharp increase. As per the notification, Rs 10,000 will be charged for two and three wheelers and Rs 40,000 for four-wheelers.Furthermore, it also proposes penalties for delays in applying for renewal of the registration certificate. An additional Rs 300 will be levied every month for the delay with respect to motorcycles and Rs 500 will be the fine for cars.The notification also includes the cost of conducting fitness tests for vehicles older than 15 years – Rs 400-500 for two-wheelers and Rs 800-1,000 for passenger vehicles. Prices for the renewal of fitness certificates have been proposed at Rs1,000 for motorcycles and Rs7,500 for cars.Cent Ind Vintage Automotive Association, Nagpur, has objected to the new proposed fees and submitted its suggestions to MoRTH and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari. “Such a coercive and deterring levy of fees as well as additional fees will only punish daily wagers, the poor, those from the lower class, the lower middle class, retired persons and automobile enthusiasts,” stated association’s secretary Anjan Chatterjee. Some vintage vehicle enthusiasts have been maintaining the older cars/bikes for generations in the best possible condition, which form a part of their family heirloom. Moreover, the present state of the economy due to the pandemic has paralysed earnings of many owners of such older automobiles, added Chatterjee. The proposed hike in fees with levies of additional fees along with the scrapping policy indicate the link between these two documents that are solely meant to discourage owners of 15-49-year-old privately owned vehicles from owning them by falsely and with malafide intentions labeling them as unsafe and polluting, the association’s letter read.Hence, the association has urged the ministry that the proposed high, inequitable, irrational and unreasonable hike in fees with levy of additional fees be done away with.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/renewal-of-old-vehicle-regn-set-to-cost-more-from-oct-1/articleshow/81916126.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

In a bid to speed up vaccinations, the health ministry has directed vaccination centres to remain open on all Sundays and public holidays during April. The response on Sunday, however, wasn’t as expected and vaccination officers waited patiently for people to show up. At GMC’s vaccination centre, just 44 people were inoculated. “Despite it being a holiday and vaccination centres functioning at their full strength, the turnout was lower than expected. Although vaccination is voluntary, we want more people to use this opportunity and get vaccinated. People, we found, require a push and need someone to mobilise them,” state immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said. He said this couldn’t be termed vaccine hesitancy but ‘foolishness’ on the part of some people, especially during this second wave. “Initially when the vaccine was new and people wanted to wait until others took it, we could term it hesitancy. Today over 7.5 crore vaccine doses have been administered in India. At this point cases and deaths are rising across the country. Do people want to get admitted in hospital for Covid? On Saturday over 90,000 cases were detected in the country, as many as we saw during the peak last year. The second wave is already here. We didn’t have the vaccine for the first wave and we waited for it. To shy away now, when the vaccine is available, is only foolishness,” he said. Borkar said the health ministry has also directed that no fresh registrations of healthcare workers and frontline workers be permitted in order to give an opportunity to people aged 45 and above to get vaccinated. “Only healthcare workers and frontline workers who have registered earlier with their respective collectors may still be able to get vaccinated. No new registrations are being permitted. These two categories were already given enough time to get vaccinated free of cost. They will have to wait for the government’s directives on this,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vaccine-centres-remain-open-on-sunday-but-receive-poor-response/articleshow/81902953.cms||---

The journey from 20 lakh cases to 30 lakh cases took just 72 days, compared to the 132 days take for the previous 10 lakh. Active cases in Maharashtra touched 4,30,503 and in Mumbai, 66,803. CM Uddhav Thackeray in a meeting with business houses said that it will be the government’s top priority to control the surge in positive cases. Civic chief I S Chahal on Sunday said 3,000 beds, including 400 ICU beds, will be added to the city’s pool of Covid beds. The bed count today stands at over 21,000. FDA minister Rajendra Shingane said that the state had begun talks with neighbouring Gujarat and Chhattisgarh to borrow medical oxygen if the need arises. Officials said the state had enough medical oxygen currently, although transporting it to certain parts of the state in a timebound manner was a challenge. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region accounted for nearly 20,000 cases, or 35% of the figure reported in Maharashtra, on Sunday. Pune district contributed to 24% of the cases. The third highest contributor was the Nagpur circle, which added 6,304 cases, with 3,111 cases coming from Nagpur city alone. Nagpur continued to be Vidarbha’s worst hit district in the second wave. Mumbai’s doubling rate dropped to 42 days with the rapid addition of cases. It may be noted that it had increased to 300 days two months ago. The addition of 222 deaths on Sunday pushed the state’s toll to 55,878. After Mumbai, which added 25 deaths, Nagpur and Nanded municipal corporation areas saw the second highest deaths with 19 fatalities each. Nashik, too, reported deaths in double digits. Of the 25 deaths in Mumbai, three victims were below 60 years of age. Mumbai’s toll has touched 11,779. State officials said that of the 222 deaths, 123 occurred in the last 48 hours and 99 occurred in previous weeks. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that nearly 52,000 tests were carried out on Sunday. He added that beds were rapidly being added to accommodate the growing number of patients. “We have asked private hospitals to increase Covid beds to May’s range. That’s when maximum beds were reserved for Covid as we were seeing a peak before cases had started to decline,” he said. Kalyan-Dombivli recorded its highest daily case count, 1,693, on Sunday. There were three deaths. The patient tally in Kalyan-Dombivli reached 84,116 and the death toll, 1,269.

The Pimpalgaon gram panchayat has decided to keep establishments closed from Wednesday to Sunday,” circle officer (revenue department) Neelkanth Ugle said. Ugle assured all the help to the gram panchayat to execute the janata curfew for the five days. Gram panchayat member Suhas More and others made the proposal with the support of traders and they passed the resolution for the janata curfew. “The number of cases is on the rise. There are about 155 cases in the village and its vicinity. Most patients in home isolation are roaming about. About 20 small villages depend on Pimpalgaon as it is a marketplace. Hence, we decided to keep the businesses closed for five days,” sarpanch Alka Bankar said. Pimpalgaon is a major marketplace for grapes, onion and other agriculture produce. All shops and establishments, including grocery stores, will remain closed. Only the medical shops, hospitals and milk centres will be allowed to function during the five days of janata curfew, the gram panchayat has decided.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 2nd wave delays partial opening of Mum-Nag E-way||MUMBAI: The partial opening of the big-ticket Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg, which connects Mumbai and Nagpur, will be delayed by three to four months due to labourers’ exodus and shortage of raw material in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions amid the second Covid wave. The 520-km Nagpur-Shirdi stretch via Aurangabad was scheduled to be opened for traffic on May 1, Maharashtra’s foundation day. The situation in Maharashtra, the most Covid-affected state in the country, is in contrast with Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s recent announcement that the pace of national highways’ construction has touched a record 37km per day in 2020-21 despite constraints posed by the pandemic. When asked about the delay in the Rs 55,000-crore project, MSRDC vice-chairman and managing director Radheshyam Mopalwar said: “We are reviewing the situation on all 16 construction packages where work was on in full swing till recently We will rework our schedule taking into account the impact of the second Covid wave on the speed of work.” A majority of the 34,000 labourers contracted for the 701km project were working on the 520-km stretch. “Owing to the delay in commissioning safety and security features like ambulances, quick response teams, petrol and electric charging pumps, CCTV cameras and toll booths, the work was initially delayed by a month or two at Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Buldhana, Washim (west) and Nagpur. But the second wave has further delayed the work,” said an MSRDC official. “While labourers, who are mostly from neighbouring states, are staying away from work sites due to Covid fear, supply of raw material at various sites has also impacted with towns like Nagpur, Nashik, Jalna and Aurangabad emerging as hotspots,” said the official, adding that the workers’ exodus begun since Holi. MSRDC officials said raw material supply has been badly affected in Wardha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-2nd-wave-delays-partial-opening-of-mum-nag-e-way/articleshow/81902981.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Dehradun||Covid-19 second wave: Hoteliers in Kumaon say another season of no tourist activity will leave them bankrupt||Nainital/Almora: With Covid-19 restrictions being reinforced in Uttarakhand following the second wave of the pandemic, hoteliers across the Kumaon region have said that the bookings for April have collapsed and many of the establishments are on the verge of closure. The hoteliers say that after suffering huge losses during the peak tourist season last year, they cannot afford to go through another year of almost no tourist activity in towns like Nainital, Almora, Binsar, Ranikhet and Ramnagar. Speaking to TOI, Hari Mann, president of the hotel association of Ramnagar said that the bookings for the next few weeks are down by as much as 30-35%. “We wouldn’t be able to survive if yet another summer witnesses no tourist activity. Already many of us have taken loans from the banks but with no earnings, how are we supposed to pay back the money? The second wave and the government’s knee-jerk reactions have already worsened the situation,” said Mann. He added that even the banks are now treating hoteliers as non-priority customers, making it increasingly difficult to procure loans. Meanwhile, hoteliers in Nainital said even though they had retained most of the staff last year, this time they will have to lay them off because none of them can survive two years of sluggish business. “We have staff coming and working from across the state. Last year, we had to cut salaries but the staff was retained. However, another year of financial disrupt will bring us on the verge of bankruptcy and we may have to lay off the staff,” said Digvijay Singh Bisht, vice-president of the hotels and restaurants association of Nainital. The owners of guesthouses and homestays in Kausani and Kasar Devi villages claim that the bookings are down by 70%-80% due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. They add that many tourists who had placed bookings are now asking for a refund. Harish Joshi, hotel association secretary in Almora, said, “The state government order mandating RT-PCR negative report for tourists from 12 states has hurt our business badly. If this situation continues, many establishments would shut down.” Rahul Choubey, district tourism officer, Almora, “There are 220 hotels and 285 homestays in Almora. I understand that the restriction of carrying a mandatory Covid-19 negative report is hurting the hotel business. We hope we are able to flatten the curve of new Covid-19 cases soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-19-second-wave-hoteliers-in-kumaon-say-another-season-of-no-tourist-activity-will-leave-them-bankrupt/articleshow/81901464.cms||Prashant Jha

The base price for the land parcels will be in the range of over Rs630 to Rs570 per square feet, depending on the project, said sources. The highest rate would be fixed for the hotel project. The area already has three major residential projects — First City, Mahindra Lifespaces and Moraj Infratech. Around 700 families are living in the three complexes, said sources. It is expected there will be enough demand for yet another residential project. There were inquiries on the possibility of building a hotel in the Mihan area too, based on which it was decided to invite the bids, said a source. In view of the Covid situation, MADC’s board has also decided to freeze the rates of land available in the SEZ area, said a source. Work on the Patanjali food park project, which had stopped for more than a year, has also begun recently. “Teams of workers have been engaged for cleaning up the site,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/madc-to-offer-non-sez-land-for-star-hotel-ind-units/articleshow/81916146.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Delhi||Delhi: What’s in a name? Plenty, if it can help save a tree||NEW DELHI: Facing an uphill battle in ensuring the survival of trees, East Delhi Municipal Corporation has come out with a unique scheme — “adopt a tree”. The civic agency is seeking approval from interested residents and inscribing their names on tree guards of newly-planted saplings in parks or roads. The person whose name is mentioned on the tree guard will be responsible for watering and taking care of the tree. As an experiment, the civic agency started the scheme in New Kondli last year. When TOI visited the area, while the upkeep of the parks was not satisfactory, most of the trees were in good condition. EDMC horticulture director Raghwendra Singh said as parks were the only open areas in dense colonies, there was no other place for children to play. As a result, he said, grass couldn’t survive in the parks. “But planting trees in parks for proper shedding was always on our agenda. Similar attempts in the past failed as the tree guards were stolen (each costs Rs 1,000) and the saplings were damaged. We finally called on the residents who volunteered to plant 30-40 saplings. We then installed tree guards and entrusted them with the responsibility of watering the plants,” he added. With staff crunch a major bane for the corporation, its maalis can’t visit all parks regularly. “However, these volunteers have ensured that the tree guards are not stolen and the plants grow properly. If the saplings don’t survive, they inform us and we replace them. We don’t expect all trees to survive, but want to promote a responsible behaviour,” Singh said. The civic agency claims to have got at least 200 trees adopted in areas like Bank Enclave, Vishwas Nagar, Jhilmil, Geeta Colony, Gandhi Nagar and Shakarpur. “The saplings were planted in parks or on road sides. Most of them managed to survive,” said an EDMC official.

We want to ensure every patient gets proper treatment. But how can it be possible with the lack of a workforce? The health services are ever-expanding, but the inflow of personnel handling the services is a concern.” “We have, therefore, appealed to the doctors, nurses, ward boys and anybody, who are now retired, to contribute voluntarily for the services in these trying times,” Bhujbal said. He said in the case of Bytco Hospital, the MRI machine and the CT scan machine are lying inoperative for lack of workforce. The authorities are looking for retired professionals, who can provide the services. The NMC are taking efforts to increase beds in the Bytco Hospital. It has increases to 1,000 beds from the existing 700, he said. In the case ofthe Civil Hospital, the administration now has 90 additional beds so that makes 200 beds now. “This is going to help the covid patients from the rural areas,” the minister said. The Civil Hospital will get 27 oxygen cylinders, each of which, was equivalent to 35 jumbo oxygen cylinders, he said.“Besides I have also spoken to state food and drug administration minister Rajendra Shingne requesting him for more oxygen tank for Nashik. He has assured the same. If that comes, we will be in a better position to provide treatment to the patients,” said Bhujbal. On food quality and cleanliness complaints at Bytco hospital, he said specific complaints reaching him will be resolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/admin-needs-more-healthcare-workers-bhujbal/articleshow/81900962.cms||Abhilash Botekar

TOI had reported in 2019 that the minister of art and culture Govind Gaude, who is also the KA chairman, was considering demolishing the open-air auditorium of the building and rebuild the entire structure. “This review was done at CCF’s expense with the hope that in the public interest, the building be restored and well looked after. It was determined that this repair work would cost a fraction of what now has been announced as the budget of Rs 55 crore,” Nondita Correa Mehrotra, CCF director, told TOI. The CCF recommended that “structural repair and waterproofing be done, especially to the amphitheatre,” and had asked faculty from IIT Madras, structural engineers who are experts in restoring reinforced concrete, to inspect KA. CCF estimated that the total structural repair works would cost approximately Rs10 crore. Goa has only one public building designed by the renowned architect Charles Correa, and CCF said that it should be kept exactly the way he designed it. They also said that they have not been consulted or involved in the work being done at KA which is commencing on Monday. “The Kala Academy is an important building, an exemplary modern public building and one of the first contemporary post-Liberation buildings in Goa. If additional auditoriums are required, could they be built as an annex so that the integrity of this unique design is not destroyed?” the CCF director said. Speaking to TOI, Gaude said that the estimate costs have been decided based on the reports of the consultants appointed to inspect the building. “We are going along with the strengthening and renovation of KA as per the reports of the GSIDC, Goa Engineering College and PWD. I am not a professional consultant in this field but what is included and not included in the estimate, I don’t know nor does CCF. The estimate prepared includes various items which the CCF will have to study,” he said. An initiative of internationally renowned architect and urban planner Charles Correa, CCF was formed some years ago to act as a catalyst for architectural urban design, planning, and community-based projects that improve the condition of human settlements in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kala-academy-repair-cost-is-fraction-of-rs-50cr-announced-by-govt/articleshow/81903001.cms||Nida Sayed

Taking advantage of this, unauthorised commercial units are producing inferior quality masks, flooding the open market and minting money. “Bureau of Indian Standards is a National Standard Body of India which granted licences to manufacture FFP2/N95 masks as per quality standardisation for minimising health hazards for the users. BIS is cautious about counterfeit brands and violators will be penalised and imprisoned,” BIS Hyderabad head and scientist-E, K V Rao said. Our role is to check the quality of the masks produced on the BIS specifications and BIS is not authorised to control unauthorised commercial units, which manufacture poor quality masks. Special teams have been formed in Telangana to raid on the licences granted to manufacturers in order to check the quality of masks, said a BIS official, replying to a query. The BIS also insisted the manufacturers in Telangana ensure the quality of FFP2 masks for minimising health hazards to the consumers. “We have imported machinery to do quality samples of manufactured masks in our own lab,” said a director of Saritha Pharma, Dr Prashant Sadanand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/counterfeit-brands-and-violators-will-be-penalised-bis-official/articleshow/81903009.cms||Sunil Mungara

Many schools and colleges, with the help of health department and NGOs, are organising various vaccine camps. Sukhwinder Kaur, principal of Government College of Girls, said she is planning to organise a camp in the campus. “Not only we have thought of organising the vaccine camp for our teaching and non teaching staff, but we also have made it mandatory for our staff to take fitness break for an hour.” According to her, the college would be organising a camp on April 7, from 9am to 2pm. “With an ID, staff can walk in and get vaccinated,” added Kaur. BBIS Raikot too had planned to organise the vaccine drive next week with the help of Raikot civil hospital, said Pawandeep Dhillon from the school. The entire staff of Guru Nanak Public School, Model Town Extension, has been fully vaccinated in compliance with Covid-19 guidelines of the state health department. Principal of the school, Mona Singh said “The school is committed to the safety of all its members.” She said twice a day, the school campus is sanitised to ensure that everyone stays safe. Teachers too are showing keen interest in getting vaccinated. “We teachers are almost like frontline workers, so we must vaccinate,” adds Pratibha, a teacher at Sacred Heart School. Sat Paul Mittal School conducted a vaccination drive in school for its staff recently on Saturday. The team of doctors from Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital and Pahwa Hospital visited the campus for this vaccine drive. Bhupinder Gogia, principal of the school, said, “If we want to return to normalcy, we should help the government bodies in successful execution of vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vaccine-drive-at-schools-colleges-to-protect-teachers-staff/articleshow/81902167.cms||Mehak Jain
---||Chennai||India’s UNHRC abstention is a nod to Lanka finding political resolution||N Sathiya MoorthyChennai: Unlike assumed by some, the Indian abstention at the recent UNHRC vote on taking forward ‘war crimes’ and other ‘accountability issues’ in neighbouring Sri Lanka was not wholly unexpected. It was a logical and practical decision, which took the total abstentions to 14 in a House of 47 voting-members, with a residual majority of 22 voting in the motion, and 11, including Sri Lanka’s backers in China and Russia, opposing it.Among the nay-sayers were Pakistan and Bangladesh, two of the four from among the eight SAARC members with voting rights this time. Like India, Nepal abstained, but New Delhi’s decision may be used to question the continued relevance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy.The resolution has directed the office of the high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) to collect evidence on war-crimes in Sri Lanka. It has also extended the mandate to cover allegations of rights violations over the past year, coinciding with the return of the war-time Rajapaksa regime, this time under President Gotabaya R. It was kind of a compromise resolution. Colombo cannot be hauled up before the International Criminal Court as it is not a signatory to the Rome Convention.Transitional justiceIndia had originally joined hands with Pakistan and China to defeat a European Union resolution in May 2009, only days after the conclusion of the ethnic war in Sri Lanka. Simultaneously, the three nations also got a parallel resolution on ‘internal investigations and political solution’ passed in the same session. However, when Sri Lanka was seen as ‘shifting the goalpost on both counts, New Delhi was constrained to vote in favour of the US-led resolution in 2012-13. In 2014, it abstained. New Delhi did not have to take a decision owing to the predecessor government in Colombo settling for ‘co-authored’ resolutions from 2015-19.The Indian abstention this time owes to specific reasons. Despite political changes at the top over the past decade, it continues to hold that only a "political solution within a united Sri Lanka, with India-facilitated 13th Amendment" as the base alone would work on the ground. Translated, the Indian position meant that the western concept of ‘transitional justice’ can only be counter-productive, alienating the Sinhala majority from the nation’s Tamils even more. More nations may take that line, at the next substantive vote in September 2023. India won’t be a voting-member at the time, as its elected, current term ends this year.The Indian abstention may force Sri Lankan stake-holders back to the negotiations table. With the government initiating measures for a new Constitution, M A Sumanthiran, spokesman of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the single-most popular political grouping of the community, has reiterated the Indian view, in a way. There is nothing to suggest that the government may be averse to the idea, whatever the final outcome, despite some hardline Sinhala views from a few cabinet ministers.Perfunctory criticismIf anyone expected Tamil Nadu to erupt over the UNHRC resolution, that too ahead of the April 6 assembly polls, that was not to be. With pan-Tamil MDMK leader Vaiko losing the war-time Lok Sabha polls of 2009, the discernible division between Dravidian political opinion and Tamil Nadu voter behaviour has become distinct.This time, too, alongside the DMK, MDMK and VCK, all allies, even the PMK partner in the ruling BJP-AIADMK poll combine, appealed and criticised New Delhi’s position at Geneva — but did not go beyond adding a paragraph in their respective election manifestos. Actor-politician Seeman, whose NTK is the only party to contest all 234 assembly seats, continued to locate his pan-Tamil sentiments in the war-time past, blaming it all on the ruling Congress-DMK combine of the time, and did not at all talk about the present, and thus the BJP and AIADMK governments.The same goes with the Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in Tamil Nadu. Despite claims that they want to go back home after three decades in India, they need guarantees for their personal safety and for sustainable incomes through medium and long terms. They were watching the UNHRC developments with interest and concern — and it stopped there, unlike in the past, when refugees from the camps, travelled in hired buses to city-centres, to join protest rallies asking India to vote against Sri Lanka.(The writer is the head, Chennai Initiative, Observer Research Foundation, a multi-disciplinary Indian public-policy think-tank)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/indias-unhrc-abstention-is-a-nod-to-lanka-finding-political-resolution/articleshow/81902169.cms||---
---||Delhi||Transport department cracks down on diesel trucks carrying C&D waste||New Delhi: Delhi government’s transport department has cracked the whip on diesel-run trucks being used in the capital to carry construction and demolition (C&D) waste, most of which are registered in neighbouring states. The environment department recently issued guidelines that only CNG-run vehicles will be allowed to carry C&D waste and a camera should be fitted in the rear portion of the vehicle. The recording of a minimum of seven days should be preserved for random checking by enforcement agencies. Also, these vehicles carrying C&D waste should be fitted with GPS to enable live monitoring. The guidelines were issued in the wake of diesel goods vehicles with national permits being used for disposal of C&D waste in Delhi, which contributes to air pollution. KK Dahiya, special commissioner (transport), said that the department has deployed its enforcement teams and on the very first day of the drive 12 vehicles were impounded on Saturday. “This is the first crackdown by our teams on diesel-run vehicles carrying C&D waste in Delhi since the notification has come,” Dahiya said, adding that out of the 12 lightweight trucks that have been impounded, there are trucks registered in neighbouring states like Rajasthan. “These trucks registered in Rajasthan have taken national permit but are operating in Delhi. This is a misuse of the national permit,” Dahiya said. He said that the guidelines were in fact drafted first by the transport department and was approved by the Delhi chief secretary after the department got to know that such vehicles are taking national permit but operating locally. “Only CNG-run transport vehicles are allowed to operate in Delhi but such trucks take national permit after getting registered at Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, etc,” he said. “These mostly lightweight and small trucks dump the C&D waste on unattended roads at night and that is an even bigger nuisance. This is also leading to environmental pollution and that is why we had proposed these measures earlier,” Dahiya said, adding that the drive will continue. He said that the department is opting for the latest technology to deal with the problem. “Now GPS will be fitted in these vehicles and these will be registered with us. Thanks to the GPS, we will know if a vehicle veers off the route,” he said, adding that the rear view camera will enable the authorities to see if a vehicle dumps the waste anywhere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/transport-department-cracks-down-on-diesel-trucks-carrying-cd-waste/articleshow/81902208.cms||Sidharatha Roy

He was speaking to reporters in Chennai on Sunday.When Islamic countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria, Iraq and Iran do not have instant triple talaq, why should it be there in a secular country like India, he asked. “The Congress and the DMK want to put the country on reverse gear. Parliament enacted a legislation after the Supreme Court said triple talaq should go as it was anti-Muslim,” he said and added that Muslim women had supported the Central legislation.Reacting to Stalin’s statement that CAA would not be implemented in Tamil Nadu if the DMK came to power, Nadda said, “CAA is a central legislation. States have no power to decide over central legislations. It (Stalin’s promise) speaks volumes about their understanding of things and wisdom. This is the effect of dynastic rule”.Replying to a query about the DMK and the Congress branding the BJP as a communal party, Nadda said, “They are the ones who are communal as they have an electoral tie up with Muslim League, a communal party”. Stalin, who did not condemn Karuppar Koottam’s attack on Lord Muruga was wielding Muruga’s vel to seek votes, he said.Responding to the DMK’s criticism of the Union and state governments for not setting up AIIMS in Madurai, he said, “I was the health minister when AIIMS was sanctioned and Rs1,100 crore was allotted for that. This hospital will come up soon”. There were issues related to land, soil testing and design of the building. Nineteen AIIMS have come up and there were many issues in their implementation, he said.He said the NDA under the leadership of the AIADMK would form the government in Tamil Nadu. Unlike the Congress, the BJP understands regional aspirations. Narendra Modi was the first Prime Minister to visit the sites of bombings in Jaffna to assuage the feelings of Lankan Tamils. Modi promised to construct houses for Lankan Tamils and Modi himself opened them. Shooting of Indian fishermen in high seas by Lankan Navy has stopped after Modi came to power. The erstwhile UPA government banned jallikattu, which is integral to Tamil culture. The DMK remained a mute spectator when former environment minister Jairam Ramesh crushed the aspirations of Tamil people. It was Modi who removed the ban on jallikattu, said Nadda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dmk-congress-taking-country-to-13thc/articleshow/81902194.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||SAD to hold protest on Monday against Cong, AAP||Ludhiana: Accusing Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of misguiding people of Punjab and being hand in glove, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will be holding a protest on Monday against both the parties. All prominent leaders and workers have been conveyed by the topmost district-level office bearers to stay present in this agitation, which will be held at Janta Nagar Chowk. The protest will be led by SAD’s Atam Nagar incharge Gurmeet Singh Kular and leaders from the youth wing as well. Kular claimed, “Both AAP and Congress are fooling people by pretending to to be ‘enemies’, but in reality both are hand in glove with each other. On the one side, AAP has been opposing the anti farm laws and projecting that the party is the well wisher of the farmers. But in Delhi, where it has its government, it has made these laws applicable. Same kind of drama is being played by the Congress. Consent was given by the Congress leaders, including chief minister Amarinder Singh, for the laws, but when Congress leaders realised that they have committed a blunder, they started propagating that Congress has been opposing the farm laws from day one.” According to Kular, Congress has been harassing people with high rates of power and new taxes on all sections of society. “It has failed miserably to govern the state. It did not even fulfil a single promise it made in its election manifesto and cheated the people of the state by coming into power on false promises. As far as AAP is concerned, it has been proven that it is Congress’s B team and both work in a way that mutually benefit them. AAP leaders, who should be in Delhi serving the people who elected them, are camping in Punjab to divert attention of people. But SAD has now decided to expose both these parties and that is why we have called for tomorrow’s protest, which is the beginning of a campaign against these anti-people and opportunist parties,” alleged Kular.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-to-hold-protest-on-monday-against-cong-aap/articleshow/81902201.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While 50 patients were moved out in the nick of time, no instance of anyone being injured was reported. “Patients’ lives were saved in the nick of time,” a fire official claimed. No BMC official was available for comment. This is the third such instance of a fire breaking out at a Covid care centre in the city in the last six months. On Sunday, at least 50 were undergoing treatment at hangar ‘F’ — the section where the fire broke out — and eventually spread to the adjacent hangar ‘G’ where another 49 had been admitted. Firefighters and security staff at the centre put out the blaze using extinguishers installed at the spot. Officials, said a short circuit in electrical wiring possibly sparked the fire. A fire official said that the fire was doused within 30 minutes with the help of firefighter Laxman Landge and private security guardRavindra Mato. Patients were rushed to hangar ‘C’, and power supply was cut off.  MLA from MulundMihir Kotecha, who is from Bharatiya Janata Party, alleged that the BMC had failed to carry out fire audits of hospitals and nursing homes before letting them admit patients. “Almost all such hospitals have fire-related issues and they are not 100% fire-compliant,” he claimed. “There must be a detailed fire audit of all Covid-19 hospitals done. It seems most Covid hospitals and centres are fire traps and, therefore, vulnerable.” Last month, Sunrise Hospital at Bhandup witnessed a blaze when over 70 patients were rescued while 11 bodies were found at the spot. It took 40 hours to put the fire out. Also, a fire broke out Apex Hospital in Mulundlast October. Two patients died while they were being shifted. A short circuit in the generator had triggered the fire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fire-at-covid-centre-in-dahisar-50-patients-shifted-in-nick-of-time/articleshow/81903948.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The incident took place in Vadgaon Kandali in Pune district on Monday. Dotted across villages that are situated in close proximity to the forests, wells constitute the support system for the sugarcane farming communities. Indispensable to these sugarcane cultivators, these wells offer a deadly fate to wild animals. One such unforeseen event was reported on Monday at Vadgoan Kandali village in Junnar, where a five-year-old male leopard had a narrow brush with death after falling into a 40-feet-deep well. The big cat’s distressed cries caught the attention of the villagers who immediately reached out to the forest department. A four-member rescue team operating out of Wildlife SOS’s leopard rescue centre in Junnar was also dispatched to the location to assist the forest officers. The rescuers immediately lowered a trap cage into the well and the leopard on sensing that this was his only chance out, climbed into it. After being lifted out of the well, the leopard was transferred to the rescue centre for medical examination. Dr Nikhil Bangar, wildlife veterinary officer, Wildlife SOS, said, “While the leopard was struggling to claw its way out of the well, he sustained minor abrasions at the nail region. We will keep the leopard under close observation while he recuperates from this stressful ordeal.” Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO, Wildlife SOS, said, “The entire exercise had to be executed quickly and with painstaking care. We are grateful to the forest department for making this rescue a success.” “The startling increasing rate of habitat encroachment has resulted in decreasing prey base, territory, and water sources for predator species like leopards that are then forced to come out into human habitation. Since these elusive cats usually prefer to move around at night, it is common for them to fall in uncovered wells,” Satyanarayan added. RFO Yogesh Ghodke said, “We suspect the leopard had fallen into the well at night while on the prowl for food. The leopard is currently under temporary observation at the Wildlife SOS centre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leopard-falls-into-40-ft-deep-well-saved/articleshow/81920925.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Speaking to the public, Bhagwat emphasised on the need for organic farming and stressed that that the day is not far when India will be the world leader. Bhagwat also announced that the RSS will encourage organic farming in the country and for this,'Bhoomi Suchitran Abhiyan' will be started from Chaitra Pratipada (April 13) on the first day of Indian New Year. Addressing the programme, he said that the 'Bhoomi Suraksha Abhiyan' is not only a national volunteer, but a campaign for the country. For this, a group has been formed by the RSS and its volunteers and the purpose of this group is to increase the fertility of the land. “People are moving towards organic farming and are stopping the use of chemicals and pesticides. Also, if we want to save nature, we must stop the use of polythene. We should make India a polythene-free country,” said Bhagwat while releasing the magazine of the RSS’s environment wing.

He said to ensure physical distancing to keep a check on the spread of the Covid 19, pitches are being marked in the grain markets restricting farmers from gathering at a single place . Sharma said every golden grain of the farmer would be procured by the district administration, though in a staggered manner. The DC said the Punjab government led by chief minister Amarinder Singh has decided to start procurement from April 10 to make elaborate arrangements in the grain markets for the farmers in view of the Covid-19 crisis. He claimed that all protocols, including masks, sanitisers and hand washing facilities for the farmers and the government employees would be strictly followed and added that a comprehensive security plan for the mandis is being formulated. District food and supply controller Sukhwinder Singh Gill said this year, we are expecting the procurement of around 9 lakh metric tonne wheat from Ludhiana grain markets and directions have been issued to all procurement agencies and their staff for making an effective mechanism of smooth procurement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-protocols-in-place-for-wheat-procurement-from-april-10/articleshow/81902193.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The decision was taken in view of the increasing demand for institutional isolation in the PMC limits. The initiative will benefit patients that don’t have a home quarantine facility. “The patients, who are asymptomatic or have minor symptoms, will be able to use these beds,” Ashish Bharati, head of PMC’s health department, said. A PMC official said majority of the citizens, who were infected, had preferred to stay at home and it was was making it difficult for the civic administration to keep an eye on them. The PMC officials said patients, who were staying at home, must not leave their houses till they complete their quarantine period of 14 day. Nearly 33,000 infected people are staying at home. The beds would be increased at the jumbo hospital on the CoEP ground, jumbo hospital at Baner, Dalvi Hospital, Sassoon hospital and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel hospital. “The PMC has been appealing patients in home quarantine to follow the norms. But, complaints have come to us that many are violating the rules for home quarantine,” a senior PMC official said, adding that demands were being made to compulsorily shift such patients in the isolation centres. So, the requirements for the bed was going to be increased. The arrangement of additional beds would also help in such cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-set-to-add-900-cots-to-isolate-those-with-ncov/articleshow/81903052.cms||---

The protest was organised under the aegis of social organisation Loktantrik Jan Morcha (LJM) and was attended by traders, academicians, members of political parties, among others.  Dr Rakam Singh, a senior management official of a local medical college, said, "The previous Congress government had promised the elevation of Roorkee from a tehsil to a district. However, the incumbent BJP has neglected our demand completely." In 2016, the then chief minister Harish Rawat announced that Ranikhet, Kotdwar, Haldwani, Kashipur and Roorkee will be made districts. "Roorkee has several prominent institutions like Indian Institute of Technology, CSIR-CBRI, National Institute of Hydrology, Irrigation Research Institute, and Bengal Engineer Group. Thus, our demand is completely genuine and we will fight for it till it is fulfilled," said Subhash Saini, LJM convenor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sit-in-protest-held-to-demand-district-status-for-roorkee/articleshow/81901504.cms||Tapan Susheel

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Don’t be picky, occupy bed wherever available, says Municipal chief||Mumbai: People should keep their hospital or room preferences aside and get admitted wherever they have been alloc-ated beds by the ward offices, BMC chief I S Chahal said on Sunday. Last week, 3,000 beds have been made operational in dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH) and dedicated Covid health centres (DCHC) and preparations are on to activate 3,000 more, including 400 ICU beds, by next week, he added. Civic officials have report-ed a worrying trend wherein people wait for beds to open in hospitals of their choice and delay treatment. Chahal said, “Citizens should occupy beds wherever available for immediate treatment...as the treatment protocol is similar everywhere. Patients are becoming critical by waiting for a hospital choice...(whereas) abundant beds are available in other hospitals.” He said the number of DCHC and DCH beds has been increased from 12,906 to 15,971. But of the 3,900-odd vacant beds currently, less than 500 are in private hospitals, while 3,388 are in public. There is a crushing demand for ICU beds, though, with occupancy of 1,900 beds rising to 92%.  He said 30 Covid Care Centres (CCC2) have been operationalised in the past week to accommodate 4,600 mildly asy-mptomatic patients. “Another 18,300 CCC2 beds are available in reserve with us,” he added. Nesco jumbo hospital will begin civil work in one of the halls to accommodate up to 1,100 patients. It already has 1,456 active beds. A dozen ICU beds are also being added to the existing 88. Further plans have been drawn up to start another 100-bed ICU that will be outsourced to a private agency, dean Dr Neelam Andrade said. At SevenHills Hospital, work has started to add 50 more ICU beds and 15 ventilators. The hospital has 272 ICU beds of which over 251 were occupied over the weekend. Dean Dr Balakrishna Adsul said 28 ICU beds will be activated in the next fortnight. In the private sector, Dr V Ravishankar, CEO of Lilavati Hospital, said they are treating patients in the triage area. Dr Gautam Bhansali, chief coordinator of private hospitals, said patients shouldn’t register in multiple hospitals as it bloats the waiting list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dont-be-picky-occupy-bed-wherever-available-says-municipal-chief/articleshow/81903956.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The thundershower struck around 7.30pm with a maximum wind speed of 45 km/hour. However, since the gust lasted less than a minute, it didn’t qualify as a squall, Met officials said. Some parts of the city were lashed by a hailstorm, but the rain didn’t last long. Weathermen said there would be little impact of the storm on the weather in Kolkata. “It will remain dry and warm over the next 72 hours. We don’t expect the mercury to plunge significantly. The maximum temperature will crawl back to 36°C-37°C and it will remain humid and uncomfortable. There is no immediate possibility of further rain or storm,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. Conditions had started turning favourable for a thunderstorm from Thursday. The scorching westerly wind that had pushed the mercury up turned weak and moisture started flowing into the region from Bay of Bengal. These two conditions combined to generate the thunderstorm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/thundershower-hits-city-but-weather-may-stay-dry/articleshow/81902303.cms||---

Two senior citizens of the home have died due to Covid-19 and all the remaining 21 have tested positive for Covid-19. Two office bearers of the trust managing the home confirmed there have been two deaths. “One senior citizen was having health problems. His family members took him to a private hospital where he tested positive and died on Friday,” they said. The old age home immediately contacted NGOs, public representatives and zilla parishad (ZP) and got RT-PCR test done for remaining 22 inmates. “Reports of all 22 senior citizens came positive at around 12noon on Saturday. Unfortunately, one more senior citizen who was sick for the last six months passed away at the old age home itself within few minutes after the reports came positive,” the office bearers said. They added that the staff had requested the senior citizen who passed away at the old age home to visit hospital but he declined. “Even family members did not turn up when contacted,” they said. Out of the 21 positive inmates, two were hospitalized on Saturday. “Nurses from ZP checked all parameters and suggested hospitalization of only two inmates. We are providing everything including medicines etc time to time and monitoring the 19 inmates at our home,” the office bearers said. Activist Kunal Mourya who coordinated with the trust and ZP said, “Tests of all inmates should have been done when first deceased developed symptoms. At least now ZP should have hospitalized all inmates. Unfortunately, 19 senior citizens are still at the home and few of them have comorbidities. If hospitalized, they can be monitored properly and get treatment,” he said. District health officer of ZP Dr Dipak Selokar and medical officer of ZP Pachgaon Primary Health Centre Dr Dongarwar did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The office bearers of the trust said, “No inmate tested positive or had any problem throughout the year. We are running the old age home on charity basis. We ensured their safety and took all precautions. Unfortunately, all contracted the disease,” they said. The ZP has reportedly declared the old age home as containment zone. The Trust had reportedly provided first dose of vaccine to the senior citizens 15 days ago though inoculation had started for started for above 60 and above 45 age group with specified comorbidities from March 1. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “After they tested positive, HR-CT of all senior citizens of the old age home should have been done immediately. Oxygen saturation level and other parameters are very late markers. Nobody must have been aware since how many days they were infected and its extent. They should be hospitalized as per results of HR-CT and other diagnosis,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-claims-2-senior-citizens-of-old-age-home-rest-21-ve/articleshow/81903065.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

There were no cases of infection in either the donors or the recipients. The team was involved in as many as 31 kidney transplants across 19 transplant centres in India. Doctors from Virinchi Hospital, Hyderabad, and Yashoda Hospital, Secunderabad, were part of the transplant team. Indian doctors successfully carried out kidney transplantation when Covid-19 cases were at their peak in the country and many experts around the world hesitated to take up the transplant fearing a high risk of infection. “There was no Covid-19 clinical presentation or diagnosis in any recipient in this study with median follow-up of 44 days,” said Dr KS Nayak, senior nephrologist, Virinchi Hospital, who was part of the transplant and research team. The result of the study was published in the science journal, Transplantation. Dr Nayak, who is also a visiting professor at the Renal Research Institute, New York, told TOI that the study had supported the feasibility and safety of kidney transplants from Covid-19 recovered living donors. The study said their approach would provide the greatest value in resource-limited, low-and middle-income countries and in countries where alternative treatment of dialysis access is limited and mortality on dialysis is higher, which becomes much higher if they become Covid-19 positive. Stating that the risk of getting coronavirus from living organ donation is low because most of the donors were asymptomatic at the time of testing and those with mild disease were symptom free for 28 days with two negative PCR tests, the researchers said it was safe to proceed with a living donation for asymptomatic individuals after following all the Covid-19 protocols. The protocols include two negative PCR tests including a negative PCR test close to donation surgery, two weeks significant social distancing and hand hygiene before surgery. The doctors also followed the guidelines of the American Society for Transplantation (AST) and The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). “Our study also shows that carefully selected kidney donors with asymptomatic and mild Covid-19 status can be managed at home with favourable outcomes like kidney transplant recipients. This supports home treatment is feasible for mild Covid-19 potential kidney donors with relevance to countries in the developing world,” said Dr Nayak, who was elected president of the International Society of Blood Purification. The study revealed that there was no nosocomial (hospital) transmission to healthcare workers or the donor-derived transmission to the recipient. Patient and graft survival was 100% respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-recovered-can-donate-organs-say-experts/articleshow/81903070.cms||Syed Akbar

The SSP said a daily routine was planned under the supervision of superintendent of police (SP) Harbir Singh Atwal for conducting checks and issuing challans. Atwal said it was necessary for the public to wear a mask, which was the only way to defeat the deadly virus. “We in Mohali are placed fifth in the state for the number of RT-PCR tests conducted under the exercise and challaning violators. The activity will continue,” Atwal added. He said the administration has constituted fresh teams to conduct checks in markets, and shopkeepers have also been warned of action if they did not direct customers to maintain social distancing and wear masks. 93% of Mohali police jabbedMohali police have achieved the milestone of vaccinating 93% of its total police force, said SP Harbir Singh Atwal. He said in Mohali, there were 2,478 police personnel, of which 2,304 have been given the first dose of Covishield. “We are seventh in the state to do so.

---||Hyderabad||Staff crunch hits Telangana Covid tests, many turned away||HYDERABAD: Hundreds of people are being turned away from Covid-19 testing centres across the state as staff crunch and additional responsibility of vaccinating thousands of people is taking its toll. At a time when novel coronavirus patients are all struggling to get beds in private hospitals, many centres in the city are urging people to turn up the next day for tests. “I went to the nearby government centre at around 1 pm. But the staff said the tests are done only till 12.30 pm,” said Ameerpet resident K Radha Raj. “Earlier the testing centres used to run from 9 am to 2 pm, but now tests are being done only till 12.30 pm. Anyone who is going beyond these timings are given slots for next day. I am so worried because of the delay now,” she said. Health officials admitted there was a staff crunch to handle the rush along with the vaccination and immunisation drive for children. The city has 89 urban primary health centres, with nine of them working round the clock. Each centre has only one medical officer and the vaccination process requires two nurses and supporting staff. So, the ANM and ASHA workers are handling the Covid- 19 tests, but still the required numbers of carrying out 1,00,000 daily tests are not being met. Telangana is carrying out 50,000 tests on an average now and sources said ever since Telangana entered the second wave, the number of people coming for vaccines has also increased, making the task to test more people, difficult. “Before the vaccination drive picked up at each centre, there would be queues for 100 daily tests and staff are able to do 60 tests daily. In a few centres, local staff are seeking additional staff from government officials to manage the situation,” a top source said. Another reason for the state to fall behind the target of one lakh tests daily has been blamed on lack of infrastructure to conduct RT-PCR tests as prescribed by the Centre in the new guidelines. According to the new guidelines, the state must conduct 70% of the samples with the RT-PCR method, but the state is heavily dependent on rapid antigen tests. Centre had given guidelines to test 25 first contacts for each tested case with the RT-PCR method. While the state is pondering how to increase contact tracing and testing, the rush also had an impact on the ongoing vaccination drive. “I booked a slot for Sunday in a private hospital, and when I landed there this morning, I was told the vaccination drive was not happening on weekends. I even got a text message asking me to go and take the jab. Now I have taken another slot on April 6,” said Indranil Banerjee, a resident of Tarnaka. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Sunday called health minister Eatala Rajender and expressed concern over the growing number of Covid- 19 cases in the state. The Governor, who is currently in Puducherry, was apprised of various measures being taken for containment of the virus and treatment by the minister.

According to the district administration, medical officer Sagar Dobariya, Dr Praful Thummar and lab technician Deepti Ruparelia were terminated with immediate effect. The health centre team was tasked with identifying Covid suspects from 13 villages falling under its jurisdiction and sending samples for testing to the Rajkot civil hospital.

District development officer, Rajkot, A R Ranavasiya told TOI, “A team which verified with beneficiaries found out that their samples had never been taken. In-charge chief medical officer along with a team also heard the trio on Sunday and found that prima facie they were involved in sending fake samples.” Ranavasiya further said that investigation will continue and the authorities may also consider filing a criminal complaint against the accused trio. According to primary investigation, the three employees had sent nearly 1,300 such fake samples.

This comes a day after main accused Lakhan was shot and injured in a police encounter after he tried to flee custody. Three accused in the case – Lakhan, Vikas and Rohit – have been arrested while another accomplice Robin is still at large, superintendent of police (rural) Keshav Kumar said. In a disciplinary action, Sardhana SHO Brijesh Singh and sub-inspector KK Maurya were suspended on charges of dereliction of duty.Lakhan and his three friends are among four accused in the gang-rape of the girl who studied at a tuition he went to. On Thursday evening, the girl had managed to get home, collapsed at the gate, took Lakhan’s name and said three others she didn’t know had gang-raped her. While her family said she had been poisoned by them, police said she had poisoned herself after being raped. The autopsy report of the girl, meanwhile, was inconclusive. “Cause of death will be given after a viscera chemical analysis report,” it said. Police had earlier said a four-line suicide note had been found at the girl’s house, in which she had accused Lakhan and three friends of raping her and said she was going to kill herself.Investigating officers said the note will be sent for forensic examination to ascertain if it was actually written by her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meerut-gangrape-murder-third-accused-arrested-sho-sub-inspector-suspended/articleshow/81901519.cms||---

---||Kozhikode||Many seats in Malabar head for a photo finish||Kozhikode: As the three fronts wrapped up their campaign in the five districts of Malabar, the contest has gone down the wire in most constituencies, except CPM and IUML strongholds in Kannur and Malappuram. Many sitting seats, including some traditional strongholds of both fronts, have been pulled into a vortex of unpredictable electoral battle. The 28 seats LDF won from the 48 in five districts proved crucial for its victory in 2016 as it could decimate Congress to a naught in Kozhikode and retain dominance in CPM strongholds in Kannur. The UDF tally of 20 seats in the region mostly comprised 16 seats won by IUML, 11 of them from party strongholds in Malappuram, leaving Congress with just four seats in five districts. Muslim votes hold the key in deciding the outcome of the assembly election in north Kerala, with over 60% of the seats having significant minority votes. Since there is no discernible Muslim consolidation in favour of a particular front, akin to 2019 Parliament elections, this time has made the contests close in many seats. While LDF campaign headed by CM Pinarayi Vijayan has tried hard to cosy up to minorities by raising strident anti-CAA rhetoric and raking up Cong-BJP’s tacit electoral understanding, UDF made Rahul Gandhi visit several constituencies witnessing close contests. UDF has raked up the issue of political violence against CPM in north Malabar, especially constituencies like Uduma that was rocked by the murders in Periya and Vadakara. The expected increase in BJP votes, in many seats, could also prove decisive in deciding the chances of UDF and LDF in closely-contested seats. Kozhikode The traditionally-left leaning district, which gave LDF 11 of the 13 seats in 2016, is facing a stiff contest in most seats. UDF is hoping to wrest the Left stronghold of Vadakara through KK Rema, wife of slain RMP leader TP Chandrasekharan and win Koduvally where IUML has fielded MK Muneer. Also, LDF sitting seats of Kunnamangalam, Nadapuram and Thiruvambady are witnessing stiff contests. Meanwhile IUML’s sitting seats of Kuttiady and Kozhikode South, where party has fielded Noorbina Rasheed, is facing close fights while there is a triangular contest in Kozhikode North seat where LDF’s Thottathil Raveendran is pitted against KM Abhijith (26) of the Congress and BJP leader MT Ramesh. UDF is expected to improve its tally from the two seats in previous election. WayanadIn Wayanad, winning three seats is a matter of prestige for Congress as the district is represented by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Parliament. Kalpetta, Mananthavady and Sultan Bathery have turned into a battleground and UDF is hoping that Rahul’s campaign will give the front the final push in Kalpetta and Bathery which had witnessed internal discords and defections. Malappuram Though IUML’s stronghold is not expected to spring surprises, spirited contests are being witnessed in six seats including in four sitting seats of the LDF. UDF has gone all out to win its traditional stronghold of Nilambur by fielding Congress leader VV Prakash and social worker Firoz Kunnamparambil has worked up a spirited fight against KT Jaleel in Thavanur. Also, the contest is close in Tanur where MYL leader PK Firos is contesting against sitting MLA V Abdurahiman. Meanwhile, LDF has expanded its experiment of fielding independents with deep pockets by fielding former IUML leader and businessman KP Mohammed Musthafa against UDF’s Najeeb Kanthapuram. LDF is continuing its experiment in other seats though local body elections proved that IUML vote base is almost intact in the district. Kannur In the Left citadel, where CPM has eight sitting seats with unassailable leads of over 34,000 votes in six of them. This also includes Dharmadom where Vijayan is in the fray. Meanwhile UDF, which has three seats, is facing the heat in Azhikode where IUML MLA KM Shaji is pitted against KV Sumesh of CPM. The front also hopes to wrest Kannur through DCC president Satheesan Pacheni. UDF has worked up a fight in Koothuparamba where businessman Pottankandi Abdulla of IUML is taking on KP Mohanan of LJD. In Thalassery, the contest between CPM’s AN Shamseer and MP Aravindakshan of the Congress as BJP lacks a candidate there. KasaragodIn Manjeswaram where BJP is fielding K Surendran, the stage is being set for a consolidation of anti-BJP votes going by the decision of SDPI and other Muslim organizations to support IUML’s AKM Ashraf. Kasaragod is likely to go IUML’s way. While LDF sits pretty in Trikaripur and Kanhangad, there is a stiff fight in Uduma despite it being a traditional LDF bastion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/many-seats-in-malabar-head-for-a-photo-finish/articleshow/81902490.cms||---

After the boy didn’t return, his father, a power department employee in Noida, started looking for him in the area. Soon, the search area spread and others joined too, but there was no clue where the boy went. “He had gone out to have ice-cream with his sisters on March 31,” the father said.“It was around 10.30am. I gave them money to buy ice-cream. My daughters returned home but he didn't. After some time, I sent my daughters to look for him, but he was nowhere to be found,” he said.The child’ parents did not receive any ransom call either. “We formed two teams to look for my son. Some of us went to the bus stand and railway station and others searched the roads. We looked for him till evening. When we failed to trace him, we approached the police,” he added. Police too launched a search operation. In his attempt to find the child, the father printed several posters and put them up on every crossing and shops he knew. But on Sunday morning, a call from a Bulandshahr police station put a halt on the search operation and dashed all hopes. They had found the boy’s body, floating in a canal.“Days passed, and we did not have any information on him. On Sunday, a team from Dadri police station visited our house and asked us to come to Bulandshahr. They said the body of a child had been found in a canal there and his face resembled that of our child,” the father told TOI. Police were alerted there after locals spotted the tiny corpse stuck at the bank of the Walipura canal.Noida’s police commissioner Alok Singh said, “We suspect the role of some people associated with the family, including a tenant. There will be a breakthrough soon.”Cause of the death is likely to come out after post-mortem examination. Bulandshahr senior superintendent police (SSP) Santosh Kumar said, “Most likely the body was dumped in the canal in Dadri area. It came floating here with the current. The cause of the death will be ascertained after post-mortem examination.”Speaking to TOI, Noida’s additional commissioner of police (law and order) Love Kumar said, “CCTV cameras in the vicinity are being scanned and our teams have been looking into all possibilities.”Local police in Dadri, which was on its toes for the last four days, believes the murder was most likely fallout of an old dispute. “There is hardly any camera in the locality. We scanned footage from some cameras on the main road, took help of digital and manual surveillance, interrogated some suspicious people who were seen in the area at the time of kidnapping but could not get a breakthrough. But we are working on it,” an officer at Dadri police station said. The family, meanwhile, alleged inaction by police. “For the past four days, I was getting assurance that my child is safe and will soon be found. I only got assurance, nothing else,” the father said.Soon after the body was handed over to them, the family members and neighbours blocked a Dadri road for three hours and refused to budge until police made arrests in the case. One of the protesters alleged that the child could have been saved had the Dadri police acted promptly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/missing-noida-boy-3-found-dead-in-canal-in-bulandshahr/articleshow/81901522.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

He was 35 then. While his two friends -- the co-accused in the case -- served the term and walked out 15 years ago, Hasan’s incarceration period began last week. Now 60 years old, he was finally caught last week after evading police for 25 years, continuously changing places of his stay, names and obviously the appearance. A resident of Ghaziabad, Hasan had fled just a day before the court announced the sentence. All of them were booked in 1989 at Muzaffarnagar’s Mansoopur police station under IPC section 366 (kidnapping) and 376 (rape). During the course of the trial, they were released on bail, police said. Six years later, when the court pronounced the verdict, Hasan went missing. According to police sources, he lived in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Baghpat and other western UP districts with changed identities. And during the period, his property was also attached by police. On Friday, police finally got a tip-off about his presence in Mansoorpur area, where Hasan had come to meet an acquaintance. Station house officer of Mansoorpur police station, KP Singh said, “Hasan was produced before a court. From there he was finally taken to jail.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/runaway-rape-convict-arrested-after-25-years-in-ups-muzaffarnagar/articleshow/81901523.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Almost all private and corporate hospitals in the city are seeing an influx of patients from across the state as well as neighbouring states and the situation is likely worsen as a further surge is expected, say authorities. “Currently some issue is there with ICU beds in private hospitals. A lot of beds are available in government hospitals. We will be holding a meeting with private hospitals and will ask them to ramp up their facilities like it was during the peak. Apart from increasing bed strength, we need to be prepared as cases are going to increase further. We need support from the people in following Covid appropriate behaviour and taking the vaccine,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health, Telangana. Meanwhile, after having downscaled Covid facilities in December last year, private and corporate hospitals are yet to increase their Covid bed strength, being in a wait-and-watch mode. “We have to wait for a week or two more to see if the cases are increasing at the same rate or not, because even other emergency cases have to be met,” said Dr Bhaskar Rao, president, Telangana Super Speciality Hospitals Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/health-dept-to-tell-pvt-hosps-to-scale-up-covid-facilities/articleshow/81903075.cms||Amrita Didyala

Though the temple remains open for daily worship, restoration is going on simultaneously to attend to the damage from the rising moisture level, cracks on the walls and roof, and the broken design details. The temple management is getting the work done through its own conservation architects and engineers and they have brought in labourers from Murshidabad, who are trained in working on heritage structures. Since the temple is located on the bank of the Hooghly, it suffers from erosion and moisture retention on the floors and the walls. This results in general weakening of the massive structure that needs complete restoration after every decade. The temple’s trust members also said that the rising number of factories around it and their untreated pollutants are causing harm to its colour, thus leading to it blackening easily. Bamboo scaffolding has come up around the main temple, the Radhakrishna temple, the Natmandir and the 12 Shiva temples. Work will start by first denuding the temple of its plaster to locate the cracks and the portions where there is damp or moisture retention.  The damp will be treated and arrested, otherwise it will easily climb up the walls, weakening the structure further, said trustee, Kushal Chowdhury. Several ornate details of the temple, called pankher-kaaj, have been damaged as well. “Though we have always done the restoration ourselves, the pandemic has affected our income. So we are appealing to devotees and corporate houses to support the restoration of the temple,” said Chowdhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/repairs-underway-at-dakshineswar-temple/articleshow/81902357.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The girl’s family has also approached a consumer court seeking Rs 20 lakh as compensation. The incident happened two year ago when the girl, then two and a half years old, was taken ill and had to be hospitalized after she consumed biscuits allegedly with a dead lizard sticking to the packet. The child’s father, Ankit Tyagi of Brahmpuri area in the city, said, “I had purchased a packet of the biscuit in June 2019, from a local shop and given it to my daughter. After consuming one or two biscuits, she started vomiting and when we checked the packet, a dead lizard was found on a biscuit.” He said he had to rush his daughter to hospital, where she spent a week. Tyagi said he tried to lodge a police complaint but they sent him to the food department, which refused to register his complaint, said Tyagi. Later, he moved court. His lawyer Sohanlal Kashyap said, “Additional chief judicial magistrate (1) Prashant Kumar's court on April 1, ordered police to register a case against the company. A case is yet to be registered at the Civil Lines police station.” Responding to a letter by the victim's lawyer, the company had said on July 19, 2019, that as “per company policy, we want to physically examine the alleged complainant sample lying with you, or your client. Therefore, kindly allow us to send our representative and examine the complaint sample”. Without examination of the alleged sample, the company said, they would not be able to “comment or accept the contentions raised by you”. Tyagi said two company representatives had visited his house and were shown the biscuits and dead lizard. “They had taken my phone number but no one has contacted us since,” he added. TOI tried to contact the company officials on the phone number given on its website but the phone was found to be out of order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/court-orders-fir-against-maker-as-child-falls-ill-after-eating-biscuit-with-dead-lizard-in-packet/articleshow/81901518.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Two weeks ago, we had marked the Suryanagari locality as a containment zone and allowed only essential services there. Now, the cases in that locality have dropped to 36 from 174. A similar strategy would be adopted across the town.”On March 26, Kamble had decided to cordon off the 1sqkm Suryanagari locality, home to 1,500 families, after 114 cases were detected in a two-week span. The area was barricaded, and police personnel were posted to ensure no rules were broken.Ever since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, Baramati tehsil has recorded a total of 10,135 Covid-19 cases. Of these, 8,365 patients were discharged after recovery, while 167 succumbed. The tehsil currently has 1,603 active cases.“Deputy chief minister Pawar has also told the administration to intensify action against those found violating social distancing norms. He also said harsher restrictions would be imposed in the tehsil if the situation doesn’t improve,” Kamble said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/baramati-tehsil-to-get-more-hotspots-to-contain-spread/articleshow/81903078.cms||Sandip Dighe

He said if SAD won, Sharma would be inducted as a cabinet minister. Sukhbir made the announcement while addressing a public gathering in Zirakpur on Sunday. Sharma was the fifth candidate to be announced, as earlier SAD cleared names of Sukhbir Singh Badal from Jalalabad, Virsa Singh Valtoha from Khemkaran, Amarpal Singh Bonny from Ajnala and Gulzar Singh Ranike from Attari. Lashing out at chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Sukhbir said he has not cared to visit this assembly segment even once despite the fact that it was part of the parliamentary constituency of his wife Preneet Kaur. The SAD president said Punjabis could not expect anything from a chief minister who was not ready to leave his farmhouse to visit a constituency that was on the outskirts of Chandigarh. “Capt Amarinder has visited his office only 11 times in four years. That is why the state has gone back on all parameters and all the facilities extended by former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal have been withdrawn and sewa kendras that were established to take the government to the people have been closed down,” Sukhbir added. Stating that the chief minister was only concerned about giving clean chits to his corrupt ministers, Sukhbir said despite the fact that social welfare minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot had been indicted by his own department’s principal secretary and accused of embezzling Rs 64 crore, he was given a clean by the CM. He said Amarinder also did not take action against three Congress legislators—Madan Lal Jalalpur, Hardyal Singh Kamboj and Gurkirat Singh Kotli—who were running illegal liquor distilleries through their confidants. He said the SAD would probe all these misdeeds once it forms government in the state and also order a time-bound inquiry into misappropriation of MNREGA funds. He assured that the SAD would not allow implementation of the three agricultural laws and ensure procurement of foodgrains on MSP. He said the SAD government would also announce MSP for vegetables, fruits and milk. “Domestic power tariff will be halved and Scheduled Caste and Backward Class students will be given free education facilities,” he assured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sharma-sad-candidate-for-derabassi-sukhbir/articleshow/81902353.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: 341 test +ve in this year’s highest single-day surge||CHANDIGARH: In the past four days since April 1, as many as 1,195 cases of Covid and three deaths were reported in the city. On Sunday, 341 people tested positive—the highest single-day case surge this year. A day before, the count was 310. The positivity rate was 12.45% on Sunday, when 2,738 tests were conducted. The number of deaths, which had been on the decline since January, started rising from March 17. Last year, before the surge, the cases doubled after a month. For instance: there were 576 cases in July and August saw 996. However, this year, there were 1,126 cases in January, 813 in February and 5,160 in March. There has been a six-time rise in Covid cases from February to March. “The second surge has seen a rapid rise in the number of cases with a faster pace as compared with the last year’s peak,” said a public health expert at the PGI.  The reasons for this rapid pace are lack of any restrictions this time, non-adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and mutation in spike proteins of the virus, feel the public health experts. “It is expected that the surge will remain till April and gradually move down only if the community adopts restrictions and takes necessary precautions. Otherwise, we will never see the virus leaving us,” said the public health expert. The UT health department warned that the present wave is more infectious and virulent and could send more people to hospitals with moderate to severe disease. There are more than 100 patients in the PGI’s Covid hospital, 50 beds are fully occupied at GMH-16 and over 50 beds are occupied at GMCH-32.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/341-test-ve-in-this-yrs-highest-single-day-surge/articleshow/81902364.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Nagpur||Collector orders all oxygen to be diverted for medical use||Nagpur: The unprecedented Covid surge and oxygen supply crisis in the district has prompted collector Ravindra Thakare to instruct the region’s only liquid oxygen manufacturer, Inox Air Production Private Limited at MIDC (Butibori), to reserve its entire production for medical oxygen exclusively. In the past, liquid oxygen production was regulated in the ratio of 80% for medical and 20% for commercial use by the collector during the crisis. But, in view of the soaring oxygen requirements, the latest decision was taken by the collector following a review meeting under the district guardian minister Nitin Raut. The minister had also taken up the matter of substantial oxygen requirements in the district with the government to ensure the supply chain from Bhilai in Durg, and Gujarat remains viable. The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) minister Rajendra Shingne had earlier asked district collectors across the state to ensure sufficient stock of oxygen for the anticipated peak in April. In Nagpur, Thakare had urged for ‘oxygen audit’ by the FDA and health teams. FDA, which is now working in collaboration with the collector office and also part of the central control room, has started monitoring production, procurement and distribution of liquid oxygen at the manufacturing, refilling, air separation units. It is also keeping track of usage at private hospitals along with stock of Remdesivir and other drugs. The FDA team, under joint commissioner Mahesh Gadekar and assistant commissioner PM Ballal, too has made an appeal for ‘judicious use’ of oxygen, with a centralized helpline (0712-2562668) number created at collector office. Thakare said the decision to use 100% production of liquid oxygen for medical purpose was for the larger interest of the people and growing numbers of Covid patients whose life depends on timely and adequate oxygen supply. “We had explored various options before coming to the conclusion that we will have to shift solely medical oxygen as of now in view of the staggering requirement,” said the collector. He said the order would be reviewed from time to time. “We are also facing shortage of tankers to bring liquid oxygen from other sources,” said Thakare. In Nagpur, the only liquid oxygen manufacturing plant (Inox) produces 95 metric tonnes. Another two air separation units produce around 50 metric tonnes of medical oxygen. Inox and the two air separation units supply four re-fillers or refilling plants, from where city hospitals get around 160 metric tonnes of oxygen everyday. As per FDA data, around 90 metric tonnes of oxygen was in stock as on April 3. As per data released by collector office, city had stock of around 14,100 vials of Remdesivir stock. Meanwhile, the decision to stop production of industrial oxygen does not seem to have gone down well with industrialists, especially fabrication and engineering units. Chandrashekhar Shegaonkar, president of MIDC Industries Association (MIA), said around 300-400 units would be affected without industrial oxygen. “Out of all those affected, there are 30-40 units where work would have to immediately stop without oxygen supply, as it is a key element to cut iron plates and such materials. This would only paralyse production,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/collector-orders-all-oxygen-to-be-diverted-for-medical-use/articleshow/81902374.cms||Soumitra Bose

It’s not that the slots are booked, but the portal has some technical issues. “We encourage the beneficiaries to come for on-the-spot registration instead of waiting for their turn on the online portal. The slots are not booked the way it is reflected online,” said the director health services, UT, Dr Amandeep Kang. Most of the residents, who had been waiting for the portal to become active, are now disappointed. “I had been trying to book from April 1, but did not get a slot even for two months. The application mentioned that the slots were booked, but when I went to the nearby vaccination site, I was immediately jabbed after on-the-spot registration,” said Manjeet Singh, a beneficiary who had come to GMH-16. The UT health department also advises people to come for scheduling the appointment at any of the vaccination sites, which will be open from 9am to 3pm throughout the week. There was a direction from the Centre that on-the-spot registration will be open from 3pm. This is not valid for Chandigarh. From April 1, vaccination started for those who are 45 years of age and above and without any comorbidity. Three priority groups have already been covered, including healthcare and frontline workers, those between 45 and 59 years of age with comorbidities and those above 60 years of age. Once a beneficiary is registered, any one of the valid photo identity cards, including Aadhaar card, passport, driving licence, PAN card or even bank passbooks, are required.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana may have to borrow more to pay 30% fitment to employees||HYDERABAD: The recent announcement of 30% hike for state government employees could well force authorities to go for additional borrowing. Top sources in the government said that monthly payment of salaries and wages for three lakh employees with additional fitment will cost about Rs 934 crore. The state may be forced to cut down the capital expenditure which is meant to create assets and instead opt for loans to pay salaries. Every month, the government is already spending Rs 1,500 crore for payment of wages and salaries alone. Now the additional burden of 30% fitment will add another Rs 934 crore per month additionally. If other allowances of outsourcing and contract employees are taken into consideration, the annual additional salary and wages will be around Rs 11,211 crore. The government is already paying Rs 18,000 crore salary bill every year and the additional burden will take the bill to about Rs 30,000 crore annually. Sources say that the state is depending on overdraft for a few months where daily cash balance available with the state government is below Rs 1.5 crore for 32 days as prescribed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Though the source of income is yet to be figured, the state government presented an ambitious annual budget outlay of more than 2 lakh crore for 2020-21. But much of government generated income goes for salary and wages payment and implementation of various schemes. “The additional requirement of funds for fitment of 30% for employees cannot be done without taking loans,” said a source. The government said that Telangana is under the prescribed level of borrowing limits and new loans would not create problem, but the income generation will certainly pose problems in view of the second wave of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-may-have-to-borrow-more-to-pay-30-fitment-to-employees/articleshow/81903999.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||CM K Chandrasekhar Rao deploys lieutenants to win over caste groups in Sagar||HYDERABAD: TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has strategically deployed ministers to woo voters from their respective castes in Nagarjunasagar assembly constituency. The bypoll is on April 17, while counting of votes will be held on May 2. Animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav and Rajya Sabha MP Lingaiah Yadav are holding meetings with elders of the Yadav community and associations seeking their support for party candidate Nomula Bhagat. There are over 37,000 voters from the Yadav community alone in the constituency. Bhagat is the son of Nomula Narsimhaiah, whose death necessitated the bypoll. Bhagat also hails from the Yadav community.  But a section of the community had opposed his candidature initially stating he was a non-local. Keeping this in view, Srinivas Yadav is leaving no stone unturned to convince the Yadavs the need to vote for Bhagat. He is also meeting the voters at their door step and listing out the welfare schemes being implemented by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao-led TRS government for their welfare, including the Rs 8,000 crore sheep distribution programme. Likewise, energy minister Jagadish Reddy among others has taken upon the challenging task of convincing the Reddy community to sail with the ruling party despite the fact that Congress has fielded a Reddy, K Jana Reddy. Mincing no words, Jagadish is telling the voters that Jana Reddy would not be able to do much for the constituency as TRS would be in power up to 2023 and it is Bhagat who can do wonders for the development of the constituency as he has the blessings of KCR. Tribal welfare minister Sathyavathi Rathod is leading the campaign for the ruling party in tribal areas and gives the value addition of being a woman to TRS as against BJP candidate Ravi Naik. There are over 34,000 Lambada voters in this constituency. Excise and sports minister V Srinivas Goud is targeting the over 12,000 vote bank of Goud community. A senior TRS leader said several other ministers and heads of various caste welfare associations would hit the campaign trail soon to not only retain the seat but also further consolidate its hold in the constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-deploys-lieutenants-to-win-over-caste-groups-in-sagar/articleshow/81903080.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Mumbai||Maha tally tops 3mn with record 57k cases||Mumbai: Maharashtra’s Covid-19 tally crossed 30 lakh on Sunday with the addition of 57,074 new cases, the highest single-day rise seen so far in the pandemic. Mumbai, too, saw its highest single-day rise with 11,206 new cases in 24 hours, taking the city’s tally to 4,52,681. For the fifth day in a row, the state recorded over 200 Covid-19 deaths. If Maharashtra were a country, a caseload of 30,10,597 would place it at the tenth position among the most affected nations in the world. The state now has more cases than Germany, which till a few days ago was the tenth worst affected country with 28 lakh cases, report Sumitra Deb Roy & Sujit Mahamulkar. In just four days of April, Maharashtra has added 1.97 lakh cases and seen 950 deaths. The journey from 20 lakh cases to 3o lakh cases took just 72 days, compared to the 132 days take for the previous 10 lakh. Active cases in Maharashtra touched 4,30,503 and 66,803 in Mumbai. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a meeting with business houses said that it will be the government’s top priority to control the surge in positive cases. Civic chief I S Chahal on Sunday said 3,000 beds, including 400 ICU beds, will be added to the city’s pool of Covid beds. The bed count today stands at over 21,000. FDA minister Rajendra Shingane said that the state had begun talks with neighbouring Gujarat and Chhattisgarh to borrow medical oxygen if the need arises. Officials said the state had enough medical oxygen currently, although transporting it to certain parts of the state in a timebound manner was a challenge. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region accounted for nearly 20,000 cases, or 35% of the figure reported in Maharashtra, on Sunday. Pune district contributed to 24% of the cases. The third highest contributor was the Nagpur circle, which added 6,304 cases, with 3,111 cases coming from Nagpur city alone. Nagpur continued to be Vidarbha’s worst hit district in the second wave. Mumbai’s doubling rate dropped to 42 days with the rapid addition of cases. It may be noted that it had increased to 300 days two months ago. The addition of 222 deaths on Sunday pushed the state’s toll to 55,878. After Mumbai, which added 25 deaths, Nagpur and Nanded municipal corporation areas saw the second highest deaths with 19 fatalities each. Nashik, too, reported deaths in double digits. Of the 25 deaths in Mumbai, three victims were below 60 years of age. Mumbai’s toll has touched 11,779. State officials said that of the 222 deaths, 123 occurred in the last 48 hours and 99 occurred in previous weeks. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that nearly 52,000 tests were carried out on Sunday. He added that beds were rapidly being added to accommodate the growing number of patients. “We have asked private hospitals to increase Covid beds to May’s range. That’s when maximum beds were reserved for Covid as we were seeing a peak before cases had started to decline,” he said. Kalyan-Dombivli recorded its highest daily case count, 1,693, on Sunday. There were three deaths. The patient tally in Kalyan-Dombivli reached 84,116 and the death toll, 1,269. Thane city recorded the highest number of new patients on Sunday with 1,701 new cases. There were five deaths. Maharashtra’s recovery rate, which had once touched 95%, is down to 83%. Between 23,000 and 24,000 people are discharged every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-tally-tops-3mn-with-record-57k-cases/articleshow/81904579.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The UT engineering department is giving final touches to the about Rs 12-lakh project. Over 24 CCTV cameras have been installed at two floors of the estate office, located at the deputy commissioner office in Sector 17. Besides record rooms, these are at the working areas, entry and exit points and corridors. The cameras will not only keep a tab on hundreds of employees, but also maintain a record of visitors. “Since the estate office deals with prime commercial and residential properties of the city and building violation cases, among others, many people visit it. The round-the-clock CCTV surveillance will keep a check on activities. The project was given to the UT engineering department a few months ago and is now near completion,” said sources. Even as a case of theft of a file from estate office was reported a few days ago, sources said the project was not planned in its wake and had been in the pipeline for long.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/electronic-eye-to-keep-a-watch-on-estate-office/articleshow/81902416.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Kolkata||Kolkata celebrates Easter, prays for resurrection of better times||Kolkata: Not all is lost, the best is yet to come. This was the refrain that one heard in the Easter prayers across city churches from the early hours of Sunday as parishioners turned up for Easter services. On Easter Sunday, the third day after Jesus was crucified, it is believed that he rose from the tomb in resurrection. Christians across denominations in the city celebrated Easter as the most important day of the calendar, keeping a fast till they attended mass and then breaking bread. In the evening, they walked in a rally under the banner of United Christians of Kolkata, which saw many priests leading from the front. The rally started from Bishop’s College near Beckbagan and ended at St James Church. Bishop Paritosh Canning spoke first at 4.30am at the Church of Epiphany at Thakurpukur and then again at 8.30am at St Paul’s Cathedral. His message was one of hope and rejuvenation. “Not everything is finished, though things may look dismal at the moment. The Lord has risen in the midst of this darkness and that is the biggest sign of hope that the best is yet to come,” he said at both the churches. Archbishop Thomas D Souza held a private prayer on Easter Sunday while vicar general Dominic Gomes read mass at St Thomas Church, Middleton Row. “Jesus is alive, he has risen…what more can we ask for? We just need to be steadfast in our faith and the worst will pass,” the vicar general said. Easter stands for new life and this can be seen in nature too, since it is spring time. Most churches held several sessions of services spread over different parts of the premises to avoid large gatherings. Christ the King Church at Park Circus held three morning masses, Sacred Heart Church, Dharamtala, St Mary’s Church Ripon Street, St Joseph’s Chapel, St Anthony’s Shrine and Church of Our Lady of Vailankanni held multiple morning services as well. No evening masses were held because of the rally. After the rally converged at St James Church, archbishop Thomas D Souza spoke about the uncertainties of the present times and how the responsibility of keeping peace lies with everyone. He prayed that the elections be fair and peaceful. Among the other religious leaders were Reverend Abir Adhikari, priest of St Paul’s Cathedral, Ivan Satyavrata, senior pastor of Assembly of God Church, and Sudip Biswas, president of the Bengal Baptist Union. Adhikari spoke on behalf of Bishop Canning, who led a similar rally from Thakurpukur to the Oxford Mission grounds in Behala. Popular bakeries in the city were filled with goodies, like Easter eggs, marzipan Easter eggs, nougat Easter eggs, Easter bunnies, Easter baskets and special Easter breads. “The items were sold out and we did much better than we had expected. Last year was so depressing when people were scared to place orders and come out of homes. There has been a 100% growth in business this time. We have not only had people coming to the store, but have also developed a delivery chain in this past year. This helped us a lot in the business,” said Debra Saldanha Alexandar, owner of Saldanha’s. “It was such a relief to once again pray in church for Easter, meet and greet each other, albeit from a distance. Last year, we were in a state of shock as the lockdown was clamped on the country. This year is once again a proof of the fact that the Lord is taking care of us,” said Terence Ireland, an educator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-celebrates-easter-prays-for-resurrection-of-better-times/articleshow/81902427.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

As a result, the pendency of RT-PCR samples reached 304,220 in the state. The pendency of sample reports till Saturday was 37,000. According to data provided by the health department, since the day of the commencement of Kumbh, on April 1, Haridwar collected 10,706 new samples while around 11,240 samples were tested in the district of which 149 tested positive. On April 2, 14,528 new samples were collected while around 3,600 samples were tested. On April 3, the district collected 19,175 new samples while 1,820 samples were tested. On Sunday, the number of samples collected was 20,996 while over 26,500 samples were tested in the district which is a record of highest sample testing in one district so far. “The district is picking pace in sample collection in the last two-three days, but even then it's not testing 50,000 samples daily. As per the information, 341,304 Covid tests were done in Haridwar in the last three months. In January, 69,332 total tests were done followed by 109,284 in February and 1,62,688 in March. The target is a minimum 50,000 per day. But the average of the last three months is 3,792 tests per day. In March alone, the district tested 5,248 per day,” said Anoop Nautiyal from Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 pandemic. He added that massive scaling is needed for an almost 10 times increase in testing in Kumbh. To recall, the health department in Uttarakhand has a maximum testing capacity of only 35,000 samples per day although the high court has asked for 50,000 samples to be tested in Haridwar alone due to the ongoing Maha Kumbh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pendency-of-rt-pcr-tests-crosses-30k-mark/articleshow/81901554.cms||Ishita Mishra

GSHSEB joint director Bahadursinh Solanki, a 54-year-old resident of Gandhinagar, filed an FIR with Sector 21 police. He said, “Our office had on February 3, issued a press statement announcing the dates of Class 10 and Class 12 board exams between May 10 and May 25. On April 1, some unknown person made a press statement viral on social media in which the exam dates were mentioned to be between June 15 and June 30.” After board secretary D S Patel was asked about the change in exam dates, he issued a clarification stating that someone had forged the press statement and made it viral due to which students and parents were being misguided. In-charge examination controller B A Chaudhary also received the fake press statement through WhatsApp which was submitted before the Gandhinagar police. An officer of Sector 21 police said that the accused person had also forged the signature of an officer along with the logo of the board to misguide the students and parents and create chaos.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Sky dining project on heritage panel’s table||CHANDIGARH: The sky dining project conceived by the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism development Corporation (CITCO) has come to a halt, as UT administrator VP Singh Badnore has asked the matter be placed before the UT heritage committee for a discussion and subsequent approval. The move has come at a time when companies—running similar projects in other parts of the country—have already approached the UT administration for submission of their proposals. The project was planned in Sector 10 Leisure Valley, which is a core northern part of the city and comes under heritage category. Now, it is to be seen if the committee finds this project viable in the heritage zone or not. Besides, the 165-foot project will be visible from Madhya Marg, which falls under heritage grade-II category. The CITCO even failed to finalise the presentation and detailed plan on how this project will come up in the city and function in the area, which is situated along the art museum, art college and other key buildings. The date of the heritage committee meeting is yet to be fixed to discuss the project, but before that CITCO has to do a mental exercise to show its viability in the area. The project was envisaged with the capacity of 24 persons who can dine at one time. Earlier, some other areas were also discussed for the project, but later Leisure Valley was finalised to attract tourists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sky-dining-project-on-heritage-panels-table/articleshow/81902446.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Chandigarh||Mohali: Not jabbed, but woman, father get certificate||MOHALI: Two residents of Mohali, who were not vaccinated against Covid, got an online provisional certificate for it. This document, issued by the ministry of health and family welfare, mentions the name of the vaccinator, the time and the brand of the vaccine as well. A father-daughter duo, who lives in different houses, had registered for first dose of vaccination for April 3. But due to some issue, they could not visit the hospital. The Mohali chief medical officer (CMO) said they have been regularly facing this issue and had already apprised the United Nations Development Programme, which has developed the CoWin portal, and the ministry of health and family welfare. HK Aggarwal, a resident of Phase I, said, “My son and I got vaccinated on April 1. Thereafter, we decided to take a slot for my daughter-in-law, Sapna (46), and her father, Narinder Pal Jain (84), on April 3. For some reason, Sapna and Jain could not go to the hospital. But in the evening, messages and certificates were received on the registered mobile number that they have been successfully vaccinated at Fortis hospital.” CMO Dr Adarshpal Kaur said, “This is a problem with the unstable CoWin portal and had happened earlier as well. We are getting it checked. In all probability, this is a portal issue and nothing else. I too had faced this problem when my brother, who was registered with us for vaccination, got an autogenerated certificate though he could not go for it. The portal is creating a problem for us. In case anyone has such a problem, they can come to us with an alternative phone number and a different ID card (not the one that was used for the previous registration).” Upset with the system, the residents registered a complaint on the CoWin helpline, but nothing happened thereafter. “How strange it is that without a visit, without any payment and vaccination, they got the certificate that can unnecessarily create confusion and problems,” said Aggarwal. Sources said this was not simply a technical glitch. Recently the health secretary from the Union ministry of health and family welfare stopped new registration of the frontline and healthcare workers. The ministry was informed that some ineligible beneficiaries were registered as frontline and healthcare workers. “To replace those who cannot attend the vaccination appointment, there are ineligible beneficiaries who were being given the benefit. It is high time the government opens vaccination for all age groups,” said a public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/not-jabbed-but-woman-father-get-certificate/articleshow/81902442.cms||Shimona Kanwar

We have been trying to get more details to nab the accused at the earliest,” said an officer of cybercrime police. The accused had first made this threat more than seven months ago to force the school to postpone exams on September 9. The sender then threatened to upload morphed pictures of girl students if the school held mid-term exams. The management cancelled mid-term exams for Classes 8 to 12 in mid-September. It also filed a written complaint with the Ahmedabad cybercrime cell, which was converted into an FIR on October 3. Then, on December 6, the school received another threat email seeking cancellation of preliminary exam for Classes 10, 11, and 12 by Monday afternoon. Subsequently, the exams were cancelled. Later, the accused came up with the new demand of stopping online classes and shared links of the morphed pictures on Wednesday by hacking into a running online class.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/accused-shifting-ip-addresses-cops/articleshow/81903100.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Canvassing reaches feverish pitch in scorching summer||HYDERABAD: With less than two weeks for the bypoll to the Nagarjuna Sagar assembly constituency, political campaigning has gathered steam. Parties are targeting each other and reaching to the doorsteps of voters despite the scorching summer heat. The ruling TRS, which is seeking to retain the seat, is promising a staggering amount of development in the constituency and is reminding people how chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao showered sops on Huzurnagar constituency after the people there voted TRS to victory in 2019 bypoll. TRS ministers G Jagadish Reddy and T Srinivas Yadav are going to the extent of terming Congress contestant K Jana Reddy as an outdated candidate and that only a youngster like Nomula Bhagat (TRS candidate) can usher in development. Jagadish said no other state government is implementing as many welfare schemes and sops as the TRS government to all sections of the society. He blamed BJP for rising prices of essential commodities, petrol, diesel and gas. Congress veteran K Jana Reddy is banking on his personal charisma and the work done by him as a seven-time MLA. He said the accumulated length of BT roads laid, irrigation projects implemented for nearly 2 lakh acres, setting up of numerous electric sub-stations are more in number than what KCR has been able to deliver in Gajwel, KT Rama Rao in Sircilla, and Harish Rao in Siddipet. TPCC president and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy, former minister Mohd Ali Shabbir, Bhuvanagiri MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy among other party leaders have launched a door-to-door campaign. They are targeting the government over unfulfilled promises, including filling up of all vacancies in government sector, not giving unemployment allowance, delivery of 2-BHK houses or financial assistance for construction of houses to those having residential plot, three acres of land to Dalits, and reservations to STs and Muslims to name a few. On its part, BJP has said that every welfare scheme being implemented in Telangana has central funding, which is not being revealed by the ruling TRS. BJP state president Bandi Sanjay said that even the 2-BHK housing scheme of KCR government is getting Rs 1,700 crore central funds. BJP is also banking on tribal votes too as it has fielded Ravi Naik, an ST candidate. There are over 40,000 tribal voters in the constituency. “BJP is going to come to power in 2023, and will fulfil the aspirations of people of Telangana, which have remained unfulfilled during the past seven years of TRS rule,” Sanjay said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/canvassing-reaches-feverish-pitch-in-scorching-summer/articleshow/81903099.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Chahal punches holes in scheme to issue developers credit notes||MUMBAI: Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Chahal has punched holes in the BMC’s controversial plan to give out credit notes instead of money to contractors to construct 12,000 housing units for Project Affected Persons (PAPs). He has returned the proposal to the finance department and called for a list of measures to be put in place before the plan is implemented. Facing a massive cash crunch, the BMC had for the first time decided to go cashless for its nearly Rs 9,000-crore mega project to construct housing for PAPs. Of the total amount, around Rs 6,000 crore was to be paid through credit notes, while the rest would have been in the form of Transfer of Development Rights (TDR). The developer will be able to use these credit notes to pay municipal taxes and premiums to the BMC or even sell them to other developers. A senior civic official said Chahal has asked the finance department to integrate the credit notes with the BMC’s internal SAP software, ensuring they are in sync with the System of National Accounts. “The municipal commissioner has called for water marks on the credit notes. He has also given instructions for barcodes or QR codes on the credit notes to ensure they are not misused,” the official said. When contacted, Chahal said, “No comments. It is a work in progress.” The opposition has slammed the proposal to hand out credit notes saying instead of generating cash for the civic body, BMC will end up losing more income when developers start paying premiums using the credit notes. Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh has written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asking him to scrap the proposal. “The BMC has awarded a contract for construction of homes of a similar size and nature as the PAP units as part of its Ashray Yojana scheme. The cost is only Rs 2,000 crore for 12,000 units. This entire scheme is a Rs 9,000-crore scam and will turn out to be a white elephant for the civic body Shaikh said. As per the plan, land owners who own land parcels reserved for PAPs, or housing for the dishoused have to come forward and offer their land to the BMC. These land owners must also carry out construction for the BMC and hand it over. The BMC will then house people affected due to its various infrastructure projects like road widening, laying of drains, construction of flyovers and bridges among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-chahal-punches-holes-in-scheme-to-issue-developers-credit-notes/articleshow/81903105.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

City police chief Amitesh Kumar, who assured to take up the issue, said he will shortly review the arrangements and tighten bandobast. The night curfew and other Covid specified behaviours, like social distancing and use of masks, which are in place to break the corona chain, too seem to be weakly enforced by the cops. Vehicular and passenger movements are being mostly left unchecked. The penal cases slapped by cops on violators too have dwindled to a minimum in the last two days at police station levels.

DPCC is running a special drive against plastic waste in industrial areas and imposed an environmental damage compensation of Rs 12.2 lakh. A DPCC official said that the 16 units were found to be non-compliant with the Plastic Waste Management Rules. “A team of DPCC inspected 25 industrial units in Narela and Bawana and of these, nine industries were complying with the norms. The rest lacked plastic waste registration and valid consent to operate,” said the official, adding that some of the units were manufacturing plastic bags of less than 50 microns thickness, which is against the norms. Meanwhile, for reducing the generation of plastic waste and preparing a roadmap for recycling the plastic, a workshop on plastic recycling with all stakeholders will be conducted by the environment department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plastic-waste-norms-closure-notice-to-16-units/articleshow/81902528.cms||---

On Sunday, the vaccine drive was held across 205 sites in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and rural limits. Some 24,991 people were administered doses. Data released by the District Health Office (DHO) showed that 15,699 beneficiaries aged 45 and above were given first doses on Sunday. Another 7,890 senior citizens were also inoculated. Pune rural topped coverage again with 8,567 beneficiaries. The PCMC (with 8,401 beneficiaries) and the PMC (with 8,023 beneficiaries) were second and third. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said authorities limited the number of vaccination sites on Sunday to prepare for the big day. He said, “We have about 2.5 lakh doses in stock, enough to achieve Monday’s target of one lakh beneficiaries. We have managed to reach a high of 76,000 daily vaccinations. So with this experience, officials are now confident that we’ll hit the target on Monday.” Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner, said the civic body is aiming to hit 25,000 vaccinations on Monday — its highest till date. On Saturday, it had reached a total of 14,815 beneficiaries. He said, “We will also be arranging free ‘vaccine transport’ for slum residents. We have hired some 16 Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) buses to ferry the beneficiaries. Some private companies have also offered their services for the transport of vaccine beneficiaries from their homes to sites.” Patil added that the PCMC has placed vegetable vendors, shopkeepers, drivers, teachers and anyone coming in contact with a large number of people every day on the priority list of Covid vaccine beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-is-now-a-few-doses-away-from-vital-vaccination-milestone/articleshow/81903098.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra to get oxygen from Chhattisgarh, Gujarat if needed||MUMBAI: The state has begun talks with neighbouring Gujarat and Chhattisgarh to borrow medical oxygen if the need arises, the state Food and Drug Administration said on Sunday. Claiming that there was no shortage at present, the FDA said it has held an emergency meeting with oxygen manufacturers and told them to divert 80% of their production for medical use. FDA minister Rajendra Shingane said the state’s daily oxygen production was about 1,250 MT, of which 700 MT is being used currently. “If there is a need for more oxygen, the government will get it from Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. Talks are also on to obtain oxygen, if necessary, from states where Covid cases are lower,” the minister said, since the order was passed on April 4 to reserve 80% tankers of six important oxygen manufacturers in the state for the transport of medical oxygen. FDA officials said that while there was no shortage of oxygen at present, transporting it to far-off districts in a time-bound manner was a challenge. Shingane also met manufactures of Remdesivir to gauge the supply situation. The minister claimed manufacturers have promised to supply the drug to Maharashtra on priority. “There is no shortage currently as stocks of around 50,000 to 60,000 injections are being made available daily,” the minister said. FDA officials also urged hospitals to use Remdesivir judiciously as there was a growing need for the drug. The department said any complaints of black marketing can be lodged on 1800222365.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-to-get-oxygen-from-chhattisgarh-guj-if-needed/articleshow/81904019.cms||---

The Neuro Endocon was hosted by the Department of Neurosurgery and Spine Services, Institute of Neurosciences at AIG Hospitals. From the hands-on and live workshops to the plenary lectures and breakout sessions, the conference made for an exhaustive scientific treat for experts. “Traditional open brain and spine surgery causes a greater morbidity for the patients but is still being practiced because it offers an in-depth view of the brain. The latest endoscopic devices enable us to get the same in-depth view of the brain without causing the trauma of opening the skull,” said Dr Subodh Raju, director and head of department of neurosurgery and spine surgery. He added that these minimally-invasive approaches have transformed how tumours and other conditions are treated as one can access the brain through a small opening in the skull and other pathways like the nose and sinuses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/experts-discuss-trends-in-endoscopy/articleshow/81902547.cms||---

---||Kochi||Guessing game on all fronts in the midlands||Kochi: Though central Kerala has shown a slight tilt towards the UDF, this election will be a tightrope walk for the Congress-led front. Their worry is the erosion of their votes to the BJP-led NDA and the fallout of Kerala Congress (M). All fronts are facing a crisis of intra-party unity, candidates forced upon the cadre, and inability to reach every voter, due to Covid-19 and strict monitoring of election expenditure. Closely fought triangular contests are expected in many constituencies. The impact of a split in Kerala Congress will be visible in Kottayam, Idukki and some parts of Ernakulam. In Kottayam, the voters have generally preferred the UDF and it remains to be seen how Jose K Mani’s switch to the LDF works. The UDF is still confident of securing their fort with the support of the NSS and the Church. Big fights are expected in Pala and Poonjar. In Pala, UDF’s Mani C Kappan is hoping that the fight between the CPM and KC(M) councillors will benefit him while Jose thinks his ‘Love Jihad’ remark will help him fetch the Church support. While in Puthuppally, UDF’s Oommen Chandy expects a smooth sailing, predictions have become difficult in Ettumanoor, where former Congress leader Lathika Subhash is running as an independent. Kerala Congress bastions of Changanassery and Kaduthuruthy are witnessing a tough fight between the Jose and Joseph factions. The Joseph group is banking on traditional UDF votes, and is aided by the NSS and the Church. In Kanjirappally, the presence of NDA candidate Alphons Kannanthanam makes it interesting. Ernakulam where UDF won nine out of the 14 seats amid the LDF wave in 2016 is facing severe challenges in four of its sitting seats — Kalamassery, Ernakulam, Kunnathunad, and Perumbavur. In turn, the LDF is feeling the heat in Tripunithura, Vypeen, Kochi, and Muvattupuzha. Neither front is in the driving seat in the district with the NDA trying to make inroads. Sabarimala issue is driving the campaign in Tripunithura, which witnesses a keenly contested triangular fight. The presence of regional party Twenty20 — in eight constituencies — could spoil the fortunes of UDF and LDF. In Idukki, prestige is at stake for the Kerala Congress led by P J Joseph. In 2016, the LDF had edged the UDF by winning three of the five seats in the district. Both fronts are facing the heat with local issues like construction ban, fall in the price of crops, human-animal conflict, 2018 floods, and landslides. Kerala Congress candidates are fighting each other in Thodupuzha, the sitting seat of P J Joseph. In the Idukki constituency, Roshy Augustine and K Francis George are in a neck-and-neck race. Power minister M M Mani is also facing a tough fight in Udumbanchola. In Thrissur, the electoral prospects of LDF that had won 12 of the 13 seats last time, have been threatened by the aggressive campaigns of UDF and NDA. UDF leaders are confident of winning at least five to seven seats. The BJP camp is placing high hopes on the possibilities of winning or coming second in Thrissur, Kodungallur, Manalur, Nattika and Irinjalakuda. Hindu votes are likely to be divided among the three fronts. The Catholic Church has taken a position against the BJP and CPM, while it has remained silent on the UDF. The leaders of the other denominations of the Church haven’t declared their stance yet. The Muslim community leaders in the district are also not united on their electoral preferences. In Palakkad, a saffron surge could shake the Red citadel. Palakkad constituency has caught national attention with the candidature of Metroman E Sreedharan, contesting for the NDA. The front is determined to open its account in Palakkad and Malampuzha. Thrithala, Pattambi and Mannarkkad are also witnessing intense battles. In Ottapalam, P Sarin of the UDF is giving a tough fight to LDF’s K Premkumar.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra sets national record, over 4.6 lakh get the jab in 1 day||MUMBAI: Maharashtra created a record by administering over 4.6 lakh Covid-19 doses in a single day on Saturday, the highest so far by any state. Encouraging more people to get vaccinated, CM Uddhav Thackeray said that Maharashtra was preparing to administer vaccines 24x7 and would demand more doses from the Centre. In Mumbai, vaccination centres that stayed open for the first time on a Sunday saw a lukewarm response as merely 28,000 people turned up to take the jab. In the previous three days, the average footfall was nearly 60,000. Last week, the Centre had directed that the vaccination drive would continue all days of April. The state’s performance for Sunday would be known on Monday. Maharashtra has completed administering nearly 73.5 lakh doses, and Mumbai about 13.6 lakh doses. Civic officials said they were expecting a bigger turnout on Sunday as cases are rising. Of the 28,015 who took the jab, 21,197 were those between 45-59 years, 6,357 senior citizens, 246 healthcare workers and 215 frontliners workers. “We were open for an additional four hours, but the footfall was tepid,” said Dr Vidya Thakur, medical superintendent, Rajawadi Hospital. At least seven hospitals, including KEM and Dahisar jumbo centre, didn’t hold the drive. Dahisar jumbo centre witnessed a commotion as people reached there only to learn no vaccine would be given. Dean Dr Deepa Shriyan said the cancellation was a planned. “We had decided to use the day to augment beds in the centre as 600 of the 660 beds are occupied,” she said, adding that those registered for Sunday will be given the shot through the week or slots would be reserved next Sunday. Thackeray on Sunday said the state is preparing for a 24x7 vaccination programme. Pointing out that Maharashtra was the first to demand vaccination for all above 45 years, he added: “Now, the state will ask the Centre to allow vaccination for everyone as well as additional stock of vaccines.” (Inputs: Sujit Mahamulkar)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-sets-natl-record-over-4-6-lakh-get-the-jab-in-1-day/articleshow/81904050.cms||Sumitra Debroy

In his FIR, Anil Koshti, resident of Kubereshwar chawl in Saijpur-Bogha, stated that his wife Rekha Koshti, 60, and his three sons Vinay Koshti, 26, Rohit Koshti, 24, and Meet Koshti, 22, separated from him in 2007 and began staying in Bapunagar. When he was legally fighting a divorce case with his wife, his advocate suggested him to demand maintenance from Rekha and his three sons from a family court. Regarding this, his family members were issued a notice by a family court judge recently. On April 1, Rekha and their three sons went to Anil’s house at Saijpur-Bogha to talk on the issue. His wife and sons began arguing with him over him seeking maintenance from them. Anil told them that he was not keeping well and could not earn his livelihood so he sought the maintenance on advice of his advocate. This did not go well with his family members who began beating and abusing him. He said in the FIR that first his wife attacked him with slippers and then his elder son held him, while two of his sons beat him with pipes. After Anil fell unconscious, an unknown person called up 108 ambulance and took him to a nearby hospital where a medico-legal case was filed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-beaten-up-by-wife-three-sons/articleshow/81903109.cms||---

Reffering to the suicide committed by Sunil Naik after getting depressed that the government was not coming out with notifications to fill up jobs, Venkat Reddy appealed to the youth not to resort to the extreme step, but support CPI in exerting pressure on the government to come out with a recruitment calendar. “The TRS government has failed to provide employment opportunities to the youth. The inefficiency of the government is reflected in the fact that it is not able to fill up even the existing vacancies in various departments, leave alone creating new posts,” he said. Stating that youth like Sunil Naik were going into depression due to the wrong policies of the state government, the CPI leader said the government has not been able to fill up even 50,000 vacancies three months after the chief minister announced they would be filled up. He said over 50% of the posts in Telangana State Public Service Commission, which issues recruitment notifications, were vacant and demanded the government to take up a recruitment drive on a war footing to instill confidence among youth. Earlier in the day, Venkat Reddy escaped with minor injuries after a car in which he was travelling met with an accident in Hanamkonda on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-govt-failed-to-fill-even-vacancies-cpi/articleshow/81903110.cms||---

But the picture is not the same in Nagpur so far. In Nagpur, only 35 children below 10 years of age required hospitalization after getting infected with Covid-19 between January 1 and March 31, states data from the two tertiary care hospitals in city. Out of these 35 kids, 10 are newborns who got the infection from their mothers. Data from four government medical colleges (GMCs) and a trust-run medical college in Wardha shows a similar trend in Vidarbha. Experts said that kids may get infected with Covid-19 but their disease is not severe. “As parents are testing positive in large numbers, their kids are also getting tested as part of contact-tracing. In Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru, the number of kids testing positive is way more than the number of kids in Vidarbha so far,” said Dr Anand Thatte from GMCH Akola. “The percentage of young patients of Covid-19 is very low, right from the first wave of Covid-19 in Vidarbha. The number of newborns getting infection from their mothers is also limited in our region,” said Dr CM Bokade, head of paediatrics departnment in IGGMCH. During the first wave of Covid-19 in Vidarbha, 5,692 kids were detected as confirmed positive cases of Covid-19 between March and October 2020. Seven kids died of Covid-19 during that wave. In the present wave, no death of children under 10 years of age has been reported so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-has-affected-fewer-vidarbha-kids-than-mumbai-pune/articleshow/81902558.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Goa||Cabral asks Centre for uniform policy to tackle plastic waste||PANAJI: While Goa has been mulling a ban on plastics for some time now, environment minister Nilesh Cabral said that he has written to the central government to come out with a uniform policy across the country to pin the responsibility on product manufacturers. Cabral had earlier announced plans to fix a responsibility on product manufacturers itself for recycling the plastic component in their packaging. But, Cabral told TOI that with a very few manufacturing units based in Goa, it is difficult for the state to dictate terms. He added that he is not in favour of imposing a hasty and ill-planned ban on plastic use in Goa, without providing citizens with practical alternatives. The state environment ministry had earlier held a meeting with manufacturers, who produce product packaging like tetra packs and pet bottles. A discussion was held on how the manufacturers can put a system in place where they pay for the collection and recycling of waste. The state environment ministry has already prepared a plan as per which municipalities and panchayats are required to adopt a ban on plastic use in their bylaws and put in place a door-to-door collection system. In 2017, then CM Manohar Parrikar had first announced the government’s plans to impose a ban on use of plastic bags from the following year. In October 2019, the state government had notified a ban on use of single-use plastics in all its offices. The state was also early in imposing a ban on plastic below 40 microns in 2002 - upgraded to 50 microns by the Centre a few years back. Cabral said that with a very few manufacturing units based in Goa, it is difficult for the state to dictate terms. “We have very few manufacturers based in Goa. So I have written to the Centre to come out with a policy for all states,” He added, adding that he is not in favour of imposing a hasty and ill-planned ban on plastic use in Goa, without providing citizens with practical alternatives||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabral-asks-centre-for-uniform-policy-to-tackle-plastic-waste/articleshow/81903135.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Bootlegging queen merrily banishes people from homes||AHMEDABAD: A woman bootlegger who holds sway over Bapunagar and allegedly has 35 cops on her Facebook friends’ list has been evicting people from the area whenever she ‘un-friends’ them on a whim in real life. Terrified by her harassment and physical assaults, about 15 families have left their own homes at Mathur Master chawl since 2019. These families now live in rented accommodation. One of the victims is Salim Ansari (name changed) who had to pull out his two children from a Bapunagar school because the bootlegger, Sitara Bhadbhuja, booted him out of the area. Bhadbhuja, 38, is popularly known as Sitara Begum. She and her henchmen are often seen thrashing people and extorting money from them at the chawl, just 50 metres from the ACP’s office. The proximity of the scene of crimes to a senior cop’s office has not affected Sitara’s impunity. Another victim of Sitara’s terror is a woman. This woman and her two sons work for daily wages. The woman’s husband is paralyzed. She said when she called police in the past, only her family suffered. “In 2019, Sitara’s aides — Sarvar and Sikandar — attacked our people after we held a rally against them,” the woman said. “I rang the police control room and the cops there transferred the call to Bapunagar police. In the end, the call produced more threats from Sitara.” The woman said she has little hope that police will act against Sitara. “We, the residents of the chawl, had even given a detailed representation to the city police commissioner at the time, A K Singh,” the woman said. The woman said that she lived in her own house at the chawl till June 2020 but now has to pay Rs 3,000 per month as rent for a Rakhial home. The rent is 40% of her family’s monthly income. Another victim, a man originally from Kanpur, was driven out of his house in December 2019. He said that Sitara and her aides had started using his house as a storage facility for liquor when he went to Kanpur in June 2018. “When I approached police, they threatened to charge me with bootlegging,” he said. “Only the intervention of an MLA ensured that no false case was filed.” He said that his two children had to quit school because of Sitara. He said that he had to move to Vatva where he has been surviving on daily wages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bootlegging-queen-merrily-banishes-people-from-homes/articleshow/81903122.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Kochi||KSEB, Adani inked short-term pact: Chennithala||Idukki: Continuing his charges against the agreement between Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) and Adani Enterprises on Sunday, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala released more documents with regard to it. In a press meet at Munnar, Chennithala said that KSEB signed a short-term agreement with Adani Enterprises for purchasing power at an increased rate. He distributed copies of a short-term agreement. “Since model code of conduct is in force, KSEB issued a letter of award to Adani Enterprises on February 15 to purchase power from the company for the period of April and May. The power will be purchased at Rs 3.04 per unit. KSEB deputy chief engineer (commercial and planning wing) signed the agreement,” said Chennithala. “The power minister claimed that they do not have any agreement with Adani Enterprises. But KSEB has written a letter to power regulatory commission seeking permission to purchase power from the private company. The commission then conducted a hearing of three firms, including Adani Enterprises, and then signed the agreement with Adani,” alleged Chennithala. “As per the contract, power was to be purchased in four phases — from April 1 to 15, April 16 to 30, May 1 to 15 and May 16 to 31. KSEB already received power from Adani Enterprises at Rs 3.04 per unit,” he said. Meanwhile, power minister M M Mani rejected the allegations against the KSEB contract with Adani Enterprises. “The opposition leader said that KSEB bought wind energy power at Rs 2.80 and 2.83 per unit, supposed to be high prices. But Congress-ruling Rajasthan is paying Rs 4.29 for solar power and Rs 5.02 for wind energy per unit. Chennithala should ask high command to solve the issue in Congress-ruling Rajasthan,” said Mani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kseb-adani-inked-short-term-pact-chennithala/articleshow/81902567.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It is the first visit by Rawat to Kochi after assuming charge as the CDS. He landed at the Navy airport in a special Indian Air Force flight on Saturday evening. On Sunday, he visited the Cochin Shipyard Ltd (CSL) where the indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC-1) is under construction. Rawat reviewed the project and naval personnel and senior officials of the shipyard briefed him on the progress of the work of IAC. Rawat also reviewed the training infrastructure at SNC, which is the Training Command of the Indian Navy. CDS also visited various professional training schools and witnessed the Damage Control Training Facility at naval base, Kochi. He held meeting with Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, SNC, Vice Admiral A K Chawla and senior naval officers. The CDS was apprised of the environmental initiatives undertaken by the SNC. These include the Miyawaki forest and the cleaning of Venduruthy Channel. After the success of the previous Miyawaki forestation drive near Navy Children School at Naval Base, the SNC has last month launched another afforestation drive employing the Miyawaki model inside the residential complex of Katari Bagh, with special emphasis on medicinal and spice plants. Rawat visited the area. Amid his busy official schedule, Rawat also found time to visit the Sree Krishna Temple at Guruvayur on Saturday evening.

Complainant Rutvika Kaushambi, a 21-year-old resident of Sanghmitra society, told police that the incident took place when she was sitting in the verandah of her house with her father-in-law Anandpriya, husband Naman, brother-in-law Abhishek, and mother-in-law Daksha. She saw three men screaming, and roaming in the area with swords and iron rods in their hands. “When they came closer to Kaushambis’ house, Anandpriya stopped them and asked them not to scream. However, they became more aggressive and began abusing Anandpriya. When Anandpriya objected to this, they attacked him with swords and iron rods,” the complaint stated. Rutvika tried to rescue Anandpriya but the three miscreants allegedly attacked her also. “Meanwhile, other members of the family also attempted to stop the three, but they continued to thrash Anandpriya and Rutvika. Anandpriya’s cousin Prince, who lives in the neighbourhood, also rushed there and got attacked by the accused. All three victims suffered serious injuries in the attack,” the complaint further stated. Other residents of the society called up the police. A team of Satellite police reached there but the accused had fled by then. The accused were later identified as Krishna Patil, Hiren Solanki and Vishal Marathi who were charged with causing grievous hurt, criminal intimidation and uttering of abusive words.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sword-attack-on-family-in-satellite/articleshow/81903132.cms||---

Catering to around 3 lakh to 4 lakh people, the health centre at the mosque has treated over 35,000 patients free of cost since December, and now sees 300 to 350 patients per day. The health centre is run by the NGO Helping Hand Foundation (HHF). With the absence of Basti Dawakhanas and primary health centre in the area, a survey found that post floods, the residents of these slums had inadequate access to basic primary healthcare services. Post floods, many had lost their houses and even jobs that worsened the socio-economic condition of the people in that area, and this had a debilitating impact on the health of many families. “In view of the increasing demand for good quality primary healthcare services, we have also opened up a night clinic which is now catering to 100-150 patients from 6 to 9 pm daily,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari of HHF. Many patients come to the centre with high blood pressure and diabetes on a daily basis. “Dental and Hijama (cupping therapy) clinics are an integral part of the health centre. Most women with gynaec issues are not only treated but also undergo Hijama for better outcomes,” said Firdaus Fatima, a physician at the centre. Given the high incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the centre is also providing counselling and screening for prevention of chronic diseases. “Ante -natal check-ups are done for pregnant women who cannot afford hospital visits and about 50 women have registered for ante-natal care,” said Asema Mumtaz, another physician at the centre. The HHF spends Rs 4 lakh per month to run the centre and has received support from Lean Foundation, USA for medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/health-centre-at-mosque-serves-ailing-flood-victims/articleshow/81902564.cms||Omar bin Taher
---||Hyderabad||Sunkishala intake well set to end summer water woes of Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: With the state deciding to build an intake well at Sunkishala in Nalgonda district, lakhs of taps in Hyderabad and peripheral areas of Greater Hyderabad will not go dry even during summer, said officials. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) has swung into action after the government allocated Rs 725 crore in the budget and floated tenders to construct the well on a sprawling 100-acre land in the shore area of Nagarjuna Sagar dam to draw Krishna water (backwaters of Sagar reservoir). “Once the tenders are finalised, we will take up civil works on the intake well by April-end. We are planning to complete the works by 2023,” HMWS&SB director (projects II) P Ravi Kumar told TOI. At present, the water board is drawing 270 million gallons a day (MGD) from Nagarjuna Sagar and supplying treated water to consumers through Krishna phases I, II and III. “We can draw another 90 MGD and preserve it at the proposed intake well to meet the water demand in future,” Ravi Kumar said. The water board proposed to use this water if all the drinking water sources are completely dried up. “We can serve Krishna water from the intake well during the summer without interruption,” said a senior official. A temporary pumping station at Puttamgandi came in handy for the water board to draw Krishna water. However, this has become an expensive proposition for the board. With irrigation and catchment area development restricting drawal of raw water if water levels at Sagar dam fall to 510 ft, the water board’s problems multiplied. “But, after constructing the new intake well, we can draw raw water even if water levels dip to 460 ft,” the official said. Water trunks at a length of nearly 15 km will be laid between the proposed intake well and existing Kodandapur water treatment plant. “Apart from this, another 130-acre land will be acquired to build an intake tunnel, pumphouse super structure, electric sub-stations and roads. The project is set to cost Rs 1,167 crore,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sunkishala-intake-well-set-to-end-summer-water-woes-of-hyd/articleshow/81902562.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘CPM should look at which way the wind is blowing’||Congress MP Shashi Tharoor tells TOI’s Rajiv G that LDF has lost its initial advantage and that UDF will coast to a comfortable if not massive victory.  Unlike in the past, Congress is under severe pressure this time. It is a do-or-die situation as the party is desperate to come back to power. Do you feel this pressure in the Congress in Kerala? I am not totally ruling out that there is no pressure for Congress. Definitely, there will be a little bit of pressure on the party. But we are not worried about surveys. It is not a representative sample is what we say about the surveys. And I am not supportive of the view that it is a do-or-die situation. Of course, it is a matter of pride that we have to win. I have toured 56-60 constituencies in the state now. I find it difficult to believe that there will be continuity in power here.  Candidate selection had caused severe resentment in the party. Do you feel that it has affected the prospects of the party in a few constituencies? Has the party succeeded in settling the differences and convincing the rank and file? There were few resentments and it is obvious in a party like Congress. By and large, the party comes together when it is to fight the election. We all say that there are groups in Congress. But after the initial resentments now what I have seen is that the entire scenario has changed from the top to the grassroots level. This a serious election and everyone has realized it. I have seen the full commitment from the leaders and our grassroots workers. Congress has made history by bringing in 55% new faces. See, initially, a few were not ready to accept the candidates in their constituencies. Now, the situation is that they went ahead in the campaigning such that they are going to create many surprises.  The chief minister appears to be very confident that the LDF is coming back to power. What might be the reason behind this? Of course, he has the right to be confident as a chief minister. He might be showing the confidence to put up a brave face before his cadres. I don’t think that he genuinely believes that he is going to come back. The CPM should stop counting the ships in the harbour and they should look at which way the wind is blowing. There is a scope for a close result. But the advantage that CPM was talking about earlier has been lost now. But now I have seen that his confidence has been coming down if you read his face. They are not at all expecting a smooth win. The momentum at our side is picking up and it has started worrying them. I am expecting not a massive but a comfortable victory for the UDF.  You have been actively involved in the election this time and the party had given you several responsibilities. Were you surprised when you were given these responsibilities? Honestly, I have been active in all the election campaigns. Even though I am not on the list of star campaigners, I have been extensively campaigning in all the elections. I have participated in several roadshows in all the 14 districts in the past elections. But it is true that I was given some responsibilities this time. They asked me to lead the manifesto consultation, which was a significant effort. In fact, this manifesto has become the main propaganda of the UDF campaign now. They also made me a member of the 10-member election management and strategy committee, in which all the nine others were very senior leaders of the party. It was not an expected decision. I hope that I have done justice to the roles I have been given.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-should-look-at-which-way-the-wind-is-blowing/articleshow/81902565.cms||Rajiv G

They were returning to their hometown, Deeg in Rajasthan, after distributing wedding cards in Haryana’s Hodal. Police said Suraj, a mechanic, was to get married on April 30. His neighbour was identified as Heera (19). Shireesh Chandra, SP, (rural), said the accident took place around 4:30 pm when the bike rider lost control over the vehicle and rammed it into a tractor heading towards Agra. Both youths died on the spot. Talking to TOI, Suraj’s friend, Rahul, who was travelling with him on another bike, said they had visited Kosi Kalan first, and after shopping and giving Suraj’s wedding dress to a tailor for stitching, they went to Hodal to invite friends for the wedding. He added that he and Suraj’s younger brother, Ajay, were on one bike and Suraj and Heera were on the other bike. “While returning, we were ahead of Suraj’s bike. After not seeing them for almost half an hour, I called on his mobile but there was no response. Then, I called Heera and someone picked up his phone and told me about their accident,” Rahul said. He said he was so shocked that he did not know how to inform their families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/weeks-before-wedding-groom-neighbour-die-in-accident-on-nh-2-in-mathura/articleshow/81901579.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Keshava Rao also condemned the decision of Ram Lal Anand College management to terminate Saibaba’s services as assistant professor while he is still in jail. “It is not correct to remove him from his job while the case is still pending in court. There are several instances when professors resumed their duties after being acquitted by court,” he said. Stating that termination of services of Saibaba amounts to violation of human rights, Keshava Rao said the case of wheel chair-bound Saibaba should be considered on humanitarian grounds. Saibaba was removed as assistant professor from Delhi University’s Ram Lal Anand College. The wheelchair-bound physically challenged (disabled) scholar-activist was sentenced to life for his alleged connections to Maoists in 2017 and has been in jail since then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/release-prof-saibaba-keshava-rao/articleshow/81902566.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Got a call from Sonu Sood’s charity? It could be a fraud||MUMBAI: Fraudsters are devising ingenious ways to cheat. Cyber criminals across the country are cheating innocents by cashing in on Bollywood actor Sonu Sood’s sense of generosity witnessed during the first peak of the pandemic. This time, the actor is blisfully unaware of the con games being played out by invoking his name. A 23-year-old from Muzaffarpur in Bihar, Ashish Kumar Singh, was arrested on Saturday by the cyber crime unit of Cyberabad police for allegedly duping a man from Telangana by promising help in actor Sonu Sood’s name. A similar case has been registered in Mumbai too where a few people were duped in the Bollywood actor’s name. In the latest case, the man from Bihar had fraudulently put up his number on social media, claiming that he was an associate of actor Sonu Sood and falsely claimed to be part of Sood’s company to help the needy, especially those affected by the pandemic. The arrested accused stated he was an ‘advisor’ of Sood’s company, Sonu Sood Corporation. The police clarified that it was a fraudulent claim made in the actor’s name. The complainant from Telangana approached the police on March 3, stating that he wanted to reach out to a few needy people in his state and had learnt that Sood was helping with such causes. He searched for Sood’s corporation’s contact details and chanced upon a number. “The fraudster who answered the call assured to help. He told the man from the southern state that Sood would donate Rs 50,000 from his kitty. But, he told the man from Telangana that he would have to pay Rs 8,300 as registration charges,” said a police officer. The accused called him up again to say that the actor would enhance the aid to Rs 3.60 lakh. “For this, a fee of Rs 60,000 was sought. The man from Telangana paid up only to realise that he had been duped,” said the officer. Sood said that he had learnt about the arrest. “People must be wary of a gang claiming to work for a charity run by me. I urge people not to entertain such online requests for donation,” Sood told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-got-a-call-from-sonu-soods-charity-it-could-be-a-fraud/articleshow/81903143.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

Caddis fly is a group of insects with acquatic larvae and are mostly found near water bodies such as tanks and canals. In some occasions, they occur in areas where an ecological imbalance has developed and are also attracted to light sources. In a video shared on social media, motorists travelling along the Rajiv Rahadari were seen struggling to drive through as a swarm of caddis flies took to the streets. According to local sources, the number of these caddis flies has been increasing in the last few days along the Kakatiya canal resulting in accidents and motorists suffering injuries. Sources attributed the increase in number of insects to the increase in water flow in the canal. “The number of caddis flies were fewer when the 4,000 cusecs of water was being released into the canal. Ever since the quantity has been increased to 6,000, the population of these caddis flies has been on the rise,” said a local.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/caddis-flies-create-havoc-near-kakatiya-canal/articleshow/81902568.cms||---

While Suhas Kulkarni was a former Maharashtra and international table tennis player, Sanjay Chakraverty was a reputed shooting coach, who mentored and guided top shooters like Olympic medalist Gagan Narang and Anjali Bhagwat. Chakraverty was a Dronacharya awardee too. Kulkarni, who succumbed to the virus after being admitted for treatment to Kaushalya Hospital in Thane, is survived by his wife, daughter and son-in-law. He was 68. Chakraverty was 79 and died on Saturday night. Along with his brothers and sisters, Kulkarni was actively involved with table tennis and other sports. After his career ended, he continued to stay in touch with the sport and was associated with coaching and also participated in Masters’ TT tournaments at the national and international level. He had also won the National Masters’ TT Championship in Indore in 2019. His demise came as a shock to the entire TT fraternity. “I watched him play against Japan in 1967 when he was barely 16. He was absolutely brilliant, and was the only one who won a match against the Japanese. He was mentored by former India player, the late Dilip Sampat, whom he stayed with. His younger sister Nandini played TT for a couple of decades and was a national champion for several years. His eldest brother Sudhir played Ranji Trophy for Maharashtra and Baroda in the 70s,” veteran journalist Makarand Waingankar told TOI. His younger brothers Satish and Jayant too played for India. In his four-decade-old career, Chakraverty mentored many aspiring shooters on their way to the international stage. “NRAI condoles the death of Mr Sanjay Chakraverty, Dronacharya. Popularly known as Sanjay Sir was not keeping well for a long time. He trained many shooters who are Rajiv Khel Ratna & Arjuna Awardees. There is a long list of international medallists who were trained by him. May God grant peace to the departed soul,” the NRAI said in a statement. “With heavy heart, conveying the sad news of demise of Dronacharya Awardee Shooting coach and mentor Sri Sanjay Chakraverty Sir in Mumbai a few hours ago. My heartfelt condolences. Folded hands we have lost a great soul,” tweeted Olympic shooter Joydeep Karmakar. “The grief of losing a real Dronacharya in Sanjay Sir. Our modern day Dronacharya who created not just one but many Arjunas (including me) and never asked for a Guru Dakshina! Indian Shooting has lost one of its pioneering doyens,” tweeted India’s high-performance specialist coach Suma Shirur, who runs a shooting academy in Panvel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-former-india-tt-champ-and-shooting-guru-succumb-to-covid/articleshow/81904116.cms||Gaurav Gupta
---||Kozhikode||Jayarajan’s FB post misinterpreted: CM||Kozhikode: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in Kannur that it is important to note P Jayarajan’s statement that communists don’t indulge in worshipping individuals and that the party was supreme. He said the media, who went after Jayarajan, won’t get the result it intended because of it. CM read out his entire FB post, analysed it and said that everything written in it was true. Jayarajan had said in his Facebook post that the party was the ‘captain’ and that the surety that the people felt was that of the party and the Left and not individuals. “As far as we are concerned, the party is supreme. Everyone is subservient to it. A person commits mistakes when he thinks he is above the party. When it feels that a person is changing and thinks he is above the party, the party will obviously correct him,” said Vijayan. He said that during campaign, he came across little kids who expressed their attachment in unique ways. “The love they express is not created by anyone. I remember one kid calling me ‘Pinarayi achacha’ during a meeting. I remember a child waving at me from inside a car when I was speaking somewhere. In many stages, I remember kids coming to me with drawings that they made during lockdown. It shows a special attachment that has formed between people and the LDF,” said the CM, adding that he had received a song written by a housewife during campaign. He said these are the signs of affection towards LDF. “When we attend a function, there would be slogans and other arrangements by the organizer. Some of you might remember the last Kerala Yatra. The rush and passion happened then because I was there as a party leader. When you see such expressions of love and excitement, one shouldn’t think that it is all due to the excellence of oneself. That would be a problem,” he said, adding that usually it doesn’t happen with Communists. “I have seen lots of expressions of excitement and as a volunteer; I had welcomed the party and party leaders like that. I am seeing the other end of it now. My style is not going to change because of this. My nature is to maintain the level of alertness that a Communist needs,” he added. He alleged that many media houses were ‘paid’ and they ‘twisted’ Jayarajan’s post in a different way. “I have said about a ‘syndicate’ in the past. This is not that but a type of pay off. This is not suitable for the media,” he said. The CM added that the front would get more seats this election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/jayarajans-fb-post-misinterpreted-cm/articleshow/81902600.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In two days, the hospital — the biggest Covid-19 treatment centre in Gujarat — will complete a year of operations. While the facility started admitted women and children again for a couple of weeks due to dip in cases, it has over 700 Covid-19 patients now. This time, the challenge is the new symptoms and another spike. Dr Kartikeya Parmar, in-charge of the hospital, said that the patients are also coming with not-so-textbook symptoms such as upset stomach, diarrhoea and severe body ache. “In recent days, we have also reported incessant coughing as a dominant symptom which is irrepressible in some patients,” said Dr Parmar. In private hospitals too, the ‘new symptoms’ are witnessed. Dr Nirav Visavadia, a city-based critical care physician, said that diarrhoea was seen in earlier phases, too. “What we are witnessing now are symptoms such as conjunctivitis and fatigue or weakness without any classical symptoms. Thus, we advise citizens to get themselves tested if they suffer from any unusual health issues and not ignore it,” he said, adding that Covid-19 can manifest in many ways. Dr J P Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that the hospital has so far treated over 22,000 Covid-19 patients and also handled over 55,000 OPDs. “The biggest takeaway for us from the year is to be prepared and put the SOPs in place. For the entire staff, it was learning on the go right from patient management to management of relatives, staff and outside stakeholders,” he said, adding that the staff is more confident now of handling the pandemic. Dr Rakesh Joshi and Dr Rajnish Patel, additional medical superintends, said that the experience of the hospital also helped other hospitals in Ahmedabad and other parts of the state. They added that it was not just Covid-19 as the hospital also had to treat existing patients and those with Covid-19 and other conditions such as pregnancy, heart ailment, kidney disease, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/a-year-on-doctors-grapple-with-new-symptoms/articleshow/81903170.cms||Parth Shastri

The two-day donkey fair, organised near the Sheetla Dham, Kada area, began on Sunday morning where around 1,000 donkeys of different breeds and pedigrees were being brought from different parts of the country for sale and purchase. However, when Kaushmabi police learnt that the organisers had not sought permission to hold the donkey fair and that Covid-19 protocols were being openly violated in the fair, the police officials rushed to the spot and stopped the fair. Additional SP, Kaushambi, Samar Bahadur told TOI that cops have stopped the annual donkey fair organised near Sheetla Dham on Sunday evening. He added that the majority of traders who brought donkeys, mule and horses had already left the spot. ASP claimed that local traders have already left the spot and those who came from other states would be vacating the spot by Sunday night. ASP said that organisers had not sought any permission to hold the annual fair. However, earlier in the day, the unique feature of the two-day donkey fair was that the donkeys were decorated with colours and fed food before they were presented for sale by the owners. The donkeys were being sold at higher prices ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 50,000 during the fair. Ashok, a resident, said, "The donkeys are fed delicacies and decorated with colours and signs before being displayed for sale." He added, "Not only donkeys but mules and horses are also sold by traders who arrive at the Kada area in Sirathu tehsil of Kaushambi district every year from all over the country for sale and purchase of donkeys at the fair. This year, traders in large numbers from Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar, MP and Rajasthan had arrived for sale and purchase of donkeys, mules and horses. Raj Kumar, a trader from Rajasthan said, "We used to apply special signs on donkeys so that they should not be mixed with the other donkeys." He added that a special breed of a donkey called 'Tipu' was in high demand and that many people at the fair were ready to shell out extra bucks for them. People of two communities namely the Pandas and washermen community organise the annual donkey fair jointly near the Dham in the Chaitra month. Both traders and visitors believe that devotees reveal their ‘mannat’ (wish) to the animals and arrive here to feed them with milk, grams, green grass and vegetables if their wish is fulfilled. Trader Shyamlal said, “Donkeys are also named after film stars and prominent personalities to catch the fancy of buyers. This is the spot where donkeys gain significance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cops-stop-two-day-donkey-fair-in-kaushambi-for-flouting-covid-norms/articleshow/81901615.cms||---

With more than 90 elections to his credit as an independent contestant, Ambedkari — a senior member of the erstwhile All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation (Bamcef), founded by Kanshi Ram before the BSP came into being — is among one of the most experienced political candidates in the fray. Ambedkari says he fights the elections on the ideology of Bharat Ratna Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar. On Sunday, Ambedkari’s wife Shivdevi Surma (68) also filed nomination as an independent candidate for Agra district council member from ward 29. She also filed a nomination for the post of gram pradhan from Kheragarh subdivision. Since 1985, Ambedkari has contested a total of 93 elections to various bodies, including the Lok Sabha and state assembly from different seats, but never ever got the mandate. In 1988, his nomination for the post of President of India was rejected. Ambedkari had contested the last Lok Sabha election from Agra and Fatehpur Sikri seats but was not able to retain deposits. The last election he fought was for member of legislative council in 2020. His best performance was in 1989 Lok Sabha elections. He had secured 36,000 votes from the Firozabad seat. Talking to TOI, Ambedkari said, “This time, I am going to contest the panchayat election for post of district council member. Today (Sunday) my nomination from ward number 30 under Kheragarh subdivision was accepted. My wife will also be contesting election the panchayat elections. We have started door-to-door campaign. I have a lot of well-wishers actively supporting me. Our agenda is impartial and corruption-free development. I will work according to the constitutional principles”. “I don’t care who are my opponents as I contest the election to give an option to voters who believe in Ambedkar's ideology.” Ambedkari has been active in politics for over 4 decades. He served as the district president and state vice-president of Bamcef from 1977 to 84. Speaking about his personal life, Ambedkari said, “I work as a farm labour and have a MNREGA job card. I have no formal schooling, but I can read and write Hindi, Urdu and English. I am a permanent resident at Ram Nagar Nagla Dulhekhan under Kheragarh subdivision of Agra. I have 10 children, all of them married and well settled.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/babasaheb-follower-files-nomination-for-93rd-time-to-contest-panchayat-polls-this-time/articleshow/81901614.cms||Deepak Lavania

Every year, students get to write four formative assessments (FAs), two summative assessments (SAs), and pre-finals. This year, the state has reduced the number of assessments by half. Teachers said conducting FA- II, SA, and pre-finals look unlikely as schools remain shut due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. “This year, the number of papers has been reduced, so is the syllabus. Although model papers are made available, students are not entirely familiar with the question paper pattern. Unless they get to write a few practice tests before the board examination, they will not be completely prepared,” said M Ravindar, a government teacher and vice-president, Telangana Progressive Teachers’ Forum. As per the schedule released by the department of school education, FA2 should be conducted by April 15. Summative assessment was scheduled to be held between May 17 and May 13. FA1 was held in March. “If not for practice, at least SA should be conducted as they are needed for internal assessment as they carry 20% weightage,” United Teachers’ Federation general secretary Chava Ravi said. He said that in case board exams have to be cancelled, students have to be promoted, as done last year, based on internal assessment marks. SSC exams are held for 600 marks (100 marks for each subject) — 480 marks for board exams and 120 for internals. Students and their parents also said that it was not fair to ask them to appear for exams without proper preparation. “Even if I get to attend SA exams before boards, it will boost my confidence. Right now, I am not sure what I learned through digital classes and whether or not it is sufficient to give boards,” Akhil V, a class 10 student, said. Commissioner and director of school education, A Sridevasena, said that right now they did not receive any instructions about examinations. “Until we receive instructions from the government to not conduct examinations, we will be making all preparations for the conduct of examinations. Till date, we haven’t received any instructions on resuming physical classes or assessments, or board exams. These are policy decisions to be taken by the government,” Sridevasena told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/class-x-students-parents-in-a-fix-over-ssc-exams/articleshow/81906105.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The city recorded maximum temperature of 40 degree Celsius on Saturday and 38.2 degree Celsius on Sunday. As per Telangana State Development Planning Society, Khairtabad, Secunderabad, Manikonda and Gachibowli are among the hottest areas that recorded maximum temperature of 41 degree Celsius. While the maximum temperature is expected to be above normal for another few weeks, a trough extending from Odisha towards Telangana and Tamil Nadu may bring in some thundershowers. Under its influence, the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad has issued thunderstorm warning for eastern parts of Telangana such as Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Mulugu, Bhadadri Kothagudem, Khammam, Suryapet, Mahabubabad, Warangal (rural and urban). “A cyclonic circulation over south Chhattisgarh and neighbourhood persists. Apart from this, a north south trough runs from north interior Karnataka to interior Tamil Nadu due to which few districts may witness thunderstorm accompanied with lightning,” said K Naga Ratna, in-charge director, IMD, Hyderabad. Meteorologists said that pre-monsoon activity has already commenced in few parts of West Bengal and Odisha and would soon extend to Telangana. “Currently, there is no significant weather system which may give thunderstorm activity. Once the temperature starts rising in Vidarbha and neighbourhood areas, thunder cloud development is expected to result in pre-monsoon showers over parts of Telangana in the second and third week of April,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet, an independent weather forecasting agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/imd-holds-out-hope-city-may-get-pre-monsoon-rain/articleshow/81902599.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||No shortage, but long queues for remdesivir||AHMEDABAD: A video went viral on Sunday where a long queue was seen outside a pharmacy – people were scurrying to get remdesivir amid the government claims that adequate stock is available. Verification of the video revealed the place to be Zydus Hospital on SG Road where the injection is made available. Dr V N Shah, business head of Zydus Hospital, said that they are catering to about 300-500 persons a day for the past three days. “As it’s one of the essential medicines, we are supplying six injections at a relatively lower rate of Rs 899 per injection. Thus, persons not only from Ahmedabad but from across Gujarat are approaching the pharmacy at the hospital to get the injections,” he said, adding that they have made arrangements so that the relatives of the patients don’t need to wait in scorching heat. The queues and rush is seen amid the claims by the state government that there is adequate stock of remdesivir available. On Saturday, Dr H G Koshiya, state FDCA commissioner, had told media that 28,119 injections are made available across Gujarat. Several cities in Gujarat including Rajkot had reported acute shortage of the injection in the past week. Sources close to the development said that the hospitals where the Covid-19 patients are admitted are managing the stock including procurement and administering. “Even then, the relatives are often asked to ensure the supply. Need of the hour is to streamline how to procure such drugs and from where to get it,” said a senior official. Dr Atul Patel, a city-based infectious diseases specialist, had told media on Saturday that remdesivir is not a life-saving drug.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-shortage-but-long-queues-for-remdesivir/articleshow/81903167.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SRA tweaked slumdwellers’ list thrice in 5 years in Omkar’s Wadala project, says ED||MUMBAI: Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) officials manipulated the list of eligible slumdwellers on the Wadala plot developed by Omkar group three times in five years. This substantially increased the development potential of the project and the developer managed to take a Rs 410-crore loan from Yes Bank, according to the chargesheet recently filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). ED has named Omkar group promoters Babulal Varma and Kamal Kishor Gupta, and JM Joshi group promoter Sachin Joshi, and 14 firms associated with them in the chargesheet. Varma, Gupta and Joshi have already been arrested. ED claimed that the list of eligible residents of Anand Nagar slum was manipulated last in 2016, just after Omkar Group took over the project. This increased the plot’s FSI from 2.05 to 4. However, the SRA website till date shows the development potential of the plot as per 2.05 FSI. The chargesheet said Omkar group created a notional 3.5 lakh sq ft saleable component on the plot with the help of manipulated documents. It then mortgaged the property with Yes Bank for a Rs 410-crore loan. ED accused Omkar of illegally diverting the money to its other group companies. Omkar group had told ED that it had merged the Wadala project with its Worli one where it had used the money, but the chargesheet said FSI of one project can be transferred to another only after construction of SRA buildings. “By making false representation in connivance with SRA officers, the accused have managed to get approval from SRA for clubbing of the FSI of the Wadala project with the Worli project,” it added. In 2009, Surana Construction was appointed developer of Anand Nagar slum with a total 464 hutments. But SRA scrutiny found that only 383 were eligible. In 2011, SRA issued letter of intent (LOI)—building construction permission—with FSI of 3.12 based on eligible slumdwellers. But, in 2013, a complaint was filed with SRA and revenue ministry that forged power bills were submitted to increase the number of eligible residents. The government confirmed the same, and accordingly, SRA decided not to give benefit to 252 residents in whose names forged bills were submitted. In 2014, SRA reduced the number of eligible slumdwellers to 138 and issued a revised LOI with FSI 2.05. In 2015, Surana sold the project to Omkar group for Rs 165 crore. In 2016, an SRA deputy collector wrote to the engineering department that 402 tenements were eligible, and accordingly, FSI was increased to 4. In the same year, Yes Bank granted the loan after Omkar claimed that FSI 4 was available on the plot and it would generate 3.5 lakh sq ft saleable component. Omkar promoters told ED they had clubbed the Wadala and Worli projects based on which the loan was taken, but investigators found that Yes Bank disbursed part of the loan even before the two projects were merged in November 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sra-tweaked-slumdwellers-list-thrice-in-5-yrs-in-omkars-wadala-project-says-ed/articleshow/81903153.cms||Vijay V Singh

The money will be transferred to the students’ accounts via the direct benefit transfer scheme.Notably, 1.6 crore students are given these facilities every year for free in Uttar Pradesh.

The only eligibility criteria is that the society should inform the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation authorities that there are 100 eligible people who are willing and consenting to take the shots. On Sunday, over 100 people in Pranam Bungalows Society in Vastral took the Covid-19 jabs en masse. The beneficiaries included senior citizens and residents 45 years and above who collected on the society campus to get vaccinated. In fact, some 6,900 individuals in 75 societies have registered with the AMC as part of this drive. Most of the societies registered are in the western part of the city like Gota, Ghatlodia, Bodakdev, Navrangpura. AMC officials said, “We send a van with the team of doctors and nurses. We ask the societies to arrange for a space and also a room where those inoculated can sit for 30 minutes after vaccination,” said a health department official. “The drive is to ensure maximum coverage of the vaccination and decongest the government-run centres across the city," said a senior AMC official. Residential societies are not the only places the AMC has been helping to organize such vaccination camps. To curb the rapid spread of Covid, the city civic body is now approaching associations, provision store owners, autorickshaw drivers, commercial vehicle operators to vegetable vendors to help organize drives for Covid vaccinations and rapid antigen tests. The AMC has also begun approaching government offices and have been requesting officials and employees to take vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/home-jabs-if-100-people-raise-their-hands/articleshow/81903165.cms||---

The infant was being sold to a well-to-do family in Bengaluru. The police are also likely to arrest a lady doctor, who is believed to be involved in the case. The cops have arrested a couple and two other women. Another accused, Julia Fernandes, is a habitual offender but she has not been arrested as she had delivered a baby a week ago and is in the hospital. Fernandes was arrested by the Wadala Truck Terminal police and Mumbai crime branch in 2016 and 2018 respectively in similar baby selling racket cases. After receiving a tip-off about the baby girl being kidnapped and sold for Rs 1.5 lakh illegally to the Bengaluru family, a police team led by senior inspector Prakash Chougule traced the child’s mother. “The woman is very poor. She has lodged a complaint about her baby being kidnapped. She took the name of a couple involved,” said Chougule. The couple was arrested and revealed their accomplices. The other two were then arrested from Chembur. All the four admitted to have kidnapped the baby to be sold to a Bengaluru couple through a lady doctor from Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4-held-for-trying-to-sell-infant-to-bluru-couple-2-more-involved/articleshow/81903179.cms||Ahmed Ali

They splurged the money at pubs and other places in Goa. Rachakonda police said P Srinivasulu and Uday Manish became friends while they were in search of job and were residing at the same hostel in Ameerpet. Officials said the two accused came across the victim through one of their acquaintances, Ganesh. The two became familiar with the victim, who later contacted them to get an auto-rickshaw since she wanted to take her puppy out. As the accused asked for Rs 500 cash for the payment of auto, the victim shared her banking credentials with the two to make the fare payment. Later, the accused stole her debit card, went to Goa and spent Rs 3.10 lakh using her banking details at pubs and other locations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/woman-gives-bank-details-loses-rs-3l/articleshow/81902608.cms||---

Against this backdrop, the government is planning to deposit Rs 1,100 into the account of each beneficiary. “After a mutual agreement of the basic shiksha vibhag about depositing a certain amount into each beneficiary’s account for the procurement of uniforms, school bags and shoes, the proposal has been sent to the cabinet,” said additional principal secretary Renuka Kumar. Kumar further said while Rs 600 would be given to each child for uniforms, Rs 500 would be provided for school bags, sweaters, socks and shoes. The money will be transferred to the students’ accounts via the direct benefit transfer scheme. Notably, 1.6 crore students are given these facilities every year for free in Uttar Pradesh. However, the procurement responsibility lies with the government and the private players whose tenders are accepted. Various complaints about the delay forced the authorities to take this step. The move to transfer the money to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries will not only prevent the delays but will also address the quality concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-govt-plans-to-deposit-rs-1100-into-students-account-to-prevent-delay-in-distribution-of-school-uniforms-school-bags/articleshow/81901642.cms||Ishita Bhatia

This free power supply order will come into retrospective effect from April 1, 2021. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao held a review meeting here with the officials concerned and took a decision to this effect after looking into the representations made to the government by the Rajaka (washermen) community and Naayi Brahmin associations. The free power orders issued ahead of April 17 bypoll to Nagarjuna Sagar assembly constituency raised eyebrows in political circles but officials said it was a long-pending demand of the two communities, and that the CM had also promised it during the GHMC election campaign. Also, the voters from these two communities do not exceed 12,000 in Nagarjuna Sagar assembly constituency. Telangana State Nayi Brahmana Ikya Vedika honorary president G Mahesh Chandra thanked CM KCR on behalf of the community and said the TRS government has been taking numerous initiatives for the welfare of backward classes. “The development and progress of Rajakas (washermen community) is possible only through chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. Towards achieving the objective of golden Telangana, CM KCR has fulfilled his promise to Rajakas made during GHMC elections. The Rajakas are better off in Telangana state when compared to their situation in the undivided state,” said Telangana Rajaka Sanghala Samithi chief advisor and Telangana Rajaka Seva Sangham state president Konduru Satyanarayana. He said that though they had sought free power only up to 150 units per month for dhobi ghats, the chief minister’s magnanimity has once again come to the fore in his decision to extend free power up to 250 units per month, said Satyanarayana. Earlier, the chief minister directed CMO secretary Bhupal Reddy to issue a GO immediately in this regard. As per the directions of the CM, principal secretary to BC Welfare Burra Venkatesham issued the orders. The CM said Telangana government’s aim was to uplift the most backward classes and the state government has already been implementing several schemes for their welfare. The decision will provide up to 250 units of quality electricity free of cost to salons, laundries and dhobi ghats and will benefit lakhs of Rajaka and Nayi Brahmin families in Telangana who have been living on the basis of caste occupation for generations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/250-units-monthly-free-power-to-rajakas-nayi-brahmins/articleshow/81902610.cms||Roushan Ali

On the other hand, the city continues to face shortage Covaxin doses despite central government’s claims time and again about no crisis of vaccine in the country. The NMC, in a press release on Sunday, said vaccination will kick off for people in 45-59 years age group and 60+ at six new centres in Laxmi Nagar zone. The centres are set up in indoor sports stadium situated in Vivekananda Nagar, NMC primary school at Shivangaon and community halls in Gajanan Nagar, Rajiv Nagar, Gayatri Nagar and Subhash Nagar. The government had rolled out the vaccination drive on January 16 beginning with healthcare workers (HCWs). Thereafter, frontline workers (FLWs) were covered from February 5. Till then, vaccination centres were limited to indoor hospitals only. The government had commenced vaccination of 60+ and 45+ with specified comorbidities on March 1. Then, the NMC and zilla parishad had started to open vaccination centres in primary healthcare centres too. Vaccination for all above 45 years kicked off from April 1 covering a larger number of people. NMC officials told TOI, “Vaccination has been facilitated at 89 centres, which can cover over 27,000 people daily. Also, 28 more private hospitals will start inoculation in phased manner from Monday. Those involved in the drive have observed that a few eligible citizens throng centres in their respective areas in the initial days and thereafter the number goes down there. There are many areas from where vaccination centres are at a far distant places. But in such areas, there are no hospitals or primary healthcare centres. Moreover, no cases of adverse event following immunization (AEFI) within 30 minutes of vaccination have been reported. Therefore, we planned to open centres in premises where huge space is readily available. It will ensure vaccination of all eligible people early,” they said. The NMC is also likely to open 45 more centres in indoor sports stadiums, schools and community halls in coming days. Shortage of Covaxin: Meanwhile, the NMC did not receive doses of Covaxin from the government and office of deputy director of health services (DDHS) on Sunday. The civic body was forced to convert Viveka Hospital, only private centre offering Covaxin jabs, into Covishield centre. This is third such centre after Dr Ambedkar Hospital and NMC’s Hansapuri Dispensary to switch over to Covishield from Covaxin. However, administering Covaxin continued at NMC’s Datke Memorial Diagnostic Centre, Mahal, and two centres at GMCH on Sunday. NMC sources told TOI, “Covaxin will continue only at two centres of GMCH from Monday and even Mahal centre will be converted into Covishield. GMCH is left with around 1,000 doses, which are necessary especially for those coming for second dose,” said the officials. The office of DDHS talked to officials at Wardha, Bhandara and Gadchiroli for getting Covaxin doses, but these districts too have been reportedly left with far less quantity of doses. “Government is likely to send Covaxin on April 10,” said an official in DDHS office. The NMC is having sufficient doses of Covishield. The vaccination in city declined to 8,166 on Sunday as against 15,871 on Saturday. Inoculation happened in only 51 of total 89 centres. Also, 38 centres in private hospitals were closed on account of Sunday, despite orders of the NMC and government to continue vaccination on all days in April for completing inoculation of all above 45 years. Many centres in rural were also closed on Sunday. Thus, vaccination in the district dropped 21,654 on Sunday as against record 41,763 on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-start-vax-centres-in-stadium-schools-from-today/articleshow/81902619.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Ahmedabad||State govt makes RT-PCR negative report must for flying to Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: After chaos broke out at airports in Gujarat spurred by passengers’ reluctance to produce RT-PCR negative reports, airlines have been asked to check for passengers’ reports at boarding points before they travel to Gujarat. Over the past two days, a number of passengers who arrived without an RT-PCR negative report were made to give their samples for testing before leaving the airport premises. The state government has made it mandatory for anyone travelling to Gujarat to show an RT-PCR negative report. The report must not be older than 72 hours. A notification issued by the department of health of Gujarat said: “Considering that a large number of passengers would arrive at airport terminals and the fact that there is a chance of the spread of Covid-19, all airlines are instructed to ask for a negative RT-PCR report of passengers before departure at origin.” The notification goes on to say: “Otherwise, the passenger may not be allowed to enter the state of Gujarat or has to perform a self-paid test at the airport in Gujarat and has to wait till the negative report is received. All airlines and airport authorities are requested to sensitize all passengers regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour.” Well-placed sources at the city airport confirmed that they have already told the airlines to not just verify RT-PCR negative reports of passengers but also to prepare passengers to get tested at the airport at their cost before leaving. Over the past three to four days, several passengers turned up without an RT-PCR negative report from various parts of the country into Gujarat at the Ahmedabad airport. “Passengers were made to give their test samples before leaving but many were extremely reluctant to get tested or pay for the tests,” said a source in the civic body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-govt-makes-rt-pcr-ve-report-must-for-flying-to-guj/articleshow/81903177.cms||---

Majority of them are employed in Myanmar’s police and fire services, as well as in other government departments. “We have been instructed not to reveal the exact number of (Myanmar) refugees due to the attitude previously shown by Union home ministry, which told the state government to deport anyone entering the state from Myanmar,” a Mizoram home department official said, adding that a large number of people could have entered through the 404-km long porous international border with Myanmar without being detected. He said it was impossible to maintain an accurate record as many refugees were afraid of being identified due to their relatives back home in Myanmar who are still at the mercy of the ‘Tatmadaw’ or the country’s army. On Thursday, a senior home department official had told TOI that more than 1,500 refugees have taken shelter in the state. The Mizoram government has made arrangements to lodge the refugees who do not have relatives or friends in Mizoram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/number-of-myanmarese-crossing-over-hits-3000/articleshow/81904797.cms||---

After receiving a complaint from AIMIM Nampally legislator Jafar Hussain Meraj, the FIR was registered under IPC sections 153-A (promoting the enmity between different groups on grounds of religion) and 295-A (Injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class) of the IPC. Swami Yati Narasinghanand Saraswati allegedly made the comments in Delhi, triggering outrage across India. The video of the priest also surfaced on social media on April 2. On Sunday AIMIM Legislator filed a complaint with the ACP Asifnagar Siva Maruti, upon which the Humayun Nagar police took cognizance of the complaint and registered the FIR. “The deliberate comments used have hurt the sentiments of Muslims,” said Jafar Hussain Meraj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fir-against-gzb-temple-mahant/articleshow/81902612.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||App for live info on voter turnout||Thiruvananthapuram: A group of engineering students from Wayanad government engineering college has come up with a web application through which voters in Wayanad can get real-time information on the turnout at polling booths. The students developed a web application named ‘Poll Wayanad App’ that will provide the details of the number of voters at the polling booths on a real-time basis. Especially when the threat of Covid-19 looms large and crowding at the polling booths would be inevitable, such an information reaching the voter would be crucial and helpful for them and the authorities for ensuring the Covid-19 protocols. Election general observer for Kalpetta Abhishek Chandra, an IAS officer from 2003 batch belonging to Tripura cadre, suggested the idea for the app. It was then developed based on requirements put across by the Wayanad district administration. “Though we have 948 booths in the district, we are introducing this service in 412 booths on a pilot basis where webcasting is being done. The information about the number of voters in the queue will be uploaded to the application every 30 minutes from 7am on the poll day by Akshaya’s technical staff,” said Wayanad district collector Adeela Abdulla. After the election observer’s idea sounded exciting, the district administration got in touch with Government Engineering College, Mananthavady, with the requirement, and the college authorities selected three students from BTech computer science stream for the task. “We were scared to take up the task initially as it is a very responsible job and there cannot be any room for error. But we took it up after our teachers and district authorities gave us confidence,” said eighth semester student Mohammed Aslam E P, who led the team. Other team members include his juniors from third semester — Abhinav P and Abhiram K Pradeep — who together got the application ready in five days. A trial run was found to be a success, and the election commission was informed about the initiative through the observer. A request has been sent to Google for uploading the application in Play Store. But since it would take at least 15 days before completing the formalities and get the app uploaded, the district administration shared the APK file for the application widely through Facebook and various Whatsapp groups where the booths will be covered by the service, so that the public can download the application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/app-for-live-info-on-voter-turnout/articleshow/81902628.cms||KP Saikiran

Though the team on Saturday visited the state capital to question Mohan’s friend, who came from Tamil Nadu recently, they could not get any relevant information from him.Police believe that the death of his daughter Vaiga and his subsequent missing were pre-planned. Mohan and his daughter went missing in the night of March 20 after they left in his car from their flat at Thrikkakra.Vaiga’s body was found from Muttar river on March 23. Police had found from CCTV visuals that Mohan crossed Walayar check post in the wee hours of March 21. They couldn’t get any information about Mohan and his vehicle after that.“Mohan had contacted his friend three months ago from a different number. Two teams are conducting investigation in Tamil Nadu. We believe he might be having liquid money to meet the fuel expense for driving his car. There had been no bank transaction for the past many months. The blood stain found in Mohan’s flat a few days ago has been sent to Regional Forensic Laboratory (RFSL) for testing. We are waiting for the result,” said a police officer, who is part of the investigation.Asked about the delay in locating Mohan, who is missing for two weeks, police said they have difficulties in conducting investigation as officers are involved in poll duty. “We have CCTV visuals showing Mohan’s travel route till Walayar. We could recover no footages after he crossed the border. The teams in Tamil Nadu are probing into it,” he said.The autopsy report of Vaiga shows that she died of drowning. “The body was recovered in a decomposed stage. Prima facia, it was drowning. More details could be known only after chemical test, the result of which is being awaited,” said another officer.Currently, Mohan’s wife is staying at her home in Alappuzha. Police had already taken the statements of her and other relatives and all of them maintained that they have no knowledge about the financial issues faced by Mohan. “We have issued lookout notice regarding his missing case,” a senior officer with the city police.Mohan was in Pune before settling at Thirkkakara five-and-a-half years ago. Police believe he was engaged in business in Pune and was involved in cheating people. He returned to Kerala without the knowledge of his relatives. Police said Mohan used the flat at Thirkkakara a hideout. Though he secured interior design works in Kochi, he owes money to many people here too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sanu-mohan-case-police-expand-probe-to-state-capital/articleshow/81901659.cms||---

She is among 141 runaways who were rescued by the RPF Mumbai division in the past 12 months, said CR chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar on Sunday. “The children were rescued from railway platforms of CR stations in 2020-21,” he said. They have been sent to their respective homes with help of NGOs. Those rescued include 92 boys and 49 girls. Most of these children arrived in the city due to some family fight or issue, or in search of a better or glamorous life, said Sutar. They were found on platforms or near stations when the RPF picked them up. In the last five years, 1,874 children were rescued in the Mumbai division of CR. —Somit.Sen||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rpf-reunites-141-runaway-kids-with-kin-in-a-yr/articleshow/81903219.cms||Somit Sen

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Covid: Emergence of family clusters causes concern||Thiruvananthapuram: While Thiruvananthapuram continues to maintain a lower test positivity rate (TPR) compared to other districts, the re-emergence of clusters from family gatherings has triggered concerns. In March last week, contact tracing following confirmation of a positive case in Kallara panchayat led to 15 positives and all of them had attended a wedding there. The officials said that though the spread has been checked, they are wary of similar outbreaks with family gatherings being expected as part of religious festivals happening this month. The health team is banking on decentralised swab collection and contact tracing in community health centres in the district. By October 2020, the process of contact tracing which was earlier centred around the Covid-19 war room in the district collectorate was decentralised and staff of local health centres had taken up the task. Whenever an unusual spurt in cases was reported from a specific area, the centralised team would alert the local health centre and steps for contact tracing would be initiated. Besides, block-level swab collection teams have also been equipped to pick up cases from rural areas. Clusters from family gatherings, funerals and institutions accounted for the majority of Covid-19 cases between July and October 2020 in the district. In August 2020, mini-community clusters had formed within the city wards. The corporation wards recorded small clusters centred on residential colonies. Around 15 positive cases, including a 10-month-old baby, were cumulatively reported from a retail chain and two housing colonies at Kesavadasapuram. Some of the contacts of a person who tested positive were traced to a marriage function held at a hotel in Ulloor. The health officials had reported that the restrictions on number of participants and longer time period for holding reception meant little as silent carriers within close family circles led to the spread. Over 250 contacts had to be tested then. In the same month, a man who was discharged from the medical college hospital died at his residence at Madavoor and the bout of positive cases in the area was traced to the funeral function. A close relative of the deceased person, employed as a contractor, transmitted infection to workers. Another man who was tested positive was a friend of the relative and he distributed old age pension at homes and he had also attended the funeral. Another person who attended the funeral at Madavoor then went on to conduct noolukettu function for his baby in another panchayat. The dynamics of transmission had shaped around family clusters post-Onam in the capital. In Kalady, around 35 active cases had emerged from three families and more than 11 cases were reported from a single family. Karimadom, Kuriathi and Manacaud had over 90 active cases in the first week of September 2020. The officials are trying to check the emergence of such family clusters which usually arise from gatherings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-emergence-of-family-clusters-causes-concern/articleshow/81901669.cms||Aswin J Kumar

In its letter marked with copies to chief secretaries of all states and union territories last month, AWBI, the statutory body established under Section 4 of the PCA Act 1960 to advise the government or local bodies on any matter connected with animal welfare, asked the concerned authorities to identify feeding spots for stray dogs in view of harassment faced by citizens attempting to feed them. “It has been noticed by the Board that complaints about animal cruelty and harassment of individuals showing compassion towards animals are not being pursued seriously and appropriate action are not being initiated by the law enforcement authorities,” the letter said, adding that such complaints were not being taken cognizance of by the local police. Recently, in March, a similar complaint was registered at Vanasthalipuram police station by an animal volunteer after the neighbours objected to feeding and care of stray dogs. “We filed a complaint in the police station after one of the dogs that the neighbours threatened to kill and relocate, died within a few days under suspicious circumstances. The colony people kept harassing my family and the dogs for several weeks even after we told them that they are sterilized and vaccinated,” said M Asha, a resident of Subhadra Nagar, Vanasthalipuram. However, while GHMC’s chief veterinary officer was not available for a comment, Lingaswamy, veterinary officer of Kukatpally zone said, “Several incidents of conflict between animal feeders and RWAs come to our notice. We have been counselling them and explaining the rules. However, the initiative to designate feeding points can be taken by the RWAs and other residential colonies. Our job is only to sterilize, vaccinate and take care of the stray animals in our shelters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-yet-to-formulate-guidelines-on-selection-of-feeding-spots-for-stray-dogs/articleshow/81902626.cms||---

This was a quarantine facility at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic last year. Unofficial sources have informed that over 300 refugees have taken shelter in Aizawl, including some members of the National League for Democracy who were elected to the parliament of Myanmar in the November 2020 elections. Meanwhile, leader of the Aizawl-based NGO United for Democracy in Myanmar, Ramlawma, told TOI that the Myanmar army indiscriminately fired at protesters on Palm Sunday (March 28) at Kalaymyo township, forcing the desperate protesters to shoot back. Ramlawma said the civilian protesters under the umbrella of Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) have collected weapons and vowed to strike back, and ethnic insurgent groups have also pledged their support to them. Student bodies and civil society groups in Mizoram have been asking the Centre and the state government to provide relief and assistance to the Myanmarese.  Vanlaltana, president of the Mizo Zirlai Pawl, the apex Mizo student body, said India should not call itself the world’s largest democracy if it does not give a helping hand to the pro-democratic protesters in Myanmar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shillong/mizoram-covid-facility-to-be-shelter-for-junta-hit/articleshow/81904798.cms||---

NDA which has no seats now is determined to open its account in the district by winning at least Palakkad and Malampuzha. The 12 seats of the district were shared by LDF-9 and UDF-3 in the 2016 assembly elections. CPM central committee member and minister for welfare for scheduled caste and scheduled tribes A K Balan said that LDF will create history by winning all the 12 seats. District Congress committee president V K Sreekhandan, MP, said that UDF will win at least seven seats, including Malampuzha represented by CPM veteran V S Achuthanandan, pushing the BJP to third position from the second position of last elections. BJP district president E Krishnadas said that NDA hopes to win Palakkad, Malampuzha, Shoranur, Ottapalam, Kongad and Nemmara. But any prediction would be futile in five constituencies witnessing neck-and-neck fight, including Palakkad and Malampuzha where a three-cornered contest is going on. In Thrithala, Pattambi and Mannarkkad the results are unpredictable. BJP which fielded 88-year-old Metroman E Sreedharan in Palakkad is sure to win, defeating the sitting MLA Youth Congress president Shafi Parambil and LDF’s youth leader C P Pramode. In Thrithala, where Congress youth leader and two-time MLA V T Balram is engaged in a fight with CPM youth leader and former MP from Palakkad M B Rajesh.

The 1962 model pistol, loaded with the bullets, was found wrapped in a bag. According to sources, a middle-aged man who arrived in a white car around 12 noon abandoned the pistol and left the compound without entering the mall. It is believed that he reached the mall only to abandon the pistol. “A letter written in Malayalam in four pages has also been recovered along with the pistol and the bullets. Our guard has recovered the pistol and we informed Kalamassery police. The letter details about the history of the pistol. It says that the pistol belonged to his grandfather and was used to kill a Pakistani national during a war against Pakistan,” said a source. He also mentioned some names in the letter and asks whoever recovers the pistol to hand it over to the mentioned people. “The pistol was found abandoned outside the entrance as one has to pass through metal detector to enter the mall. The CCTV footage shows that the car is registered with Ernakulam RTO,” said a source. Police have started investigation to locate the person after collecting CCTV footage and car registration number. “The pistol will be subjected to forensic examination,” said Kalamassery police. Special branch officials have also visited the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pistol-five-bullets-found-abandoned-at-city-mall/articleshow/81901674.cms||---

Shreya S Ajith, a Class VII student of St Paul’s International School, composed a song for the film ‘Kalluvazhayum Njaval Pazhavum’ directed by Dileep Thomas and its audio release was done by music directors Bijibal and Anil Johnson. Shreya is the only daughter of music director Ajith Sukumaran and Sruthi Suresh, a professor at FISAT. Her passion for music began at a very young age and she proved it by composing a kid’s song when she was three-and-a-half-years old after getting inspired by her father. She started training in Carnatic music at the age of four and has composed several short songs, enabling her win the Indywood Best Child Musician Award at the age of nine. “The initial tuning of my songs is mostly done during my travel and I roughly record the tunes in my mobile phone. Shreya keenly observed this ever since she was a baby and she herself recorded a kid’s song in my phone when she was three-and-a-half-years old. It was then we realized her passion for music. Later, that song was sung by the students of St Paul’s when they participated in Rajagiri Kids Fest. Shreya is very dedicated and she now knows how to play keyboard and the basics of various recording hardware and software,” said Sukumaran. The song ‘Oru Vaakku Minduvan’ that was released on Saturday was composed by Shreya during the lockdown. Two other songs in the same film are composed by her father. “Shreya has composed several devotional song in the recent years. When she expressed her wish to compose a song for the new movie I signed up for, I let her do it. Lyricist Sasikala Menon wrote the lyrics. She composed the song a year ago and wanted to release it at the earliest,” said Sukumaran. Shreya said she aspires to become a singer and musician. “I am so happy that I could complete the song. I am thankful to my parents and the musicians for the support they gave,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/12-year-old-city-girl-turns-music-director-for-new-movie/articleshow/81901691.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: One lakh power lines snapped for not paying bills||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) has remained firm on its policy to temporarily disconnect power supply for non-payment of electricity bills in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The number of connections temporarily disconnected has crossed the 1-lakh mark this week, said an MSEDCL official. Across Maharashtra, electricity bill arrears had mounted to Rs 48,500 crore, of which Rs 242 crore was pending in MMR, an official said. Nearly 2 lakh consumers in MMR -- which includes residential, commercial and industry users—had not paid their monthly power bills during the past ten months. In the first week of March, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said, “there will be no disconnection of electricity supply for farmers and local residents who failed to pay their bills until the issue of non-payment of outstanding bills was debated in the state assembly”. However, state energy minister Nitin Raut subsequently said that recovery of arrears was important to ensure smooth running of MSEDCL and to meet expenses including funds to procure power. “Raut directed officials to go ahead with temporary disconnection to recover arrears ,” an official said. A staffer involved in the disconnection and recovery drive in Vashi said, “We are temporarily disconnecting supply and it will be restored once the consumer pays the pending bills.” The official said several consumers have come forward and handed over between Rs 30,000 and Rs 80,000 and also cheques after which their connections were restored. A few officials faced the risk of being attacked but have police protection now. A case in point was of officials who visited a populated slum in Vashi on Tuesday where residents came out and blocked their path. “I warned them that I am calling the police after which they agreed to cooperate. We disconnected the meter connections and will restore supply only after there is payment,” said a woman employee from MSEDCL. The MMR covers Mulund-Bhandup, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Panvel and Pen areas. In February, when the drive was launched, around 47,000 consumers in Mumbai region paid up after receiving notices and MSEDCL was able to recover Rs 62 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-one-lakh-power-lines-snapped-for-not-paying-bills/articleshow/81903274.cms||Somit Sen

They said that DSJP has not fielded any candidates in the polls and alleged that the candidates who claimed to be fielded by DJSP were part of the rebel group led by Konni Gopakumar and Mallelil Sreedharan Nair, who were ousted from DSJP recently. Addressing a press conference at Ernakulam Press Club, Menon, who claimed to be the president of DSJP, said that they have approached the election commission to not recognise the rebel group of DSJP and not allot the party symbol to them. “Following this complaint, the bank accounts of DSJP were frozen and it must be investigated how the rebel group is managing funds for the contest in 10 constituencies. We are the official leaders of DSJP and in the general body meeting held at Karukutty on April 1, Mallelil Sreedharan Nair and Konni Gopakumar were ousted from the party for anti-party activities,” he said. The candidates fielded by Gopakumar and Nair for the assembly polls were not official candidates of DSJP, Menon said. “We have not fielded candidates anywhere. But the party general body meeting has decided to support Metroman E Sreedharan in Palakkad and actor Suresh Gopi in Thrissur,” Menon added. Meanwhile, Konni Gopakumar, who claimed to be general secretary of DSJP, said that the allegations by Menon and others were baseless and said that he and Mallelil Sreedharan Nair were the true leaders of DSJP. “Election commission recognized us and allotted the symbol. KSR Menon claiming that he is the party president is not true and nobody has ousted me and Nair,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dsjp-leaders-fight-over-party-leadership/articleshow/81902645.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The winner, Aniyan Midhun, said he competed with the contestants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal in the 70-kg category in the ‘International Games 2021 - South Asia Championship - Wushu Sanda’ held at Kathmandu. Midhun said the championship was to be held from March 28 to 31, but the duration was cut short and completed on March 30, because of the Covid-19 situation. Midhun is now in the camp at Jammu where he has received advanced training in Wushu which is a martial art as well as a full-contact sport. Arjuna Award winner Kuldeep Handu was his coach there. Wushu involves boxing, kicking and throwing.

The accused Pratik Wadhwa was arrested from Dombivli (East) after the cyber police team from Sakinaka tracked his social media posts. Wadhwa, who wanted to earn a quick buck, was produced before the Bandra holiday court on Sunday. On February 18, the pharma company director got a call from a company inquiring why the cheque issued by him to buy 130 power banks has bounced. Soon, he got a similar call from another company.

Fish traders said that the situation was largely on account of the dispute between the Wholesale Fish Traders’ Association and the SGPDA sopo contractor over the issue of sopo (occupation fees) collection, and partly because of the scarcity of fish catch over the last few days. The SGPDA retail fish market saw availability of local fish varieties on Sunday, however, as the supply failed to meet the demand, prices of local fish soon skyrocketed. The sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Salcete, Jyoti Kumari has scheduled a meeting of the Wholesale Fish Traders’ Association, and the sopo contractor of the SGPDA on Monday. The meeting has been convened to find a solution to the issue of sopo collection of the SGPDA market. Tension had gripped the wholesale fish market last week after nearly 45 fish transportation vehicles were prevented from leaving the market on account of non-payment of sopo (vehicle parking fees) to the contractor. The president of Wholesale Fish Traders Association, Ibrahim Musa, has contested the authority of the sopo contractor Milagre Fernandes in collecting the sopo on the grounds that his contract has expired, while the latter has alleged that Musa’s actions were “politically motivated” and aimed at maligning his image. Sources in the fish trade said that the outcome of the Monday’s meeting of the stakeholders with SDM is expected to resolve the vexatious issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fish-vehicles-fail-to-enter-sgpda-mkt-for-4th-day/articleshow/81903399.cms||---
---||Surat||Bharuch: Nine cremated, but official toll zero?||BHARUCH/SURAT: The District Health Department has come under fire from citizens of Bharuch for not presenting the real picture, which is a grim one, regarding the numbers of Covid-19 infections and casualties. According to the District Health Department bulletin, 129 positive cases and zero deaths were reported in the industrial district of Bharuch in last week. But it came to light that as many as nine dead bodies were cremated at the Covid-19 designated crematorium near Golden Bridge on the bank of Narmada while one was buried at the cemetery in Bharuch. “The situation is worsening by the day as the coronavirus is spreading very fast. The district health department and administration need to be proactive. The department should release the correct figures so that citizens know about the gravity of the situation. Long queues outside pathological laboratory in Bharuch for RTPCR testing show how wrong the government’s figures are,” said Jivraj Patel, president of Bharuch Citizen Council. Shamsad Ali Saiyed, municipal councillor and leader of opposition at the civic body, echoed Patel’s view. “Government should not hide the numbers. Many relatives of the patients have approached us and informed that people are dying because of shortage of ventilators,” Saiyed said. District Collector Dr A M Modiya, though, stressed on the importance of vaccination. “Vaccination has started in 245 centres across the district and all those above the age of 45 years should get vaccinated. It is a concern that against the target of 4.06 lakh senior citizens only 90, 000, which is just 22%, took the jab,” Modiya said. “Around 800 beds are reserved for Covid-19 patients in various hospitals. Bharuch Civil hospital, Sewashram, Patel welfare, and ESIC Hospital, Ankleshwar, are providing free of cost treatment to the patients,” Modiya added. But sources informed that though the ESIC Hospital has 50 beds, it doesn’t have facility of ventilators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/nine-cremated-but-official-toll-zero/articleshow/81901722.cms||---

Election songs have always been an instantly-appealing medium of communication to aim at a rival or sing one’s own praises and woo voters. However, unlike previous elections, when parody songs were the norm, this time elections songs and musical ads by various political parties promoted on the television, digital and radio platforms make the campaign fiercer with most of them bringing in professional artists and celebrities. These artists include award-winning playback singers Sithara Krishnakumar, Sooraj Santhosh, Vaikom Vijayalakshmi and music director Bijibal. Most of these songs are instant hits in all platforms with more than one lakh views and some of them have even become the ringtones in mobile phones. ‘Urappanu Keralam’, a song composed and sung by Sithara, has been promoted as the official anthem for LDF in the assembly polls. Written by B K Harinarayanan, the lyrics focuses largely on local issues and highlights LDF’s fight against floods and Covid-19. The intro music and visuals of the song resemble the old KPAC drama songs but later it turns peppier with inspiring lines ‘nammale nayichavar jaikkanam / thudarchayode naadu veendum ujwalikanam,’ (Those who led us should win and the state should shine brighter in this continuity. Sithara said she did not have to think twice to commit the project owing to her Left political background. “The song was completed in three days. Malayalis have clear individual political stand and I don’t think they can be influenced by any gimmicks. But an artistic approach makes the campaign lighter. The song was well received by people and even those supporting other political parties too said they liked it. Harinarayanan’s lyrics was one of the main reasons for the acceptance,” she said. ‘Hridayapaksham’, people’s anthem’ composed, produced and sung by singer Sooraj Santhosh, is another election campaign song for LDF. Even though the lyrics, written by Anil Lal, are not focused on the achievements of LDF like Sithara’s song, the visuals do it with subtlety. Vaikom Vijayalakshmi has rendered UDF’s theme song ‘naadu nannakanai’ highlighting the front’s election slogan ‘UDF for a better Kerala’. The NDA brought out a theme song ‘puthiya Keralam Modikoppam’ (new Kerala with Modi) which is more visually appealing as it features the scenic, cultural and artistic beauty of Kerala coupled with rallies and campaigns of BJP leaders. Music director Bijibal, who had composed the song ‘kayyoorulloru’ for Communist leader V S Achuthanandan during the previous assembly polls, has come up with a song, ‘priya sakhavu’, highlighting chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Besides professional artists, politicians and their family members too have also sung some of the election songs. P C Vishnunadh, UDF candidate from Kundara, has sung ‘naadu nannakan UDF’. Thejal Shaji, son of LDF independent candidate from Ernakulam Shaji George Pranatha, composed a song ‘ayiram kykal korthu naam’ for his father.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/musical-duels-get-a-professional-touch/articleshow/81902686.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Lucknow||TMC goons targeting nationalists, will face action: Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday unleashed a frontal attack on TMC president Mamata Banerjee accusing her of allowing her party goons to target people who swear by nationalism and unfurl the tricolour. “Mamata Didi has taken the oath of the Indian Constitution as an MP, a Union minister and then as West Bengal CM. But TMC goons murder people who try to unfurl the tricolour in West Bengal,” he said, while addressing a rally in Khanakul assembly seat of the poll-bound state. The CM categorically referred to the alleged killing of BJP functionary Sudarshan Pramanik, who died during a scuffle with TMC supporters over hoisting of national flag on Independence Day in Hooghly district last year. “TMC ke gundon ne Sudarshan Pramanik ki hatya is liye kar di thi kyunki wo TMC ke rashtra drohi aur bhrashta krityon ke khilaf lagatar aandolan kar rahe they… (TMC goons killed Sudarshan since he was raising his voice against anti-national and corrupt activities of the ruling party workers),” Yogi alleged. The UP CM, who also addressed rallies in Jangipura, Chandannagar and Amta assembly seats, said the struggle of the people of Bengal would not go in vain. “May 2 ko jaise hi counting hogi aurBJPjeet kar sarkar banayegi…chun chun karTMCke gundon ko,jo arajakta faila rahe hain, nirdosh karyakartaon ko maar rahe hain…inke khilaf aisi karyawahi hogi ki inki aane wali kai peedhiyan gundagardi karna bhool jayengi… (Such action will be taken against TMC goons that their forthcoming generations would forget hooliganism),” Yogi said. The UP CM said Mamata had no sympathy for women, youth or farmers. “Unhe to hamdardi bas yahan ke gundagardi karne wale tattvon ke saath hai… (She just sympathises with anti-social elements involved in hooliganism in the state),” he said. He stressed that goondas who had been spreading terror in UP vanished after BJP came to power four years ago. “Sab gundey gayab…bahut saarejail chale gaye… aur kuchh yamlok chale gaye (Goons have vanished. Many went to the jail while some were gunned down in police encounters),” he said. “Many farmers in Hooghly region committed suicide in last 10 years of TMC rule but Didi (Mamata) did not allow them to get the benefit of PM Kisan Nidhi (envisaging a grant of Rs 6,000 per annum to small and marginal farmers),” he said. “People who are a threat to India or are harassing poor, farmers and traders will face the law once BJP comes to power in Bengal. The rule of Congress, Communists and TMC has only led to disorder, corruption, anarchy and community appeasement. Disruption in celebration of Hindu festivals also happened in UP four years ago but not anymore,” he said. Yogi reiterated that Bengal has a rich historical and cultural background and BJP would free the state from prevailing lawlessness and corruption. Yogi said the TMC chief was pained by the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. “She was earlier opposed to only BJP. Now she has a problem with Lord Ram,” he said. “Didi does not like construction of Temple…she does not like Durga Puja,” he said. He said that the administrative machinery in West Bengal should contribute in allowing free and fair elections. “Main prashasan se kehna chahta hun…YeTMCki vidai ki bela hai…imandaari se chunav sampann karne mein apna yogdan dijiye…party banenge dikkatein ho jayengi…ye sehat ke liye accha nahi hoga… BJP aayegi to 7th Pay Commission degi (The administrative machinery should note that the days of TMC government are numbered. Contribute in free and fair elections. There will be problems if you become a party…it would not be good for your health. BJP will implement 7th pay commission after coming to power),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tmc-goons-targeting-nationalists-in-wb-will-face-stern-action-yogi/articleshow/81903293.cms||Pankaj Shah

The complainant approached the police on March 3, stating that he wanted to reach out to a few needy people in his state and had learnt that Sood was helping with such causes. He searched for Sood’s corporation’s contact details and chanced upon a number. “The fraudster who answered the call assured to help. He told the man from the southern state that Sood would donate Rs 50,000 from his kitty. But, he told the dogooder from Telangana that he would have to pay up Rs 8,300 as registration charges,” said a police officer. A couple of days later, the accused called up the man in Telangana to say that the actor had decided to enhance the aid to Rs 3.60 lakh, said the officer. “For this, a registration fee of Rs 60,000 was sought. The man from Telangana paid up only to realise that he had been duped.” Sood said that he had learnt about the arrest. “People must be wary of a gang duping claiming to work for a charity run by me. I urge people not to entertain such online requests for donation,” Sood told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/call-from-sonu-soods-charity-could-be-cyber-fraud/articleshow/81904801.cms||V Narayan
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Errant doctors not joining Covid duties set to face FIR||NAGPUR: District collector Ravindra Thakare has asked the police department to call up doctors not reporting to duty at government-run Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCHs), like GMCH, IGGMCH or Shalinitai Meghe Hospital, and warn them of legal action. Sources said around 160 doctors have so far joined duties but almost 120-140 have so far refrained from joining their designated positions at Covid facilities. The orders had been issued by the collector in view of the shortage of expert hands in the backdrop of the spiralling corona positive cases in the district. Concerned by the large scale non-compliance, it was decided at a review meeting under guardian minister Nitin Raut that criminal action would be initiated against the doctors if they do not cooperate in the face of the crisis. Due to the shortage, doctors working at the government facilities have also raised the issue of fatigue and exhaustion, with the pandemic showing no signs of receding. It’s learnt Thakare had been issuing orders for doctors from various ayurvedic and dental colleges, hospitals under central government health scheme (CGHS), Maharashtra Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESIS) and such places to join state-run Covid facilities. At these hospitals, the rising number of patients had outnumbered the experts treating and taking care of them. Thakare is empowered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1877, and Disaster Management Act, 2005, to issue orders for doctors from various institutions to join Covid duties at government hospitals. Thakare said names and other details of the doctors who are yet to join government hospitals have been provided to the police department. “Legal action would be taken against the doctors under the relevant provisions of the pandemic period for not complying with orders to join Covid duties,” he said. “Most doctors who have been issued order to join Covid duties are from the city itself,” he said. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said the police stations have been given names and details of doctors to whom calls would be made, asking them to comply with the order of the district administration or else face legal action including a FIR. “In case, we find any doctors unwilling to comply then the complaint (First Information Report) would be sought from the district administration against such erring persons and offence would be registered,” said the CP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/errant-doctors-not-joining-covid-duties-set-to-face-fir/articleshow/81902684.cms||Soumitra Bose

City streets and rural roads that had reverberated with poll rhetoric and slogans went silent as Tamil Nadu voters geared up to decide the fate of close to 4,000 candidates in the fray. The DMK-led alliance, including the Congress, the MDMK, the VCK and the Left parties are pitted against the AIADMK-led BJP and PMK inclusive front. A small formation led by T T V Dhinakaran’s AMMK and including Vijayakant’s DMDK and IJK is in the fray besides Kamal Haasan’s MNM and Seeman’s NTK. The election may see the entry of some political debutants. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami campaigning for himself in Edappady constituency where he is contesting for the 10th time urged voters to help him taste victory yet again. “People should support me, cast their votes for me and help me win with the biggest margin,” he said. In Chepauk, his rival and DMK president M K Stalin, reserved his last-day campaign schedule for his son Udhayanidhi in Chepauk. “A few days ago, Udhayanidhi asked me not to campaign for him in Chepauk, since his victory has already been assured. But like Kalaignar, I too did not want people to say that I extensively campaigned across Tamil Nadu but not for my son,” said Stalin. “So, here I am on the last day of campaign to request you to vote for Udhayanidhi and ensure he wins by a huge margin,” the DMK leadeer said. The campaign themes of both the leaders focused on taking on each other on various fronts – leadership and administrative abilities, corruption and promises of sops and welfare measures. While Palaniswami sought votes on “the credentials” of his performance as CM, Stalin wooed voters with promises of what he could help achieve if he became CM. There was much melodrama too when DMK’s A Raja stirred controversy and triggered debate with his ‘derogatory’ remarks against the CM ending in the Election Commission debarring him from campaigning for 48 hours. Under the cover of poll cacophony, voters were wooed with cash in the quieter bylanes and underbelly of constituencies despite near vigilant flying squads and undercover EC teams. There were rampant poll violations too by all parties and some “indecent oratory” that went unchecked. As EC teams went around constituencies to vacate “outsiders” and securing polling booths across Tamil Nadu, the voter turnout on polling day may give an indication of the outcome of a most bitterly fought election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/campaign-ends-leaders-go-silent-tn-citizens-will-speak-on-april-6/articleshow/81903321.cms||---

But the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) has postponed the tournament that was to take off from Monday at different grounds in the city. The association said that the decision has been taken due to rising Covid-19 cases. “When the tournament was planned, the Covid-19 cases were under control. We had planned to follow all the Covid-19 guidelines including creating a bio bubble for the players who were picked up for the tournament,” BCA officials said.“But over last few days, there has been a sudden spike in the Covid-19 cases. It may take a while before the situation improves. Considering the safety of our players and the support staff, the association has decided to postpone the tournament,” the officials added.About 90 cricketers including Ranji Trophy, Under-19 as well as Under-23 players were picked up for the tournament that was to be played on league-cum-knock-out basis. It would have been difficult for the association to create bio-bubble for so many players and staff members.The postponement may come as a major disappointment for the players who were looking forward to display their talent in the shorter format of cricket.

Budaun SSP Sankalp Sharma had sent a report against all the four officers to the EC and their suspension was approved on Saturday. A huge quantity of spurious liquor purchased from a licensed shop was served by a Zila Panchayat aspirant. Two persons had died while another lost his eyesight after consuming the illicit liquor in Moosajhag area on Thursday night. Another person died after consuming liquor at the same party, but his family had cremated the body without any police complaint. Four persons, including the former village head, were arrested while three licensed shops were sealed after they were found to be selling spurious liquor. When contacted on Sunday, the SSP told TOI, “We have arrested four persons and have found the involvement of many others in the crime. There was negligence on the part of beat constable Akhsay Kumar, outpost in-charge Updesh Kumar and SHO Amit Kumar and they all have been suspended by us after seeking approval from the state election commission because of the enforcement of model code of conduct. We are conducting raids and ensuring no such incident is repeated.” Excise inspector Vani Vinayak Mishra was suspended by deputy excise officer Vijay Kumar Singh. Sources in police said that the local police had reportedly caught a shipment of illicit liquor from a car of a liquor mafia in Musajhaag area on March 27, but it was later released and the accused was set free. Several people have lost their lives across the state after consuming illicit liquor and cops have gone on an overdrive with frequent raids to prevent its spread ahead of this month's panchayat polls. Meanwhile, around 1,000 cartons of liquor were seized at Milak tehsil in Rampur while several consignment of illicit liquor were seized by police in Bareilly zone on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/spurious-liquor-deaths-budauns-excise-inspector-sho-2-other-cops-suspended/articleshow/81901143.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nagpur||Health teams to detect ‘red flag signs’ in home isolated +ves||Nagpur: District health teams have now been instructed to be more vigilant about ‘red flag signs’, being termed as ‘dhokyachi ghanti’ or alert message related to home isolated patients and refer them to hospital at the earliest to check the growing Covid fatality, rate which seems to be spiralling out of control even in rural places. The signs, which are nothing but known symptoms of Covid, are now being assessed on priority basis for more closer scrutiny to ensure hospitalization is not delayed for home isolated patients, whose monitoring has been made a systematic exercise in the district with guidelines and 14-day checklist for healthcare workers. As per an official source, on an average around 1,100-1,200 patients are being tested positive daily, while Covid death figures are hovering around 25 a day in the district, which is much more than the numbers recorded last year. The number of positive patients detected daily was around 550 and deaths were between 15-20 during the peak in September last year. An official said, list of the ‘red flag signs’, which include symptoms like oxygen level falling below 94 in pulse oximeter, fever above 100 degree Fahrenheit, body and head ache, uneasiness, loss of taste and/or smell, loose motions, cough and cold and any other usual symptoms, is being provided as part of the guidelines for the health teams to scrutinize condition of home isolated patients. The guidelines also include ‘six-minute walk’ test, which was reported by TOI, wherein the patient’s pulse oximeter count must not fall below 94-mark or slide down by four counts after the walk. “Early detection and timely hospitalization soon after noticing the danger signs would help check the fatality rate and boost recoveries of home isolated patients,” said district collector Ravindra Thakare. District health officer Dr Deepak Shelokar said a checklist of certain prescribed Covid behaviours for home isolated patients too is being provided to the health workers for better monitoring.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/health-teams-to-detect-red-flag-signs-in-home-isolated-ves/articleshow/81902688.cms||Soumitra Bose

Rising temperature is not the only reason for Nagpurians feeling more heat so early this year. According to doctors, most of us remained unexplored to the last year’s summer due to lockdown, as a result of which we are feeling this year’s summer as more scorching. General physicians are coming across patients with heat-stroke and dehydration in the first week of April, which is quite unusual for Nagpur. “A person born and brought up in Nagpur used to be alright until 45 degree Celsius temperature. But, this year, many are feeling exhausted at 42 degree Celsius. We had to prescribe oral rehydration solution (ORS) and other general medication to them,” said Dr Sumit Pawar, who owns a clinic on Manewada Road. Not just of bearing heat, but we have lost many of our abilities during last one year of changed lifestyle. Lockdown has adversely affected several soft skills of many like writing speed, face to face interactions and physical abilities like running, endurance etc. Most of us have missed our daily routine of exercise; many have stopped following diet regime, and many have gained excessive weight. “Children used to write regularly as part of daily classwork. This practice has stopped in the period of online classes. When they will be back to school, we will have to start from the beginning,” said Dr Mrunalini Dasture, principal of South Point School. “We have to focus more on students’ soft skills, emotional quotient and counselling rather than academics,” she pointed out. Even the state and CBSE boards are aware of the fact that students have lost their writing speed. Hence, this year, students are getting additional 30 minutes time to write their board examination papers. Dietician Malvvika Fulwwani talked about food related issues faced due to the year full of restrictions. “Lockdown has led to increased stress that triggered ‘carbohydrate craving’ in people. This resulted in to overeating. Many became obese and facing lifestyle disorders,” she said. The Work From Home culture has brought erratic lifestyle changes like working late, waking up late in the morning, no fixed meal timings and increased use of electronic gadgets leading to eye problems and headache. A recent study on health concerns during lockdown in Indian adults published in the International Journal of Community Medicine and Public Health stresses on the need for monitoring and counselling of those affected with physical and psychological problems, especially students, so that they can cope up with their regular activities, personal and professional life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/a-year-of-changed-habits-creating-issues-for-many/articleshow/81902691.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The man had some dues pending with the company and had hatched the plan to settle scores police said, adding that 307 mobile phones were recovered from them.

---||Nagpur||Rising cases leads to 84% rise in biomedical waste in city||Nagpur: The new surge on Covid-19 cases has led to a sudden rise in biomedical waste generation in the city. “There has been a near 84% increase in biomedical waste generation on account of Covid cases including used protective gear, masks, gloves and syringes,” said an official from Superb Hygienic Disposal (SHD), the firm engaged in collecting and disposing biomedical waste, in the city. The official further said the SHD collected 31.63 metric tonne (Mt) biomedical waste in March as against 17.25Mt in February. “It means the city generated over 1,000kg biomedical waste in March. These figures apparently don’t take into account the waste generated by about 80% of Covid patients in home quarantine, who have been disposing of the waste as the domestic ones,” he said. With no NMC facility available to collect biomedical waste generated by patients in home isolation, many are disposing of the waste in door-to-door garbage collection van. In October last year, the city had generated 54.449Mt of biomedical waste which gradually went down with the corresponding drop in cases to 17.25Mt in February. Apart from the 80-odd dedicated Covid hospitals, the company also collects biomedical waste from 1,800 city establishments including 632 private hospitals, clinics, OPDs, pathology laboratories, radiology centres etc. On an average, the city is generating around 1,500kg biomedical waste per day including more than 1,000 kg Covid-19 waste. To a query, the official explained that in March 2020, the NMC had even categorized food for quarantine patients under biomedical waste. So the waste last year was 85,852 kg. The rise in cases also means a rise in the financial costs of hospitals. For Covid waste, the firm charges Rs 100 per kg while for non-Covid waste, hospitals are being charged Rs 164 per bed. Many private hospitals with no storage facilities for biomedical waste have been urging the firm to make more trips a day. The firm has also increased lifting time of garbage and it has been working from 8am to 8pm. Besides, it has increased both manpower and vehicles for lifting the waste. From 40 employees and two vehicles, the firm has now engaged 90 employees and 20 vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rising-cases-leads-to-84-rise-in-biomedical-waste-in-city/articleshow/81902704.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Recently, four persons cheated an employee of an Apple store at a mall in Gorwa of Rs 3.2 lakh by sending him fake payment message through a bulk SMS service. The three made purchases worth Rs 3.2 lakh from the store while the fourth scamster sent the SMS from Mumbai. On Saturday, two of them, identified as Akshesh Panchal and Mohit Rajput, both residents of Ahmedabad, were arrested. On March 25, Panchal, Rajput and their unidentified accomplice went to the store one after another and purchased two iPhones, a smart watch, a charger, power adapter and screen guard for phone. While making the payment, all of them preferred UPI mode of scanning the QR code. The store employee received SMS regarding the transaction of all three of them, following which he gave out their invoices. Two days later, the employee received a call from the head office telling him that the payment for the purchases made by the trio had not been credited to the bank account. When the employee called the accused’s phones, they were not reachable. Later, he approached police and lodged a complaint of cheating at Gorwa police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/four-pull-off-rs-3-lakh-upi-fraud-at-apple-store-2-held/articleshow/81901849.cms||---

Justice G R Swaminathan passed the order on a batch of petitions filed complaining of irregularities in the process of allocating plots. The petitioners stated that a notification was issued inviting applications for allotment of industrial plots. All interview calls were made only through mail, that too at short notice. Allotment order was issued on the day of the interview itself when the process of screening also by the screening committee was not completed so as to declare the screened and eligible candidates. The petitioners alleged that the allotment of plots was made with the interference of political parties. Due to these reasons, the allotment order is not sustainable. Stating that such an allotment is nothing but gross violation of natural justice, the petitioners moved HC Madurai bench challenging the allotments made and sought to reallot the plots by following procedures. The petitioners also sought interim injunction restraining the authorities from confirming the allotment and handing over possession of the plots till disposal of the petitions. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/interim-injunction-on-allotting-sidco-plots/articleshow/81902701.cms||---

The health secretary in his counter affidavit had stated that the issue with regard to dumping of bio-medical wastes in Tamil Nadu from other states has been discussed during the state advisory committee meetings and instructions were given to local authorities and TNPCB for taking actions.The panchayat president in his counter affidavit had stated that pursuant to the complaint made by the petitioner, a team of officials inspected the spot. But, there was no waterbody in the place mentioned by the petitioner and the land is classified as government poromboke. The place was used to dump waste and there was no medical waste dumped in the area, the affidavit stated.A division bench of Justices M M Sundresh and S Ananthi said that the counsel appearing for the petitioner had photographs to show that bio-medical waste is still found in the area. However, the special government pleader produced the proceedings of the Trichy district collector dated February 18, indicating that administrative sanction has been made to construct a building to deal with the problem.The judges observed that we could see a joint inspection was made and thereafter, monitoring was done to prevent the dumping of waste including the bio-medical wastes. However, there is no indication of continued inspection.Hence, the judges directed the authorities to carry out inspection once a month at the area and also directed to complete the construction of building in the area within a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/inspect-monthly-to-prevent-dumping-of-bio-med-waste-hc/articleshow/81902697.cms||---

As per the records, the revenue earned is approximately Rs 160 crore higher than the previous financial year. A senior official said, “We have achieved good results in earning revenue against the fixed target of Rs 10,500 crore. Jaipur zone has earned the maximum revenue of Rs 3,845 crore. This is 98.25% against the fixed target.” The state government this time decided to e-auction composite liquor stores (where IMFL and country liquor are sold at the same shop), instead of making allotment through lotteries. An official said, “Out of total 7,665 composite liquor stores in the state, the department has completed the allotment process of 5,833 liquor stores. It is expected to earn the revenue of Rs 10,500 crore once the allotment of all the shops is completed.” For the entire year, the state government plans to earn Rs 13,500 crore after making amendment to the excise policy. Officials said, for the first time, the state government has allowed setting up of micro-breweries in the state. “Hotels, malls and other establishments after setting up micro-breweries can offer fresh beer without preservatives like glycerine that are added to extend the shelf life of bottled beer by six months. We are receiving many queries for the establishment of the new setup. We are hoping to earn good revenue after fixing the fee soon,” an official added. Sources said relaxation has also been provided to establish bars and this would also be a source of revenue generation. “Now, a bar can be opened after obtaining the licence of hotel and restaurant from the local body. The mandatory provision of having a commercial plot to open a bar has also been removed. After this move, there will be spurt in bars in the city,” added the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/excise-dept-earns-rs-3-8k-crore-after-e-auctioning-jaipur-liquor-stores/articleshow/81902698.cms||---

Sohail Khan (35) collapsed on the ground while running between the wickets. He was rushed to SMS emergency ward and was declared ‘brought dead’ by the doctors. Khan was a resident of Topkhana Walo Ka Raasta in Kotwali police station area. Lal Kothi Police reached the hospital after learning that a man died while playing and asked the doctors to send the body for post mortem. The move was opposed by Khan’s friends calling it against their religious beliefs. Police were adamant to take the body for autopsy since they suspected foul play. Terming it as natural death, Khan’s friends refused to give permission for the post mortem. They forcibly attempted to take the body with them. Police from SMS police post also rushed to the spot and tried to stop them from taking it without the formalities. “In a fit of anger, the friends damaged the glass window of the emergency gate. They started screaming at the hospital staff and police,” said an eyewitness. “The family of the deceased was accommodative and asked the friends to do not to create a ruckus. The eyewitnesses say death was caused due to him falling on the ground and refused any foul play,” said Surendra Singh, SHO, Lal Kothi police station. The unruly scenes sparked fear among patients and resident doctors. Later, police and the hospital staff asked the relatives to write an application seeking an exception from post mortem. “The body was released to the relatives,” said police, who confirmed that no one was injured during the ruckus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/youth-dies-playing-cricket-friends-create-ruckus-at-sms-hospital/articleshow/81902706.cms||---

Police identified the arrested suspects as Shabnam Hanif Shaikh (30) and her aides, Mohammed Hussain Mohammed Sharif Qureshi (23) and Salim Murtuja Shaikh (33), all residents of Lohegaon. A search is on for a fourth suspect involved in the crime. “Shabnam was simultaneously involved in relationships with Jagtap, who had a few body offences to his name, and another man. Jagtap was pestering her to leave the other man. Thus, Shabnam and the other suspects hatched a plot to kill Jagtap,” senior inspector Gajanan Pawar of the Airport police, where the crime branch has registered a case, told TOI. “Owing to the night time travel restrictions, most people in the locality were in their house. Some of them rushed to check the matter on hearing Jagtap’s cries from an open plot near his residence,” Pawar said. “Some of these witnesses saw a man and a woman swiftly moving into a car and driving away. The car had a sticker ‘Lady Don’ pasted on its rear windscreen and some people in the area were familiar with whom the car belonged. We have recovered Shabnam’s car used in the crime, but are yet to recover the murder weapon,” Pawar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-two-aides-held-for-hacking-man-to-death/articleshow/81902709.cms||---
---||Madurai||Containment yet to be enforced in Madurai||Madurai: The city corporation is facing a tough time as compliance from the general public on following Covid-19 norms has been poor, even in the 11 containment zones announced in the last few days. Residents in the respective streets say they do not know that it is a containment area as they come out and spend time without wearing masks or keeping physical distance. An official from the corporation health department said that sealing a street off completely is not feasible as there will be many people from the area going out for work, unlike during the lockdown when they were confined to their houses. Another issue they raised was non-compliance to safety norms like wearing masks, which is prevalent across the state. The official added that they don’t have any clear instruction as of now on what precautions or restrictions have to be implemented in the containment zones, adding that they are currently busy with election work and will focus on it after voting day. A casual visit to the containment streets gives an impression that the residents here are least bothered with Covid-19. Children are seen playing together, elderly gather and chat while people go on for walks together without masks. Most residents do know that at least three people from the same street have tested positive. Deputy Collector Colony 6th street in KK Nagar was the first containment zone announced four days back, but residents are unaware of it. “We play like every day. No one has asked us to stay at home or wear a mask. We have not been told about covid infections in the street,” said one of the children playing together in the street on Sunday morning. S Manickam, a resident of VOC 1st Street in Tahsildar Nagar, a containment zone, said, “We did not know anything about Covid-19 infections in our street. There has not been any information from the officials. We have not been asked to restrict our movement nor have we seen any disinfection activities.” Except for zone 3 in Madurai Corporation, all the other three zones have started reporting cases in double digit since the beginning of April. Zone two, which consists of some elite residential localities, has been reporting the highest number of cases. For instance, out of the 58 cases reported in the city on Saturday, zone Two alone accounted for 26 cases, which is 45% of the total cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/containment-yet-to-be-enforced-in-madurai/articleshow/81902711.cms||V Devanathan

A call from Udaipur collector to all communities to participate in the vaccination drive, four days ago, has shown tremendous results as the medical department is flooding with requests from various samaj, groups and institutions for holding vaccination camps at their locations. More than 25 organisations have voluntarily held vaccination camps in the last four days and the daily average of inoculation in the city periphery has increased from 8,000 to a whopping 30,000 persons per day. Around 25 per cent of the target, i.e. 45+ age group, have been vaccinated in just four days. Against the target of 8.99 lakh people above 45 years, a total of 2,24,743 have been vaccinated so far. From April 1 onwards, the state government had launched a vaccination drive for people aged 45 years and above. Seeing the reluctance and hesitation of the public, Udaipur collector Chetan Ram Deora had appealed to the head of the communities and samaj to come ahead and motivate their people to get themselves vaccinated and win the battle against corona. The call made an impact and communities stepped ahead. Jain Social Group, Sindhi Samaj, Dawoodi Bohra Samaj, Muslim community, Vipra Foundation, Gujarati Samaj, Bhatt Mewada Samaj etc held camps at the community buildings and religious places where a large number of people turned up to take the shots. “People who are hesitant, reluctant, distrusting, or otherwise not motivated with respect to being vaccinated need encouragement from society to make them realise that vaccination decision is right for them. Public engagement will only play a central role in building confidence in the Covid vaccines,” Deora said. Zilla parishad CEO Dr Manju, ADM (administration) OP Bunkar and CMHO Dinesh Kharadi have been assigned the task of monitoring these camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/udaipur-collectors-appeal-raises-vax-drive-pace/articleshow/81902708.cms||---

Locals attacked the cops with batons and even pelted stones. Additional force was called in and the situation was brought under control.  Several villagers have been detained and an FIR was registered against 46 identified and around 150 unidentified people under the sections of rioting and other acts.  The local youth’s wedding was called off as all the men in the village were either arrested or had to flee. The youth was supposed to get married to a girl from an adjoining village in Rampur on Saturday but now he is also missing from the village. Police said that model code of conduct is into effect and no such arrangements are permitted. Police were informed that the dancers were called to lure the voters for upcoming zila panchayat elections. Five policemen, including a sub-inspector, sustained injuries during the clash. This incident was reported from Kishanpur village under the jurisdiction of Shahbad police station.  A feast was arranged by one Ameer Hussain on the eve of his wedding and a few dancers were called to perform in front of the guests. Locals said that it is a ritual which is followed in every wedding. Nearly 200 people from three villages had gathered to enjoy the performance of the dancers when local police outpost in-charge Pushpendra Kumar along with constable Sudheer Kumar arrived on the spot and asked them to stop. According to the police, a few villagers were inebriated and misbehaved with the policemen and later many villagers charged at them. The women in the village alleged that police acted against innocent people. The actual culprits who misbehaved with police belong to another village. Police had vandalised their household items and their men had run away fearing police action. Shahbad SHO Shivcharan Singh told TOI, “The villagers chased our team that initially went to stop the dance party but locals charged at the team and forced them to run away. Thereafter additional force was sent to the village on the instructions of the seniors and nine persons were arrested. We have registered a case under sections 147 (rioting),148 (rioting with deadly weapons),149 (unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant), 269 (unlawful act likely to spread the infection of any disease),323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant in the discharge of his duty), 336 (negligent act to endanger human life), 353 (assault to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty), 427(committing mischief), 504 (intentional insult), 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC along with section 3 of the Epidemic Act". Additional SP Sansaar Singh said, “We had to send extra force after the villagers refused to stop the dance party but the locals turned aggressive and attacked our police team which is why we had to take action in retaliation to ensure law and order. Nine people have been arrested and sent to jail.” Watch Watch: Villagers clash with police for stopping stage dancer’s show in UP's Rampur||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/violent-clash-between-police-villagers-for-stopping-stage-dancers-performance-in-ups-rampur-five-cops-injured/articleshow/81901222.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

He said there is no other interpretation of his statement issued earlier on Monday. “I was clearly talking about operation of essential shops only. Essential shops will be allowed to remain open as per the government and Nagpur Municipal Corporation notifications from 7am to 8pm,” said Raut. Earlier, BJP city president Pravin Datke had issued a released stating that Raut is giving conflicting statements. “The statement of Raut about opening of all shops has created confusion among city traders,” he said while demanding a clarification from the district guardian minister. Datke said due to the Covid surge in city, the BJP supported the new restrictions announced by the state government and NMC, but demanded clear statements from Raut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/all-non-essential-shops-shut-from-april-6-30-nitin-raut/articleshow/81919218.cms||---

A call from Udaipur collector to all communities to participate in the vaccination drive, four days ago, has shown tremendous results as the medical department is flooding with requests from various samaj, groups and institutions for holding vaccination camps at their locations. More than 25 organisations have voluntarily held vaccination camps in the last four days and the daily average of inoculation in the city periphery has increased from 8,000 to a whopping 30,000 persons per day. Around 25 per cent of the target, i.e. 45+ age group, have been vaccinated in just four days. Against the target of 8.99 lakh people above 45 years, a total of 2,24,743 have been vaccinated so far. From April 1 onwards, the state government had launched a vaccination drive for people aged 45 years and above. Seeing the reluctance and hesitation of the public, Udaipur collector Chetan Ram Deora had appealed to the head of the communities and samaj to come ahead and motivate their people to get themselves vaccinated and win the battle against corona. The call made an impact and communities stepped ahead. Jain Social Group, Sindhi Samaj, Dawoodi Bohra Samaj, Muslim community, Vipra Foundation, Gujarati Samaj, Bhatt Mewada Samaj etc held camps at the community buildings and religious places where a large number of people turned up to take the shots. “People who are hesitant, reluctant, distrusting, or otherwise not motivated with respect to being vaccinated need encouragement from society to make them realise that vaccination decision is right for them. Public engagement will only play a central role in building confidence in the Covid vaccines,” Deora said. Zilla parishad CEO Dr Manju, ADM (administration) OP Bunkar and CMHO Dinesh Kharadi have been assigned the task of monitoring these camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/udaipur-collectors-appeal-raises-vax-drive-pace/articleshow/81904897.cms||---

Assistant police inspector Santosh Koli of the Chatushrungi police told TOI, “Local volunteers and the ResQ Charitable Trust shared video footage and photographs of the man engaged in the act and registered an FIR against him. We arrested him at 9 am on Sunday under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which makes sexual activities “against the order of nature” illegal as well as the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.” The canine is currently under rehabilitation at the RESQ Charitable Trust Centre in Bavdhan. Koli said the man would perform the act at a society’s parking lot in Model Colony. After being notified about the incident, Neha Panchamia, founder and president of RESQ Charitable Trust and member of Pune District SPCA, put together a team with cameras and volunteer a few days ago to track the culprit. “We needed proper eye witnesses, evidence to catch him and have a solid case. On day three of tracking him, he was finally caught on footage walking suspiciously towards the dog, picking her up in his arms and carrying it inside a secluded parking lot. He was then caught in the act on camera. We then took the canine under our care,” said Panchamia. Section 377 of IPC involves punishment with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years. He will also be liable to fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-arrested-on-grounds-of-performing-sexual-act-on-dog/articleshow/81902716.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Chennai||Chennai, you are breathing microplastic!||CHENNAI: If you stopped having seafood after studies showed microplastic in fish sold in Chennai, you still can’t breathe easy. A new research has found that Chennaiites may be inhaling microplastics, more so those in the southern parts of the city. Microplastics can enter the human body through ingestion and inhalation and may cause a wide range of diseases affecting the lungs, heart, nervous system, immune system and hormones. Some are also carcinogens that could cause cancer. The study by researchers at Pondicherry University and Cochin University of Science and Technology found more than 200 particles of microplastic of less than 5mm across in every 100g of street dust samples collected from 16 localities in the city. They were found in higher quantities on streets of the densely populated south Chennai (265.4 +-76.76 particles in 100g dust). In the more industrialized North Chennai, the average was comparatively lesser (190.4 +- 83.38 particles in 100g of street dust. Researchers tracked the sources of these microplastics to packaging materials to non-stick coatings on cooking pans and stabilisers used in food and beverages as well as binders used in cosmetics. Suja P Devipriya, corresponding author of the study, said 92% of the microplastics found in the dust were fragments, which could have possibly disintegrated or broken down from bigger plastics either dumped in landfills or spilled while being transported and later circulated through air. In urban areas, microplastics could be tracked to road littering, surface abrasion of tyre treads and paints used on the road. “What makes microplastics more dangerous is that heavy metals and chemicals could get deposited on the surface of these particles to form inhalable toxins. We found several trace elements on rough surfaces of smaller particles which could be associated with vehicle exhaust,” Devipriya said. These particles could enter the human body either through inhalation and through ingestion when the dust gets settled on materials that come into direct contact, for instance, when children put toys in their mouth. Analyses of the fragments found nine types of polymers which were traced to their sources. For instance, 24% of the fragments were polyvinyl chloride or PVC which is used in packaging, floor and wall coverings, electrical wires, consumer goods, bumpers and interiors of automobiles, furniture coverings, nozzles and medical applications like blood bags. And 19% were polytetrafluoroethylene used as non-stick coating on utensils, pipes and containers of reactive and corrosive chemicals and cellulose microcrystalline, which is used in food as stabiliser, fat substitute, emulsifiers and anti-caking agent, beverages, pharmaceutical as binders and cosmetics. “We also found more LDPE (low-density polyethylene) used in plastic bags and HDPE (high-density polyethylene) used for making food and beverage containers, toys, and household cleaning products as well as cellulose used in the textile industry,” said Arunkumar Patchaiyappan, a co-author of the study. The sources could be linked to high presence of microplastics in south Chennai localities like Velachery which is densely populated and has more service industries like retail and hotels where the maximum of 408 particles were detected in 100g of dust. The lowest was found in samples in North Chennai which mostly has houses and factories. Samples collected from Moolaikadai were found to have just 17 particles per 100g of dust on the streets. Though the health impact of inhaling microplastics is yet to be reported, experts advocate strict implementation of ban on single-use plastics and a behavioural change among people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-you-are-breathing-microplastic/articleshow/81903404.cms||U Tejonmayam

Prohibition enforcement wing personnel are on their toes to prevent bootlegging of liquor from neighbouring Puducherry and its enclave Karaikal towards Tamil Nadu. Madurai city police have formed teams to prevent illegal liquor sale as they have seized more than 1,150 liquor bottles in one of the big catches in a day so far and arrested 97 people. 97 separate cases were registered against the violators. In a major seizure, the Thilagar Thidal police arrested one person and seized 159 bottles from him. The Prohibition Enforcement Wing alone registered 32 cases. Although the Tasmac administration had warned employees against bulk sales in view of the elections, bootleggers procured bottles allegedly using their connections with employees. The police can only restrict the sale of these bottles now, said a police officer. There was complete disregard for Covid-19 precautions as crowds thronged Tasmac outlets from Saturday evening. As the situation went out of control, Tasmac employees closed early. Some of the shops shut at 8pm although the usual closing time is 10 pm, a police inspector from Anna Nagar range said. Election officials in Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai districts that share immediate borders with Karaikal have constituted a team each comprising police officials to receive complaints pertaining to the smuggling of liquor. “For the last 10 days, our teams are conducting vehicular inspections along the borders to prevent bootlegging. So far, no major seizure was made, complaints were also low this time. Vehicule inspections will be intensified on Monday,” said R Muruganandam, divisional excise officer, Mayiladuthurai. Compared to previous elections, officials said that bootlegging attempts have dwindled this time. There are 12 surveillance teams in both Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai districts additionally monitoring the movement of vehicles on district borders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/1-2k-bottles-seized-97-held-in-madurai-as-police-step-up-vigil-on-bootlegging/articleshow/81902719.cms||---
---||Pune||NCL to get 3rd genome sequencing lab in Pune||PUNE: The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has decided to step up genome sequencing of the coronavirus by setting up a laboratory at the city-based National Chemical Laboratory (NCL). This will be the third such facility in the city, after the ones at National Institute of Virology and National Centre for Cell Science. CSIR director-general Shekhar Mande on Sunday said NCL will get adequately trained staff as well as funding. Mande said the facility will help researchers gain insights into the different variants circulating in Maharashtra. Mande further said the government should prepare for a third wave of the pandemic, blaming “complacency, mass gatherings and careless attitude” for the ongoing case surge. Mande said CSIR has stepped up sequencing activity because some mutants were spreading rapidly in Maharashtra. “The two variants — L52R and E484Q — are known to be virulent. These are California-like mutations and our national level consortium has already sequenced over10K samples,” he said. Mande said these mutations might have been carried into Maharashtra by travellers. “Genomic surveillance is going on and we can alert the government so that the carrier can be quarantined immediately to avoid further spread,” added Mande. Every district collector has been sent a format for sampling by the central task force. Mande expressed support for the idea of a lockdown, but said it needs to be balanced as it has a huge impact on economic activity. “A partial lockdown also works well where many infections are found in a particular area. Night curfew also helps prevent citizens from gathering outside, especially at commercial establishments, hotels and restaurants,” Mande said. Mande further that there was little evidence currently to suggest vaccines do not work on mutations. the definite benefit of the vaccine found that vaccination reduces the intensity of the disease. “Vaccines cannot completely protect against the infection, but definitely shield against extreme events,” Mande added. Historically, Mande said, pandemics have come in waves. “a third wave in India cannot be ruled out and we must be prepared,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ncl-to-get-3rd-genome-sequencing-lab-in-pune/articleshow/81902721.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Ruby, who runs a chikan embroidery startup, RF Creation, with at least two dozen employees, says her unit now fetches a turnover of Rs 1.5 lakh per month which used to be her annual income before coronavirus pandemic. Crediting the success of her startup to easy loan access provided to her by the government, Ruby said, “There was a time when I was struggling to survive and expansion was the only solution. Fortunately, I came across the advertisement of state government’s one district, one product (ODOP) scheme and contacted the office of district commissioner of industries (DCI) last July after lockdown. The team helped me secure a bank loan and further guided me to expand my business.” Similarly, three interior designers – Ruchi Srivastava, her cousin Ritu Vaish and Akhilesh Tiwari of Kalyanpur –started a joint spice manufacturing and packaging unit after lockdown. The brand, Swaad Bhog, currently employs at least 10 people. “All this became possible due to easy loan sanctioned to us under the CM Yuva Swarozgar Yojana. Local authorities and bank guided us in our endeavour,” said Ruchi (37), co-owner of Chinhat-based Shree Industries. Like RF Creation and Swaad Bhog, there are many small scale startups in Lucknow which were provided loan worth Rs 5,103 crore, against the target of Rs 2,215 crore, by the consortium of 30 banks and their 957 branches in financial year 2020-21. Talking to TOI, the lead bank manager of Lucknow district, Vinod Mishra, said: “A total of Rs 8,538 crore against the target of Rs 10,663 crore, was given as loan under various categories to revive the local economy of Lucknow after lockdown.

Further, in case of nursery and primary schools, they have not been able to collect even 5% of fees. It is unfortunate to see that no financial aid has been provided,” said the statement. The association appealed the government to bear 50% or at least a minimum percentage of cost of salaries for staff during the pandemic. Further, the FePSA demanded for the payment for RTE admissions in 2020-2021, which is to be paid before the end of April. The association also put forth several other demands, including waiving of road tax and insurance premium for school vehicles until reopening, promoting and upgrading recognition for all nursery and primary schools with RTE seats ans middle schools. They also urged to not allow admission of private school students without issuance of Transfer Certificate to Class I, VI, IX and XI in government schools this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/private-schools-seek-financial-support-citing-struggle-for-survival-amid-covid/articleshow/81902727.cms||---

Delhi government has proposed to undertake several projects to increase the availability of drinking water. Kejriwal said, “Our aim is to increase the availability of clean drinking water to every household in Delhi. For this purpose, we have to expedite all the ongoing projects related to wastewater reuse and groundwater recharge.” He asked the officials to expedite negotiations with neighbouring states to exchange treated wastewater for drinking water. One of such projects involves exchanging treated water with Haryana for clean water. A senior official explained that 25 MGD (million gallons per day) treated water would be diverted from Rithala Sewage Treatment Plant to the Auchandi canal in return of the same amount of clean water that will be received from Haryana for drinking purposes. Similarly, 140 MGD of treated water will be provided to UP for irrigation purposes, in return of an equal volume of clean drinking water. A senior DJB official said the CM also reviewed various projects of groundwater recharge occurring through lakes and waterbodies and instructed the department officials to submit timelines of water extraction from the areas where the groundwater levels are high. Kejriwal reviewed the progress of the upgradation of 13 common effluent treatment plants too. DSIIDC officials said that the department was working on a scheme to convert CETP’s outlet water into drinking water by installing RO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-speed-up-projects-for-recharge-of-groundwater/articleshow/81921468.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This condition would prevail mainly due to a rise in temperature in the neighbouring southern states,” a senior IMD official said on Sunday. On Sunday, the Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories recorded 38.4°C and 38.9°C, which were above normal by 1.3 and 0.9 degrees, respectively. The meteorological department has already warned of a heatwave for the Vidarbha region from April 5 to 7. “We have advised people against venturing out between 11am and 4 pm due to the extreme heatwave-like conditions. Some of districts in Marathwada and Madhya Maharashtra would also record high day temperatures in the next 72 hours,” the official added. Meanwhile, officials from the state agriculture department said that the rise in day temperatures was not conducive to the growth of leafy vegetables, like fenugreek, coriander, and spinach, and summer fruits like lime, watermelon and muskmelon. “The excessive heat develops black spots on the outer shell of the summer fruits, which ripen early. In some places, the head has affected mango plantations,” an official from the agriculture department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/day-temperature-to-hover-between-37-38c-for-the-next-few-days-imd/articleshow/81901899.cms||Sandip Dighe

Rampur SP Shogun Gautam told TOI the liquor was meant for distribution during the panchayat polls. During a joint operation by excise department officials led by excise inspector Virendra Singh and local police led by Milak SHO Anil Kumar Singh intercepted a truck on the national highway 24 on Sunday morning and seized 1,000 boxes of illicit liquor, said police. Police said an accused — identified as Mehfoz Ali of Bhot Ka Majra village in Rampur district — was arrested, while three others fled. The SP said, “The accused failed to produce relevant documents and cash memo of the seized liquor. The liquor — 1,000 boxes containing 45,000 bottles — bears the brand name ‘Masti’ and is manufactured by Rampur Distillery. A manhunt is on to nab other accused.” Managing director of Rampur Distillery KP Singh, however, said, “Around a hundred trucks and containers loaded with the liquor of different brands were dispatched from the distillery to various destinations with all legal documents, including the permission by the UP excise department. Similarly, the seized liquor was also sent out of the distillery for Kannauj after all legal documentation. The truck is equipped with a GPS. We received information that due to some technical problem, the truck was halted near Milak tehsil, where police and excise department raided it.”Singh added that they would produce the bills, gate pass and other legal documents before the court to get possession of the seized liquor, because “everything is legal from our end”. Police, meanwhile, booked Mehfoz and his three unidentified accomplices under sections 420 (cheating) 407 (criminal breach of trust by carrier) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and appropriate sections of the Uttar Pradesh Excise Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/one-thousand-cartons-of-illicit-liquor-worth-rs-32l-seized-in-ups-rampur/articleshow/81900836.cms||Nazar Abbas

While mass at churches were cancelled, many establishments broadcast celebratory programmes for the day online — marking a quiet Easter with family at home. “Apprehensions about the possibility of a strict lockdown soon have left people in no mood for any kind of celebration. My wife has been feeling a little under the weather with bodyache and weakness so we could not do anything for Easter. We ordered in food and had a good lunch with my daughters and their kids at home together. When we telephoned our relatives to wish them, we found that even they did not do anything this year,” said Pimpri resident Michael Dwyer. Blogger Deepti Borges said, “This Easter has been the worst one for me. I took a Covid test yesterday and my results came back positive today. I have quarantined myself at home. My symptoms are not as severe but I am feeling unwell. My husband and son tested negative so that’s one good thing. We are not having any kind of celebration, just resting a lot and having plenty of fluids.” Content writer Alisha Shinde tried to spruce up celebrations at her home by ordering hot cross buns as her mother could not make them this year. “We didn’t do anything major. We attended mass online for an hour in the morning. Usually, it is a family affair but this year it was just my mother and I. We made biryani at home to have a grand lunch to indulge in a festive feeling.” Business management consultant Anthony D’Souza said, “My wife and I went to Goa for a trip with another couple, who are our friends, and got back on Friday. We asked them to stay over for Easter and had a small intimate party among ourselves. One of our friends was off chicken and alcohol for a month during lent, so it was a feast for him. We made chicken curry and pulao for lunch at home.” “This year was different for us as we watched the service online with our family followed by a nice lunch. Usually, we go to church, meet our friends after the service and hang out for a while. This year, most people just greeted each other with WhatsApp forwards,” said videographer Krishna Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/12-hour-curbs-greet-low-key-easter-celebrations/articleshow/81902754.cms||---

In a rare case, a judicial magistrate’s court in Rajkot turned Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd’s (PGVCL) plea to send a slum dweller to civil prison for not paying electricity bill since he did not have any means of earning. The court of principal senior civil judge P N Navin rejected the plea as money could not be recovered from the man Jagubhai Meniya because he did not own anything. In a way, the court also saved the company’s money as it would have to pay an allowance of Rs 300 per day to keep Meniya in civil prison for a month for recovery of Rs 3,000 from him. The company approached the court in 2019 to recover money from Meniya. As part of the proceedings, when the bailiff went to Meniya’s house, it was found that Meniya did not own anything, so it was not possible to recover any money from him. PGVCL then submitted an application to the court to keep Meniya in civil prison since the money could not be recovered and it was even ready to pay the allowance for it. While referring to the judgements of Supreme Court and Madras high court, the court stated that PGVCL had failed to prove that Meniya had any means to pay the money and that he was intentionally evading the payment. “The debtor (Meniya) can be sent to civil prison if he intentionally evades even after having sufficient means of living,” the court stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/prison-only-resort-if-bill-deliberately-evaded-court/articleshow/81901905.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Soon after Surya posted the tweet, taking a dig at the DMK, the restaurant chain clarified that they were not forced by anyone to provide free food. “In fact, everyone comes forward to pay their bills,” Annapoorna tweeted. Soon, there was a barrage of tweets trolling Surya.“A maskless Tejasvi Surya literally boasting about paying his bill after eating breakfast in a restaurant, as if its some sort of an achievement. Bro, its how normal human beings live in a civilised society,” tweeted Cow Momma.Priya Yadav tweeted that Tejasvi Surya has been nominated for Philip Kotler award for paying his bill. Yet another twitter user said Surya used the restaurant for crass propaganda.Surya, who had visited the district on April 2 to campaign for the BJP women’s wing president, Vanathi Srinivasan, had breakfast at one of the branches of hotel Sree Annapoorna Sree Gowrishankar with his supporters. Soon after breakfast, he tweeted that the restaurant’s cashier was hesitant to accept the money and that he had to insist on accepting the bill amount. “I told him that we are from BJP. A party that respects all and protects all. Not DMk to do roll - call even from small businesses,” he tweeted. Later, he brought the subject in multiple campaign speeches too.“The cashier was hesitant and very scared to take the bill. I said I am not from the DMK, I am from the BJP,” he said at one meeting.Tejasvi Surya was perhaps referring to a 2018 incident when a group of DMK men assaulted a hotel staff in Chennai allegedly after they demanded free food.

---||Ludhiana||BJP’s micromanagement drive begins in Punjab||JALANDHAR: Political parties in Punjab, including Bharatiya Janata Party, have parvasi cells mainly to focus on migrants from other states. However, in a first, BJP has created a special Himachal cell in Jalandhar, the first cell named after a state. According to BJP insiders, the move is part of micromanagement by the party as it is working to expand and consolidate its base in Punjab when it set to go alone in the 2022 assembly elections. There are scores of residents in Punjab who trace their roots in Himachal but are now permanent residents of the state. Sources said that other districts too can have such special cells if the local BJP units feel the need. Punjab unit of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) already has a predominant presence of parcharaks, who are important functionaries of the Sangh, who have roots in Himachal. Jalandhar district BJP president Sushil Sharma, who announced the setting up of the Himachal cell and appointed Devinder Mintu as its convenor, said that the cell had existed earlier too. However, queries from former district BJP presidents Raman Pabbi and Ramesh Sharma confirmed that it did not exist during their tenures and was a new formation. “We want to work more extensively among people originally hailing from Himachal and to strengthen the party base among them,” BJP unit chief Sushil Sharma said. There are a few pockets in Jalandhar, where residents of Himachal origin have been living for decades, and many belong to the second generation now. BJP insiders said the drive is part of micromanagement by the BJP just like has been done in other states. “The strategy is to work in specific pockets of different sections to try to bring them closer to the party for expansion and to influence electoral results,” said a senior party leader. “Districts can have their own cells. Though we have parvasi cell, common perception is that it is meant for people basically belonging to UP and Bihar, who are present in the state in big numbers. Idea is that some section which needs special attention for bringing them closer to the party and for that district presidents have been authorized to form special cells,” said Punjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma and confirmed that the special cell has not been named after any specific state in Punjab except the Himachal cell. It is learnt that there is a significant presence of parcharks in Punjab unit of RSS. “There are not many from Punjab who come forward to become parcharks, which means having a very frugal lifestyle. At the same time, several from Himachal have dedicated themselves as parcharks and that is the main reason for their significant presence in Punjab unit,” said sources in RSS and BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bjps-micromanagement-drive-begins-in-punjab/articleshow/81902774.cms||IP Singh
---||Mumbai||Covid +ve woman defies quarantine rules, travels from Vadodara to Mumbai; booked||MUMBAI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) recently filed a complaint against a Dahisar resident, who allegedly travelled on a train from Vadodara to Mumbai on March 24 despite testing positive for Covid. She was instructed to undergo 14-day home quarantine after getting discharged from SSG Hospital in Vadodara the previous day. The 53-year-old, Taruna Nayak, who is currently at Dahisar Checknaka Covid Centre will get discharged in a day or two. Meanwhile, the authorities are concerned about all those who came in contact with Nayak while travelling on the train from Vadodara. Nayak visited her relatives in Vadodara last month to attend a family ritual when she contracted the Covid infection. “The hospital she was admitted to erred in their responsibility and got her discharged and asked her to undergo 14-day quarantine,” said a BMC official. Nayak then approached her relative but they got her a train ticket to travel back to Mumbai as they did not have the space to accommodate her. “Nayak was helpless and she boarded the train on March 23 and reached Mumbai the next day. A resident and local corporator informed about Nayak’s arrival and tipped off the BMC that they suspect she tested positive. A team went to her Kandarpada home and found out that she had been tested positive. We got hold of the discharge card of SSG Hospital in Vadodara where Nayak was admitted and the RT-PCR test report confirmed she was positive,” said BMC sanitary inspector, Pravin Lad in the first information report (FIR). MHB Colony senior inspector PG Yele said Nayak has been booked. “The woman is currently undergoing treatment at Dahisar’s Covid Centre. Chargesheet will be filed in the court and it will decide the further course of action,” said Yele.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-ve-woman-defies-quarantine-rules-travels-from-vadodara-to-mumbai-booked/articleshow/81903469.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The special operations group (SOG) of Vadodara rural police nabbed the rickshaw driver Salim Fakir Dewan during a vigil on the national highway 48 near Karjan. When Dewan was driving towards Vadodara, SOG sleuths stopped his auto-rickshaw since some packets were kept on its passenger seat. On opening the packets, cops found the marijuana like substance, which was later confirmed as the contraband after an on-spot forensic test. “We are yet to know the source of the drug since the accused has been quarantined and is yet to be questioned,” said a police official. Besides marijuana, cops seized the auto-rickshaw and a mobile phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/autodriver-held-with-marijuana/articleshow/81901915.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Poll heat singes Behala (E) as Trinamool, BJP face off||Kolkata: The poll battle in Behala East reached a flashpoint on Sunday with the two main contestants — actor Paayel Sarkar of BJP and Trinamool candidate and former mayor Sovan Chatterjee’s wife Ratna Chatterjee — reaching the Thakurpukur police station around the same time with complaints of scuffles. They accused each other of instigating violence. Four people were arrested later from both sides. The chain of events started around 11.30am near the Joka Checkpost area. “We had planned a door-to-door campaign with Paayel. At a place close to the campaign spot, a group of TMC supporters suddenly pounced on us with sticks and rods,” said BJP mandal president, Monomoy Biswas. The BJP supporters blocked the Bakhrahat Road to protest the “unprovoked attack” on their candidate, Y-category protectee. The BJP workers also claimed that once the blockade began, the TMC supporters attacked them once again. By the time BJP supporters reached the police station, the TMC mobilized its supporters too. A scuffle reportedly took place for the third time before cops intervened. Sarkar, who reached the police station, alleged that she was attacked inside the police station. “We were campaigning peacefully when the attack took place. They did not spare the women even. Some cops were around, but they did not act immediately. The TMC supporters tried to intentionally hurt me even inside the police station. They tried to throw shoes at me and abused me openly. At least 10 of our workers were injured,” she alleged. Chatterjee, who reached the spot soon after, countered the allegations. “It was the BJP workers who attacked our supporters. One of our female supporters had to be admitted to hospital. They are trying to whip up tension before the polls. This is nothing but a drama that suits a rangamancha,” she said. Police sources said the clash began over setting up of a party camp in Joka near Booth 280. Initially, the BJP candidate informed us that she would arrange door-to-door campaigns with five persons. However, when she arrived, there were four cars, a generator van and 15 bikes in the convoy. There was another attempted scuffle outside the Thakurpukur PS, which was thwarted. We have lodged FIRs from both sides. We will inform the EC about the model code violation by the BJP candidate, who didn’t seek permission,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/poll-heat-singes-behala-e-as-trinamool-bjp-face-off/articleshow/81901923.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Amritsar (rural) senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruv Dahiya said the police recovered 1 FAL 222 rifle with one magazine and nine live rounds, 1 AK-47 rifle with one magazine and five live rounds, one .303 bore gun with one magazine and seven live rounds and one .30 bore China-made pistol with one magazine. Acting on specific input, the police made the recovery from near the border pillar number 99/3 near Border Security Force (BSF) Pul Moran Border outpost, about 10 metres inside the Indian territory from the border with Pakistan. Dhruv said preliminary investigations revealed that the arms and ammunition consignment was pushed into Indian territory by a Pakistani national identified as Bilal. “Bilal is closely associated with Sikh hardliners engaged in anti-India activities. He had been involved in pushing weapons consignments into India earlier as well,” said the SSP. He said further investigations, including technical analysis, was being conducted to unearth the network of Bilal’s foreign and Indian associates involved in the supply and further movement of the consignment. Police have not nominated any Indian smuggler in the case so far. “We are investigating to know about the Indian counterpart of Bilal and others,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/arms-seized-at-pakistan-border/articleshow/81902778.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Chandigarh||True Lies||‘Ghar-ghar jal’ or ‘ghar-ghar nal’? The battle for Mandi has come to puns and former Union telecom minister Sukh Ram’s son and local legislator Anil Sharma has chief minister Jai Ram Thakur in the line of fire. Claiming that the CM’s constituency is well-nursed while his seat has received taps without water, Sharma said he was confused “whether the state government’s slogan was ‘ghar-ghar jal’ or ‘ghar-ghar nal’. Everything was fine till the announcement of the 2019 parliamentary elections. Sharma was power minister in the Jai Ram Thakur cabinet and their relations were cordial. Then Anil’s son, Aashray Sharma, along with grandfather, Sukh Ram, joined the Congress. Aashray became the Congress candidate and Sharma had to quit the cabinet. Now, right before the Mandi municipal corporation elections, Sharma said the CM was now “begging in the streets for votes” because Mandi’s “neglect was evident”. BJP state president Suresh Kashyap has dared Sharma to resign from the assembly and face a fresh election to test his “popularity”. Dear AAP, there’s security in obscurity Heavy security at the Jalandhar Circuit House during their recent press conference was a ‘pleasant’ surprise to the AAP leaders, who felt important all so suddenly. The arrangements were unprecedented indeed, something the Punjab AAP leaders are unaccustomed to. But their happiness was short lived. Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma had come to the Circuit House around the same time and the security was for him. Sharma had not even called any crowd to the venue. Why no mask: BSP’s wellness mantra At rally in Kanshi Ram’s Ropar village, BSP’s Randhir Singh Beniwal was asked why no one in the party wore a mask. Beniwal said he had just made a public appeal to follow the Covid-19 protocol. His workers seemed to have missed it. Beniwal claimed his supporters didn’t want to be caught on camera with masks. About calling a huge gathering amid the pandemic, he claimed: “When (Punjab chief minister) Captain Amarinder Singh was asked if these guidelines were for political parties also, he had refused. The BSP workers are hardy people who drink water out of wells, so they are immune, but we do advise them to take precaution.” When win now is lose later Picking municipal bodies’ office-bearers when the state elections are only a few months away is a risky assignment for the senior Congressmen. There are many recently-elected contenders for top posts at most of the civic bodies, so the MLAs fear that those not given posts might work against them or go neutral when the big game starts. They want to minimise the probable loss to their own electoral campaigns. Now farmers send ‘Khattar to Delhi’ Farmers’ constant opposition of the BJP-JJP leaders has apparently made Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar a frequent camper in Delhi. Before the speculations related to farmers’ impact come true, Khattar clarified in a Chandigarh press conference this week that he wanted to be more accessible to people, so since 14 Haryana districts were in the NCR, in Delhi alone he could be accessible to the maximum people. Hard times for CMO With important functionaries down with Covid-19, file at the Haryana chief minister’s office (CMO) are moving slowly. Only CM’s principal assistant Abhimanyu Rao has returned to work after recovery. D S Dhesi has recovered as well but he will take time to resume duties due to the death of his father. Another active officer is Dr Amit Aggarwal, but he too is recovering. He monitors media planning.

---||Vadodara||‘Ab Main Ration Ki Kataron Mein Nazar Aata Hoon’ poet dies at 82||Vadodara: Mana ki zindagi se bahot pyaar hain magar, kab tak rakhonge kaanch ke bartan sambhal kar (We know that you love life immensely, but how long will you take care of the glassware?) — the man, who wrote these lines that were later sung by ghazal maestro late Jagjit Singh, is no more. Khalil Dhantejvi, one of the most prolific poets in Gujarati language, died at the age of 82 in Vadodara due to age-related issues on Sunday. Born in a poor family in Dhantej village of Vadodara’s Savli taluka, Khalil could not complete his formal education beyond Class IV. But from a very young age he started mastering the art of writing, turned into an author, poet, journalist and columnist. His ‘ghazals’ in Gujarati language have been voiced by many famous singers, like his ‘ghazals’ in Urdu. The poet was born as Khalil Ismail but adopted ’Dhantejvi’ from the name of his village Dhantej. Khalil was known in mushaira circles for his trademark baritone voice and style of rendition.He went on to write ghazals, nazms and even title songs for television serials whenever Singh would ask him if he had something suitable. In 2004, he received the poet Kalapi award. In 2013, he received the Wali Gujarati Ghazal award while two years back he received the Narasimha Mehta award. “I am pained at the death of famous Gujarati poet, writer and ghazal exponent Khalil Dhantejvi. His contributions will always be remembered for making Gujarati ghazal interesting. Condolences to family members and his fans,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet. “He was one Gujarati poet who was as famous in Gujarat as much he was across the country. Penning a ‘ghazal’ is an art, present it is also a different art. He possessed both,” said Dr Bharat Mehta from the Department of Gujarati of M S University’s Faculty of Arts. “He had cleared just class four yet his works were no less than any established, educated or qualified writer. He lived with the power of words. Lok Shala or experience was his biggest school,” said Mehta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ab-main-ration-ki-kataron-mein-nazar-aata-hoon-poet-dies-at-82/articleshow/81901936.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Panel to decide on state snake, spider||Nagpur: The state government has set up an eight-member committee to decide on declaring a state snake and spider. Maharashtra already has a state bird (yellow-footed green pigeon), flower (jarul), tree (mango), butterfly (blue moron), animal (Indian giant squirrel) and mangrove tree (Sonneratia alba). Considering the importance of snakes in nature, and various superstitions and myths thereof, which lead to the killing of snakes, a proposal to declare a state snake was put up by state wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre in the last meeting held on December 4, 2020. The eight-member committee will be headed by APCCF (wildlife), West, Sunil Limaye, and Ramesh Kumar (wildlife), Pune, will be the member-secretary. The other members include field director & CCF (Pench) Ravikiran Govekar, independent researcher Varad Giri, Ashok Kaptan, and representatives of the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) and Botanical Survey of India (BSI). The committee will also delve on what grounds and criteria should be taken to decide on state species of animals. The terms of reference (TOR) of the panel includes uniqueness of snakes to be declared as state reptile, and analyzing the importance of declaring state spider. “Before taking a call the committee will also look into the importance of species, its role and present protection status, and its repercussions,” said sources. According to arachnologist Atul Bodkhe, spider Nephila pilipes, commonly known as golden silk orb-weavers or tiger spider, is commonly found in every tiger reserve. “The panel should consider declaring it as state spider,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/panel-to-decide-on-state-snake-spider/articleshow/81902780.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Chandigarh||Thakur again takes ‘family over development’ dig||Shimla: A day after BJP MLA Anil Sharma accused him of failing to ensure development in Mandi, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said the sidelined legislator preferred family over development of Mandi assembly constituency and that was why there was no development in the area despite him remaining in power for so long. Addressing an election meeting in Khaliyar on Sunday, Thakur said Sharma was asking him to give an account for work done in Mandi. “I am ready to give account of my performance, but question arises that people would also ask for the account of not one person, but the entire khandan (family) of theirs,” he said. Without naming Sharma, the CM said people get annoyed with his words these days, but he had only said he too had sought votes for him. He said in the last assembly elections, atmosphere was such that anyone could have won from Mandi seat on a BJP ticket. He said Sharma had left Mandi midway by preferring family over development of area. “We had given him cabinet status and made him power minister. Even after this, he wanted family, while we wanted the development of area,” he said. He said Sharma was now saying that the CM was wandering the streets for votes. “If needed, I will even visit every household for the sake of my party,” he added. He said when Sharma’s son contested the Lok Sabha elections on a Congress ticket, he could understand his dilemma of not campaigning for BJP then, but now no one from his family was contesting the election. “Then why he is not campaigning for BJP?” he said. Thakur added Sharma was now talking of his vision, but had done nothing so far. “Where is his vision? Has he kept it for some special occasion,” he asked. Sharma had opened a front against CM Thakur and cabinet minister Mahender Singh Thakur by saying that 45% budget allocation under Jal Jeevan Mission was spent in Seraj and Dharampur .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/thakur-again-takes-family-over-development-dig/articleshow/81902776.cms||---
---||Delhi||How keeping parks green is running Delhi dry||NEW DELHI: Even as a political row simmers over the sealing of borewells in municipal parks, the depleting groundwater table is an issue that cannot be easily brushed aside. While the borewell points irrigating the parks are being sealed in accordance with the orders of National Green Tribunal, the civic authorities want the drive to be halted till alternative arrangements are made. The three corporations collectively manage over 15,064 parks with more than 4,000 tubewells being used for irrigation. Jai Prakash, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which manages 6,095 parks spread over 2,159 acres, said the law department had filed a review petition in NGT to consider halting the drive till a new arrangement of getting water from sewage treatment plants was made. The north civic body has 1,862 borewell points, of which 99 have been sealed so far. This has affected over 400 parks, officials say. Delhi government has maintained that the spectre of parks turning barren and contributing to pollution is looming large because of the "mismanagement and misrule" of BJP even as Delhi Jal Board provides free treated wastewater. The civic functionaries, on the other hand, have blamed DJB for the sealing drive. Leader of the house in South Delhi Municipal Corporation, Narendra Chawla, claimed that DJB was ordered by the green tribunal to arrange water tankers for the parks. SDMC has 6,872 parks in its jurisdiction and uses 1,398 tubewells. Of these, 167 have been sealed so far. Senior civic officials say that while treated wastewater from DJB may be available for free, transporting it in a separate fleet of tankers will be costly affair. According to estimates prepared by the civic bodies, north corporation will need 540 tankers of 5,000-litre capacity to replace borewell-based irrigation, which will involve an expenditure of Rs 162 crore annually. Similarly, SDMC will need 600 tankers and an annual cost input of Rs 180 crore. Of the three corporations, SDMC has taken the lead in creating new mini-STPs to replace the old borewells. Officials say 132 parks are currently being irrigated using STPs and 56 tubewells have been closed as a result of this initiative. In east Delhi, around 474 borewells have been closed while 20 tankers are being used to irrigate key parks. A recent Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) report has stated that Delhi’s groundwater table is declining at a rate of 0.2 metres each year. In some parts of Delhi, mostly in south and southwest Delhi, the groundwater table has fallen to around 80 metres below the ground level. In joint surveys conducted by DJB and the revenue department, 12,350 illegal borewells were identified till March with the maximum concentration in the North West and South West districts. Only the Central district in Delhi is currently in the “safe zone” with all remaining districts either in “critical” or “over-exploited” categories, according to CGWB. It is clear the two-year-old NGT order to create alternative irrigation arrangements from STPs has not been acted upon with the urgency it required. CGWB has also pointed out that in almost 15% of the capital, groundwater now lies at a depth of 40-80 metres. In almost all of south Delhi and parts of central and east Delhi, the volume of groundwater withdrawn is much higher than what is replenished. A Delhi Parks and Gardens Society (DPGS) official said they were already providing financial assistance to parks up to Rs 3.5 lakh to set up decentralised sewage treatment plants, which could water parks as well as cater to other localised demands. However, borewells need to be shut down completely to comply with the directions. A study by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has advocated water harvesting in parks and open spaces of Delhi as a way to augment the drainage system and also address issues related to urban flooding. Spread over 8,000 hectares, Delhi has more than 16,000 parks and open spaces where stormwater harvesting can be implemented, CSE has stated. The city has the potential to harvest 12,800 million litres of rainwater every year. Instead of being points of crisis, the NGT order can be used to make these green spaces water conservation hotspots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-keeping-parks-green-is-running-city-dry/articleshow/81901938.cms||Paras Singh
---||Kolkata||Over 2 yrs after blaze, Bagri Market ready to rise from the ashes||KOLKATA: The section of the Bagri Market on Canning Street, where a fire raged for 60 hours in September 2018, is ready to do a phoenix. Extensive repairs and renovation of Block A of the market, in which 200-odd shops, offices and godowns were completely gutted, is nearing completion. Around 100 shops have been handed over to the shop-keepers for fitment. Fire safety equipment, including smoke detectors and sprinklers, are being installed in the other shops that are expected to be handed over in a few days. “Of the eight blocks, the A block facing Canning Street was the worst affected as the fire had continued to burn there for three days. Even after 72 hours, there were fire pockets in this block. The heat was so intense that concrete pillars and beams had developed cracks. There were doubts about the structural stability of this block,” recounted Bagri Market Central Kolkata Traders’ Welfare Association president Ashutosh Singh. In months that followed, experts from IIT Roorkie, IIT Kharagpur and Kolkata Municipal Corporation inspected the damage, conducted tests and chalked out a repair plan. While the extreme heat had caused concrete to flake off, the steel joists used in the construction of columns and beams had stayed intact. “High quality Belgian steel used during the building construction in the 1960s had withstood the heat without any damage. So, all the concrete was stripped off along with the walls. Then steel jacketing was done and repair was carried out with micro-concrete that is 10-times more strong than the reinforced cement concrete that is usually used,” an engineer overseeing the repair said. Of the Rs 20 crore spent in the entire market, around Rs 14 crore has been spent to rebuild the A block. While the rest of the market reopened on April 25, 2019, work on the A block started only in July 17, 2019. “We have not only installed state-of-the-art fire safety equipment and changed all the electrical wiring, a new SOP has been put in place to ensure there is no encroachment in the corridors. We have employed two fire officers and two electricians to ensure compliance at all times and meet any exigency,” said market association core committee member Girish Vasandani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/over-2-yrs-after-blaze-bagri-market-ready-to-rise-from-the-ashes/articleshow/81901945.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Nagpur||CBSE parents too want auto-promotion to next class for kids||NAGPUR: CBSE school parents are demanding automatic promotion to the next academic level for their wards, on the lines of the state board announcing it for Std I-VIII students. The state education department has taken multiple ‘student-friendly decisions, citing the Covid-19 pandemic and the various levels of ongoing restrictions in many districts as the reason. On Saturday, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced that all students up to Std VIII will be promoted to the next academic level without an exam. For Std IX and XI, a decision will be taken soon. The remaining students, of Std X and XII, will appear for their board exams as per schedule. Parent of a Std VI student, who attends a well-known CBSE school in Wardhaman Nagar, said there needs to be a uniform policy. “The decision taken by the state government is fantastic and I can only hope that CBSE follows through with a similar policy to benefit our kids,” said the parent. CBSE, however, won’t be making the decision unilaterally, rather it will follow instructions from the Ministry of Education. Last year too, education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal had made the announcement directing CBSE to promote all students up to Std VIII. That decision was made in the first week of April last year, so it’s expected that soon something similar will be announced. The reason decisions are taken separately for students up to Std VIII, is because they come under the purview of the Right to Education (RTE) Act. This act mandates that no student be held back till Std VIII. So, even if a student fails in the final exam, remedial classes and re-exams are taken till he/she clears the test. Eventually, every school pushes kids onwards to the next class. Since Std IX-XII are outside of RTE’s purview, students have to appear for exams and qualify for the next academic level. While Std X and XII students appear for board exams, it’s the Std IX and XI students who have to clear their institute’s internal exams. So it’s for these students that the Maharashtra government is working out a strategy, where they can be assessed without the need for them being called to school. As per sources, CBSE school students can expect a similar decision this month itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbse-parents-too-want-auto-promotion-to-next-class-for-kids/articleshow/81905540.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The local TMC has denied charges saying none from the party was involved in the attack. “In his complaint, Paul stated that it was on April 2 around 5.40 pm that the accused persons — one of them identified and 20 others — being the leader & supporters of TMC, in furtherance to their common intention, wrongfully restrained the complainant Paul and assaulted him by fists and blows and also threatened him with dire consequence in front of Mahabodhi Society Hall in the College Square area. Investigation of the case has been taken up by Amherst Street police,” said an officer at Lalbazar. SFI later lodged a strong protest against the incident. Paul claimed that the attack could be due to his campaigning at Madhyamgram for the Sanjukta morcha candidate. The TMC, on their part, denied the charges saying the attack had nothing to do with the Trinamool Congress. “A probe will establish the truth,” said a party functionary in central Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/presidency-sfi-boy-alleges-assault/articleshow/81901953.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||Magistrate has no role in DV case if parties not sharing household: HC||Nagpur: Where there is no domestic relationship between a woman and her in-laws after marriage, the magistrate has no jurisdiction to entertain a case under Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, said the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court. Upholding plea by two couples for quashing proceedings against them under Domestic Violence Act, the high court has slammed a woman’s attempt to settle score against her in-laws over soured business deal.A woman had filed a case under the DV Act seeking criminal proceedings against her two sisters-in-law and their spouses. She had not named her husband in the complaint. A magistrate had allowed her application.The aggrieved couples approached the high court for quashing the proceedings, saying the husband-wife duo was trying to settle score against them using the DV Act. They contended that in the absence of a domestic relationship between the complainant and them, the magistrate was not having any jurisdiction to entertain the woman’s application under Section 12 of the DV Act. “A plain reading of the application reveals that the woman isn’t a distressed woman. Rather, she and her husband are attempting to abuse the DV Act provisions to settle their alleged monetary claims. In view of this, the proceedings (against four petitioners) are liable to be quashed and application under Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code deserves to be allowed,” said Justice Rohit Deo.“I’ve noticed propensity of over implication and roping in all members of the husband’s family in wife’s application. Such over implication needs to be nipped in the bud,” Justice Deo observed. He added that a bare reading of the woman’s application reveals that the parties didn’t reside together in a shared household.“What is more disturbing is that the magistrate issued notice mechanically. There was no domestic relationship between the petitioners and the woman as would empower the magistrate to take cognizance of her application. The wife isn’t an aggrieved person and recourse to DV Act is clearly misconceived,” said the HC.After the petitioners demanded exemplary cost on the woman citing unwarranted trauma and agony, the judge said it would be more appropriate if they institute proceedings before the appropriate forum. “The petitioners should agitate a claim of compensation and/or damages, if so advised, which shall be considered on its own merit, uninfluenced by any observation herein,” said Justice Deo.WHAT THE HC SAID* A plain reading of wife’s application reveals she isn’t a distressed woman* Couple is attempting to abuse DV Act to settle their alleged monetary claims* Noticed propensity of over implication & roping in hubby’s all family members* Such over implication needs to be nipped in bud||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/magistrate-has-no-role-in-dv-case-if-parties-not-sharing-household-hc/articleshow/81902831.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The Gujarat Ecological and Education Research (GEER) Foundation has successfully implemented a pilot project to rejuvenate the grassland spread across 2,500 sqkm area and also help resuscitate livelihood of the Kutchi cattle breeders. Around 600 hectare (ha) land in arid Kutch has been rejuvenated and blossoming with grass now! The foundation started work under the National Fund for Climate Change (NFCC) project in 2018 and has so far created a seed bank of 38 native species over the period of last two years with the help of local cattle breeders. According to various researches, the grassland productivity has dipped to a mere 620 kg in 2009 from the 4,000 kg per hectare yield in 1960. The area under the grassland too got reduced to 63,000 ha in 2009 from 1.42 lakh ha in 1989, according to the report. A study finds that the major threat to the pastoral economy is also from uncontrolled livestock grazing and if the current condition continues, the area under grassland is feared to decrease by 23,000 ha land by 2030. The result is destruction of many indigenous species of grass. The GEER Foundation has started re-cultivation of native species of grass. Director of GEER Foundation, RD Kamboj said, “We came up with the idea of creating a seed bank where we could provide native grass seeds to the entire banni region. Under this project, plantation has been done in 600 ha in nine villages of Banni. We collected 6.69 lakh kg of grass, of which 3.46 lakh kg was collected by the villagers.” Grass plots, after rains have become lush green and got good grass collection for fodder in December 2019 and January 2020. GEER Foundation team first removed the gaando baval through machinery, and thereafter tilled the open area before planting the native grass species. They have so far planted more than 10 types of native species of grass in the fenced project area to protect these from grazing animals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lifeline-for-asias-finest-grassland/articleshow/81901959.cms||---

This has raised a major concern among forest officials as the sanctuary houses rare, near-extinct animals like the Alpine musk deer, Himalayan tahr (bovines found in Himalayas), Himalayan griffon (a vulture native to the Himalayas), Himalayan black bear (a subspecies of the Asian black bear found in the Himalayas) and snow leopards as well as trees like oak, birch and rhododendron.  As per data provided by the forest department, a total of 9,550 trees have been gutted till now in the fires which began in October last year and forest ecosystems spread over 1,359.8 hectares have been adversely affected Meanwhile, the Centre on Sunday directed use of two IAF choppers as well as National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel to be deployed to help in dousing the flames. The state government had written to the defence ministry on Saturday citing “a worsening situation of forest fires” and had asked for two IAF helicopters, one each to be stationed in Garhwal and Kumaon. Home minister Amit Shah on Sunday tweeted about the forest fires, saying “The central government has issued an order for immediate deployment of two choppers and NDRF teams in Uttarakhand...”. CM Tirath Rawat had spoken with the home minister earlier in the day. “While one chopper would be stationed at Tehri — to cover areas under Garhwal region — the second one would operate from Almora and Nainital and cover the Kumaon region,” the CM told TOI. The CM also held a meeting with officials from affected districts as well as police and disaster management departments. Officials have been asked to distribute kits of torches and firefighting equipment at the block level, so villagers can also be roped in to fight forest fires. Four human and seven animal deaths have been officially recorded till now due to the forest fires.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/raging-fires-gut-uttarakhand-forests-kill-4-iaf-set-to-join-dousing-ops/articleshow/81904811.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Shashikala, who shone in shades of gray, dead||Shashikala, who left an indelible imprint playing characters that the audience loved to hate in the Hindi cinema of 1960s and 70s, passed away in Mumbai on Sunday. She was 88. "We don't know the exact details of her demise," BN Tiwari, president, Federation of Western India Cine Employees told PTI while confirming the news. The Solapur-born actor’s career spanned over six decades and 175-odd films and TV serials. Shashikala Jawalkar (later Saigal) endured a deprived childhood and struggled for years doing minor parts before finding a semblance of a foothold with V Shantaram’s Teen Batti Char Raasta (1953) and Surang (1953). It was Bimal Roy’s Sujata (1960) where she lip-synced with Nutan, ‘Bachpan ke din bhi kya din thhey’, that drew attention and earned her a first Filmfare nomination for “best supporting actress.” The Sixties was her most rewarding decade. Oldtimers remember her fleeing sandals in hand to avoid her domineering mother (Lalita Pawar) in Junglee (1961) to sing, ‘Nain tumhare mazedar’, with Anoop Kumar. Shashikala earned a mindboggling eight Filmfare nominations (Sujata, Aayee Milan Ki Bela, Himalay Ki God Mein, Anupama, Neel Kamal and Phool Aur Patthar) and two awards (Aarti and Gumrah) for “best supporting actress”. She received a nomination every year from 1963 to 67. For negative parts such as a manipulative sister-in-law or a woman in cahoots with the villain, she was the producer’s first choice. The movie that earned her major recognition was Rajshri’s debut production, Aarti (1963). “Shashikala gives a memorable performance as (the) bitter, scorpion-tongued sister-in-law,” said The Times of India review. In Phool Aur Patthar, she memorably essayed a dancer determined to get the man she loves (Dharmendra) at any cost. In times when actors were tied down by an image, breaking the mold wasn’t easy. But Shashikala often delivered nuanced performances. In BR Chopra’s Gumraah, she played the mysterious secretary of Ashok Kumar. The role required her to keep the audience guessing and she succeeded with aplomb “playing a colorful role in a colorful manner”, as TOI wrote. In Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Anupama (1967), she was again excellent as a talkative girl who displays her sensitive side in the final reels. Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s Khubsoorat (1980) too offered her the off-beat part of a married woman whose desire to dance is suppressed by a disciplinarian mother-in-law (Dina Pathak). In later years, Shashikala also acted in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham and the TV show, Jeena Isi Ka Naam hai. Among those who mourned her death on social media were Lata Mangeshkar, Padmini Kolhapore, director Anil Sharma and Farhan Akhtar. “She essayed every kind of role with felicity,” Mangeshkar tweeted in Hindi. Shashikala had received the Padmashri in 2007.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/shashikala-who-shone-in-shades-of-gray-dead/articleshow/81903588.cms||Avijit Ghosh
---||Coimbatore||Campaign dust settles down||Coimbatore: The high decibel canvassing of votes for the 2021 assembly polls came to end at 7pm on Sunday, as candidates ended the campaign with a punch. Political parties opted for everything from bike rallies to processions and additional poll promises, hoping to leave a mark on the minds of the voters. DMK’s N Karthik and BJP leader Vanathi Srinivasan organized two-wheeler rallies, while the MNM had its top boss’ daughter Akshara dancing to the beats of a music band during a door-to-door campaign with aunt Suhashini Maniratnam. AIADMK’s S P Velumani, accompanied by his son, made a fervent plea to the residents of his locality to vote for him. The Congress had its general secretary Gundu Rao accompanying the party’s lone candidate in the district, Mayura Jayakumar, for the last leg of campaign at Puliyakulam. Coimbatore MP and veteran left leader P R Natarajan also joined the Congress leaders in the campaign. “I have travelled across the state for canvassing votes. There is a clear DMK wave,” said Dinesh Gundurao, as the Congress ended its electioneering at Puliakulam. Kamal’s daughter Akshara, who has been in the city taking care of the actor after he developed leg pain, accompanied aunt Suhashini for the campaign at Amman Kulam locality. As they went door-to-door seeking votes, Akshara jumped into an impromptu dance to the tunes of a music band. Suhashini too joined her and shook a leg for a few minutes, as the crowd cheered. “Vote for torchlight for an honest, corruption free, progressive government,” Suhashini told them. Kamal, meanwhile, was joined by actor Radhika on the last day of campaigning. The message from the MNM’s vice-president, R Mahendran, was not to accept bribes from political parties in exchange for votes. “Don’t sell your votes,” he said in Singanallur, as he ended the campaign. S P Velumani sought the public to keep away ‘rowdy elements’ from grabbing power and vote for development, while his opponent Karthikeya Sivasenapathy appealed to end ‘Velumani’s corruption’ by voting for the Rising Sun. There were tense moments as well on Sunday, as the AIADMK and the DMK men gathered at the same spot at Vadavalli to wind up campaigning. Scores of AIADMK men thronged the bus stand area, where the DMK was campaigning, sparking tension, which was eventually diffused by police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/campaign-dust-settles-down/articleshow/81902832.cms||Mayilvaganan
---||Kolkata||Porn movie dealers lay OTT trap for aspiring models||Kolkata: Bidhannagar Police, which is probing a leaked porn video of an aspiring actor from Bongaon, has received fresh complaints of some aspiring models and actors receiving dubious offers in the name of various OTT platforms. Kolkata Police, too, have received several such complaints. The arrest of “producer” Subhanjan Roy led police to understand the modus operandi of the gang. Four others of the gang have also been arrested. “The accused had been involved with selling porn videos to various websites. He would target aspiring models and actors — mainly women — from various training schools in the city. The women mostly hailed from towns around Kolkata. He would offer bold roles for top OTT platform movies and call them for audition. He would then record it. Although the women would agree to filming on condition of not showing their face, the accused would crop the real face and sell it out to some websites. Each video fetched them big bucks, ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 2.5 lakh. Even the still photos earned them huge money,” explained an officer. “They were arrested while shooting a similar video with another woman at a New Town hotel. The woman was rescued and search is on for the rest of the crew members,” he added. Police have asked people not to fall prey to such gangs. “One needs to be careful what deal they are getting into. A thorough background check is the need of the hour,” said an officer. The police said that many had approached them after the arrests began to take place in a span of one week. The space, where the clip was uploaded, is one of the most-visited porn sites and is among the top 10 most-visited sites in the world.“We emailed the website and followed it up, after which they pulled the video down. We kept tracking the activities of the group and finally caught them red-handed,” the officer added. The complainant had received a call last year from Roy, who introduced himself as film producer and offered her a role in a web series. “She was called to a New Town hotel and coaxed into shooting a nude video. The accused promised not to capture her face. But in December, she found her clip on the site and came to us,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/porn-movie-dealers-lay-ott-trap-for-aspiring-models/articleshow/81901967.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Some of these organizers were told that programmes were cancelled at the last moment as the VMC did not have enough doses for the vaccination drive. The Jain Swetambar Murti Pujak Sangh had organised such programmes at three different venues while the Raghuvanshi Lohana Mahajan had also scheduled a vaccine camp. Some professional training institutes had also organised camps for their members to administer the vaccine but were cancelled at the last moment. VMC officials, however, said that there is no shortage of vaccine doses in the city. Refuting all allegations of shortage as baseless rumours, Dr Devesh Patel, VMC medical officer said, “As on Saturday, we had 15,000 vaccine doses. On Sunday, we received another 50,000 doses after which the total number of doses has reached 65,000. There is no question of any shortage of vaccines.” He said that the staff involved in the vaccination drive has been working continuously without any break. “We have to provide some rest to them as well. From Monday, the vaccination drive will continue with full force,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vaccine-holiday-in-vadodara/articleshow/81902041.cms||---
---||Goa||Over 400 farmers affected as sluice gate gives way in Chorao, saline water destroys crops||BICHOLIM: On Friday, twin sluice gates ‘katar khazan’ and ‘kawa khazan’ broke down in Chorao in Bicholim taluka, leading to saline water entering the fields. The incident has left chilli and vegetable crops damaged, affecting over 400 farmers, who have threatened to hold an agitation against government authorities for ignoring their pleas to repair the sluice gates. The road leading to the Pomburpa ferry point in this area has also been left inundated causing hardships to pedestrians and commuters alike. The farmers and villagers have demanded that the state administration immediately take up repairs of the sluice gates or face an agitation. Locals said that ‘katar khazan and ‘kawa khazan’ had weakened over the decades with time. “About 450 farmers are undertaking agriculture in the area for the last several years. In recent years, seeing that both these gates have become weak and may breach at anytime, the farmers have been repeatedly demanding with the state government authorities to undertake repairs. However, the government had not paid any heed to our demand. Today’s situation has arisen because of negligent attitude of the administration,” said a farmer Sanjay Kandolkar. Sluice gates are a simple mechanism, devised centuries ago to maintain flow of saline water into and out of rivers. This helps regulate salinity levels in the khazan lands, enabling cultivation here. Another farmer Dasharath Mapari said that all efforts of the farmers have gone in vain due to damage caused to their chilli, banana and vegetable crops. “Now we do not know which authority to approach for these damages,” he said. The farmers have demanded with the Mayem ZP Shankar Chodankar and local MLA Pravin Zantye that their issue be addressed at the earliest. “We will resort to an intense agitation if the authorities fail to undertake repair of these sluice gates at the earliest,” said Kandolkar. Only last year, farmers around ‘kava khazan’ in Chorao had managed to repair three breaches in a bundh with the help of government authorities and managed to stop the flow of saline water into their fields. The fields, which had been uncultivated due to the saline water ingress, were then tilled after a gap of one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/over-400-farmers-affected-as-sluice-gate-gives-way-in-chorao-saline-water-destroys-crops/articleshow/81903676.cms||---

No casualty was reported in the incident and the flames were jointly doused by firefighters, police and local residents within half-an-hour. Abhay Singh, circle officer, Haridwar, told TOI, “The fire broke out in the hut of a daily wage worker. The workers were cooking food on the stove when the grass of the thatched hut caught fire. However, we managed to control the blaze in time.” The camps of Bairagi seers are located not too far from the spot where the fire broke out. Pramod Kumar, a daily wager whose hut was gutted in the fire, told TOI, “We have lost everything and have no money now. We are forced to live under the open sky now. The government should provide us with some monetary assistance.” A similar incident took place last month in the Kumbh area when 40 huts were reduced to ashes. Back then, local activists with the help of Kumbh Mela officials had provided the affected daily wagers with food and clothes. The workers have been deployed for Kumbh Mela arrangements. Many of them have come from outside Uttarakhand in search of work and live in temporary structures along the Ganga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/fire-breaks-out-in-kumbh-mela-area-15-huts-of-daily-wagers-gutted/articleshow/81901297.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Delhi||HC refuses to give corpn more time to clear salary dues||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Monday rapped the municipal corporations and AAP government over delay in paying salaries, noting that such dues were a fundamental right of employees or retirees. It also dismissed a plea by North Delhi Municipal Corporation to extend the deadline to clear arrears of staff, which the court had last month fixed for Monday. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli rejected an application filed by the corporation seeking extension of time to clear arrears of salaries and pension of serving and retired employees of all categories from April 5 to April 30. “The right of employees to get salaries and pension is a fundamental right. The right to get salaries and pension is a part of right to life and liberty under the Constitution” the bench observed, underlining that non-availability of funds can’t be a ground to deny salaries on time. “The north corporation has employed the personnel to render their services. It is for the corporation to find ways and means to pay its employees,” it said, citing its March 9 order where it directed all the three municipal corporations of Delhi -- east, north and south -- to ensure all the arrears of pension and salaries of all the ex-employees and serving staff of all categories were cleared on or before April 5. HC had in its earlier order also directed Delhi government to make payment of the remaining amount due towards BTA to the three corporations as per its revised estimate by the end of financial year 2020-21, that is, March 31, 2021. But the north corporation argued that the amount had been paid by the government only after making some deductions. It informed HC that pension and salaries of all employees till January 2021 and sanitation workers till February this year has been paid. Senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, representing Delhi government, said it was the only government that was not getting grants from the Centre to pay municipal corporations and that they had to manage their own affairs also. But the bench was not impressed. It remarked,“You cannot run away from your responsibilities...this is not a time to make these adjustments and recover money from them. You can’t shrug off your liabilities.” HC also questioned why the issue of shortage of funds was raised when, simultaneously, full-page advertisements are taken out. “We are not living in ivory towers. Spending money in these difficult times on propaganda. Is this not criminal? You will gain more goodwill by ensuring payment of salaries to these employees,” it said, listing the matter for further hearing on April 27. The court was earlier informed that as per the revised estimate of Delhi government, the amount payment by the state to EDMC, SDMC and the north corporation towards BTA was Rs 864.8 crore, Rs 405.2 crore and Rs 764.8 crore, respectively, in the financial year 2020-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-refuses-to-give-corpn-more-time-to-clear-salary-dues/articleshow/81921569.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune: Careless day trippers start forest fires, 81 calls so far||PUNE: The fire brigade received as many as 81 emergency calls of forest fire and grass catching fire on the hills located in and around the city in between January and March, this year. The officials said a majority of such fires were caused by amateur trekkers and weekends picnickers. Last year, they received 105 calls of forest fires and grass fires. A large number of trees, many of which were full grown, were gutted in a forest fire early in March at Wagholi hill. The trees had been planted in 2016 by senior citizens, school and collegians as well as other citizens. Pune city fire brigade chief Prashant Ranpise,.“Most of these calls came on Saturdays and Sundays. Of the 81 calls, over 60 were received on weekends. They reported fires from the areas of Bopdev ghat, Sinhagad Road, Katraj, the hills in Warje, Wadgaon, Baner, Chatushrungi and other places,” Pune city fire brigade chief Prashant Ranpise. Last week, forests and grass located on the hills around Khadakwasla reservoir, Bopdev Ghat, Katraj, and Baner hill caused panic among the local residents. “Though nobody saw the visitors or trekkers setting the grass ablaze, we presume that people visiting the areas either threw cigarette butts or lit matches into the dried grass which caught fire. Local residents informed fire brigade personnel that they had not torched the grass,” Ranpise said. No one was injured in these fires but there has been extensive damage to the trees on the hills, he said. “At many places, including the areas of old and new Katraj ghat sections, people throw garbage along with the road. Some people torch the garbage to destroy it but after a while, the fire spreads to the dry grass and then it goes on increasing and covers a huge swathe of the forested area,” fire brigade officials said. People should not throw any garbage, especially paper, plastic and food on the road sides. This causes real problems, the firemen said. Environmentalist Sachin Punekar said, “Such fires only take place between January and April. The forest officials and revenue officials and other government agencies should prevent them. Forest guards can be temporarily hired for these four months to protect the hills and forests.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/careless-day-trippers-start-forest-fires-81-calls-so-far/articleshow/81901969.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: School students yet to get cycles under govt scheme||JAIPUR: The students of government schools are yet to get bicycles under a scheme which was launched for promoting girl child education and increasing enrolment. The bicycle distribution scheme started for the girl students passing out of Class VIII to provide a mode of transport to such students especially in rural areas to reach school for continuation of studies. Due to the distance in secondary schools, many girls used to drop out because of this. While the current session 2020-21 came to an end and Class IX examination will being from April 24, girl students are still waiting for the bicycle. After the results are announced, these girls will reach Class X and without bicycles, the girls are not getting benefit of the scheme. Due to this government lethargy around 3.50 lakh girls are affected by it. A senior government official anonymously said that most of the year schools were closed and with pandemic across the city government didn’t get time to think about the cycles when the entire department was busy with dealing pandemic. Schools, however, have been functioning since January, and it was announced by the education minister Govind Singh Dotasra that even in the Corona period there is no plan of the state government to stop the schemes that will benefit students. But despite the announcement, the cycle distribution schemes yet to be implemented. Narayan Singh Sisodia, president Rajasthan School Evam Panchayati Raj Shikshak Sangh, said, “It seems like that after milk distribution scheme, the government is ready to stop the cycle scheme as well. The scheme started as a project to boost the girl child education in the state but with such delay in the process its purpose is lost. I hope it will resume this year.” Coronavirus affected millions of life with people going jobless and amidst these difficult times, it is better for the government to re-start the scheme that will benefit the girl child further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/school-students-yet-to-get-cycles-under-govt-scheme/articleshow/81901972.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: In Mewat, vaccination remains a challenge||CHANDIGARH: Mewat continues to be a challenge for health authorities in Haryana in terms of vaccination for Covid-19, as the number of vaccines which have been wasted crossed 12% till Saturday and the number of people getting vaccinated stayed low. In all, 20,220 vaccine shots have been consumed, against allocated 37,421 shots. According to the state health department’s Covid-19 bulletin, 18,250 persons, including all categories of healthcare workers, frontline workers and persons of the age group of 45 years and above, could get the jab. A traditional mindset of locals against any kind of vaccinations, absence of private institutions and NGOs, and inadequate awareness campaigns are said to be the reasons behind the few takers for the vaccination. Younis Alvi, a former zila parishad member, said, “Like other districts, there had not been sufficient awareness meetings with villagers, clerics and locals, even for motivating them for vaccination. This is agreed that due to literacy level, people here have become reluctant (about getting vaccinated), but they are equally concerned about their health and lives. We have not seen any such move where public figures have got themselves vaccinated for Covid,” he said. Meanwhile, Haryana assembly deputy leader of opposition Aftab, who too comes from Mewat, hit out at the district administration. “Even I have not been offered vaccination once by local authorities? Such campaigns need awareness campaigns. We are sure if popularised, this vaccination will be a success here as well,” he said. Nuh civil surgeon Dr Surender Yadava remained inaccessible. When contacted, deputy commissioner Dhirendera Khadgata admitted to a low turnout, but largely reasoned non-availability of private medical institutes. “See, there are doubts about the vaccine. Despite all efforts, we struggle to achieve vaccination targets. Unlike other districts, where you have a lot of private medical institutes and clinics, we have only one such institute here. This is also a reason. Else, we are on the job,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vaccination-continues-to-be-a-challenge-in-mewat/articleshow/81902836.cms||Manvir Saini

The accident shook three others in the group so much that they consumed poison and committed suicide. The youths, who hailed from Kundi village in Bhilangana block of Tehri district, had gone to hunt wild fowl in the Cholah Tok forest near their village on Saturday evening, Kuldeep Shah, in-charge of Ghansali police station, said.Disaster struck the group when one of the youths, Santosh Panwar, 19, was hit by a bullet which was accidentally fired from a muzzle-loading rifle carried by another youth, Rajiv Singh, 22. “Rajiv is believed to have lost his balance and fell down, and in the process, the bullet went off, killing Panwar on the spot.” sub-divisional magistrate of Ghansali, PR Chauhan told TOI. Providing further details, Chauhan added that seeing their friend dead, the other youths went into a state of panic. “First, they brought back Santosh’s body from the jungle to a cowshed near the village. They were so stricken with grief and a sense of guilt over the incident that they decided to shoot themselves as well but then changed their plan. Three of them —Arjun Singh, 23, Pankaj Singh, 24, and Soban Singh, 23, consumed pesticide. They were taken to Baleshwar community health centre, where they were declared brought dead,” he said. Meanwhile, Rajiv Singh who was carrying the gun has gone missing.

The satellite imagery obtained from the Forest Survey of India (FSI) on Sunday shows how forests are on fire, causing huge habitat destruction for wildlife and damage to our environment that will aggravate problems caused by climate change. According to FSI statistics, Maharashtra continues to be one of the leading forest fire-prone state with a number of fire incidents doubling from 22,499 in 2019 to 44,809 in 2021. These fire alerts are mostly for the period from January to March. “The year 2020 was a silver lining with overall 6,342 alerts owing to rains. All these fires are man-made ahead of season for tendu plucking and mahua flowers collection,” said senior forest officials. Gadchiroli circle, where tendu leaves interest is high, tops with 16,800 fire alerts, followed by Thane (5,857), Chandrapur (4,847), Kolhapur (4,616), Nagpur (2,270), Pune (1,850) and Yavatmal (1,581). Fires are being reported from even tiger reserves and sanctuaries that are considered to be most protected. There were 1,028 fire alerts in Wildlife (East) consisting of Tadoba, Pench, Bor and Navegaon-Nagzira in 2021. State wildlife board member Kishor Rithe said, “The data of fire monitoring shows zero fires in 2020 at several places. This may be due to stringent lockdown last year. Though fire season in Vidarbha starts in February, most of the fires occur in March ahead of the tendu season. The 2021 fire data portrays a grim picture and calls for a need to tighten protection mechanism in the areas where there is an increase in fires as the next two months are crucial.” According to environmentalist Suresh Chopne, forest fires no more remain confined to damaging only forest and wildlife. “Its environmental damage cannot be calculated in monetary terms. The large-scale fires expose chink in the armour of the forest department. Fires are largely of anthropogenic origin and therefore preventable to a large extent. Despite spending crores of rupees on prevention and getting real-time alerts, the state forest department has failed to control them.” “Chandrapur district is already the most polluted district in the country due to polluting industries and coal mines. These forest fires increase air pollution. The district exceeds in particulate matter and forest fires will further worsen the situation, causing trouble for villagers,” said Chopne. According to various studies, said Chopne, the annual losses from forest fires for the entire country have been moderately estimated at Rs450-500 crore. “This estimate does not include the loss suffered in the form of biodiversity, nutrient and soil moisture, and other intangible benefits,” he said. Eco-Pro president Bandu Dhotre said, “There are many forest fires this year. This raises doubts whether fire protection works were done or not owing to funds crunch. There are several fires at one spot and seems to be an act of revenge.” “These fires have affected plantations and vegetation in a big way. From an ecological point of view, these fires are dangerous. High smoke concentrations can also be a very serious matter, particularly near homes of people with respiratory illnesses or near healthcare facilities,” said Dhotre. Sources said Bramhapuri division witnessed huge fires affecting tigers and their prey. “I have sighted a couple of tigers leaving the Sindewahi forest area in search of safe heaven as their habitat has been completely gutted near a canal in recent surface fires,” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-forests-on-fire-in-jan-mar-heavy-loss-of-wildlife-habitat/articleshow/81902864.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Cops push for better use of underground parking space in Connaught Place||NEW DELHI: Traffic police met with New Delhi Municipal Council officials to discuss how to deal with chaos in Connaught Place and manage surface parking. A senior traffic police official told TOI that in a discussion with traders sometime back over decongesting markets, several points were highlighted. “The points included proper utilisation of the underground parking lot at Palika Bazar. The parking has some issues that need to be rectified, such as proper lighting and hygiene,” said the official. “These points were raised in a meeting with NDMC officials. The civic body also carried out surveys in the area, but we have not received any update yet.” According to the official, traffic congestion at Connaught Place, especially during weekends, is primarily due to shortage of parking space and less room on footpaths for people to walk because of encroachment by hawkers. “The Palika Bazar parking is utilised by less than 50% of its capacity. Even the multi-level parking system at Baba Kharak Singh Marg is under-utilised, but the surface ones are full,” said the official. “This gives scope for illegal parkings.” New Delhi Traders Association general secretary, Vikram Badhawar, confirmed that a meeting had happened with the traffic police officials about a month ago. “The multi-level parking at Baba Kharak Singh Marg is not practical for shoppers as it is far from the inner circle and no one likes walking so far, specially in summers. However, if the problems at Palika Bazar are fixed, there should be no issues in using that,” he said. Traders said that the old parking lot needs a lot of improvement in terms of lighting, security, hygiene, etc. “The top level at parking is occupied, but people don’t want to use the two underground levels. The levels are dingly, unlit and are unsafe, specially for women, as men can be seen urinating on the walls while using the parking space,” said Badhawar. “In the surface parking, several old cars have been kept for a long time, which need to be removed. Some hawkers even use these cars to keep their supplies.” TOI tried contacting NDMC officials concerned, but received no reply. The traffic police had also suggested fixing the parking charges higher than the usual rates for those parking beyond four hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-push-for-better-use-of-underground-parking-space-in-cp/articleshow/81902037.cms||---

Till Saturday, of the total active caseload in the state, Ranchi alone accounted for more than 56% cases. As many as 49 medical teams have been deployed across the district to visit containment zones to examine the health parameters of infected persons and advise them on medication. Apart from physical visits, doctors are also available on phone and are connecting with patients on video calls if required. Talking to TOI, Ranchi civil surgeon Dr V B Prasad said on the directions of deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan, testing of people employed in commercial areas have been started and till now, around 1,000 samples have been collected. “On Saturday we collected over 600 samples from the city’s busiest commercial centre GEL Church complex. Today (Sunday) we will test employees of a few big garment shops on Main Road. The drive will continue in a phased manner.” Several small commercial shop owners, who have strength of less than a dozen, are being asked to visit Ranchi sadar hospital to get tested. Ranjan said, “We have started conducting tests of high exposure groups to ensure people interacting with customers are not carrying the infection. I personally conducted surprise inspections at the small containment zones in Dangratoli, Netaji Nagar, Mecon colony among others on Saturday to ensure no one is violating the rules.” He further said, “I have directed the incident commanders to ensure banners are put up declaring an area a containment zone and the dos and don’ts are pasted.” On being asked about surveillance of people who have returned from other states, Ranjan said, “A total of 138 persons have returned to Ranchi from various parts of country between March 10 and March 31. All of them have been put on surveillance after being tested. We have also established round-the-clock control rooms which are monitoring their health if they have been kept under home isolation.” A senior official at the district health office said on several occasions, people listed in contact tracing refuse to co-operate and try to mislead the authorities by informing that they have got themselves tested and their reports are negative. “In such cases, we are asking them to produce their reports and if they fail, we are sending a team to collect their samples,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/contact-tracing-on-in-containment-zones-testing-of-high-exposure-groups-increased-in-ranchi-district/articleshow/81901928.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Stopping vax registration for healthcare workers unfortunate||Ranchi: The Jharkhand chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Sunday termed the Union ministry of health and family welfare’s decision to shut registrations for frontline and health workers for Covid-19 vaccination as “unfortunate”. The decision comes at a time when the number of fresh cases is rising exponentially in the state. On Saturday, the state had recorded 873 fresh cases of Covid-19 and seven deaths. “There may still be hundreds of healthcare and frontline workers who are waiting to get themselves registered to take shots of the vaccine. What will happen if these people get infected in the line of duty amid the growing cases in the state?” Jharkhand IMA president Dr A K Singh told the TOI on Sunday. Late on Saturday night, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote a letter stating that the national database has witnessed a 24% increase in the registration of healthcare workers for the vaccination in the past few days. Bhushan also said that inputs were received about ineligible people registering themselves as frontline and health workers to take the jabs. “As per recommendations of NEGVAC (National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid 19), no fresh registrations of healthcare and frontline workers will be allowed,” Bhushan’s letter read. Officials of the state health department on Sunday acknowledged that new registrations have been suspended. Health secretary Kamal Kishore Soan said the state will comply with the Centre’s guidelines. As per Jharkhand’s data, nearly 5.13 lakh healthcare and frontline workers had registered themselves on the Co-WIN portal to get inoculated with Covishield and Covaxin. As on Saturday evening, 4.27 lakh of them had taken their first dozes. “Those who have registered will get the vaccines,” a senior official said. However, the state health department did not have data on how many healthcare and frontline workers are yet to register till date. Backing the Centre’s move, an official of the health department said, “There may have been anomalies in spot registrations at the session sites in Jharkhand too. However, healthcare and frontline workers, who did not register themselves due to apprehensions on the vaccine’s after-effects, can approach the district health machinery. Based on their request, the state can place a request to the Centre seeking allotment of vaccines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/stopping-vax-registration-for-healthcare-workers-unfortunate/articleshow/81902109.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Plaint filed with PMO against former JSACS head for graft||Ranchi: A Jamshedpur-based NGO has filed a complaint with the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) against the former project director of Jharkhand State AIDS Control Society (JSACS), Rajeev Ranjan, for his alleged corruption in terminating and awarding work to certain NGOs under the Targeted Interventions (TI) project which is run by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). Ranjan, an IAS officer of the 2010 batch, was removed from his office in February following an inquiry by the state health department on the corruption allegations levelled by some NGOs. According to the complaint which was received by PMO on April 3, a copy of which is with TOI, the president of Indian Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances Council, Darsh Choudhury, said that Ranjan terminated the services of well-known NGOs which have done good work for over a decade and allotted work to some unknown organizations. The letter also accused Ranjan of corrupt practices in awarding work by ignoring rules and regulations and mentioned that he did this in lieu of money. Choudhury further said that Ranjan appointed several ineligible candidates who did not have the required qualifications and work experience at JSACS. “These appointments were done in direct violations of the NACO for monetary gains,” he claimed. He accused Ranjan of financial irregularities during his tenure as a project director of JSACS and said he awarded a contract of Rs 1 crore to an NGO without seeking the state health secretary’s approval. According to financial regulation, a project director has to seek approval from the health secretary before awarding any contract amounting to Rs 10 lakh and more. Upon contact, Choudhary said, “I have access to the documentary proof of the financial irregularities based on which I have filed the complaint to PMO. I have also forwarded similar complaints to the president’s secretariat, personnel department of state government and will be filing a complaint with Lokpal Jharkhand too within a couple of days.” Meanwhile a few JSACS project managers said things deteriorated after Rajan took over as project director. “Our NGO has been working in TI since 2009 and the year-end evaluation of our work was pretty good. However, a few days after the evaluation we were asked to pay Rs 3 lakh if we wanted to continue with our projects. As we failed to pay the sum our NGO was discontinued by Ranjan,” said a program manager of West Singhbhum-based NGO which works with TI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/plaint-filed-with-pmo-against-former-jsacs-head-for-graft/articleshow/81901896.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Flyers asked to report 3 hrs early at city airport||Ranchi: Amid the surge in new Covid-19 cases in the state capital and across Jharkhand, the health department on Sunday asked the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) management to prepare 250 Covid-designated beds by Wednesday while the city airport has appealed to the passengers to reach the airport three hours before their flight departures to avoid rushes and follow safety protocols. On Sunday, health secretary Kamal Kishore Soan chaired a meeting attended by Rims director Kameshwar Prasad, the institute’s critical care head Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya and other senior officials of the state health mission. During the meeting, Soan asked the Rims authorities to get the beds ready. Rims had over 200 Covid beds during the peak of the pandemic last year but as the cases declined, the beds, which were put up at the new trauma centre, were reduced. Doctors present at the meeting said of the 250 beds, at least 65 beds will have to be equipped with ventilator support. The health department also directed the Rims management to provide nurses and paramedics to attend these beds. After the meeting, one of the doctors said, “Last year, we did not have to worry about manpower as the hospital was shut. But now, the hospital is fully functional and getting extra manpower for these beds will be a problem,” one of the doctors present at the meeting said. Meanwhile, Birsa Munda International Airport director Vinod Sharma said, “Since the re-carpeting work of the runway is underway, flights have been rescheduled before 11 am and after 5 pm. We have been observing that passengers arrived just before their scheduled departures. This is leading to a rush at the entrances as we have to carry out Covid safety protocols for every passenger.” At present, passengers have to undergo thermal screening and sanitization of their luggage before entering the airport premises. Passengers without masks are not allowed inside. “These processes take time and a lot of passengers are missing their flights,” Sharma added.

Ravikumar was miffed after finding that bus drivers were not wearing masks and there were no provisions for hand sanitizers on board the vehicles. While taking a tour of the Jai Prakasha Bus Terminus in Sakchi’s Bhuiyadih on Sunday, the officer blacklisted several buses and admonished commuters who were not wearing masks and flouting social distancing norms. He warned the vehicle owners, drivers, commuters and other staff with penal action if they continued to flout the guidelines. “Wearing mask is a must for every person and sanitization of the vehicle is compulsory. The commuters also need to follow the rules,” he said. Ravikumar’s visit to the terminus came a day after two passengers tested positive. Following the development, the district health machinery has proclaimed that it will sample passengers daily at the terminus. The terminus is witnessing a rush since Holi. Nearly 22,000 passengers take buses to Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal each day from the terminus. After the official’s visit, Jamshedpur Bus Owners Association president Upendra Singh said: “A notice has been circulated to all bus operators asking them to ensure that everyone on board wears masks and the vehicles are sanitized regularly. Passengers won’t be allowed to board buses without masks.” Ravikumar also took stock of the testing arrangements at the Tatanagar railway station later. The district has recorded nearly 20,000 Covid-19 cases since last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-transport-secy-inspects-steel-city-bus-terminus/articleshow/81901871.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A similar situation was witnessed on Saturday when only 3,481 beneficiaries were given the jab across 28 session sites, a stark contrast to Friday’s figures when nearly 11,281 people received the vaccine dose at 101 inoculation centres. Dhanbad DC Uma Shankar Singh claimed that Jharkhand is not getting sufficient doses of the vaccine from the Centre and as a result, the district has now run out the vaccine. He, however, said, “The state authorities have arranged for 10,000 doses of the vaccine for Dhanbad from various districts which should reach Dhanbad by today evening.” “Once we get the doses, full-fledged vaccination will resume,” Dr Das said. Meanwhile, the district Covid-19 control room has once again been reactivated and the administration has released two phone numbers -- 0326-3550460 and 2313035 -- for getting information related to Covid. The administration has also directed all those visiting the OPD of SNMMCH and Dhanbad sadar hospital to undergo a Covid test. Even those arriving at Dhanbad railway station and Dhanbad bus depot need to undergo a test. As many as 31 new cases were reported in Dhanbad on Saturday and the administration has created five containment zones so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dhanbad-runs-out-of-vax-dc-blames-centre-for-low-supply/articleshow/81901882.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ranchi||Private schools defer resumption of offline classes after surge in new cases||Ranchi: Instead of waiting for directives from the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), many schools have decided not to start offline classes from Monday. Following the directives of the Centre and the state, the schools had earlier agreed to conduct offline classes for senior students from the fresh session. But given the unprecedented surge in Covid cases, they have decided not to risk the health of students. Bishop Westcott group of schools has already circulated a message to the students to this effect informing that online classes will continue for Classes KG to X. Sixteen staff members of the group’s girls’ school in Namkom were found infected after a parent-teacher meeting in the second half of March. The coordinator of CBSE schools in Ranchi, Manohar Lal, said that the CBSE schools were unanimous about continuing with online classes and not opting for offline classes as was decided earlier. “We will discuss on Monday about conducting classes but practical examinations for the boards are already going on and these cannot be stopped,” he said. During the last one week, corona cases have rocked several schools in the state. Three schools in Jamshedpur — Loyola Convent, DBMS English School and Andhra Association English School — had to be closed after students and teachers tested positive for the virus. As many as 29 students of Indira Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya in Bundu also tested positive, following which the school was sealed. The secretary of school education and literacy department, Rahul Kumar Sharma, admitted that there was no hurry for the schools to return to the offline mode of teaching but at the same time the department is also worried about the matriculation examination beginning Tuesday. “The practical examinations for Class X will start and these can be organised in a staggered manner, abiding by the Covid norms. But it may be difficult for students to attend the tests if they reside in containment zones,” he said. Sharma asked the deputy commissioners, who are responsible for finalizing exam centres, to keep this fact under consideration while finalizing the centres. He said that to ensure social distancing, the number of examination centers has been increased. Meanwhile, even government departments were looking up to the SDMA for a concrete decision about oprerating schools. A senior official of the education department, unwilling to be named, said that the state had deferred the matriculation examination to May thinking that the infections would further come down. “No one had expected the second wave and since the situation is apparently worse than before, there is no harm if the examinations are further postponed or conducted online,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/private-schools-defer-resumption-of-offline-classes-after-surge-in-new-cases/articleshow/81902098.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

After his death, chief minister Hemant Soren said the second wave of the pandemic has reached Jharkhand and appealed to the public to seriously follow safety rules. Bhaiya, who was a legislator from the constituency twice, was suffering from kidney ailment and was admitted to the critical care unit of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) on March 16. While at Rims, he was diagnosed with multiple complications and infection of the lungs. He was discharged after treatment before Holi, but as his condition worsened, he was brought to the Bhagwan Mahavir Medica Superspecialty Hospital after the festival. The hospital’s medical adviser Anand Srivastava said the former MLA was diagnosed with Covid infection soon after he was admitted and his lungs had suffered significant damage. Bhaiya could not recover from the multiple ailments and breathed last at about 10.30 pm on Saturday. An emotional Soren, who along with his cabinet colleague Mithilesh Thakur visited the bereaved family at the hospital to offer their condolence, appealed to the masses to take the pandemic seriously and abide by all orders of the state and the Centre in following the safety protocols. He said, “The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has already hit Jharkhand and there is a sharp rise in the number of infections everyday. People should not take the situation lightly.” Soren also asked the people not only to maintain social distance and wear mask, but also urged them to get vaccinated “It is through public support only that the virus could be contained,” he added. Condolences also poured in from all political camps. Among them are Union tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda expressed and Speaker Ravindranath Mahto and other ministers. It may be noted that Bhaiya had switched to JMM from BJP in 2009. He had also voluntarily given up his seat to facilitate JMM president Shibu Soren to contest the election so that he could remain in the office of the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ex-jamtara-mla-bishnu-succumbs-to-cov-infection/articleshow/81901946.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The hurry to register properties was catapulted by the speeding up of works for Bhogapuram airport. The situation is such that the eight sub-registrar offices in Vizag city raked in Rs 654 crore in the 2020–21 fiscal, a significant increase from Rs 595 crore in 2019–20. The offices achieved 81% of their total yearly target of Rs 801 crore. The Madhurawada sub-registrar office raked in the highest revenue, Rs 141 crore, followed by Super Bazaar office which brought in over Rs 133 crore. Interestingly, the Bheemili sub-registrar office generated 107% of its target, Rs 61.95 crore. Visakhapatnam district registrar K Manmadha Rao said that there is growing buzz around shifting of the capital to Vizag. The majority of land transactions took place in the city outskirts: Bheemili, Madhurawada and Gopalapatnam and Pendurthi. Developments surrounding the Bhogapuram airport in Vizianagaram district have also created property demand at Anandapur. Vizianagaram district achieved 99% of its property revenue target in the 2020–21 fiscal, bringing in Rs 240 crore out of its target of Rs 241.8 crore. Of the 13 sub-registrar offices, Bhogapuram brought in the highest, Rs 37 crore, in revenue. Vizianagaram district registrar M Srujana said, “We expect Vizianagaram to continue the same trend in terms of property registrations and revenue generation this fiscal as more and more people are coming to buy land and houses in the area between Vizag and Vizianagaram cities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/property-registrations-shoot-up-in-vizag-vzm-in-202021-fiscal/articleshow/81901354.cms||Nalla.Babu

He said Pawan blamed BJP for not securing Special Category Status (SCS) in the past and has joined the saffron bandwagon now. Speaking to the media here on Sunday, Nani asked why Pawan remained silent on the Centre’s decision to sell its stake in Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) to private entities during his campaign in Tirupati for Lok Sabha byelection. He said Pawan should ask BJP as to why it was not asking for CBI probe into attacks on temples in the state even after the state government’s recommendation if at all Pawan and BJP had love to know the facts. “Pawan Kalyan has been trying to whip up the Hindu sentiments while campaigning for BJP. Pawan had earlier found fault with BJP for giving ‘rotten laddus’ in the name of a special package for the state,” said Nani. “It appears that Pawan is doing justice to the extent he is being paid to enact dramas in public. He proved he could act on and off the screen,” said Nani. Nani asked whether Pawan Kalyan knew that former minister YS Vivekananda Reddy was murdered when his close associate Chandrababu Naidu was at the helm in the state. He said it was strange that Pawan was questioning the YSRC government despite knowing that the case is being investigated by CBI which is under the control of Union home minister Amit Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/perni-nani-slams-pk-for-shifting-stance/articleshow/81901363.cms||Samdani MN

The comments were made at an event organised by the International Federation of Indo-Israel Chambers of Commerce (IFIICC) on Sunday to discuss the ongoing business collaborations being pursued through IFIICC's leadership across sectors. “The international business potential backed by Israeli innovation, UAE's visionary leadership and strategic partnership of both nations with India could be $110 billion by 2030,” Ambassador Ilan Sztulman Starosta, Head of the Israeli mission in Dubai, said in a press release issued by IFIICC. Echoing similar sentiments, Ambassador of the UAE to India and Founding Patron of IFIICC, Dr Ahmed Abdul Rahman AlBanna, said that ”UAE and India's bilateral trade is projected to grow from $60 billion in 2020 to $100 billion by 2030. UAE is a gateway to the world and this trilateral with India and Israel could benefit the world”. Dr Aman Puri, Consul General of India to Dubai, said, ”the Indian business community in the UAE could significantly leverage the strengths of this trilateral to boost economic growth of all nations”. Ran Tuttnauer, Honorary President of IFIICC in Israel and Chairman of Israeli Manufacturers Council at Manufacturers Association of Israel (MAI) participated in the event virtually from Tel Aviv. Tuttnauer stressed that “International business through the UAE in collaboration with India using Israeli Innovation will be the future”. IFIICC was launched on December 14 last year and is looking to set up offices globally, drawing the support of the Indian diaspora, the largest in the world. “Innovation and collaboration can help usher in a new, post-pandemic era of sustainable economic growth,” Merzi Sodawaterwala, Founder and Chairperson of IFIICC, said. Kamal Vachani, Honorary President of IFIICC for the UAE and Group Director & Partner of Al Maya Group, noted that “the innovation and economic prospects of this trilateral are endless”. The European business school (ESCP) in a seminar organised recently also highlighted the global potential of trilateral ties between Israel, the UAE and India. The seminar held last month was organised in cooperation with SPJIMR. Established in 1819, the ESCP Business School (École Supérieure de Commerce de Paris) is considered to be the world's first business school. The post-Abraham accords phase normalising Israel's ties with some of the Arab countries has generated a lot of interest in this trilateral partnership with several events organised by various organisations, including leading banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-uae-and-israels-trilateral-trade-could-reach-110-billion-by-2030-top-diplomats/articleshow/81904818.cms||---

---||Goa||Panaji observatory eyes solar energy for its power needs||PANAJI: A solar energy model has been proposed for the second phase of the renovations at the astronomical observatory in Panaji. “The second phase of renovation which will be taken up later will involve making the premises self-sufficient with clean solar energy. We have proposed a solar energy museum, a sundial garden, a weather forecasting station, a scale solar system and more,” said president of the Association of Friends of Astronomy (AFA), Satish Nayak. There will also be an installation of the latitude and longitude of Panaji for visitors to observe from the meridian of the city. The observatory will also have a  reception area where telescopes and sky charts will be kept for visitors. The astronomical observatory in Panaji is situated on the terrace of Junta House, Panaji but was without any enclosed space for its activities. TOI had reported on Friday that the first phase is already complete making the observatory equipped with a mini auditorium, library, observation deck, fully automated dome housing the C-14 telescope, among other facilities. The mini auditorium will be named after AFA founder, Percival Noronha while the library will be named after Aryabhatta – the mathematician and astronomer from the classical age. “Noronha started the observatory with small requests like drinking water and toilet facilities, and after years of struggle we are here. It was his dream to see the observatory equipped with more facilities,” Nayak said. Founded in 1982, the administration of the AFA was carried out from Percival Noronha’s private residence. It was only in 2005 that the state government took cognisance of the decades long request and allotted a room on the fifth floor of the Junta House premises to set up the administrative office for the observatory. In 2016, Alina Saldanha, the then minister for science and technology, initiated the procedure for the upgradation work to be undertaken by Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation. While the paperwork and grant of funds took a few years, the work started only to hit a roadblock due to the pandemic in 2020. It is only this year the first phase of the new observatory stands completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panaji-observatory-eyes-solar-energy-for-its-power-needs/articleshow/81903014.cms||Nida Sayed

Bengal women and child development minister Sashi Panja said Modi, through his sarcastic “Didi o Didi” jibes at public meetings, “insults not only Mamata, but the women of Bengal in particular”. “This is another instance of the numerous ways our CM is being harassed by BJP. This behaviour of the PM is anti-woman, akin to harassment. We will leave it to the people of West Bengal to give a befitting reply to Modi and (Union home minister) Amit Shah,” she added. TMC leader Ananya Chakraborty said Modi showed his patriarchal mindset. TMC’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien said: “ Aman intimidating and making lewd remarks shows little respect for women and the comments are against the only woman CM in India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/people-to-give-fitting-reply-to-modis-anti-women-jibes-says-trinamool/articleshow/81904842.cms||Debashish Konar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: These entrepreneurs help kids be safer, creative, stress-free||BENGALURU: After lengthy breaks in learning during the pandemic, keeping children engaged, emotionally aware and motivated has become a top concern for parents. A new crop of women-led startups is trying to solve some of the challenges by designing modules and platforms for specific age groups. Smitha Pisupati’s venture, Tinkerama, introduces kids to the maker culture and STEM-based activities, while Darshan Bawa’s BodhiShishu offers structured meditation programmes developed especially for young ones. Dr Kanika Sharma’s initiative, Hapchi, educates students about the crucial aspects and nuances of child safety, which schools tend to tiptoe around. All three startups are being incubated at NSRCEL, Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore. NSRCEL runs an extensive ‘Women Startup Programme’. Bengaluru-based Smitha is an electronic engineer who studied at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). She worked in the semiconductor industry for more than a decade before entering the learning and development space. “I lived in the Bay Area in the US from 2012 to 2016, and I loved visiting the tech museum in San Jose. I even volunteered there. The spirit of innovation and building things inspired me to help kids discover that spark,” she says. “When I was a student, marks were never a problem because I, like many others, did rote learning. At one point, I struggled to complete a circuit and that moment stayed with me, eventually playing a small part in my decision to take this path.” Two years ago, Smitha started conducting workshops on maker skills before developing STEM-based kits for children aged 6 to 15. “The idea is to encourage kids to use the materials and create something on their own. You facilitate the process, but you don’t teach. You let them come up with solutions. When they do figure it out, their eyes light up,” she says. Smitha has taught hundreds of students. “I aim to help children express their creativity and personality. Creativity is generally associated with art like painting, but it has many forms. What one needs is independent thinking, critical reasoning and a drive to create something of value, even a prototype,” she explains. She feels the current education system somehow sends a message to students that original ideas are not welcome, and this must change. “I have leased a space to open a playhouse of science. It will be filled with STEM toys like robotic kits and old laptops that children can pull apart and reassemble,” she adds. Smitha is glad she gave entrepreneurship a shot. “It is always a big step — quitting a well-paying job and taking up something that may not be as financially rewarding, at least for a few years. It was a difficult transition, but I am happy I did it,” she says. Mysuru-based Darshan is a serial entrepreneur with a particular focus on wellness. She’s the co-founder of Bodhio, a meditation organisation that designs humanitarian programmes. She started BodhiShishu in 2019 because she believes teaching meditation to children is no longer an option but a necessity, considering the pressures of everyday life. “Sooner or later, everyone has to turn to meditation, whether they are looking for peace of mind, health, happiness or good relationships. If we give the tools of meditation to children early on, they will become rounded adults. They won’t have to strive to be stress-free; it will be their natural state,” she says. Darshan and her husband opened centres in Mysuru, Bengaluru and Noida before the pandemic unfolded. “We took our programmes online then, reaching people around the world,” she says. The startup’s programmes, which employ a play-and-learn methodology, cater to the age group of 4-12. “All our programmes of guided meditation focus on building emotional intelligence. The other part is concentration, which is a given outcome of meditation. Many parents and teachers are struggling with children who are frustrated and stressed because of the Covid-19 situation. Simple techniques can help such kids become calmer,” she says. “We deliver material in the form of animated stories, worksheets and activities that involve a lot of handwork.” Kanika’s initiative, Hapchi, covers issues that schools and parents often shy away from discussing — child neglect, bullying, abuse, peer pressure and depression, among others. Her ‘Be Smart, Be Safe’ programme creates early awareness among children and also connects other stakeholders, who often lack the understanding of sensitive subjects. “Once, my son returned from school and said a session on ‘good touch, bad touch’ was held in the class. He couldn’t tell me much because he was very young, so I tried to do some research. The material available online lacked the Indian perspective. That prompted me to study the issue of child safety and consider writing a book. I finally authored a series,” she says. Kanika believes that teaching the topics on child safety should be a continuous process. “Children suffering neglect or other problems have no proper platform to express or learn from. There is hesitancy on the part of schools to deal with the themes. Schools that show interest take a half step. Basically, someone conducts a seminar and no one knows how much kids have absorbed,” says Kanika. “We need an approach involving schools, teachers and parents. Educating the parents is crucial because they know the best way to communicate with their children.” The ‘Be Smart, Be Safe’ programme seeks to make young minds resilient. “It is aligned with the existing guidelines and the National Education Policy,” says Kanika.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/the-entrepreneurs-helping-kids-be-safer-creative-stress-free/articleshow/81904607.cms||Harsh Vora

Shopkeepers from Sitabuldi, Itwari and Momipura areas had heated arguments with city police and staff of Nagpur Municipal Corporation after they staged a protest in the area wanting to keep their shops open. Tehsil police led by senior PI Jayesh Bhandarkar and assistant municipal commissioner Ashok Patil too faced a tough challenge to convince the shopkeepers to keep their shops shut. On Monday, the NMC announced a partial lockdown from 8pm on Monday till April 30, with complete shutdown on weekends, stricter night curfew and prohibition of assembly of more than five people during daytime. As part of the lockdown, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B ordered shops and establishments dealing in non-essential commodities, restaurants, eateries, malls, theatres, multiplexes and religious places to remain shut. Shopkeepers told TOI that they had been cooperating with the administration since last year. “This lockdown is totally unacceptable as only non-essential shops were once again targeted as if we are responsible for surge in Covid-19 cases,” said a ready-made garment shopkeeper Madhur Jain from Itwari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-civic-officials-face-a-challenge-to-shut-non-essential-shops/articleshow/81930272.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||World||Conspiracy by ex-crown prince to destabilise country busted: Jordan||A senior Jordanian official on Sunday accused the country’s former crown prince of conspiring with foreign elements in a “malicious plot” that threatened national security. Foreign minister Ayman Safadi told reporters that the plot had been foiled at the “zero hour”. “Then it was clear they moved from design and planning into action,” Safadi said. He said some 14-16 people are under arrest, in addition to two senior officials close to Prince Hamzah. Safadi spoke a day after Hamzah, a half brother of King Abdullah II, was placed under house arrest, in a rare public clash between top members of the long-ruling family. The unprecedented incident has raised concerns about stability in a country seen as a key Western ally in a volatile region and drawn an outpouring of support for Abdullah. In a videotaped statement from house arrest, Hamzah accused the country’s leadership of corruption and incompetence. Safadi, who also holds the title of deputy prime minister, said intelligence agents had been observing the plotters for some time and raised their concerns with the king. He said Hamzah was asked to “stop all these activities and movements that threaten Jordan and its stability,” but he refused. Safadi did not identify the foreign countries allegedly involved in the plot. But he said a longtime senior official who has business ties in several Gulf Arab states, Bassem Ibrahim Awadallah, was involved and had been planning on leaving the country. He also said Awadallah had been trying to secure a plane for Hamzah's wife to flee. Awadallah and a second senior official, Sharif Hassan bin Zaid, are among the suspects in custody. “There is a joint coordination between Awadallah and the prince but I will not go into the details,” Safadi said. He declined to say whether the prince would be charged with any crime. Asked whether Hamzah could face charges, Safadi said that for the time being there were “amicable” attempts to deal with him, but added that “the kingdom's stability and security transcends” everything. The plot is totally contained. Our security and stability are not shaken.” The US, Saudi Arabia and Arab countries across the Middle East issued strong statements in favour of Abdullah. The swift show of support underscored Jordan’s strategic importance as an island of relative stability in the turbulent region. While the harsh criticism from a popular member of the ruling family could lend support to growing complaints about the kingdom's poor governance, the king's tough reaction also illustrated the limits to which he will accept public dissent. Labib Kamhawi, a Jordanian analyst, said Hamzah had crossed a red line by indicating he might be an alternative to the long-ruling king. “This is something the king does not accept or tolerate,” he said. “This is why we are now witnessing what has happened. This file is now more or less closed.” Early on Sunday, Hamzah's mother, Queen Noor, expressed sympathy for “innocent victims.” “Praying that truth and justice will prevail for all the innocent victims of this wicked slander. God bless and keep them safe,” she tweeted. In his video, Hamzah said he was visited early Saturday by the kingdom's military chief and told he could not go out, communicate with people or meet with them. He said his phone and internet service were cut and his satellite internet, used to record the message, was being cut off as well. He said he was told he was being punished for taking part in meetings in which the king had been criticised, though he said he was not accused of joining in the criticism. Hamzah then lashed out at the “ruling system” without mentioning the king by name, saying it had decided “that its personal interests, that its financial interests, that its corruption is more important than the lives and dignity and futures of the 10 million people that live here.” “I'm not part of any conspiracy or nefarious organisation or foreign-backed group, as is always the claim here for anyone who speaks out,” he said. “There are members of this family who still love this country, who care for (its people) and will put them above all else.” “Apparently, that is a crime worthy of isolation, threats and now being cut off,” he added. Hamzah is a former crown prince who was stripped of that title by Abdullah in 2004, five years after becoming king following the death of their father, the late King Hussein. Hamzah is a popular figure in Jordan, widely seen as pious and modest. It is extremely rare for senior members of the ruling family to clash so publicly. Whatever damage the crisis might have inside Jordan, however, appeared to have little immediate effect on outside support for Abdullah. US State Department spokesman Ned Price said, “King Abdullah is a key partner of the US, and he has our full support.” The US considers Jordan a major ally, granting it access to military equipment and assistance. US special forces and other troops routinely train with the Jordanians. The kingdom hosts some 3,000 US troops. Pro-US Gulf Arab countries, which have many Jordanians working across public sector jobs, also immediately issued statements backing the king and his government. The state-run Saudi Press Agency said the kingdom's royal court supported King Abdullah's efforts “to maintain security and stability and defuse every attempt to influence them.” Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the UAE similarly issued statements supporting Abdullah. Israel dismissed the turmoil as an “internal Jordanian matter".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/conspiracy-by-ex-crown-prince-to-destabilise-country-busted-jordan/articleshow/81904874.cms||---

Takanori Takeda, who had moved to the city on a work visa in 2019, had met Asang Chang in October that year. Chang, he alleged, identified herself as the manager and co-owner of a karaoke bar in the city. She allegedly told him she was originally from Nagaland but was born and brought up in Bengaluru. Over time, Chang developed close ties with Takeda and introduced her sister to him. They also played golf together at the TERI golf club. “She said she would take care of me during my stay in India and help me in every way possible,” Takeda said in his complaint. In early 2020, Takeda went to Japan, but returned to India in March. A few days later, Chang allegedly sent him an email, asking her for a loan of Rs 7.5 lakh. She told him the money was needed to receive a parcel from the US that had been lying at the Bengaluru airport for long. “She invited me to her apartment to explain why she needed the money. Her younger sister and brother were also present and said they were students. She demanded Rs. 7.5 lakh and told me she needed to pay remittance charges for an international parcel. The parcel had been sent by her cousin from the US and it contained diamonds, gold and a few documents,” Takeda told police. Chang allegedly told Takeda the parcel was extremely important for her. Though a little hesitant, Takeda transferred Rs 5.5 lakh to her bank account. Chang told him she would return the money once her cousin from the US, who worked in Turkey, sent her Rs 50 crore in a few months. In an attempt to make Takeda believe that Chang’s dealings with his cousin were indeed true, she allegedly got someone to pose as a senior RBI official and send messages to him. “She also showed me some documents that said that the amount she would now receive was more than Rs 8 crore,” the complainant said. Chang allegedly showed Takeda a few other papers and pleaded with him for more money to get the parcel released from the Bengaluru airport. One such document, which mentioned the Union finance ministry, said Chang needed to deposit another Rs. 12.2 lakh. Between March and July last year, Chang allegedly coaxed Takeda to pay several such loans, each time assuring the Japanese national that she would return the money once she got the funds from her cousin. “I believed the story projected before me by Ms. Asang and the documents shown by her to be correct and in friendly faith lent her a huge amount of money to the tune of Rs 1.85 crore,” Takeda wrote in his complaint. Takeda said he went into depression after learning he had been cheated and could not approach police during the lockdown. He eventually submitted a written complaint to the police commissioner, following which, a case was registered under IPC sections 406 and 420, accounting for punishment for criminal breach of trust and cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property. A senior police officer said, “We have registered a case in the matter and an investigation is underway.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/japanese-man-who-came-to-gurgaon-for-work-cheated-of-rs-1-8cr/articleshow/81902636.cms||Shubhra Pant

"A number of representations were received by the chief minister to relax the restriction with certain conditions... It is now decided that gyms will be allowed to remain open with the condition that the occupancy at any time cannot exceed 50% of the capacity," the Sunday order issued by chief secretary P Ravi Kumar reads. It adds that gyms are mandated to ensure strict Covid-appropriate behaviour. Gyms violating norms will have to be closed till Covid is over: MinThe government has asked gyms to follow Covid-19 safety rules such as wearing of masks, physical distancing, and provision of hand sanitiser are enforced. “The equipment shall be sanitised after every use. If there is any violation, the gym shall be closed till the Covid pandemic is over,” the order read. Earlier in the day, health minister K Sudhakar told reporters: “The health department and technical advisory committee’s recommendations have been submitted to the chief minister.

So it is important to introduce curbs and also ensure that they are enforced.” Pointing out that some people are criticising him for pushing (for containment measures), he said his first responsibility as health minister is to safeguard the health of the people. The government, he said, is faced with a difficult challenge of finding a balance between health and livelihood. “Keeping this in mind, the CM has given some concessions to some people, and I do not have any comments on that. As CM, he is thinking of both health and livelihood; as health minister, I’ve done my duty of informing the CM of the situation,” he said. Urging people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, he said that just as they do not jump a traffic signal because it attracts punishment, they need to start wearing the masks. On relaxing the curbs on movie theatres within hours of the first order, on Saturday, he said: “As a health minister, I have to work within my limitations, the government is a big system. The CM has to balance both health and livelihood, there’s a lot of pressure on him. Even I have pressure. Schools are complaining, fans of certain actors have approached me, gym operators say they will get affected badly, and so on.” “I am not finding fault with what all these people are saying. But the first responsibility of the government is to save people and in this context the health department plays a key role. It becomes our duty to keep the CM informed about the analysis and recommendations made by the TAC. And to that extent, I am doing my job. Some may not like what I am doing; let them say what they want, but as per my conscience, I will continue to keep my chief minister informed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-allows-gyms-to-run-with-50-capacity/articleshow/81904893.cms||---

They said the NIA is scrutinising the documents unearthed during Thursday's raid on a club at Girgaum in south Mumbai to further probe the role of now-suspended API Sachin Waze, who is in the agency's custody till April 7. One of the documents shows the name of the office as well as officers by designation and there was an amount mentioned against their names, and the same had been tabulated month-wise, the officials said. The officials suspect the amounts mentioned could be bribe money paid every month. NIA likely to share docus with I-T, CBIBefore sharing further details, the NIA is likely to seek an explanation from the club owner and others about the documents. The officials said that if needed the documents would be shared with the income tax department or CBI authorities for further probe as the NIA is mandated to probe anti-terror cases only. They said the club used to be frequented by Waze who had even got Naresh Gor and co-accused Vinayak Shinde employed there.

---||Noida||Noida: Special vaccination camps for teachers, judges, journos from this week||NOIDA: Now, bank and insurance workers, teachers, lawyers, judges and journalists aged over 45 years can get the Covid-19 vaccine at special camps across Gautam Budh Nagar. The district administration has released a schedule for vaccinating these groups from April 8 onwards. Meanwhile, surveillance and sanitisation activities have also been intensified. According to the schedule, journalists, mediapersons as well as shopkeepers will be vaccinated on April 8 and 9, whereas bank and insurance staff will get the shot on April 10 and school and college teachers on April 12-14. Meanwhile, autorickshaw, bus and taxi drivers will be inoculated on April 15-16, other government officials on April 17-19 and court staff and lawyers on April 20-21. Private company employees will get the jab on April 22 and 23. The dates have been decided by the UP government for all districts in the state. There is no count, however, of the number of people who would fall in these groups in GB Nagar. Officials said an estimate may be taken through associations and special centres will be assigned accordingly. “We have not finalised the details yet, but we will assign centres for these groups on the mentioned dates. This will help make the process smooth for the general public as well as special groups. We are in touch with some of the associations that will help us allocate suitable centres for vaccinating these groups,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate. Officials said a lucky draw has also been announced by the state government to motivate those who have already taken both doses of the vaccine. The district surveillance and contact tracing team on Sunday visited areas from where large numbers of Covid cases are now being reported. These include sectors 19, 22, 30 and 34, Nithari and Chauda. Health department officials said these are all high-density areas with reduced sanitisation efforts now and increasing cases may lead to an outbreak again. Meanwhile, rapid response teams (RRTs) visited several housing societies on Sunday to conduct awareness drives for RWAs as well as security and maintenance staff. The areas visited include Ashiana Orchids in Sector Gamma 2, Sector 137, Great Value Sharanam in Sector 107 and Paramount Floraville and ATS Grand Paradiso in Greater Noida. Officials said random testing of travellers, cab drivers, shopkeepers and other focused groups is being carried out. Increased surveillance and focused vaccination drives are required to control the rising number of cases in the city, according to officials. In GB Nagar, 294 cases have been reported in the past four days of April itself, while 560 cases were recorded last month. While the case fatality rate is still low and no deaths have been reported in the past six months, the positivity rate has been increasing consistently since early March — it was 0.3% in February and now stands at about 1.5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/spl-vax-camps-for-teachers-judges-journos-from-this-wk/articleshow/81903388.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Mangaluru||PUBG spat goes awry? Boy, 12, found dead in Mangaluru||MANGALURU: A 12-year-old boy was found dead 500 metres from his house in Mangaluru on Sunday morning, about 10 hours after he left home saying he wanted to meet a friend. Police suspect the boy may have been a victim of the now-banned PUBG videogame. Police have picked up a 17-year-old boy for questioning in the case. It is suspected that the boys were playing the game together after an accidental meeting at a mobile store in Mangaluru three months ago. It could not be confirmed if the boys were playing PUBG or one of its many variants flooding the cyberspace after the original game was proscribed last year. Terming the incident 'unfortunate', Mangaluru City police commissioner N Shashi Kumar told reporters here on Sunday that preliminary investigation revealed that the boy, identified as Mohammed Akif, son of lorry driver Haneef, used to play PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) with a few acquaintances. Police quoting parents said the boy, a Class 6 student at Falah School here, left home around 8.45pm on Saturday, speaking over the phone. Teen hit boy with stone after he lost PUBG game: PoliceWhen the boy did not return home, his family looked for him before filing a complaint with police. Around 7am on Sunday, a police team found the boy’s body behind a school, close to his house, covered with plantain leaves and coconut fronds in the Ullal police station limits. The boy’s parents identified the body. Later, the body was shifted to Wenlock Hospital for postmortem. Sources said the 17-yearold told police that he and Akif used to play the game. The deceased was on a winning spree, and he suspected the boy was using fraudulent methods or seeking help to win without losing even once, and challenged him for a faceto-face encounter. Akif, according to police sources, reportedly lost the game in the direct clash on Saturday night, and this led to an argument that turned violent when the accused allegedly hit the boy with a stone. When Akif collapsed and was bleeding, the accused allegedly dumped him in a secluded corner and fled from there, according to the police officer. The family confirmed to police that the deceased boy used to play the videogame. “The Ullal area has a lot of CCTV cameras, whose footage is being examined to ascertain if there were others at the spot,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/pubg-spat-goes-awry-boy-12-found-dead-in-mangaluru/articleshow/81904898.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Goa||When Goan women won hearts but lost the final||Tongues started wagging no sooner the Goa women’s team decided to move out of the accommodation provided by the organisers. Goa were making their debut at the Women’s National Football Championship at Sultanpur in 1976 and had whipped up quite a storm, scoring 10 goals against Delhi and 12 against Chandigarh in the first two matches. The girls from Goa looked unstoppable, but with most having travelled outside the state for the first time, adjusting wasn’t easy. The accommodation provided by the organisers wasn’t good enough, so they opted to move elsewhere. That’s when gossip spread like wild fire. “One of the players told me that everyone believed the move was made because the Goa players wanted to drink (alcohol), without others knowing about it. That this was the reason why they were so dominant on the field,” says captain Yolanda de Sousa, bursting into a hearty laugh at the theory. Goa had missed the 1975 edition of the nationals because nobody in the state had a clue. The girls had just started kicking the ball around that time, and when they travelled to Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh for the second edition, not many took them seriously. Then Goa put on a show. In the opening game, Goa thrashed Delhi 10-0 with vice-captain Rekha Kamat scoring five, Yolanda registering a hat-trick and Succorinha Pereira netting two. Against Chandigarh in the second game, the girls did even better, hammering a dozen goals past their hapless-looking opponents. Again, Yolanda was the star as she scored five, while Succorinha got four. Everyone was scared of Goa. Nobody stood a chance. Bihar tried and lost 0-6, Kerala were no match as they conceded three goals without scoring, and in the semifinals, the girls demolished Manipur 4-0 with Yolanda scoring another hat-trick, her third in the tournament. All this from a team that was playing at the nationals for the first time. And that too without their coach. Joao Mello was the one who coached the girls prior to the nationals. The Sesa Goa coach took time off from his senior team commitments to get the girls into shape. He made them into a fine unit. “He was a great coach. He got us going,” says Juliana Gurjao, Goa’s star midfielder in a 4-2-4 formation, alongside Rekha. “He trained us for a month at Campal and we got better with every session. We grew in confidence.” Among Joao Mello’s training routines was to make the girls play against the boys at Campal. There was just one rule change: the boys could only use their left foot. The games turned out to be hugely competitive. No wonder when the team reached Sultanpur, Goa were in rocking form. By the time they were drawn to play the final against Bengal, Yolanda alone had scored 15 goals, more than what their opponents had collectively scored in five matches. “We missed Joao Mello in the final. There was nobody who could guide us tactically,” says Yolanda. Bengal had eight internationals with Nili Ghosh and Shanti Mullick the most dangerous. They had the experience and tactical awareness. They played to a plan and provided no space for Goa’s famed attack – also including Perpetua Fernandes, senior and junior on either flank -- to move towards goal. When Bengal got an opportunity in the second half, Sukla Dutta scored from a goalmouth melee. Despite Goa’s best efforts for the remainder of the match, the score remained unchanged till the final whistle. Goa were heartbroken. And so were the fans. “Only twice I have been shocked at the result of a match. Once when Joe Frazier defeated Muhammad Ali in boxing in 1971 at Madison Square Garden and second when the glittering Goa women football team unfortunately lost to Bengal at Sultanpur,” Arshad, a fan from Uttar Pradesh, said in a hand-written note to Yolanda, which she has preserved till date. Arshad never missed watching Dilip Kumar’s movies in theatres on the opening day. But on October 21, 1976, he had a tough choice to make: either watch ‘Bairaag’ or the Goa women’s team. He chose to give the Bollywood legend a miss for the first time and instead watched Goa play. Such was Goa’s impact at the Indira Youth Stadium in Sultanpur. Playing in front of packed stands, they won plenty of hearts, never mind the agonising loss in the final.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/when-goan-women-won-hearts-but-lost-the-final/articleshow/81903477.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||Curchorem civic body fiasco triggers debate over need to amend Goa Municipalities Act||Margao: The dramatic turn of events at the Curchorem Cacora Municipal Council (CCMC) that led to a no-confidence motion being moved against the chairperson minutes after his election earlier this week, has, besides stoking a political controversy, also stirred a debate over the need for amendments in the Goa Municipalities Act to ensure that the statutory provisions or the lack of it are not misused to upend the spirit of the law. BJP’s state general secretary and former chairperson of the state law commission, Narendra Sawaikar, speaking to TOI said that the Curchorem episode was, in effect, exploitation of a “grey area” in the Goa Municipalities Act by the aggrieved group of councillors “who felt they were wronged” by the outcome of the election and wanted to overturn the verdict. Balkrishna Hodarkar, who was elected chairperson of the CCMC eight votes to seven by a secret ballot, had to face the prospects of a no-confidence motion being moved against him by 10 of his fellow councillors within minutes of his election. Political observers feel that the absence of any provision in the statute that provides some sort of secured tenure for the chairperson has been exploited in the current case to suit political exigencies. The Goa Panchayat Raj Act, however, provides that a no-confidence motion against a sarpanch cannot be moved “within six months after the meeting of the panchayat defeating the motion of no confidence.” Concurring with the suggestion that the Goa Municipalities Act needs amendments to prevent such misuse of the law, Sawaikar said, “The legislature, in its own wisdom, has to look into the provisions of the Act, and if at all required, propose amendments to that extent.” Former bureaucrat, Elvis Gomes, who also served as the director of municipal administration (DMA), was severely critical of the Curchorem episode. Pointing out that the Goa Municipalities Act provides a week’s time for a chairperson to do a re-think on this decision in the event he tenders his resignation, Gomes said, “Now, if you are going to oust him within minutes of his getting elected, it goes against the spirit of this provision in the law.” Gomes also strongly voiced his opinion in favour of legislative remedies to cure the malady. He, however, pointed out how several attempts to move a comprehensive amendment in the Act during his stint as the DMA were thwarted by the powers-that-be for obvious reasons. “Municipal councils and panchayats are used by politicians to test their political muscle,” Gomes said. “Nevertheless, the problem lies in the councillors who shift their allegiance to the politicians the moment they get elected, instead of pledging their loyalty to the people who got them elected. As we saw what happened in Curchorem that day, the obligation of the councillors to the people is sadly missing.” Rotation of the chairperson’s position among councillors during the five-year tenure has, of late, become a norm leading to instability in the councils, with development suffering collateral damage. Both Sawaikar and Gomes were of the view that direct election to the post of chairperson (directly elected by the people) was among the options that could be considered to prevent such frequent change of guard, as is done in some parts of the country. “It’s the way you look at it,” said Sawaikar. “Such manoevers are done to ensure that the group (panel of councillors) remains stable. Rotation of the chair among the group ensures this stability. However, direct election to the post is an option that can be considered to prevent rotation of chair.” Gomes said that provision of a fixed tenure was another option worthy of consideration to prevent such manoeuvers which, he said, go against the spirit of local self-governance. “Even before he gets acclimatised to the chair, it’s time for the chairperson to quit, and all this just to serve political needs. This means that one’s political need is superior to that of the people or to the demands of governance,” he said. Lawyer Hrishikesh Kadam, however, made a telling remark. “An elected representative needs to possess a moral compass and a social conscience in order to make any valuable contribution to the society. As he has entered public life to serve the society, this is what is expected of him in a democracy. If one needs to have laws for everything for elected representatives, it implies that they are devoid of any morals or principles.” He said that just as there is a possibility of a “bandwagon effect” turning advantageous for BJP in the upcoming polls for the other five councils following its victory in most of the councils that went to polls last month, in the same manner, there’s every possibility that the Curchorem episode could turn counter-productive for BJP. “After all,” he said, “perception is what matters in a democracy. And public perception is a double-edged sword.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/curchorem-civic-body-fiasco-triggers-debate-over-need-to-amend-goa-municipalities-act/articleshow/81902786.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

Experts say these fires have had a huge impact on biodiversity. Prof TJ Renuka Prasad, ex-coordinator of Biopark, designated special officer of Biopark, said: "Several rare, endangered and threatened medicinal plants have been destroyed. Areas which are enriched with birds and butterflies also suffered loss. A fire preparedness plan has to be taken up by the campus development committee. Fire hydrants at several locations will help a lot. Quick-response vehicles should be made available on the campus to reach the interior parts of the forest." Prasad said he has requested for patrolling of the campus by armed personnel to prevent not only fire but also miscreants' movement. "This will help in checking sandalwood theft, cattle grazing and other related issues, which cause manmade fires on the campus. Sprinkling of treated water on dried leaves may also be considered," he said. KM Kariarju, fire station officer, Nagarbhavi, said: "On Friday, nearly 150 acres of land were on fire inside the campus. Of the 150 acres, we were able to save 100 acres after fighting the blaze for 10 hours. Fifty acres were completely burnt. We're sure that this fire was man-made; some miscreants who don't understand that burning cigarette butts should not be thrown near dry leaves have caused this."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/fire-incidents-damage-200-acres-in-bangalore-university-bio-park/articleshow/81904917.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||Goa||‘Devpt in Vasco will not be affected by MLAs’ differences’||Vasco: State BJP president Sadanand Tanavade assured voters of Mormugao municipal council (MMC) that “ego clashes of our MLAs will be taken care off”, adding that personal problems will not affect functioning of the civic body. On Saturday, Tanavade, in the presence of Rajya Sabha member of Parliament Vinay Tendulkar and others, declared 24 candidates for the MMC elections. Only in ward number 10 BJP “is having a friendly fight” and so the candidate there is not declared, Tanavade added. The BJP panel includes many new faces and experienced outgoing councillors like Fredrick Henriques, Yatin Kamurlekar, former chairperson and councillor Deepak Naik. When reporters pointed out that MMC suffered due to ego clashes between the party’s MLAs, Tanavade said that when he campaigns for the assembly elections in the next six months the scenario will be different and voters will see development. He also said that he can be held responsible if the differences between BJP’s MLAs continue. In the run-up to the civic polls, Vasco BJP MLA Carlos Almeida had clashed with urban development minister and Mormugao MLA Milind Naik accusing him of creating anomalies in reservation of wards. He had even demanded that the chief minister Pramod Sawant drop Naik from the cabinet. “I knew from the beginning that the circular of the directorate of municipal administration on the reservation of seats for municipal elections was wrong. In a letter to the chief minister, I had asked for Naik’s removal or his resignation as he has failed at his job,” Almeida had said. Tanavade said, “BJP is strong and is sure of winning with a majority in five upcoming municipal elections. Party workers, including MLAs, have forgotten their differences since winning is what is important and we shall keep up the spirit.” “There will be certain changes in Section 144 or it may be withdrawn as the campaigning and elections are due. However, people should coperate, get vaccination done and follow safety precautions to avoid being infected with Covid-19,” he said. Naik, panchayat minister and Dabolim MLA Mauvin Godinho, and Vasco MLA backed their candidates as this municipality includes Mormugao and Vasco as well as a part of the Dabolim constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/devpt-in-vasco-will-not-be-affected-by-mlas-differences/articleshow/81902796.cms||---

BJP had fielded Priya from ward 15. Nandadeep told reporters that his wife and him had not even been called for the BJP meet and press conference. Nandadeep said he was not taken into confidence. “BJP has always done injustice to me. Even as chairperson the party did not support me being in power and give me the help that they could have,” he said. Nandadeep is a strong supporter of Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida and was backed by Almeida as chairperson. “Almeida has been supportive and I will always stand with him,” Nandadeep said. Priya will be contesting from ward 15 as an independent candidate. Nandadeep was a strong BJP karyakarta. The last time he had contested the municipal polls, former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had campaigned for him. He has had a good rapport with BJP leadership, but lately, he had felt that he was being given a cold shoulder from some though he is close to Almeida.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/loyalists-wife-not-to-contest-on-bjp-panel/articleshow/81902829.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Covid-19: Positivity rate in Bengaluru crosses 5%||BENGALURU: The average rate at which Bengalureans are testing positive for coronavirus has increased drastically in the past week. The positivity rate has crossed the mark of 5 per cent. Effectively, five people are turning positive for every 100 Covid-19 tests. After a sharp decline in the past few months, cases are climbing again. In January and February, the positivity rate was less than 1 per cent. Last month, it was 2.3 per cent and on Saturday, 5.3 per cent. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the rate should be below 5 per cent for effective containment of Covid-19. The positivity rate is a key measure to determine how widespread coronavirus infections are and whether adequate tests are being conducted. A higher rate worries health officials as it points to a large spread triggered by transmission in the community. Bengaluru’s positivity rate peaked in July last year, hovering around 24 per cent before sliding to about 8 per cent in October and 0.9 per cent in January this year. It started increasing in March as the second wave of Covid-19 hit the tech capital, and experts believe it will go up further. The number of cases detected in the city every day has shot up from 300-plus in the first week of March to 3,500 now. Health minister K Sudhakar attributes the rising rate to multiple factors. “We share borders with Maharashtra and Kerala, two states which have reported the highest number of positive cases in the second wave. There is heavy movement of people and this has triggered the spread of Covid-19. Moreover, citizens have dropped their guard and are not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing,” he said. A senior official of the state health and family welfare department said that the positivity rate went up after the testing capacity was ramped up. “We were conducting around 30,000 tests per day three months ago. We have doubled it now, so more cases are getting detected,” the official added. A review of data from the period of March 27 to April 2 shows that positivity was high in Rajarajeshwarinagar (6 per cent) and Bengaluru South zone (5.1 per cent). The rate can be lowered by reducing transmission or by increasing testing. “But many people are reluctant to get tested despite showing symptoms. Citizens must act responsibly, get tested and isolate themselves if they have symptoms,” the officials said. In some relief for health officials, the fatality rate is low, which indicates low virulence of coronavirus variants circulating in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-19-positivity-rate-in-bengaluru-crosses-5/articleshow/81904913.cms||Rakesh Prakash
---||Vijayawada||Guntur-Guntakal railway track work gathers pace||GUNTUR: Putting the key infrastructure project on fast track, South Central Railway (SCR) has completed yet another stretch of doubling and electrification work as part of Guntur-Guntakal doubling project. The SCR announced the completion of nearly 81 km of the 404-km track to connect Guntur and Guntakal. After completing thorough inspections, the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) has given the green signal for train operations between Donakonda–Gajjelakonda stations on the newly constructed double line along with electrification. The Guntur-Guntakal section is a vital rail link to connect the coastal region of the state with Rayalaseema and Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. “The double line works along with electrification between Donakonda–Gajjelakonda for a distance of 12.4 Kms has been completed and commissioned after getting all safety clearances,” said SCR general manager Gajanan Mallya in a statement. He said that the speed trial inspection has been successfully carried out by CRS and the section is initially permitted with maximum permissible speed of 90 kmph. He said that the railway ministry had granted the Guntur-Guntakal doubling and electrification project to provide seamless transportation and ease the congestion on this section. He explained that work on doubling and electrification between Nallapadu–Satulur (32 kms) and Dhone–Pendekallu-Edduladoddi (36.6 Kms) has already been completed and commissioned. “With the completion of another 12.4 Kms of stretch between Donakonda–Gajjelakonda, a total of 81-km of doubling works with electrification has been completed on the Guntur–Guntakal section. Works in the remaining sections are in fast progress,” said Mallya. He said that Centralised Electronic Interlocking (CEI) system has been provided at Donakonda and Gajjelakonda stations for efficient handling of the trains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/guntur-guntakal-railwaytrack-work-gathers-pace/articleshow/81901321.cms||Samdani MN

Schools from Margao will be shifted to the outskirts in a bid to decongest the town area. The complex will be on the lines of the Cujira school complex, where schools from the heart of Panaji were moved. Over 1.15 lakh sqm of land was already transferred by the South Goa collector for the complex to the directorate of education in December 2016. The state government has said that it is eager to begin work on the complex soon, even as the project had come to a standstill due to opposition from Davorlim locals, who fear the school complex will lead to traffic congestion in the area. “Preliminary work such as possession, demarcation of the land for the establishment of proposed Integrated Educational Complex at Davorlim, Margao, Salcete is completed. The department is working to start the work earnestly. No date can be fixed for completion as of now,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said in a reply tabled in the state assembly at the recently concluded assembly session. As per the plans in 2016, the DoE was looking to shift nine high enrolment schools located in Margao and Navelim to Davorlim. The schools included Shishu Vikas High School, Posh English High School, Shree Damodar Vidyalaya High School and Shree Damodar Higher Secondary School of Science, St Anthony High School, Fatima Convent High School, Popular High School, Bhatikar Model High School, Mahila Nutan English High School, New Era High School, T B Cunha New High School and Ravindra Kelekar Dnyanmandir School. The shifting of the schools to the Integrated Educational Complex is expected to help in reducing the traffic congestion in the town area, while providing the schools the opportunity to construct spacious new buildings. Also, the schools will get some common facilities like large playgrounds. An area of 8,000 to 15,000sqm is expected to be allotted to each school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/land-demarcated-for-davorlim-school-complex/articleshow/81902862.cms||---

While the ruling YSRC has roped in several senior ministers to campaign for its candidate Dr Gurumoorthy, the BJP-Jana Sena combine is not lagging behind. Union ministers Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari and G Kishan Reddy are scheduled to lead the BJP campaign in coming days. The actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan held a roadshow followed by a public meeting in the city on Saturday, appealing to the voters to extend support to the BJP-Jana Sena’s candidate K Ratna Prabha. TDP, which has decided to boycott the MPTC-ZPTC elections in the state, is relying on several former ministers and MLAs to campaign for its candidate and former Union minister Panabaka Lakshmi. TDP state president K Atchem Naidu has been camping in the temple city for more than a week. Former minister and party’s national general secretary Nara Lokesh is also part of the campaign. Meanwhile, former TUDA chairman G Narasimha Yadav told TOI that former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu will hold roadshows and public meetings in all seven assembly segments from April 9 to 10. Congress has fielded six-time MP Dr M Chinta Mohan and the CPI(M) candidate is N Yadagiri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ysrc-ropes-in-senior-leaders-for-campaign/articleshow/81901335.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Ranchi||Archaeologists find another Buddha statue at H’bag excavation site||Hazaribag: The team of archaeologists, who are digging at the site of a supposed 10th Century Buddhist Vihar (monastery) in Hazaribag’s Bahranpur village, on Saturday, dug out a 6.8-feet tall sandstone statue of Gautam Buddha. “The statue, which portrays Buddha as Avlokiteshwara, is the tallest to be excavated across all Buddhist sites in Jharkhand till date,” Dr Rajendra Deori, who is leading the excavation, told mediapersons. The statue, depicted in Kamrup pose in Varadamudra, was dug out from a spot which archaeologists claim was at the centre of the five rooms in the monastery. Avlokiteshwara is considered to be an earthly manifestation of Buddha. Earlier, two more statues of Avlokiteshwara were found from the site, but were between 3 and 4 feet in height and dated between 900 BC and 1,000 BC. “We believe bigger statues can be found in the site and excavations are still underway,” Deori said. “It is difficult to ascertain their exact age,” said Shatrughan Pandey, faculty at St Columba’s College in Hazaribag. Sub divisional officer (sadar) Vidya Bhushan and SDPO (HQ) Mahesh Prajapati visited Barhanpur and directed the security to be stepped up in and around the digging site. Solar lights have also been set up to detect any trespassing after sundown. Notably, two of the excavated statues were stolen last month and later found in Ranchi. Five persons were arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/archaeologists-find-another-buddha-statue-at-hbag-excavation-site/articleshow/81901966.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||TMC: People will decide if PM’s jibe at Didi disrespects women||Kolkata: Dubbing Prime Minister Narendra Modi “anti-women”, Trinamool Congress said it would let people decide for now whether his “Didi o Didi” jibe at chief minister Mamata Banerjee was disrespectful and demeaning to women. The party reminded that post-Nirbhaya, such statements could have legal implications. Bengal women and child development minister Sashi Panja said Modi, through his sarcastic “Didi o Didi” jibes at public meetings, “insults not only Banerjee, but the women of Bengal in particular”. “This is another glaring instance of the numerous ways our CM is being harassed and heckled by BJP. This behaviour of the PM is anti-woman, akin to harassment. We will leave it to the people of West Bengal to give a befitting reply to Modi and (Union home minister) Amit Shah,” she added. Panja further said CM Banerjee had been an MP and a Union minister several times. Ananya Chakraborty, a Trinamool leader said, Modi showed his patriarchal mindset by addressing a woman leader in such a manner as they were “soft targets”. Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien said: “After the Nirbhaya case, there were some amendments in the laws to protect safety and security of women. We are examining the law.” The MP added: “More than spirit of the law, a man intimidating and making lewd remarks shows little respect for women and the comments are against the only woman chief minister in India.” Derek said Modi had understood that BJP had no chance of winning the Bengal polls and so was involved in mind games and insulting the chief minister. Trinamool also criticised Shah over his promise of a Narayani Battalion. Senior party leader Subrata Mukherjee said: “Amit Shah had promised a Narayani Battalion earlier. However, an RTI (query) has now exposed that he was not speaking the truth. No such proposal was ever sent to the home ministry. Whereas work has already started for the battalion which the CM promised. This is shameful.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-people-will-decide-if-pms-jibe-at-didi-disrespects-women/articleshow/81903746.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Spike in cases dips footfall at Bokaro restros, eateries||Bokaro: Restaurants and prominent eateries of the town, which were gradually overcoming the financial losses incurred due to the Covid-19-induced lockdown last year, are staring at tough times once again after cases started rising here. Till Sunday morning, the district had 120 active cases. With the usual hustle and bustle slowly fading away and denizens giving dining out a slip in fear of contracting the virus, the restaurants are witnessing a sharp decline in sales. Vikram Shanan, owner of Zaika resort and chain of restaurants in the town, said, “Due to the second wave, the footfall in our restaurants have dropped to 50%. People have switched to home delivery orders. A sharp decline in sales was seen in the last four-five days.” Amit Johar, owner of Hotel West Inn, said: “This weekend, sales dropped by 25%. After Covid cases declined in the beginning of this year, people had gradually started coming to the restaurants. Although home deliveries are an option, but it is not enough to compensate for the loss in business.” Air-conditioned restaurants aren’t the only ones to suffer. Roadside vendors, who sell snacks, rolls and other food items, are also bearing the brunt. Kaka, a street vendor in Sector- 3, is also suffering losses as a major chunk of his Biriyani is going unsold. With the drop in footfall, restaurant staff are once again a worried lot. Santosh Kumar, a waiter, said “We were happy that customers had begun to come once again, but the second wave is ruining things once again. If restaurants shut down again, we will have to sit at homes without an income like last year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/spike-in-cases-dips-footfall-at-bokaro-restros-eateries/articleshow/81901980.cms||Divy Khare

The move came after the surge in Covid-19 cases in the district in the past week and after considering the experts' view that a second wave of the pandemic has already started in the region. The officials said the new guidelines on gatherings will have to be followed strictly and violators will be punished along with the filing of FIRs against them. Moreover, street food vendors who do not follow the Covid-19 safety protocols will be taken to task by seizing their goods and filing of FIRs. According to the guidelines, no food vendor is allowed to serve their customers but can deliver only parcel food, additional district magistrate Nand Kishore Lal said. He added that surprise raids would be conducted at restaurants to ensure that they follow the protocols, including maintaining social distancing and wearing of masks. Meanwhile, motorcycle-borne policemen were seen patrolling the city to check violators of the protocols. The steps taken up by the administration were welcomed by a large section of society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-gatherings-without-admin-nod-in-steel-city/articleshow/81902031.cms||---
---||Kolkata||4 VB teachers urge Prez, PM to help restore faculty morale||Santiniketan: Four teachers of Visva-Bharati University representing multiple departments have written to the President and the Prime Minister, urging their immediate intervention in restoring morale of the faculty and the VB community that has plunged to new depths following differences with the vice-chancellor and alleged threats issued by him against them. President Ram Nath Kovind is the visitor of Visva-Bharati and PM Narenda Modi the chancellor. In the letter, professors Manas Maity, Arani Chakravarti, Sudipta Bhattacharya and Pijush Kanti Ghosh referred to ominous threats issued to them on several occasions by VC Bidyut Chakrabarty. Quoting him from an online address to teachers last month, the quartet said he had called them Mir Jafars or traitors, threatened to terminate their jobs, physically harm them and organise a social boycott against them. Chakrabarty and a section of the faculty have been at loggerheads over multiple issues over the past couple of years. They have also filed police complaints against the VC, who has in turn filed counter-complaints. Several issues, including Bhattacharya’s suspension, are in the legal domain at present. TOI tried to get the VC’s response to the allegations but he did not respond to messages sent to him. Chakrabarty, too, had written to Modi seeking central security, claiming he and his family were facing a threat. That letter was sent on March 24, a day after Trinamool Congress’ Birbhum chief Anubrata Mondal allegedly issued a threat to Chakrabarty at a public meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/4-vb-teachers-urge-prez-pm-to-help-restore-faculty-morale/articleshow/81903819.cms||---

Moitra has demanded a proper investigation into the incident. The candidate in question is BJP’s Mukutmani Adhikary, who is contesting from Ranaghat Dakshin. The video the Krishnagar MP shared soon went viral, with the 30-second clip garnering 47,000 views by evening. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee referred to the video in one of her election rallies. Later, BJP’s Jayprakash Majumdar denied there was any truth to the video. “If true, shocking video of @BJP candidate for AC 90 Ranaghat Dakshin - Mukutmani Adhikary & team distributing money door to door. Ghar Ghar Modi’s true meaning! @ECISVEEP,@CEOWestBengal please investigate & take immediate action,” she tweeted. The video shows a homemaker standing at the door with currency in her hand. “Apni arrange korun. Sir jokhon bolechen, apnar chinta nei. Unar jonno chesta korchi,” suspected BJP workers are heard saying. The family keeps mum in the video.

---||Kolkata||Modi violated code; are you superhuman, asks Didi||Khanakul/Sonarpur: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday accused PM Narendra Modi of violating the model code of conduct, referring to a speech the PM had made in Hooghly’s Haripal on Saturday. “Are you God or superhuman,” the CM asked the PM. “You can make your political speeches in a democracy but as a Prime Minister, how can you ask state government officers to be ready when you come for the swearing-in ceremony (of the Bengal government),” the CM said. “This is illegal and unconstitutional.” Exuding confidence about forming the next government in Bengal, the PM had said that he would attend the oath-taking ceremony of the BJP government and request it to implement the PM Kisan Nidhi scheme as early as possible. Referring to the PM’s speech, Banerjee said: “Does this suit a Prime Minister? You have no authority to instruct state government officers. When elections are underway, you are giving instructions to state officers. What do you think of yourself? Are you God or superhuman? He peddles lies everyday,” the CM said, addressing a rally in Hooghly’s Khanakul. “If I start instructing your officers, will it be correct? It would not be. So, first handle Delhi and your officers,” she said. Banerjee also accused Union home minister Amit Shah of “transferring police officers daily”, using the EC. “This home minister is changing officers daily. They transferred four officers even yesterday. You think you are picking officers close to BJP, but I believe all officers will work impartially,” she added. “Those who will work for you should be ready to work with you in future too. I have no problem with it,” she said. She even referred to an officer who was sent to Cooch Behar ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, and has now been sent to Alipurduar. “A few people”, she said, “are listening to BJP and acting on their behalf. They may be thinking that they will follow Delhi’s instructions for a while.... You (Delhi) had repatriated 125 officers. You had removed them.... BJP’r ek mash (BJP is only for a month). After that, we will remain,” adding, “They have lost completely. They will lose their deposits in many places. First let them get 50 seats.” Banerjee addressed the minority community, alleging BJP was trying to “divide you”. “To divide minority votes, they are fomenting trouble and making communal statements. I do not do communal politics. I work with Hindus and Muslims together. It is my responsibility to ensure your security and the well-being of your society. All these rotten people can never do that. They have sold themselves to BJP.” Addressing Hindus, she said: “BJP goes to homes and says that we are Hindus and they are Muslims. When a tiger steps out of the forest and we chase it, do we see who is Hindu or who is Muslim? When floods ravage our homes, does it differentiate between Hindu and Muslim homes? Am I not a daughter of a Brahmin family? Am I not a Hindu? Stay together, fight together and do not create divisions among yourselves. Years back, it was a Muslim youth who saved my life. This is how a society protects its own.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/modi-violated-code-are-you-superhuman-asks-didi/articleshow/81904000.cms||Falguni Banerjee

The carcass was recovered on Sunday inside the Chilapata range. Forest guards said it was “quite fresh”. Incidents of poaching are not new for Jaldapara. Over 70 rhinos have been poached since 1951. The crime reached its highest levels between 1968 and 1972, when as many as 28 rhinos were poached. In 2018, two rhinos were poached in Gorumara national park in April. The very next month, there was an exchange of fire between security personnel and poachers in Dhupjhora area of the forest. The Jaldapara national park is one among four forest tracts in India where the one-horned rhino can be seen in the wild. The others are Assam’s Kaziranga and Manas national parks and Bengal’s Gorumara National Park. Rhinos can also be seen in the Terai region of Nepal. There are about 3,000 Indian rhinos in the wild, half of them in Kaziranga alone. Jaldapara has around 250 rhinos and attracts thousands of tourists every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rhino-killed-in-jaldapara/articleshow/81903882.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya
---||Kolkata||Bankura cop held in coal case; BJP, TMC spar over audio tape claims||KOLKATA/BANKURA: The Enforcement Directorate late on Saturday arrested Bankura police station inspector-in-charge (IC) Ashok Mishra in the ongoing illegal coal mining probe. Three weeks back, police had arrested Vikas Mishra, brother of Vinay Mishra, implicated by both ED and CBI as among the key accused in the case. On Sunday, BJP, citing an audio tape conversation, alleged that the “real” beneficiaries were political patrons of those being probed; Trinamool Congress dubbed the allegations “unverifiable and wild” and “an act of desperation”. The CBI, which too is probing the case, has already questioned the Bankura police officer. Earlier, ED had summoned him twice but he cited health reasons for not appearing before the agency. Three weeks back, Ashok reached New Delhi for treatment. On Saturday, the agency asked him to appear at its office in New Delhi. After questioning him for more than seven hours, agency officials arrested him. The ED has sought six days’ custody of Ashok. Incidentally, Vikas too was arrested in New Delhi. The cop is related to the Mishra brothers, sources said. ED sources indicated that Ashok’s name came up during Vikas’ interrogation. Agency officials have reasons to believe the cop may have helped the Mishra brothers in continuing the illegal coal trade. They claimed they also came across evidence that the three had spoken to each other several times in the past. Anup Majee, also a key accused in the case, had moved the Supreme Court challenging CBI’s powers to probe the case since the Bengal government had withdrawn its general consent in 2018. The SC granted him interim protection from arrest. Majee had earlier moved the Calcutta High Court. A little over 12 hours after the arrest, BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, citing a purported conversation between two persons – one, who Suvendu claimed, was a businessman questioned by central agencies in this case – alleged that senior Trinamool leaders were the real beneficiaries of these crime proceeds. “He (Ashok Mishra) was earlier posted at Diamond Harbour,” Suvendu said. “There are several other officials in West and East Burdwan, Bankura and Purulia who are also under the central agency radar,” he added. Citing the audio tapes, Suvendu alleged that many facts relating to the “involvement” of senior TMC leaders had now been brought to the fore. Amit Malviya, Bengal BJP co-in-charge, alleged: “Chief minister Mamata Banerjee looked the other way.” Trinamool reacted sharply. “The audio tapes are unverified. It shows two persons are talking to each other but there is nothing to prove their identity. Neither is any media taking responsibility of the veracity of these audio tapes. There is nothing to say and nothing to react on such unverified and wild claims,” said senior leader Subrata Mukherjee. Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien said: “The first two phases have been a disaster for BJP, and they are trying mind games now. There is nothing to prove in those audio tapes and hence there is nothing to react.” Trinamool state spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said: “Adhikari claims to know a lot of things. He was part of the state cabinet till December. Who stopped him from speaking out then?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bankura-cop-held-in-coal-case-bjp-tmc-spar-over-audio-tape-claims/articleshow/81903718.cms||Rohit Khanna

If anyone says so in BJP regime, an encounter will be carried out,” said BJP’s Birbhum district president Dhruba Saha, while attending a roadshow in favour of candidate Tarak Saha. BJP’s national secretary Anupam Hazra was alongside Saha when he made the threat.

Reacting to Saha’s comment, TMC district vice president Abhijit Singha said: “BJP leaders have mastered the art of instigating violence.” Nanoor goes to polls in the last phase on April 29. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/birbhum-bjp-leader-issues-encounter-threat-stirs-row/articleshow/81903832.cms||---
---||Kolkata||EC rubbishes Mamata’s Nandigram complaint, probes whether she violated code||KOLKATA: The Election Commission on Sunday rejected Bengal CM and Trinamool Congress Nandigram candidate Mamata Banerjee’s complaints about voter fraud in her constituency on April 1, calling the “allegations... factually incorrect, without any empirical evidence whatsoever and devoid of substance”. The EC also called Banerjee’s vigil at Boyal’s Maqtab Primary School a “side show” that had “immense potential to have an adverse impact on law and order across Bengal and may be some other states”. “There could not have been greater misdemeanour,” the EC note said, adding that it was “separately examining” whether “the happenings merit any action” for violation of the model code of conduct. On election day (April 1), Banerjee had reached the primary school at 1.45pm after allegations that BJP workers were not allowing Trinamool polling agents inside the booth and not letting people vote. She stayed at the polling station, writing out a complaint on two pages, and left at 3.35pm, escorted out by cops. BJP and Trinamool supporters were engaged in several rounds of skirmishes as police personnel — from both central and state agencies — stood as a buffer between the warring factions. The EC’s response on Sunday laid out the sequence of events, starting from the mock polling exercise at 5.30am. Three polling agents — representing the BJP, the CPM and an Independent candidate — were present, and actual polling started at 7am “and continued peacefully” in the presence of these polling agents, according to the poll body’s note, which also does not mention any Trinamool polling agent at the booth. On Sunday, the Trinamool said Banerjee had to visit the booth “precisely because no Trinamool agent was allowed in”. The EC note said officials received a complaint from a polling agent, who said he was unable to come to the booth “as some persons were threatening him”. The polling agent “refused to come” despite being “assured” security, the EC note said, adding that several officials consistently reported that polling was peaceful. “There was no evidence to suggest that BSF jawans indulged in inappropriate behaviour,” the note said, adding no officer reported “outsiders or guns and goons capturing the booth..., violence... (and) intimidation of voters”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-rubbishes-cms-nandi-plaint-probes-whether-she-violated-code/articleshow/81904005.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal’s second Covid wave rides on election fever pitch||KOLKATA: When the Bengal polls were announced on February 26, the number of active cases in Bengal was 3,343 with a significant decline — of 10 cases — compared with the previous day’s figures. On April 3, the active cases jumped to 8,844 — with a jump of 1,152 cases over April 2. The death toll also rose from 3 on February 26 to 5 on April 3. Hospital occupancy rate, which was 3.3% on February 26, now stands at 12.7%. As Bengal’s poll fever gathers steam, so has the spate of infections. And health experts have pointed out that polls — which, in Bengal, always means large congregations — may be helping the second Covid wave. Kolkata and North 24 Parganas, the two worst-hit districts as far as spread of infection was concerned in the first wave, look likely to bear the brunt of having the polls at the fag end of the eight-phase polls, fear experts. In fact, Kolkata and North 24 Parganas are leading from the front — with 3,195 and 1,776 active cases and a surge of 338 and 220 cases in the last 24 hours respectively. Bengal polls are always preceded by huge gatherings at colourful and noisy campaigns, where Covid-19 protocols are difficult to maintain. TOI, which has been criss-crossing Bengal to cover the poll campaigns and polling processes, has seldom found either vote-seekers or voters wearing masks or maintaining a safe distance. “Election campaigns are the mother of all congregations, where a huge number of people gather to listen to promises made from a podium,” says social scientist Pradip Chakraborty. “The larger the audience, the bigger the success. Thanks to electronic media, most political parties are now enclosing areas to show a high concentration of the audience, with the belief that this would influence the next congregation, or one phase influencing the other,” he added. Raja Dhar, CMRI Hospital’s director of pulmonology, concurred. “It is impossible to expect those taking part in electioneering to follow safety measures,” he said, adding, “We are now approaching the final phases of electioneering, when things are going to reach fever pitch. Gatherings have been happening for the last two months, and the impact is there for all to see. We will see more of them and the numbers will climb even faster now. We are heading towards a gloomy situation.” The numbers back up their fears. Bengal’s total Covid caseload was 5,74,716 on the day the polls were announced.

The health and family welfare department has ramped up testing. On February 26, there were 20,084 daily tests conducted; on April 3, the number was increased to 26,114 from 105 laboratories. However, the total number of Covid beds has gone down — from 6,736 on February 26 to 5,604 now.
