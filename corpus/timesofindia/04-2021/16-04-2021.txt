Union urban affairs secretary DS Mishra said this at the launch of two new challenges; EatSmartCities and Transport4All. The virtual event held on Thursday saw attendance of several city administrators and officials from state governments. Mishra said while 4,320 municipal entities participated in the Swachhta survey, the participation is less in some other competitions launched by the ministry. "Let’s bring the provision of disincentive for those who are not joining the challenge. We will soon come out with this provision," Mishra said while adding that participation of cities is more important than just winning. The ministry said as many as 11 cities will be selected at the end of the first phase of the twin challenges that were launched on Thursday. The EatSmart Cities Challenge is aimed at creating an environment of right food practices and habits, strengthening the food safety and regulatory environment, building awareness among the consumers and urging them to make better food choices in India’s major cities and can set an example for other cities to follow, the ministry said. Launching the Transport4All Challenge, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the Covid-19 has brought the entire world to a halt with transport being one of the worst-hit sectors. "The Transport4All Digital Innovation Challenge will support cities to recover from this mobility crisis," he added. The challenge aims to develop digital solutions that will make public transport safe, affordable, comfortable, and reliable for all, he said. Mishra said the challenge will also help support cities and start-ups all over the country to move towards digital transformation in urban mobility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-warns-negative-marks-for-cities-not-participating-in-urban-challenges/articleshow/82090612.cms||Dipak K Dash

And with many forced to postpone their wedding last year, venues were booked this year with people hoping to host their dream shaadi. However, with India being badly hit by the second wave of COVID-19, and with a weekend curfew being announced in Delhi, many are being forced to rethink their plans, even though Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced that those attending weddings in the capital will be given e-passes to facilitate movement. Ready with band, baaja, but where is baraat?Between April 22 and May 4, thousands of weddings were scheduled in the capital and lakhs across the country. But with a cap of 50 guests in most states, wedding planners say over 80% of these shaadis are now postponed. Most families are postponing weddingsOver 80% weddings are postponedThe guest list dilemmaThose who have decided to go ahead with their wedding and not postpone it to a later date are facing a tough time pruning the guest list. “My wedding is at the end of this month, and unfortunately, family members on the groom’s side have now contracted COVID. Since the cap on wedding guests is 50, we have decided that only immediate family will attend. It was disheartening to uninvite people at this stage. I promised them that we will soon organise a reception, but now seeing the rising number of cases, any function seems like a distant dream,” shares Kalkaji resident Radhika Chauhan.

---||India||3 states and 4 opposition leaders seek re-run of free foodgrains to poor as Covid cases surge||NEW DELHI: Amid surging Covid-19 cases across the country, three states Rajasthan, Kerala and Uttrakhand have urged the centre to restart distribution of free food grains to 81 crore poor under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMGKAY). Four MPs including NCP chief and former agriculture minister Sharad Pawar have also sought the re-run of the scheme which was launched last year during the first wave of the pandemic. Early on Thursday, responding to a question from reporters, Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said 3-4 states and public representatives have made specific requests to the Centre to consider that kind of (PMGKAY) scheme implemented last year. Under PMGKAY, the Centre distributed 5 kg rice or wheat per person and one kg of pulses per family to all those covered under the National Food Security Act. This covered the April- November period of 2020 and had come as a big brief to the poor families across the country. Sources said currently no discussion has started on the suggestions from the three states, Pawar, and TMC law maker Saugata Roy, left party MPs Binoy Vishwam and Elamaram Kareem. They added there are different suggestions. While some have sought the rerun of the scheme for 2-3 months, some have suggested this should be implemented for six months to one year. Officials in the Food Corporation of India said similar requests have been coming from time to time. The FCI has huge surplus stock, almost two-and-half times more than what the government needs to meet the requirement for NFSA and other welfare schemes. Moreover, the government is heading towards a record procurement of 42.73 million tonnes of wheat this year, which Pandey said will be a record. So far 6.47 million tonnes of wheat has been purchased within a month since the procurement started. He also said the direct benefit transfer (DBT) of MSP to farmers’ accounts has been successful in Punjab. Even arahtiyas in Punjab, who get 2.5% commission for their service, are getting their dues directly in their accounts. "We are getting good support from the state government as well as arahtiyas," Pandey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-states-and-4-opposition-leaders-seek-re-run-of-free-foodgrains-to-poor-as-covid-cases-surge/articleshow/82091539.cms||Dipak K Dash

Deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours rose to 1,184, the highest since September 18. Meanwhile, active cases in the country crossed 1.5 million (15 lakh) on Thursday. The unprecedented flood of infections this month has led to an over 2.5-fold increase in active cases, which numbered less than 6 lakh on March 31. A higher active case count means an increased risk of the virus spreading faster as well as a higher probability of deaths.

A senior official said that a total of 68 “top seers” in Haridwar have tested positive for Covid-19 between April 5 and 14.On Thursday, a record 14 states and UTs posted their highest-ever spike in daily cases while Maharashtra logged its second-biggest surge of 61,695 cases. In all, 2,16,902 fresh cases were reported on Thursday, as per TOI’s database. As deaths keep increasing — although still slightly lower than the tolls seen at the peak of the first wave — four states reported more than 100 fatalities each in the last 24 hours. Maharashtra continued to record the highest deaths at 349, followed by Chhattisgarh (135), Delhi (112) and Uttar Pradesh (104). Fatalities were also rising in Gujarat, which recorded 81 deaths, Karnataka (66) and Madhya Pradesh (53).   The death rate in Punjab, which recorded 51 fatalities on Thursday, continued to be the highest in the country at 2.7 per 100 cases. The national death rate (or case fatality rate) stood at 1.22% and has been dropping marginally through the second wave as cases spiral sharply. On Thursday, Uttar Pradesh led the states that saw a record spike in infections with a tally of 22,439. UP is the only state apart from Maharashtra to log more than 20,000 cases in a day. Chhattisgarh reported another new peak of 15,256 fresh cases.

The government on Tuesday waived the pre-condition of bridging studies in local population for grant of EUA for foreign-made vaccines that have already been approved for use in the US, the UK, the European Union and Japan or are on WHO lists.

Each vaccine batch will be released by the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL), Kasauli, before it can be used as per guidelines prescribed under the National Covid-19 Vaccination Programme.   After receiving approval from the CDL, an applicant will use the Covid-19 vaccine only on 100 people initially and submit the safety data to CDSCO. The company concerned will be allowed to use the vaccine only after the safety data of the 100 recipients submitted by it is reviewed by subject experts in the CDSCO and found to be satisfactory. The regulator will approve the protocol for the bridging trial in consultation with its subject expert panel within seven days of the receipt of the proposal, the guidelines said. The government expects the move to facilitate quicker access to foreign vaccines by India and encourage imports, including that of bulk drug material, optimal utilisation of domestic fill-and-finish capacity etc, which will, in turn, provide a fillip to vaccine manufacturing capacity and vaccine availability within the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/import-licences-for-foreign-vaccine-in-3-days-says-government/articleshow/82093233.cms||---

Official data released on Thursday showed inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), accelerated to 7.4% in March, higher than the 27-month high of 4.2% in February. This is the highest inflation rate recorded in the new data series. The previous high was 7.4% in October 2012. The sharp rise in March was also attributed to the low base as data for March 2020 was computed with a low response rate due to the nationwide lockdown. The spike in WPI came against the backdrop of an increase in retail inflation, which jumped to a four-month high in March. The NDA government had been so far been successful in taming inflation since assuming power in May 2014, but a string of factors and the Covid-19 pandemic has added to pressures on the prices front and triggered unease among households dealing with job losses, salary cuts and uncertainty. Data showed that wholesale inflation in the manufactured products segment rose to an eight-year high of 7.3% in March, highlighting the return of pricing for manufacturers as the economy opened up, and global metal prices strengthened. The inflation rate in the fuel and power segment rose to a two-year high 10.3%, compared with a decline of 2.9% in March 2020, which was attributed to the surge in global crude oil prices. Vegetable prices declined due to improved supplies. With the manufactured products category, vegetable and animal oils and fats rose an annual 34.2%. High edible oil prices have added to the burden of household budgets. Manufactured food inflation shot up to a 49-month high of 9% largely led by edible oils. Economists said they expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to continue with its pause on interest rates despite the rising uncertainty and risks to growth due to localised lockdowns being imposed to prevent the spread of the fresh surge in Covid-19 cases. The central bank focuses on retail inflation while deciding on rates, but also takes into account price movements across a broad spectrum. “We expect the headline and core WPI inflation to rise further over the next two months, peaking at around 11.0-11.5% and 8-8.5%, respectively, in May 2021. The expected trajectory of the WPI inflation, and its partial transmission into the CPI inflation going ahead, supports our view that there is negligible space for rate cuts to support growth, in spite of the growing uncertainty related to the surge in Covid-19 cases, localised restrictions and emerging concerns regarding migrants returning to the hinterland,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency ICRA. Inflation in the food group rose by 3.3% in March 2021, compared to 1.4% in February and 4.6% in the year earlier, due to higher prices of pulses (13%) and fruits (16%).

---||Delhi||Conspiracy charge against Umar Khalid unwarranted: Court||NEW DELHI: A city court on Thursday granted bail to JNU scholar Umar Khalid in a case related to the northeast Delhi riots saying he couldn’t “be permitted to remain behind bars on the basis of sketchy material against him”. Police had claimed that the acts of violence were the result of an alleged criminal conspiracy devised by Khalid, former councillor Tahir Hussain and activist Khalid Saifi. To substantiate its claim, the prosecution had relied on call data record (CDR) location of the accused. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said the sole evidence of this “so-called” conspiracy was based on an eyewitness’s statement. On September 27, 2020, the witness claimed that he had dropped-off Hussain at a building in Shaheen Bagh and seen Khalid and Saifi enter the same building on January 8, 2020. “I fail to understand from the aforesaid statement how a lofty claim of conspiracy can be inferred. In my humble opinion, chargesheeting the applicant (Khalid) on the basis of such an insignificant material is unwarranted,” the court observed. It also noted that the argument that Khalid had been in regular touch with Hussain and Saifi on phone, which was evident from their CDR location of January 8, 2020, was “hardly of any consequence” for “prima facie” it did not in any way establish the criminal conspiracy against him. Khalid’s lawyer, senior advocate Trideep Pais, argued that his client was framed as it was a political vendetta to muzzle dissent. He said Khalid was not physically present at the scene of crime and not seen in any CCTV footage or viral video, besides not being named specifically by any witness. The prosecution had relied on the alleged disclosures made to police by the accused and referred to the witness’s statement to substantiate its claim that a meeting between Khalid, Hussain and Saifi had taken place at Shaheen Bagh. The court, however, highlighted that the witness’s statement only spoke of a meeting without disclosing its subject matter. It was also revealed that the same witness had recorded his statement in the “conspiracy case”, bearing FIR number 59/2020, against Khalid and others being investigated by Delhi Police’s Special Cell. “The statement under Section 161 CrPC of public witness Rahul Kasana was recorded on May 21, 2020 where he didn’t utter a single word against the applicant (Khalid) qua criminal conspiracy. Now, all of a sudden, he vide his statement recorded on September 27, 2020 blew the trumpet of criminal conspiracy against the applicant. This prima facie does not appeal to the senses,” the court noted. The court pointed out that Hussain was made an accused in 10 other cases of this “cluster of Chand Bagh puliya in or around his house”. Khalid, however, wasn’t made a co-accused in any of those cases, even on the strength of material sought to be read against him. “I do not find any rationale in the act of police involving the applicant (Khalid) in this solitary case for the offence of conspiracy. If the principal accused (Hussain) was moved or actuated by the applicant in a meeting dated January 8, 2020, then the applicant should have been made co-accused in 10 other cases, which is also not the case. Police have unnecessarily brought in the material of FIR number 59/2020 in this matter,” said the court. The bench also underscored that Saifi had been granted bail and the prosecution hadn’t been able to show that Khalid’s alleged role was different from Saifi’s. Though granted bail in this case, Khalid will remain in jail as he faces another case of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act case being investigated by Special Cell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/conspiracy-charge-against-umar-khalid-unwarranted-court/articleshow/82093525.cms||Aamir Khan

The notifications for all the phases have been issued and the nomination process is over. It is not possible to make any changes in the schedule at this stage. There is no such plan or discussion in EC,” a senior EC functionary told TOI on Thursday. The fifth phase of polling in Bengal is scheduled for Saturday, followed by three more phases on April 22, 26 and 29. The EC functionary said there was no formal communication from either Banerjee or TMC seeking clubbing of the remaining phases. The appeal was only on social media, he said. In a tweet on Thursday, Banerjee said, “Amid an ongoing pandemic, we firmly opposed EC’s decision to conduct West Bengal polls in eight phases. Now, in view of the huge surge in Covid-19 cases, I urge the EC to consider holding the remaining phases in one go...” Sources said there was little scope for any revision in EC’s guidelines on Covid-safe campaigning either, irrespective of calls from several parties to restrict physical rallies. “Only 11-12 days of campaigning are remaining. Also, the number of Covid-positive cases in districts where polling is to be held in the remaining phases, barring Kolkata, is very low. Even in Kolkata, the cases are much less as compared to the situation in other metros and big cities,” an officer said. The EC is working to ensure smooth conduct of polls despite many members of its staff, including some senior officials, testing Covid-positive. Incidentally, the EC allowed physical rallies in addition to virtual programmes while issuing guidelines for the Bihar polls in August 2020, based on demands from several opposition parties, including Congress and Left. These parties requested the EC to allow door-to-door canvassing and physical campaigning, arguing that limiting the campaign to digital mode would put ‘rich’ parties like BJP at an undue advantage. While it remains to be seen what arguments these very parties, besides TMC, put forward at the all-party meeting convened by the Bengal chief electoral officer on Friday to ensure strict adherence to Covid-19 guidelines, a source said any change in the mode of campaigning was unlikely. Only recently, the poll panel had reiterated its guidelines, advising political leaders to set an example by wearing masks and asking all those in attendance at their rallies to do so too, use sanitisers and follow social distancing norms. It had further cautioned that in cases of breach, the EC would not hesitate in banning public meetings of the defaulting candidates.

---||India||China feels it can boss around but India has stood firm: CDS General Bipin Rawat||NEW DELHI: China is resorting to “my way or no way” policies but India stood firm in preventing a change in the status quo on its northern borders in eastern Ladakh and garnered international support for it, said chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat on Thursday. Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue, General Rawat said China feels “it has arrived” on the world stage because of its “superior” armed forces, equipped with “advanced and disruptive technologies” that can paralyse an adversary’s strategic systems as well as energy, banking, transport and communication grids. “They (Chinese) feel by doing a little bit of shove-and-push, they will be able to compel nations to give into their demands. But India has stood firm on its northern borders and we have proven that we will not get pushed,” he said. The international community has come to India’s support by affirming that every country must follow the international rules-based order, without seeking to unilaterally alter the status quo. “China tried to change the status quo... They thought that India will succumb to the pressures that they have been putting on us because of the technological advantage that they have. But that did not happen,” said the CDS. There has been no overall de-escalation in the year-long military confrontation in eastern Ladakh till now, with China refusing to even complete the stalled troop disengagement at Gogra, Hot Springs and Demchok. At the Raisina Dialogue, chief of staff of the Japanese Self Defence Forces General Koji Yamazaki also slammed China’s attempts to unilaterally change the status quo in areas like the Taiwan Strait as well as the East and South China Seas. Australian chief of defence forces General Angus Campbell said, “(China’s) Grey zone tactics are a way to nibble away at territory. We see this in the South China Sea. It is very challenging to respond without breaching the line that leads to open conflict.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-feels-it-can-boss-around-but-india-has-stood-firm-cds-general-bipin-rawat/articleshow/82093617.cms||---

Concerned by the exploding Covid crisis, the traders have urged administration and police to order closure of markets and are even themselves planning to keep their establishments closed for a few days to break the virus chain. President of Civil Lines Vyapar Mandal and Prayagraj Automobile Association, Sushil Kharbanda told TOI, “The market is badly hit and there is hardly 20% business. Lives of people are more important than business. We are witnessing declining footfall in markets with each passing day.” “Since there has been an unprecedented rise in Covid cases, we have appealed to district and police authorities for complete closure of markets to break the virus chain, We are ourselves planning to keep our shops closed on Saturday and Sunday,” he added. Traders dealing in footwear, garments, jewellery and fast food corners said their sales have declined considerably in the past 10 days as customers are following Covid protocols and not coming out for non-essential work. However, traders of the medicine market and chemists have reported a big upswing in the sale of medicines, disinfectants and surgical items. The active Covid-19 cases continued to be above the 46,000-mark in the district. A trader dealing in garment business at Civil Lines said, “There were hardly one or two customers as people are staying indoors due to fear of contracting Covid. It would be a better idea if we close our shops for three-four days which would help the health and district authorities to check the spread of disease to some extent.” Most traders have agreed to shut their shops on the weekend to break the infection chain, he added. Traders’ bodies said corrective measures should be initiated by individuals and organisations to assist authorities in breaking the transmission of disease. Closure of markets for some days could contribute in this, said traders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/traders-appeal-for-market-closure-to-break-virus-chain/articleshow/82090048.cms||---

In last two days, two IAS officers and few other officials lost their lives. Imagine about commoners! Many senior IAS, officials, doctors, employees admitted. No beds available even in Patna. Health secretary has asked for doctors from Indian Army (sic),” Tejashwi tweeted on Thursday. In another tweet on Wednesday, the RJD leader had requested PM Narendra Modi and BJP national president J P Nadda to spare health minister Mangal Pandey from the party’s election duty in West Bengal. “Since last year nothing has been done to ramp up the capacity building in government hospitals in Bihar,” Tejashwi tweeted. Pandey, on the other hand, said he was very much present in Bihar and taking stock of the situation on a regular basis. “The RJD believes in spreading rumour and canard to suit its vested interests,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-slams-govt-for-scary-covid-situation/articleshow/82089724.cms||Ramashankar
---||Kolkata||Jab centre in every Kol ward to boost vax drive||Kolkata: In view of the ongoing polls that have led to congregations, risking a further surge in Covid numbers, the government has decided to increase Covid beds, ramp up vaccination at the ward level, enforce micro-containment zones and prohibit overcrowding at transit nodes and terminal points. Currently, the KMC health department is running vaccination centres at 80 wards. According to a KMC health department official, the civic body has planned to vaccinate 15,000 citizens daily across 16 boroughs once 144 vaccination centres — one at each ward — become operational. In a meeting held by home secretary Hari Krishna Dwivedi, which was attended by senior police officers and civic chief executives, it was decided to ramp up vaccination at the grassroot level. In Kolkata, where the rate of infection is the highest among the districts, it was decided to develop vaccination centres at each ward so that people can book vaccination slots on the spot. Chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay spoke to Union home secretary and health secretary to ensure that Bengal, where an eight-phase poll is under way, gets enough vaccines. “Bengal has ramped up vaccination. There will be a shortage if the current rate of vaccination is sustained,” said a senior health department officer. The state has decided to increase the number of beds by 20%. On October 22, when the Covid number peaked in the first wave, the state had 12,751 Covid beds. Similarly, the number of safe houses and satellite treatment facilities would also be increased. Currently, the occupancy rate of Covid bed hovers around 32%. It has been decided that the civic body will open vaccination camps at 144 urban primary health centres across the city. “Currently, we are engaged in strengthening our infrastructure before we can offer citizens vaccination facility from all our urban primary health centres,” a KMC official said. KMC has sent an SOS to send vaccinators and trained paramedics to run the vaccination centres across the city. A KMC official informed that several vaccination centres were witnessing heavy rush after the government decided to vaccinate all above 45 years. “While 300-400 people are queuing up at some of our vaccination centres in areas like Burrabazar, Bidhan Sarani, Taltala, Bhowanipore, Chetla, Behala, Jadavpur, Garia, among others, we hardly have the capacity to attend 150-200 recipients a day for non-availability of vaccine doses,” a KMC health department official said. Police forces have been asked to ensure strict Covid-appropriate behaviour at public places, including in mass transits systems, markets, railways stations and transit points like bus terminus and ferry ghats. The chief secretary has already met commerce chambers and traders’ bodies with an appeal to maintain Covid-apppropriate behaviour. The traders were asked to operate their markets from 11am to 5pm so as to avoid overcrowding in evenings. On Friday, the state government will meet Eastern Railway, South Eastern Railway and Metro Rail officials so that overcrowding can be controlled at stations. It will be decided on Friday whether the Metro needs to revive the e-pass system to limit the number of passengers. The health department on Thursday held a meeting with private hospitals and leading manufacturers of Remdesivir, where it was decided that the government will act as a bridge between private hospitals and pharmaceutical companies to ensure a steady supply of the drug. Currently, there is a shortage of Remdisivir across all private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jab-centre-in-every-kol-ward-to-boost-vax-drive/articleshow/82090148.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||City poll candidates take guard against virus spread||Kolkata: As the city’s Covid graph remains north-bound, a section of political heavyweights locked in the assembly polls contest has decided to impose restrictions on their campaign strategy to save themselves, fellow partymen and people at large. The death of the Congress candidate from Shamshergunge has come as a shocker to many Kolkata-based senior politicians who now feel that they would have to be more responsible. Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, a veteran Trinamool leader, has decided not to participate in any rallies that encourage gathering of party workers in large numbers.“Instead of bringing out large rallies, I have decided to reach out to them personally in my constituency. I shall take the opportunity to remind them of the necessity of maintaining Covid protocols like wearing masks, maintaining social distance or washing hands,” Chattopadhyay told TOI. The state power minister is also reaching out to his voters virtually. Another veteran leader and Chattopadhyay’s colleague in the state cabinet, Subrata Mukherjee, will now be confining himself to visiting his electorate at select housing complexes besides going from door to door in a few neighbourhoods of his Ballygunge constituency. “I have carefully chosen not to participate in a large rally that will add to Covid woes. I can feel that the situation has taken a serious proportion. Accordingly, I have devised my strategy this election season,” he said. Mukherjee would also try to reach out to his voters on social media platforms to reduce the risk of infection. Palash Das, a CPM candidate contesting from the Dum Dum constituency, felt avoiding rallies and road shows was one of the effective means to keep coronavirus at bay. “We have thoughtfully avoided rallies and road shows amid a Covid resurgence. Instead, we have focused on a door-to-door campaign. Party workers are distributing masks where people are not conscious. We have made wearing masks mandatory for our party workers out on campaign,” Das said. However, enforcing Covid protocols some times takes a back seat, conceded BJP candidate Samik Bhattacharya who is contesting from Rajarhat-Gopalpur. “But I shall now plan my election campaign in such a way that will itself carry the message of following the Covid protocol rather than breaking it,” Bhattacharya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-poll-candidates-take-guard-against-virus-spread/articleshow/82090232.cms||Saikat Ray

District collector J Innocent Divya said the Nilgiris too had been witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases, and the main contributors were the people with a travel history to neighbouring districts. The district logged 39 new cases on the day, taking the tally to 9,065, of which 8,748 have recovered from the infection so far. Presently, there are seven containment zones in the district. The positivity rate in the Nilgiris, which has done 3, 92,742 Covid tests, stands at 3%. On an average, 1,250 people are subjected to testing a day. As far as vaccination drive is concerned, 98,144 people have been inoculated till date. According to Divya, while people aged above 45 years constitute 1/3 (2.5 lakh) of the population in the district, only 55,000 of them have taken vaccination so far. The collector had inspected Ooty market and Uzhavar Sandhai on Wednesday. “We found many of the traders aged above 45 years are yet to be inoculated. We have requested them to come forward to get vaccinated, as it will help break the chain of virus transmission.” She said they were well positioned to provide treatment for the positive patients. “We have identified Covid care centres for asymptomatic patients in Ooty, Coonoor, Kotagiri, Gudalur and Pandalur towns. Tourism activities are regulated as per the government norms. E-registration to enter the district will continue,” the collector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/in-nilgiris-active-cases-soar-to-266-from-61-in-a-month/articleshow/82091501.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Need for rapid tests at pvt labs’||Kolkata: With an increasing number of swab samples, laboratories conducting RT-PCR tests across the city are under pressure. Most felt they will either have to start refusing samples or people will have to wait longer for results. In such a scenario, doctors feel there is a need to allow private hospitals to conduct the easier and quicker rapid antigen tests (RAT). “RAT has its limitations. If not used properly, the kits can throw up false negatives, resulting in missing cases. That is why its use is restricted to government health facilities,” said a Swasthya Bhawan source. Last July, ICMR had urged states to approve use of RAT at all government and private labs. Some states, like Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Odisha, have allowed private hospitals to use RAT. “Given the surge, the pressure on RT-PCR labs and the need to break the chain, the use of RAT should be extended to private labs. May be a guideline can be issued,” said former director of medical education Pradip Mitra, a pathologist. Paediatric intensivist Prabhas Prasun Giri has come across an increasing number of children who need to get tested — some urgently. “RT-PCR test is being done only at a few private labs. Where do I send these patients? It is high time the government allowed private hospitals to conduct RAT and introduce other kits,” said Giri. While the lab at SSKM is testing the highest number of samples among the government facilities, Dr Lal Pathlabs and Suraksha are among standalone private labs bearing a major sample burden. “We can run 550 samples a day and are operating at full capacity,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri, attached with the lab at Peerless Hospital.  West Bengal Doctors’ Forum has now written to the state chief secretary to allow RAT at all healthcare centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/need-for-rapid-tests-at-pvt-labs/articleshow/82090093.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The notifications for all the phases have been issued and the nomination process is already over. It is not possible to make any changes in the schedule at this stage. There is no such plan or discussion in EC,” a senior EC functionary told TOI. The fifth phase of polling in Bengal is scheduled for Saturday, followed by three more phases on April 22, 26 and 29. The EC functionary said there was no formal communication from either Banerjee or Trinamool seeking clubbing of the remaining phases. The appeal was only on social media, he said. In a tweet on Thursday, Banerjee wrote, “Amid an ongoing pandemic, we firmly opposed EC's decision to conduct Bengal polls in eight phases. Now, in view of the huge surge in Covid-19 cases, I urge the EC to consider holding the remaining phases in one go. This will protect the people from further exposure to Covid-19.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-rules-out-change-in-state-poll-schedule/articleshow/82090326.cms||Bharti Jain

If the situation continues to worsen in the state, necessary steps will be taken,” the CM told reporters at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) here after taking the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine. “The all-party meeting has been called following an appeal made by PM Narendra Modi to all states to hold such interactions chaired by governors. Suggestions at the meeting will help the government fight the pandemic,” Nitish said. The CM reiterated the need for increase in Covid tests. “Covid cases are now being recorded in rural area as well. The pandemic is no more confined to urban areas,” the CM added. He said equal emphasis is being laid on vaccination so that severity of the infection remains less. “The biggest solution to the crisis is conducting more and more tests. We are conducting more than 1 lakh tests per day and the number will be increased in the coming days,” Nitish said. ‘Expedite IGIMS expansion work’: CM Nitish Kumar held a meeting with the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) officials on Thursday and asked them to expedite the expansion work of the hospital. IGIMS director Dr N R Biswas informed the CM that the first phase of the project was completed and a cancer research centre would be developed in the second phase. The CM directed the IGIMS to fulfil the requirements of doctors and health workers and assured it of providing necessary support.

---||Patna||Patna: Acute shortage of oxygen cylinders hits hospitals||PATNA: A majority of hospitals in the state capital are facing an acute shortage of medical oxygen cylinders as Covid-19 cases surge in Bihar amid the second wave of the pandemic. Private hospitals claimed that the demand for liquid oxygen has doubled in the past couple of weeks as more and more patients need oxygen support while manufacturers are scrambling to plug the gap in the supply and transportation of the life-saving item. Due to the acute shortage, most private hospitals are not able to admit critically ill patients. Some hospitals are even asking family members of critically ill patients to take them elsewhere. On Thursday, a private hospital at Khemnichak asked the family members of 30 of its Covid ward patients to take them to other hospitals as they are running short of oxygen supply. Dr Santosh Kumar, the director of Ford Hospital, told this newspaper that they are helpless and were forced to discharge 30 patients who needed oxygen support. “We have asked the health department, civil surgeon and Patna DM about the urgent need for oxygen cylinders, but no intimation has come from their side,” Kumar said. Pankaj Kumar Mehta administrator and nodal officer for Covid at the Medizone Hospital, Kankerbagh, said 90% of hospitals in Patna are facing an acute shortage of oxygen supply. “We have clubbed with three other hospitals to provide oxygen to the critical patients. But in no time, we will also run out of oxygen supply as the demand is increasing every day,” he said. The administrator of Rajeshwar Hospital, Satyendra Singh, said they had not anticipated that the number of cases of Covid and demand for oxygen would become so high in just a week. Several other hospitals in Patna also sent letters to the health department and district administration to plug the gap. Aparna Minakshi, a nodal officer at Jagdish Memorial Hospital, said to treat Covid patients they need uninterrupted oxygen supply as most patients are critically ill. The crisis has forced the families of patients to run from pillar to posts to admit their loved ones at facilities where oxygen supply is available. Abhijeet Sinha, who hails from Buxar, said his mother who tested positive about a week ago was being treated at a private hospital in Patna. “The hospital administration has asked us to vacate. Where would I take my mother as she is in dire need of oxygen,” he asked and added that he had contacted 4-5 hospitals but none was ready to admit her as they too don't have enough oxygen supply. A resident of Saguna Mor, Abhishek Ranjan, said the state government needs to intervene as Samay Hospital administration has asked the families of 75 Covid patients to transfer them to other hospitals given the shortage of oxygen cylinders. “They say there is no oxygen supply available and asking relatives to discharge their patients. My father needs oxygen and I don’t know what to do,” said Ranjan. “I have tried every means and contacts but failed to arrange an oxygen cylinder for my mother. The hospital has asked us to arrange the oxygen as they are running short of supply,” said Namita Sinha, a resident of Ashiana Colony. Sumit Kumar, a businessman, said he lost his uncle as he didn’t get oxygen on time. “The whole city of Patna has run out of oxygen supply,” he wrote on his Twitter handle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/acute-shortage-of-oxygen-cylinders-hits-hospitals/articleshow/82089514.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Kanpur||265 Remdesivir injections seized, three arrested in Kanpur||KANPUR: The Kanpur unit of Special Task Force (STF), on Thursday, arrested three persons with 265 Remdesivir injections meant for black marketing. Remdesivir is a key medicine, used in the treatment of Covid-19 and is in high demand. Local chemists told TOI that Remdesivir injections are sold at a high price of over Rs 4,000-5,000 per injection in the black market. The STF sleuths nabbed three persons with 265 Remdesivir vials on Thursday from Kidwai Nagar crossing. However, it is yet to be confirmed whether the recovered vials are original or fake. DCP South Raveena Tyagi said, “Prashant Shukla of Naubasta’s Pashupati Nagar and Baktauri Purwa resident Mohan Soni, were arrested with the vials wrapped in a saree packet. On the information provided by the two, STF sleuths arrested Sachin Kumar of Yamuna Nagar Haryana.” During interrogation, they revealed that they had received this supply from West Bengal, the police said. “Prashant and Mohan said that they were supposed to be paid by a person hailing from West Bengal but the he, instead of paying, asked them to take 265 Remdesivir vials from him and deliver them further to one Sachin of Yamuna Nagar, Haryana in lieu of hefty sum,” said the police. The police further said that the batch number on the vials was found to be missing, besides the arrested Kanpur persons also could not produce the bill of the vials. “We have seized the mobile phones of the trio to scan call detail record to ascertain their nexus,” said Tyagi further. STF sources further said that they had started tracking the accused following an input given by military intelligence to Lucknow STF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/265-remdesivir-injections-seized-three-arrested/articleshow/82090060.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Patna||Bihar: Covid 2nd wave last straw for famed Magahi paan farmers||NAWADA: The nationwide lockdown last year had the Magahi paan (betel leaf) farmers hard forcing many of them to quit. Now, the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic has proved to be the proverbial last straw for those hardy farmers, who stuck to farming the famed Magahi, which is produced only in the four districts of Gaya, Nawada, Nalanda and Aurangabad. The Magahi paan along with Katrani rice and Jardalu mango were accorded the Geographical Indicator (GI) tag in 2018. The coveted GI tag had lured many farmers to the cultivation of Magahi in the Magadh range. Randhir Chaurasia of Dheuri village under Hisua police station in Nawada had to throw away damaged paan amounting to Rs1 lakh in 2020 due to the Covid-induced lockdown. "Current prices have come down from Rs 200 per dholi (200 Magahi paan leaves) to Rs20 to 25 rupees per dholi," Chaurasia said. Krishnadeo Prasad Chaurasia of village Dafalpura in the same district saw Magahi paan leaves worth Rs 4 lakh destroyed by severe frost in 2018. "Not a single paisa worth compensation was awarded despite the spot inspection in March 2019 of the three-member team constituted by the agriculture department," he said. Shambhu Prasad, the horticulture director of Nawada district, admitted that the state government did not pay the desired attention to the three-member fact-finding team’s report on the severity of the extensive damage caused Magahi paan due to frost and chilling in 2018. The three-member panel constituted on the direction of then agriculture minister Prem Kumar, comprised scientist Sidhnath Prasad of Magahi Paan Research Centre at Islampur in Nalanda district and affiliated to Bihar Agriculture University (Sabour), Rakesh Kumar, deputy director of Gaya Horticulture department and Shambhu Prasad, the director of Nawada district’s horticulture department. "I would look into the issue by getting in touch with the state-level officials," Prasad said. After the widespread damage due to frost in 2018, Magahi paan worth Rs50crore was damaged in the region due to lockdown, as per local farmers associations. Consequently, many Magahi paan farmers have turned ‘bataidars’ (share-croppers) and now grow paddy and wheat. Yogendra Chaurasia of Dheuri village, who earlier grew Magahi paan in 6 to 7 kathas of land, now works as a ‘raj mistry (mason)’. Rahul Chaurasia, son of Hardwar Prasad, whose family was in Magahi paan farming for three generations, said he doesn’t know how to fund his children’s education from merely growing wheat and paddy. The only silver lining, according to Ranjit Chaurasia, the general secretary of the Magahi Paan Utpadan Kalyan Sangh, is that all farmers who diverted to other ventures maintain a truncated 'bareja' (paan growing enclosure) of a couple of decimal of land so that the "latar" (root) of Magahi paan does not become extinct. "Magahi paan cannot be grown from seed and one needs a shoot of "latar" (root) to grow," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-2nd-wave-last-straw-for-famed-magahi-paan-farmers/articleshow/82089764.cms||S B Sinha
---||Business||Sachin Bansal's company, 7 others apply for bank licences||MUMBAI: Sachin Bansal’s Chaitanya India Finance, former Citibanker Pankaj Vaish and Akhil Kumar Gupta are among the applicants for a bank licence. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday released the names of eight entities that had put in an application for either a universal bank or a small finance bank (SFB) licence. Chaitanya India has earlier announced its intent to pursue a banking licence. Non-bank lender UAE Exchange had first applied in 2017 when it was still part of the BR Shetty Group of companies. It has since been sold and renamed Unimoni. The other applicants in this category are REPCO Bank — a government-promoted cooperative lender operating in the southern states, and Vaish. Coincidentally, the names were released on the same day that Citi announced its decision to exit consumer banking in India, among other markets. There are also four applicants for an SFB licence. They include banking technology provider VSoft Technologies, Calicut City Cooperative Bank and Dvara Kshetriya Gramin Financial Services. The fourth applicant is Gupta. Last month, the central bank had appointed a five-member panel to screen the application for new bank licences. The committee is headed by former RBI deputy governor Shyamala Gopinath. The standing external advisory committee (SEAC) has a term of three years. While announcing the guidelines for new bank licences in 2016, the RBI had indicated that after the central bank screens the applicants, the proposals will be screened by the SEAC. Last year, an internal working group of the RBI reviewing the corporate structure of private banks said that NBFCs owned by corporates should be allowed to set up banks. Considering that top corporates had sought bank licences in the past, it was expected that many corporate-promoted NBFCs would join the queue for a licence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sachin-bansal-co-7-others-apply-for-bank-licences/articleshow/82090922.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Leaders’ deaths show harm electioneering has done’||Kolkata: The deaths of a Covid-positive Congress candidate from Murshidabdad on Thursday and that of another Trinamool Congress leader from the district underline the threat that electioneering poses even as Bengal reels under the impact of the second Covid wave that has seen a far more rapid transmission of the virus than the first one last year, say experts. Leaders’ deaths, they pointed out, was an ominous sign and indicates thousands might have been infected at poll gatherings in Bengal. The daily spike has crossed last year’s peak early last week. Since then, the numbers have been rising at an even greater pace as experts warn that poll gatherings are bound to act as ‘super-spreader’ events, helping to transmit Covid far and wide, faster than ever before. Absence of Covid protocol at election rallies has also been a cause for concern. “Unfortunately, electioneering in Bengal gathered momentum almost simultaneously with the onset of the second wave and the result has been predictably disastrous. Any gathering is a potential spreader and election rallies are no different from any other congregation. There was no effort to restrict these gatherings despite the rising cases. It should have been done on the virtual platform. If the Prime Minister and the chief minister can be seen on TV every day, why do we need to have rallies that can take lives?” said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. He added that the entire campaign exercise should be stopped immediately even though substantial damage has already been done. While daily new cases never reached 1,000 in Kolkata last time, the second wave saw the daily spike touch 1,109 cases on April 11. On April 15, it reached 1,615. In Bengal, daily cases have jumped from 4,043 on April 10 to 6,769 on April 14. With poll campaign reaching a feverish pitch, caution has been thrown to the winds which would be dangerous, said Apollo Gleneagles Hospital consultant Shyamasis Bandopadhyay. “We must wait for 15 days for the impact of each poll phase to manifest. It will not be a pleasant one. At this rate, we will soon run out of hospital beds,” said Bandopadhyay. He, however, added even states where polls are not being held have been hit by the second wave. “In Bengal, the elections are probably hastening the spread,” he said. Any gathering is a threat now and should be prohibited, said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Souren Panja. “The Election Commission should ban all poll gatherings and replace them with virtual alternatives. It’s sad that while we were very cautious when the pandemic began last time, we have let our guards down now. Since the second wave has been a stronger one, we needed to be more cautious now,” said Panja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/leaders-deaths-show-harm-electioneering-has-done/articleshow/82090192.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Senior officers said more than 60% of those infected had been vaccinated twice and around 90% had received the first shot. The traffic police are the worst hit in the second wave, with Jorabagan traffic guard alone reporting two severe cases, one of them a sergeant. Last year, this traffic guard was hit hard and the adjoining Jorabagan police station was declared a containment zone. “The fact that most have been vaccinated has reduced chances of any one of them becoming critical, though a few have been admitted to hospitals,” said an officer. Traffic cops have been asked to start checking and seizing papers wearing gloves, face shields and masks. Almost all traffic guards have also set up isolation rooms for officers and staff. “If anyone feels sick after or during duty, they can stay here until a Covid test is done,” said an ACP. The cops cited the example of a sergeant at a north Kolkata traffic guard who had felt sick and refused to return home as he had aged parents. “His test turned out to be positive and he is now admitted at a Rajarhat hospital,” said an officer. So far, 1,450-odd police personnel have been infected and 24 cops have died due to Covid. “We have begun sending our infected personnel to a Rajarhat facility,” said an officer. “We have also decided to ask those caught without masks to appear in court after lodging each case under the Disaster Management Act. We will avoid making them sit at police stations as that might increase chances of infection among our own staff,” said an officer. A total of 57 people were prosecuted on Thursday. morning. “Most said they felt suffocated by the mask in the heat. But people should have gotten used to it,” said an officer. On Wednesday, a handful of people were asked to leave public areas, like temples, the Maidan and parks. “We took the contact details from those who broke the rules with intention and knowledge, or had flimsy excuses. We told them we would get a notice issued against them from court,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/at-risk-on-roads-traffic-cops-told-to-wear-gloves-when-checking-papers/articleshow/82090258.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Sent home after cases dipped, Cov warriors reinstated at govt hosps||Kolkata: A group of 650-plus Covid-infected migrant labourers, who were relieved of duty as volunteers at city government hospitals last month, have been reinstated. Their contracts have been extended till the end of May in the face of the surge in cases across the state. On March 11, TOI had reported how the Covid warriors in Kolkata were staring at an uncertain future after the state asked them to go home by the end of March since there was a decreasing number of Covid cases in the city. The day the article was published, there were only 244 new cases in the state. On Thursday, the state recorded 6,769 new cases with Kolkata alone recording 1,615. “The decision to release the Covid warriors was taken at a time when the number of cases had come down significantly. But with the rising number of cases now, their contracts have been extended till the end of May. The contract may be extended further depending on the state of infection at that point of time,” said an official attached with the state health department. The news has brought relief to the migrant workers who had been worried about a bleak future after receiving Rs 15,000 stipend per month since August last year. “I was clueless about my future as I went back to my village in Dinhata. But after 10 days, I got a call saying I had been reinstated. I rushed back and resumed my duty at MR Bangur Hospital as a volunteer where I help Covid patients manage their food and take care of the ward linens,” said Saheb Ali, who used to work as a tailor at a Delhi unit before the pandemic. Sarfraz Molla (23), another Covid warrior who is from Murshidabad’s Beldanga and had been working at Belighata ID Hospital during the pandemic, said he hoped the authorities understand their importance and offers some permanent employment. “We have learnt a lot in the last few months and can work well with hospital staff. We even check vitals of patients and take care of their daily medication. I don’t want to go back to my life as a migrant worker in Pune,” said Molla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sent-home-after-cases-dipped-cov-warriors-reinstated-at-govt-hosps/articleshow/82090247.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The sudden closure of the Nature Safari is seen as a huge set back to the state’s tourism industry, which was slowly and steadily recovering. Speaking on the government’s decision to close down the recently inaugurated Nature Safari on Thursday, divisional forest officer Nefamani K said, “It was due to the spike in Covid-19 cases in Nalanda and elsewhere that we decided to shut it. Safety of the people is prime.” As per reports, thousands of visitors from Nalanda and neighbouring districts used to queue up for entry tickets every day, but most of them did not follow Covid-19 guidelines. Earlier this month, the forest department restricted the number of persons allowed on the famous glass bridge at the nature safari to 15 at a time. It was considered the first step towards strict curbs amid the slowly rising Covid cases a fortnight ago. With the inauguration of Nature Safari and new ropeway by chief minister Nitish Kumar on March 26, the footfall of visitors had significantly gone up at Rajgir, which had rekindled the hope of recovery of the loss the tourism sector which it had suffered last year. According to reports 5,000-7,000 visitors from different districts of Bihar and neighbouring states used to visit the Nature Safari. The main attraction is the 200-foot high, 85-foot long and 6-foot wide transparent glass bridge constructed in line of 200 metres high glass bridge of Hangzhou province in China. Besides the transparent glass bridge , the visitors also enjoyed several other recreational amenities including ziplining, shooting range, children's park, butterfly garden, meditation park, cafeteria, suspension bridge, night stay camps, Bihar Darshan at the Nature Safari developed amid thick forests on Rajgir-Jethian Buddha Marg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-spike-forces-indefinite-closure-of-rajgir-nature-safari/articleshow/82089713.cms||Farrukh Nadim

We hope this will break the chain of the virus,” Brajesh Kumar, judge-incharge, administration, told this newspaper on Thursday. “Irshad Ali Rizvi, a senior clerk, died at his home in Muzaffarpur last night,” Kumar said, adding that 25 court employees have tested positive and have gone into home isolation. “We were running physical courts since January till a week ago,” the officer further said, praying that the situation improves soon. Souces said that Rizvi had taken an ambulance ride home to his native place Muzaffarpur for self-quarantine after testing positive. When the district court administration decided to suspend physical hearings and go virtual last week, lawyers had staged a protest. Meanwhile, a lawyer Prabhat K Verma is reported to have tested positive. “He was in home quarantine but there was no medical help to monitor his status. The Covid helpline numbers were unreachable. His oxygen level dipped to 56 last evening and we rushed him to the medical college hospital,” Prashant, the patient’s nephew said, adding that his lawyer uncle has been put on ventilator. “His condition is critical,” he added. Meanwhile, with 109 new Covid cases coming to light in the district on Thursday, the total number of active cases rose to 615 in just 12 days. “ Altogether 18 patients have been hospitalised. The rest are in home isolation,” civil surgeon (CS) Arun K Sinha said. He said that 83 containment zones have been earmarked. “While 41 containment zones are in Bettiah alone, the number is likely to increase.” The CS, however, expressed his inability to assess and trace the contact chain that is feared to have emanated from the civil court premises, given the fact that physical courts were held till just a week back and litigants from all over the district would visit the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/civil-court-closed-as-many-test-ve/articleshow/82089746.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

---||Business||Piramal expands into 7 retail fin segments, to leverage DHFL network||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: Piramal Group on Thursday expanded its foray into seven segments in retail finance. The group’s retail arm will provide funds for affordable as well as mass housing, loans against property, secured small business loans, purchase finance, unsecured loans and used car loans. Announcing the diversification, Piramal Retail Finance CEO Jairam Sridharan said that the group would use DHFL’s distribution footprint in 300 centres and existing customer base to grow business in these segments. He added that the focus would be small businesses in non-metros, which he described as ‘budget customers of Bharat’. He said that the strategy was to use technology to reach out to customers who were hitherto unserved by institutional lenders. “We have doubled the employee base of retail finance business from 500 to 1,000 in FY21 and we now plan to double it again in FY22,” said Sridharan. “While we will be using DHFL’s network, that is not the end. In five years, we want to be present in 1,000 towns and cities,” said Sridharan. Piramal, which won the bid for DHFL, has raised Rs 18,000-crore equity for its finance business. He said that the company aims to increase the share of retail, which is currently 11% of its Rs 45,000 loan book, to two-thirds of the book. According to Sridharan, this was the right time to grow retail business as many of the traditional lenders in this segment are pulling back. “The best time to start a lending business is at the bottom of the cycle,” he said. The Piramal Group’s lending business is undertaken by Piramal Capital & Housing and Piramal Retail Finance — both of which are subsidiaries of Piramal Enterprises. Post-acquisition of DHFL, the group has announced its intent to merge its housing finance business with the acquired company. There is also a likelihood that there would be a restructuring of the business at the holding company level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/piramal-expands-into-7-retail-fin-segments-to-leverage-dhfl-network/articleshow/82090698.cms||Mayur Shetty

A team of frontline staff, who found the carcass near Pethikuttai Pirivu on Wednesday evening, alerted senior forest department officials. Forest veterinary officer A Sukumar and assistant conservator of forest M Senthilkumar visited the place on Thursday morning. Sukumar, who conducted an autopsy, said no external injuries were found. “The two-and-a-half-year-old animal had died two days ago. It had suffered internal injuries on its right abdomen. The abdomen had undigested food. Lungs and heart were reddish. The liver was pale brown. We have collected tissue samples, which will be sent to the laboratory,” he said.The calf could have died after an adult elephant pushed it into a gorge, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/female-elephant-calf-found-dead-in-sirumugai-forest/articleshow/82090350.cms||---
---||Goa||Hospitals & ICUs full as statesees biggest single-day spike in Goa||PANAJI/ MARGAO: Goa on Thursday witnessed its record single-day spike as 757 Covid-19 cases were reported, putting the state’s health infrastructure in tatters with all the nearly 550 beds, including 75 in private hospitals, occupied. The 318-bed South Goa district hospital—the designated Covid hospital—was full and so was its nine-bed ICU. The step down ITU, which had nine beds commissioned on Wednesday, had eight of its beds occupied, as hundreds of patients continued to fill up its emergency room. With the steep rise in cases, Goa’s case positivity rate has accelerated to 28%, which is probably the highest in the country. The tally of active cases in the state rose to 5,681, while it reported five casualties, also the highest toll in the past several months, as the mortality count went up to 863. In all, nine people have died over the past 48 hours. Thursday’s record spike surpasses the previous highest of 740 positive cases reported on September 12, last year. “We had 171 cases come to the emergency room of the hospital on Wednesday, the highest number we have seen since the hospital was commissioned in September last year. Today, the emergency room was also teeming with fresh cases,” a senior doctor at the South Goa district hospital said. To tide over the situation, two more assistant matrons from Goa Medical College and Hospital were deputed to the South Goa district hospital on Thursday, while four more ward nurses were expected to join on Friday to ensure optimal functioning of all wards, sources said. Health minister Vishwajit Rane said the bed capacity would be further scaled up and added the ESI hospital, Margao, will also begin catering to Covid patients requiring hospitalisation. “ESI hospital will also be starting ICU and ITU units to manage rising cases,” Rane said. ESI hospital, which treated Covid patients during the first wave of the pandemic last year, is currently notified as a Covid care centre—of the 86 beds available, almost half of them are occupied—where most of those admitted are asymptomatic. At the 60-bedded Covid care centre at Fatorda, 25 beds were occupied by Thursday, sources said. The surge in infections in urban areas continued with Panaji, Porvorim, Margao, Candolim, Mapusa and Ponda reporting a sharp rise for yet another day. On Thursday, Margao alone had 660 active cases. “ESI hospital has to be reopened for Covid patients, there’s no choice. It can function as a step-down hospital,” a health official said, describing the rise in Covid cases and hospital admissions as “exponential” and “worse than last year”. “There are excellent facilities available, but the public is carefree and careless and as a result doctors and nurses are now fatigued. This cannot go on and on,” a healthcare worker said. The recovery rate, which has been on the decline for the past several days, dipped further to 90% on Thursday. Until last month, it ranged between 96% and 97%. As many as 182 patients were cured over the past 24 hours, even as there were 97 hospital admissions and 367 patients under home-isolation. The South Goa district hospital, which treats mild to severe Covid cases, created an additional male ward after the existing one filled up quickly as it has been receiving more male admissions compared to female. The 15-bed obstetrics ward has pregnant women and those who have delivered. The hospital also has six new-born babies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hospitals-icus-full-as-statesees-biggest-single-day-spike/articleshow/82091957.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Ahmedabad||Eight Pakistanis held with 30 kg of heroin off Gujarat||AHMEDABAD/NEW DELHI: A fishing boat with eight Pakistani nationals and 30 kg of heroin was seized in a joint operation off the Jakhau coast by the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and the Gujarat Police’s anti-terrorist squad (ATS) in the early hours of Thursday. ICG director general Krishnaswamy Natarajan said fast interceptor craft, along with ATS personnel, had been continuously deployed since an “input” was received on Tuesday about suspected narcotics being trafficked by a Pakistani fishing boat “NUH” off the Gujarat coast. During the “concerted surveillance operation”, the boat was finally detected inside Indian waters on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. “We nabbed the Pakistani fishing boat, with eight persons, off Jakhau. On boarding and rummaging, the boat was found to be carrying 30 packets of heroin, each weighing a kg, which in the international market is valued at Rs 300 crores,” said Natarajan. The boat, with its eight-member crew, is being escorted to Jakhau for further investigations. “In the last 19 months, the ICG has apprehended over 1.6 tonne of narcotics worth around Rs 5,200 crore,” he added. “The contraband was loaded from Karachi in Pakistan and was to be delivered to Punjab via Gujarat,” said an ATS officer, adding that the agency is close on the trail of those who were to receive the drugs in Gujarat. Deputy superintendent of police, ATS, Bhavesh Rozia, had learnt from his informers that a Pakistan-registered boat ‘Nuh’, carrying heroin, would arrive at the Gujarat coast near Jakhau port of Kutch district during early hours of Thursday, ATS officials said. Based on the tip-off, Gujarat ATS personnel reached Jakhau and teamed up with the ICG for the operation to catch the drug-runners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/8-pakistanis-held-with-30-kg-of-heroin-off-guj/articleshow/82090579.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Covid-19 treatment gets cheaper in Vadodara||VADODARA: In a major respite to the citizens, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has reduced the Covid-19 hospitalisation charges in private hospitals. The decision was taken after taking the association of private hospitals in the city, Setu, into confidence. The decision was taken after a meeting of elected representatives of the city, VMC officials and officer on special duty Vinod Rao. Setu representatives also held an online meeting with Rao before giving consent to the new rates. Since May last year, designated Covid hospitals in the city have been divided into two categories — Segment (I) has the hospitals that do not have an ICU while Segment (II) has hospitals with ICU. Earlier the charges for normal ward beds and high dependency unit (HDU) beds varied as per the category of the hospital. It has now been decided that the charges of a bed in a normal ward will be capped at Rs 4,500 in both the segments. Similarly, the charges for a bed in HDU have been capped at Rs 6,000. ICU beds without ventilators in Segment II have a capping of Rs 13,500 per day. Similarly, the highest amount that can be charged for a bed with ventilators in private hospitals now stands at Rs 16,000. The rates include meals, cost of PPE kits, masks and routine medicines that include antibiotics, HCQ, ivermectin, zinc, multivitamins and others oral drugs. The patient will have to bear additional charges of medicines like remdesivir, flavipiravir, tocilizumab and others. The charges do not include those for super-specialists, but these have also been capped at Rs 1,000 per visit. To increase beds and ensure that there is no discrepancy in billing due to room category, it has been decided that the hospitals will do away with beds in semi-special and special categories. Setu president Dr Krutesh Shah said that the hospitals needed to do their bit in these times of pandemic. “The decision will benefit the common man. Hospitals can earn a little less in this time of crisis,” he said. Minister of state for Narmada and urban housing Yogesh Patel said that in case patients are overcharged, they can complain to the VMC. He added that a team of chartered accountants would also be roped in to look into the complaints. Rao said that people should avoid paying cash to hospitals so that if there are any grievances in the future, there is evidence of payment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ncov-treatment-gets-cheaper-in-vadodara/articleshow/82089699.cms||---

Experts and residents, however, believe re-imposition of lockdown is not a suitable option. Instead, stricter surveillance, containment and caution are the way forward. While states like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have already imposed weekend lockdowns, night curfews and stricter curbs to break the chain of transmission, the Bihar government has so far not announced any major step to contain the pandemic. The government, it is believed, would decide its future course of action after an all-party meeting on Covid situation to be chaired governor Phagu Chauhan on April 17. D M Diwakar, an economist, said imposing lockdown will directly impact each section of society and have a cascading effect on socio-economic set up of the state. “The objective of a lockdown is to buy some time for preparing ways to further tackle the situation. The government had a year to do so, but it failed miserably. More lockdowns will only result in loss of livelihood for the poor,” he said. Bihar Industries Association (BIA) president Ram Lal Khaitan said small businesses which bore the brunt of the pandemic last year can no longer survive another lockdown. “Government should come up with a comprehensive approach to balance life and livelihood,” he added. Political leaders have expressed hope that the government will consider people’s plight while taking decisions. JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said, “I am sure the government will come up with a decision prioritising both public health and economy.” RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said considering the track record of Nitish Kumar-led NDA government in the state, no public-centric decisions can be expected. “In spite of having a year to prepare for the second wave, the government did nothing,” he said. The pandemic-hit common people have appealed to the government to speed up the vaccination drive. “We will not be able to survive the second phase of lockdown,” said Sunny Kumar, an autorickshaw driver. Devendra Pranu, executive of an electronic shop, said, “The government should ramp up health facilities in the state and be proactive as people like us can no longer bear the brunt of another lockdown.” Nishant Singh, a businessman, said, “The scale and severity of Covid-19 demand faster vaccination, tests and stricter surveillance, not lockdown.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-stricter-curbs-not-lockdown-need-of-the-hour/articleshow/82089599.cms||---

They were isolated at a hotel here. Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar said 16 of 579 passengers who reached Patna Junction by the Lokmanya Tilak Terminus-Patna Junction special passenger train (03202) tested positive for Covid-19. Of 42 passengers who reached Patna Junction by Lokmanaya Tilak Terminus-Guwahati special passenger train (05645), five tested positive for the virus, he added. He said railway employees working at stations, workshops, depots, control rooms and offices have been asked to adhere to Covid protocols. “Platform tickets are not being issued in a bid to check unnecessary rush of people at the stations,” he added. The DRM said benches, chairs, washbasins, bathrooms, door knobs and ticket booking counters are being disinfected at major railway stations like Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Patliputra Junction and Danapur. Railways to run two pairs of special trains: The railways has decided to run two pairs of special passenger trains on Samastipur- Mumbai Central and Samastipur-Ahmedabad routes to clear rush of passengers.

The last time the RBI had conducted such an exercise was in 1999. In a statement issued here, the central bank said considering the developments in the regulatory functions and “evolution of the regulatory perimeter”, it is has decided to revisit the regulations. The RRA 2.0 will function for one year and review prescriptions internally and seek suggestions from the RBI-regulated entities and other stakeholders on their simplification and ease of implementation. The terms of reference of the committee include removing redundancies and duplications in the rules, obviating the need of paper-based submissions, improving ease of compliance and revising the dissemination process of RBI’s instructions. According to the RBI, the first RRA’s recommendations helped streamline and increase the effectiveness of several procedures and simplified regulatory prescriptions. It also paved the way for the issuance of the master circular and reduced reporting burden on regulated entities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-sets-up-panel-to-overhaul-rules/articleshow/82090601.cms||---

Azhar told TOI, “I don’t have to inform anybody about the T10 League in the UAE. Conflict of interest applies only in India. This is an international tournament approved by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Whoever I had to inform in the BCCI, I have done it.” Azhar, who had earlier issued the show-cause notice to some members of the Apex Council seeking their explanation for an alleged violation of the rules and regulations at the recent 85th annual general body meeting (AGM), said the members were acting against the interests of the HCA. “They are doing things clandestinely by changing the address of the HCA and filing cases without my knowledge. As the HCA president, I should be made aware of any court case. The notice was slapped on them based on high court order. It is very clear that they have done wrong,” he said. He further said, “I am not answerable to them. The court order is very clear about their misdemeanour.” Azharuddin had written to the registrar of societies of Rangareddy district on April 12, asking him not to entertain the minutes of the AGM held on April 11 unless they were sent by him. “I hereby submit that the official minutes of the AGM are being prepared and the same would be submitted at the earliest duly signed by the president, who is the chairperson,” Azhar said in his communication. As per the HCA by-laws, secretary prepares the minutes of the AGM and the Apex Council meetings. Former secretary T Shesh Narayan said the minutes are prepared by the secretary and signed by the president before being submitted to the registrar’s office. “The minutes need to have both their signatures. It will be difficult for the registrar to accept the minutes with just one signature,” he said. Apex Council members — HCA vice-president K John Manoj, secretary R Vijayanand, joint secretary Naresh Sharma and treasurer Surender Agarwal — replied on Wednesday, alleging several violations by Azhar. “Nowhere it is mentioned (in the constitution) that the president has the powers to issue a show-cause notice. Therefore, issuance of the notice is atrocious and a cheap tactic of twisting the facts,” they said in their letter. They argued that the issue first needs to be discussed in the Apex Council before a notice is served on the members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mentor-row-azhar-hits-back-says-kept-bcci-in-loop/articleshow/82091504.cms||Solomon S Kumar
---||Business||Citi to exit consumer banking business in India||MUMBAI: Citibank, the largest foreign lender in India, has said that it will exit consumer business in the country as it does not have the scale required to compete. The multinational bank has a host of consumer business in India, including credit cards, mortgages, and personal banking. The decision was conveyed by the bank’s global CEO Jane Fraser during the earnings conference for the first quarter where she announced exit from its consumer franchises in 13 countries. Citi has operated in India since 1902 and despite having only 35 branches has a large market-leading franchise thanks to digital channels. “As a result of the ongoing refresh of our strategy, we have decided that we are going to double down on wealth. We will operate our consumer banking franchise in Asia and EMEA solely from four wealth centres, Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE and London,” said Fraser. The other 12 markets that the bank will exit are: Australia, Bahrain, China, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. “While the other 13 markets have excellent businesses, we don’t have the scale we need to compete. We believe our capital, investment dollars and other resources are better deployed against higher returning opportunities in wealth management and our institutional businesses in Asia,” said Fraser. Ashu Khullar, Citi India CEO said: “There is no immediate change to our operations and no immediate impact to our colleagues as a result of this announcement. In the interim, we will continue to serve our clients with the same care, empathy and dedication that we do today.” While Fraser has announced the road map, the exit from India would require a clearance from the RBI as the central bank would need to approve the new buyer. Incidentally, the RBI had recently amended its norms allowing credit card companies to be part of the interbank payment system which means that a bank licence may not be mandatory to run a credit card business. Until now SBI Card — the only non-bank in the business — was the only exception as all other issuers including American Express are banks. “Citi has been a deeply imbedded institution in India and the sharpened strategy announced today will strengthen our ability to bring the full global power of Citi to our institutional clients, reinforcing our leading positions across corporate, commercial and investment banking, treasury and trade solutions, as well as smarkets and securities Services,” said Khullar. The sale of the card business in India could generate significant value for the bank. SBI Card has a market capitalisation of Rs 85,000 crore. In India, Citi serves 29 lakh retail customers with 12 lakh bank accounts and nearly 27 lakh credit cards with a 6% share of credit card spend with average card spends around 1.4 times higher than industry. It is also a market leader in wealth management with the largest assets under management among foreign banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/citi-to-exit-consumer-banking-biz-in-india/articleshow/82090869.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||IL&FS aims to recover 62% of Rs 99,000 crore debt||MUMBAI: The board of IL&FS has increased the recovery target to Rs 61,000 crore from Rs 56,000 crore. It also said that Rs 43,000-crore debt has already been resolved. The increased target is nearly 62% of the overall fund and non-fund based group debt of about Rs 99,000 crore as of October 2018. The aggregate debt of Rs 43,000 crore addressed to date is nearly 71% of the overall revised targeted recovery value of Rs 61,000 crore and 44% of the overall debt of over Rs 99,000 crore. “Between now and September 2021, we see this (Rs 43,000 crore of addressed debt) number going up in excess of Rs 50,000 crore. Thereafter, we are increasing our overall estimate of what we think we can resolve to Rs 61,000 crore, or close to 62%, of the total debt,” Uday Kotak, the government-appointed non-executive chairman of IL&FS board, said. Describing the infrastructure and finance conglomerate’s resolution as ‘peeling an onion’ Kotak said the number of companies has shrunk from 347 to 186 and will come down to double digits in the current fiscal. The new board, which took over the challenge of resolving the conglomerate’s debt in October 2018, faced a fresh challenge after the Covid outbreak last year. There was an instance when all the 12 members of a credit appraisal team looking at the company’s assets were infected with Covid. A major challenge was of state governments reneging on their annuity payments to some IL&FS group companies. This was because finances were stretched due to the pandemic. While banks have agreed to restructure loans where repayment was hit by delay in state government payments, a further delay could result in these loans turning bad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ilfs-aims-to-recover-62-of-rs-99000cr-debt/articleshow/82090499.cms||---

This remark from the CJI, who was heading a bench comprising Justices Sanjay K Kaul and Surya Kant, came during hearing of a plea filed by Supreme Court Women Lawyers’ Association seeking fair representation of women among HC judges. Against a sanctioned strength of 1,080 high cour tjudges, only 661 are in place, including 73 women judges (11%). Appearing for the association, advocate Sneha Kalita said, “There is not even a whisper in the memorandum of procedure (MoP) for appointment of judges about appointment of women advocates as judges of high courts.” The CJI said, “If there is no mention of women in the MoP, there is also no mention of other vulnerable sections of society. But when we sit in collegium, we deliberate on suitability of women advocates, judicial officers as well as advocates and judicial officers of vulnerable classes for appointment as HC judges. “Many women, when offered judgeship, decline saying their children are either in Class 10 or 12 and other domestic compulsions. It is not that all women say this. Many have accepted and have performed well... We have the interest of women in mind and are implementing it to the best of our abilities. You point out good women candidates and we will consider them for appointment as HC judges.” When senior advocate Vikas Singh and advocate Shobha pointed out that even after 71 years of working of the Constitution, India did not have a woman CJI, Justice Bobde said, “It is time we select a woman judge to the SC who would become the CJI. The time for a woman CJI has come.” Women took up the legal profession after the ban on their entry was lifted in 1923. But so far, of the 247 SC judges, only eight have been women — Fathima Beevi (1987), Sujata Manohar, Ruma Pal, Gyan Sudha Mishra, Ranjana Desai, R Banumathi, Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee. While Madras high court has 13 women judges, the highest among the HCs, there are no women judges in the HCs in the states of Manipur, Meghalaya, Bihar, Tripura and Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/many-women-cite-compulsions-decline-judgeship-chief-justice-of-india-sa-bobde/articleshow/82093620.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

They were provided SPO cards and played a crucial role in the overall crowd management. District sanghchalak of RSS Rohtas Singh Chauhan told TOI, “Social service is the goal of our organisation and following a request from the Kumbh Mela police we sent our young volunteers on duty. They were deployed by the mela police at different places." "The mela police asked our volunteers' services for a week, but we are always ready to serve if they seek any further assistance in future," Chauhan said. These volunteers performed their duties during the day and their work was praised by police officials, locals and visiting pilgrims. They also made people aware of the Covid protocols. Similarly, on the request of police, Seva Dal - a Congress outfit - sent at least 64 workers to the Kumbh Mela on royal bathing festivals. They also received SPO cards and were deployed at various other points. Kumbh Mela IG Sanjay Gunjyal said, “We are happy that both RSS and Congress workers were at the service of the pilgrims for a common cause at the Kumbh. They were deployed at different places. No doubt, they have done tremendous crowd management work.” Not only RSS and Seva Dal volunteers, a total of 2,257 volunteers of 18 other social groups and individuals were posted as SOPs by the Kumbh police to assist them in crowd management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-1000-rss-volunteers-at-kumbh-mela-get-special-police-officer-cards/articleshow/82090344.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Kolkata||Plasma demand up, but no stock in banks||Kolkata: The surge in active cases has brought back the demand for plasma donors. Calls have started pouring in at plasma banks and other voluntary organizations, but no plasma bank — including the one at Medical College Hospital Kolkata — has a stock at present. “During the first wave, we issued 200-plus plasma units,” said transfusion medicine specialist Ritam Chakraborty, who heads the transfusion medicine and blood bank at AMRI Hospital Dhakuria. During the first wave, convalescent plasma therapy was one of the treatments doctors resorted to. Apart from the plasma banks attached with private hospitals in the city, the state launched one at MCHK. But as infections started dwindling, the requisition for plasma had diminished for close to four months before the sudden surge about two weeks ago. “About 65% of donors at our unit were healthcare and frontline workers, most of who are now vaccinated. Post vaccination, there is scarcity of donors. We appeal to donors to come in,” said Prasun Bhattacharya, head of immunohaematology and blood transfusion medicine at MCHK. Experts felt a lack of guidelines from any Indian authority on plasma donation after vaccination could be a factor for the crisis. “A person who got infected in the past six months can donate plasma 28 days after the second dose,” said transfusion medicine expert Suvro Datta. “We are trying to activate our donor pool and mobilize more to come in,” said Ajay Mittal of Project Life Force, which helped many with donors during the Covid peak in 2020. Doctors, however, warned that plasma therapy was not meant for all patients. Meanwhile, a study during the first wave by three doctors — Abhijit Mandal from West Bengal Blood Transfusion Council, Ritam Chakarabrty of AMRI Dhakuria and Suvro Sankha Datta of Tata Medical Centre — on whole blood-derived convalescent plasma was published in ‘Transfusion and Apheresis Science’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/plasma-demand-up-but-no-stock-in-banks/articleshow/82090203.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Though officials claim to have sealed 187 kilns, some were not sealed entirely, said V Venugopal, secretary of the association. “Tangedco had disconnected power only to brick manufacturing units. Kiln owners are using power supply to their offices to switch on lights and are sending out brick loads,” he said. “Tipper lorries continue to take loads of bricks from kilns in the dead of the night. Lorries frequent the kilns between 3am and 4am.

---||Patna||Bihar: Private oxygen plants told to divert supply from industries to hospitals||PATNA: The state government on Thursday diverted 90% of oxygen manufactured by three private plants in Patna for use by all hospitals treating Covid-19 patients in Patna as demand for medical oxygen has skyrocketed in the last few days, and suppliers are unable to meet the requirement. Industries department additional chief secretary Brijesh Mehrotra directed Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh to divert the oxygen supply from industrial units to hospitals at a high-level virtual meeting held on Thursday. Deepak Kumar, advisor to CM Nitish Kumar, Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, civil surgeon Vibha Kumari, nodal officers of all private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients and representatives of oxygen refilling plants in Patna were present at the meeting. Later, the DM issued orders to divert 90% of the oxygen for use by hospitals and deputed a magistrate at each of the three manufacturing units for monitoring. Singh deputed a nodal officer for every Covid-19 hospital to monitor the daily demand and supply along and also ordered the formation of a cell to oversee the situation. The DM also directed the SDOs of Patna City, Sadar and Danapur to keep an eye on illegal oxygen storage at hospitals. As per the government authorities at the meeting, till now it is only Patna where medical oxygen is in short supply. It was divisional commissioner Agarwal who came up with the suggestion during the meeting that around 50% of oxygen produced in Patna is still being supplied to industries and it may be diverted for medical use for a few days to save lives until alternate arrangements of liquid oxygen tankers are made. As per the DM, private hospitals of Patna are generating a demand of 10,000 oxygen cylinders per day and plants can refill around 7,000 cylinders. The representatives of oxygen refilling plants in Patna told the government authorities that they needed a continuous supply of at least four tankers of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) per day for their manufacturing plants so that they can keep refilling cylinders and try to meet the demand of hospitals. They said liquid oxygen is not manufactured in the state. At the meeting, the industries department authorities established contact with multinational gas plants outside the state who agreed to supply liquid oxygen for Patna hospitals. However, they asked for arranging tankers to which DM proposed that nitrogen carrying tankers of Bihar state milk cooperative federation limited could be used for the purpose. Mehrotra asked DM to also make arrangements for procuring oxygen from plants in districts such as Begusarai, Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur, Purnia, Aurangabad, Darbhanga, Motihari and Gaya. The possibility of setting up plants for manufacturing liquid oxygen on a war footing was also explored at the meeting but a Patna-based oxygen manufacturing plant owner said it would take around two years to set up a plant for manufacturing liquid oxygen as most of the machinery is imported and up to six months to set up a plant which would produce oxygen from the air. However, CM’s advisor Kumar asked Mehrotra to explore the possibility of plants that could be set up in the next six months in Patna for future needs and the government will extend all possible help for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/private-oxygen-plants-told-to-divert-supply-from-industries-to-hospitals/articleshow/82089584.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The ornaments and money were stolen from his house at Kowdiar. Police said that it wasn’t a break in as none of the windows or doors were smashed or broken. The thief is suspected to have made his way through the gap of a wooden panel near the courtyard. It had a curtain cover and a mosquito net. The thief might have slid through the small space of the wooden panel and then undid the mosquito net made of aluminium to enter the house. Night vision camera visuals from inside the house showed a fair, lean man wearing masks. He is seen taking his face cover off, probably unaware of the cameras installed inside the house. Police, however, couldn’t recover any other visuals since the courtyard and the suspected point of entry were not covered by CCTV in the house. The police team has also checked the surroundings for other camera visuals but only found two CCTV cameras in the vicinity. The visuals did not reveal much about the arrival of the thief, the vehicle he may have used and his direction of exit. Police said that the thief took a bag containing cash and ornaments from the top floor and brought it downstairs. There were also some artificial gold ornaments, which the thief may have taken for real gold. The bag was packed ready for Govindan’s daughter who was scheduled to leave for Bengaluru on Thursday. The theft came to light by Wednesday morning. The house didn’t have a burglary alarm system. However, the thief was able to evade the dogs being reared in the house. Police said that he may have been sure of his point of entry as it did not involve smashing glass or breaking the lock. Police have started making a sketch of the suspect based on CCTV visuals collected from the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/police-begin-probe-into-theft-at-jewellers-house-in-tvm/articleshow/82090351.cms||---

However, teachers or officers of the rank of professors and associate professors will have to attend to their duties daily. In a partial modification to its earlier notification issued on April 10, the education department has also notified that in primary schools where there are only two teachers, each teacher would attend to his or her duty on alternate day. In case, if there are more than two teachers in a school, 33% of them would attend to their duties every day. In middle and secondary schools, headmasters have been asked to report to their duties daily. However, only 33% of other teachers and non-teaching staff would attend to their duties by rotation. In all the educational institutions, classes are already being held in online mode and students need not visit their campus for academic activities. All other instructions issued by the department in the said notification of April 10 would have to be followed, the notification said. The department had announced suspension of academic activities in all schools, colleges and coaching institutions till April 18 in view of the second wave of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the Magadh Mahila College on Thursday wrote to the Patna University (PU) registrar, informing him that the college would be kept closed for the next 10 days. MMC principal Shashi Sharma said it was really very difficult for the college staff to control the crowd of girls visiting the college for their admission or registration work. “A number of staff and teachers have tested Covid-19 positive in the last few days,” she said. PU examination controller R K Mandal said the university examinations scheduled to commence later this month have already been postponed in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases. PU vice-chancellor G K Chaudhary, Patna Science College principal S R Padmadeo and a number of teachers and non-teaching staff have already tested positive for the virus, he said.

On short supply of oxygen cylinders and alleged hoarding of some medicines, Sinha said people should treat fight against the pandemic as “mahayuddha” and unite to overcome it.

Almost 50 feet of the wall that runs along Anna Nagar Road in Cheran Nagar collapsed during the 15mm rainfall. Other portions have developed cracks.“The wall collapsed and fell on barren land. No one was injured because it occurred at midnight. On normal days, local boys play cricket on the ground and people use it to graze cows,” said J Sadhiq, a commuter. The corporation removed the debris around 1.30pm on Thursday. DMK MLA N Karthik slammed municipal administration minister S P Velumani for the debacle. “For one person’s selfishness, all landmarks of the city are getting destroyed. Construction of this wall was part of the Rs 998 crore-worth work, including beautifying Ukkadam Periyakulam, Valankulam and playground. The collapse of this wall proves that substandard materials were used for its construction and the corruption involved” he said.MNM founder Kamal Haasan flayed the state government for poor quality of Smart City construction work in the wake of the wall collapse. Meanwhile, the rain also led to drainage overflow from Gandhi Park’s south gate, near Sullivan Street. “The street is stinking and motorists are not able to drive out from the parking lot,” said J Santhosh, a goldsmith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/wall-around-periyakulam-lake-collapses-in-rain/articleshow/82090380.cms||---
---||Goa||Stay firm, don’t scrap GoaMiles: CII to govt||Panaji: After the Goa State Industries Association, the Confederation of Indian Industry’s Goa chapter has come out in support of the state government and has asked chief minister Pramod Sawant to remain firm in the ongoing stand-off with taxi operators. It has asked the government not to give in to the demand to scrap the app-based cab service, GoaMiles. In a letter to Sawant, CII chairman Atul Jadhav said that the protests by taxi operators are detrimental to the progress of Goa. Jadhav also said that it is “unreasonable to put forth uncompetitive demands” such as scrapping of GoaMiles. “The CII would like to urge the government not to succumb to the pressures of the taxi lobby in the state, but ensure that GoaMiles continues its operations and also allow other app-based taxi service aggregators to operate in the interest of the tourists, resident Goans and the industry,” Jadhav stated in the letter. The CII said that since Goa lacks proper public transport, there is a need for a reliable app-based taxi service which offers a convenient, transparent and seamless mode of travel. In August 2019, during a similar situation, the CII had supported the state government. This time again, the CII has appealed to Sawant and the ministers to remain firm. Taxi operators have been on strike for close to 10 days demanding that GoaMiles should be scrapped. The CII has urged the taxi operators to agree to meet with transport minister Mauvin Godinho without any pre-conditions. The industry body said that it is very unreasonable to put forth preconditions for the meeting when the government has given a viable and transparent app-based option. It said that it is backing GoaMiles because an app-based taxi service helps stop errant taxi operators from taking undue advantage of helpless or stranded tourists. The industry body also asked the government to remain firm about the installation of digital meters for taxis in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stay-firm-dont-scrap-goamiles-cii-to-govt/articleshow/82091988.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Coimbatore||Chippiparai dog squad to check wildlife crimes||Coimbatore: In a first, the Coimbatore forest division would get the native dog breed Chippiparai to sniff out wildlife crimes. The dog, along with three other dogs of the same breed, is currently undergoing training at the Tamil Nadu Forestry Training College at Vaigai dam in Theni district. It will be deployed as the sniffer dog in the forest division from June.The remaining three dogs would be deployed in Pollachi, Nilgiris and Gudalur forest divisions.The forest department had bought the four Chippiparai puppies a month ago and handed them over to the training college. They have also been named – Valavan (for Coimbatore) Kaduvan (for Pollachi), Kaligan (for Nilgiris) and Athavai (for Gudalur forest division).R Rajmohan, principal, Tamil Nadu Forestry Training College, said the four dogs were being trained by the trainers with the Tamil Nadu police department and Indian military. “They have been training the dogs to obey commands for the past one month. Hereafter, they will be trained to detect forest crimes.”He said the dogs could easily sniff sandal and teak woods, and skins of various wild animals. “If people are illegally possessing sandalwood or deer meat, the dogs could easily detect them. The maintenance for this native dog breed is very less than that of imported dog breeds.”Rajmohan said the native dog breed could be taken to the reserve forest, where it could easily be put up in a place for 15 days. “But the imported breeds need more medications and maintenance. Chippiparai and Kombai breeds are very sharp to detect wildlife crimes. Kombai is one of the best guarding dogs and we can leave a wildlife crime accused with Kombai, as it won’t allow that person to escape.”Pointing out that the dogs would complete the three-month training by May-end, he said they would then be handed over to the respective forest divisions.The Coimbatore forest division has appointed two anti-poaching watchers as the sniffer dog handler and helper. The duo will take care of the dog and familiarize them with the Madukkarai, Boluvampatti, Coimbatore, Periyanaickenpalayam, Karamadai, Mettupalayam and Sirumugai forest ranges in the division to detect wildlife crimes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/chippiparai-dog-squad-to-check-wildlife-crimes/articleshow/82090391.cms||A Subburaj

---||Delhi||Delhi: Rush results in long wait for Covid-19 tests, results delayed||NEW DELHI: Laboratories are overwhelmed with requests to collect Covid-19 samples, forcing most of them to either turn down the callers and ask them to speak to the customer-care executives. There also is a delay now in giving out the results. TOI spoke to lab executives to learn first-hand why the test flow has clogged up. One said his facility now had a waiting period of three days. Of the 70 test slots per day, the next available was on 18 April. Another private lab could offer slots only two days later. “We are overbooked. Even if the sample collector goes to a particular area, we cannot accommodate another request because as soon as we finish at one house, we have to immediately rush to another,” said the executive. Dr Naveen Dang, consultant microbiologist at Dr Dang's Lab, claimed that all reports were “released within 24 hours”, but added that the lab’s workload was very heavy. “Other labs may have delaying the results, but that’s possible given the massive demand for tests,” said Dang. “A machine breakdown or shortfall in manpower can affect operations. Also, in many cases, the lab personnel are falling sick.” Many labs are advising desperate callers to seek help from other diagnostic facilities. A housewife, Kamna Singh, who recently tested positive for the infection along with her husband and daughter, said that it took almost 48 hours for their test reports to be declared. “I have got tested four times in the past and each time I got tested, the report came before the passage of 24 hours,” said the flustered woman. “This time we kept waiting for the reports for two days. And after that, it was so tough to get a hospital bed for my husband. His condition is bad and is deteriorating by the day.” Many labs did not attend TOI’s repeated calls. A sample collector in a private lab said he was relieved when cases started declining early this year. But his worst nightmare came true soon after. “People we visited earlier have saved our phone numbers and I keep getting calls,” he said. “I can see they are in not in good shape, but I cannot help them. They want to immediately book tests and have samples collected. I feel terrible when I have to refuse them because I cannot generate a registration number on my own. Only the lab can to enable samples go to the designated laboratories.” Tanushree Singh, a student, similarly complained, “I have been trying to book a home sample collection for myself and my family of six for two days, but I am unable to do so because all the labs I am trying to reach are either giving us slots a few days from now or not taking the calls altogether.” For affected families, securing a time slot from a laboratory is not the end of their problems. They report that a time slot is no guarantee of a collecting agent turning up at their house. Apparently, because labs are mandated to give the test results in 24 hours, some of them, knowing they cannot keep to this time frame, delay picking up samples or decline to entertain requests altogether. Some executives also said that a few labs had started running out of test kits and were left with no option but to delay the pick-up of samples or not respond to calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rush-results-in-long-wait-for-tests-results-delayed/articleshow/82091512.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

I and my wife used to go out to work and the woman and her husband would call her to their house. She told her mother that one day the woman and her husband locked her in a room with a man, who sexually assaulted her.” He added, “After this, the couple used to take her in their vehicle to different places, where different people sexually assaulted her.

Sharique and his wife, Oniba, were framed in a drug case and lodged in Qatar jail for 21 months. The couple was sent to India after the Qatar Supreme Court exonerated them of all charges. Sharique and Oniba, both 31, had tied the knot in April 2019. Though they had honeymooned in Bangkok, Sharique’s aunt Tabassum Qureshi gifted them a second honeymoon to Qatar in July. The couple was not keen since Oniba was pregnant. But Tabassum was insistent and made arrangements for their travel from Mumbai to Bengaluru and then to Qatar, besides a three-day stay there. “She told us to carry 16 pairs of clothes for each of us. I was surprised and asked her why we needed so much for a three-day trip, but she was adamant. She had even given us a bag in which we kept our belongings. One of her aides, Nizam Kara, came to Bengaluru airport and checked our bag too. When we landed at Qatar airport, we were detained and police recovered drugs concealed in the bag. We had no clue about it,” Sharique told TOI. The couple was arrested at Hammad International Airport in July 2019. Tabassum had told them she was sending ‘gutkha’ for an acquaintance there, but it turned out to be 4.1 kg hashish. The couple was sentenced to life imprisonment in November 2019 and fined Rs 1 crore. “It was a nightmare. Once you are trapped in a drugs case on foreign soil you cannot do anything. We are thankful to the government of India, especially officials of the Narcotics Control Bureau and all those who worked and prayed for our release,” says Oniba, who had also tested Covid positive in jail. Sharique said a day before Oniba’s delivery on February 26, 2020, he had filed an application before the Qatari authorities to be with his wife, but it was rejected. “Though we were in jail for long, we could meet only thrice,” he said. He says the most difficult time in Qatar was at the drugs enforcement authority’s lock up. “It was a very small room where two more inmates were kept along with me. It had an air-conditioner, but no ventilation. There was no washroom either, and we would have to shout for the guards for 10-15 minutes if we needed to go,” added Sharique. Sharique’s father camped in Qatar for 15 months and hired a lawyer to fight their case. Their families also approached the Mumbai police and Tabassum and Kara were arrested under the NDPS Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-couple-recounts-21-mth-ordeal-in-qatar-jail/articleshow/82091532.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Pune||Stop high-flow oxygen for Covid patients: Task force||Pune: The state Covid-19 task force has now advised doctors to use non-invasive ventilation, instead of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) cannula, as the latter method consumes more oxygen while treating patients with respiratory distress. The new advisory is a response to the increasing demand for liquid medical oxygen in the state. "Stop the use of HFNO machines until further notice. The HFNO machines use a very large quantity of oxygen, sometimes up to 80 litres per minute," Sanjay Oak, chief of the task force said in the advisory released on April 12. In Pune district, the daily requirement of liquid medical oxygen has touched 340 metric tonnes (MT). The district, currently, can supply 383 MT to hospitals, drawn from three plants in Pune and one 28-MT plant in Kolhapur. Demand then is fast reaching critical levels. Oxygen therapy for Covid comes in four forms: via regular oxygen masks, the HFNO, non-invasive ventilation and through invasive/mechanical ventilation. "The HFNO is excellent for seriously ill Covid patients. But many hospitals have already reduced its use as oxygen supply has gone haywire in Pune," said Mukund Penurkar, secretary of Associations of Physicians of India (API), Pune branch. Unlike non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilators that require a central oxygen system (piped gas by the patient's side), HFNO can be administered using oxygen cylinders. But small hospitals have stopped using it as the method is cumbersome and financially non-viable. "Ideally, HFNO also needs a central oxygen system. This is because we will have to change a jumbo cylinder quite frequently as HFNO takes 60 litres of oxygen per minute and a jumbo cylinder contains 1,000 litres of oxygen," said critical care expert Subhal Dixit, ICU director at Sanjeevan hospital. Very few critically ill patients actually need ventilators and among them, a tiny number can be treated using HFNO, instead of placing them on ventilators right away. "The HFNO is a beneficial method, but we need to regulate oxygen flow as per requirement. Sadly, this is not happening and there has been oxygen wastage," said Ruby Hall Clinic's chief intensivist, Kapil Zirpe. But HFNO plays a vital role when patients just cannot do with a regular oxygen mask. Approximately 20% of patients have reported hypoxia (breathlessness). The condition is usually cured via the mask. "But in some cases, oxygenation via a regular cannula (tube) is not enough to maintain blood oxygen levels. For such patients, the HFNO has proven to be beneficial. But the method has now taken a backseat," Zirpe said. Laxmikant Tapadia, a distributor of jumbo oxygen cylinders in Pune said, "Currently, my daily requirement is 100 jumbo cylinders. But I'm getting only up to 70 cylinders now. This has been the situation for more than a week. The worst hit are small and medium-sized hospitals."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stop-high-flow-oxygen-for-covid-patients-task-force/articleshow/82091520.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Nagpur||Provide RTPCR results to patients on WhatsApp: HC to labs||Nagpur: In a big respite to scores of Covid-19 patients, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Thursday directed the pathology laboratories conducting RTPCR tests to send results on WhatsApp and also hand them a hard copy. Currently, those submitting to tests, particularly at the government-run facilities, need to personally go there to get their RTPCR results the next day, risking themselves as well as others of infection.While hearing a civil application by Dr Mukesh Chandak through counsel Raheel Mirza, a division bench comprising justices Zaka Haq and Amit Borkar directed the laboratories to upload results of positive patients on Indian Council for Medical Research’s (ICMR) website within 24 hours. “The reports of the patients who test negative should also be uploaded on the ICMR portal in seven days. This arrangement shall continue until further orders,” the bench said.Dr Chandak's application was filed in a suo motu PIL (No4/2020) on bed shortage based on a TOI report where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed as amicus curiae and Nidhi Dayani his assistant. The intervenor pointed out difficulties faced by patients in getting the reports of RT-PCR test. According to Dr Chandak, the delay takes place because the laboratories procedurally have to upload them on the ICMR website, but many times the server slows down the process.While disposing of the application, the judges warned laboratories that if HC directives aren’t complied with, the authorities will be free to take appropriate action against them.Earlier, the lawyers for intervener, including M Anil Kumar and Tushar Mandlekar, suggested that reports of the patients, whether positive or negative, shall be immediately sent to them on WhatsApp and their hard copies should also be made available to them. As far as uploading reports on the ICMR portal is concerned, it should be done as the data is of utmost importance for the government and authorities to take appropriate decision and action in the matter, they said.BoxGovt agrees to set up oxygen plant in cityOn HC’s request to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to explore setting up an oxygen-producing plant in the city to tide over its crisis, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic time, the government informed that it had in-principally accepted the proposal. The submission in this regard was made by senior counsel MG Bhangde and additional government pleader Deepak Thakre. The duo, pleading on the government’s behalf, informed that there are proposals to set up such plants at many other places in Maharashtra and a meeting was convened by the chief secretary for the purpose. Bhangde also informed that commissioner of police was told to deploy the security around Covid-19 hospitals to prevent attacks on doctors and other staff by the relatives of patients, as per the HC’s directives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/provide-rtpcr-results-to-patients-on-whatsapp-hc-to-labs/articleshow/82090400.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Ahmedabad||Stop black marketing of oxygen: Court||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Thursday said there are hospitals involved in black marketing of oxygen due to the shortage caused by the surge in Covid-19 cases. The court asked the state government to make quick arrangements for supply of oxygen.The chief justice pointed out to a racket involving Covid hospitals and said such Covid hospitals do not admit patients who require oxygen, as their oxygen beds are occupied by patients who do not need it. On the pretext of full occupancy, hospitals turn down patients. “Those who actually need oxygen are not getting beds. This is a problem that needs to be checked. I fail to understand that even at this time, people are interested in making a fast buck. Now oxygen is being black-marketed. That is the information we have. We cannot make a statement, but hospitals are doing this because oxygen is provided to them on demand. This is how they are misusing it,” the CJ told the advocate general during the hearing.The court asked the government to verify this and stop it. “Oxygen is being siphoned off and patients who do not require it are put on those beds,” the CJ reiterated.The chief justice said he got this information from authentic sources. He said that he did not feel happy putting this information out in the public. The court asked the government to deal with the issue and resolve the crisis quickly.The state government told the court that oxygen demand has increased multifold and enumerated steps it has taken to secure enough oxygen supply, particularly in four districts with major cities. He also informed the court about the Centre’s scheme, in which hospitals can establish plants and become self-reliant. Two such plants have already started, and four others are in the pipeline and will be established by the end of this month, he said.The AG also said that if oxygen demand increases and goes past beyond production capacity, the state may procure it from outside. The high court asked the Centre to help the state government with oxygen supply, if it requires it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/stop-black-marketing-of-oxygen-court/articleshow/82090404.cms||---

There was a slight dip in the number of active cases, which stood at 4,438 on the day, as 643 patients were discharged from treatment centres. In tandem with the rise in positive cases, the number of containment zones in the city corporation limits has also gone up to 75 on the day, from 44 on Monday.While the district has recorded 65,406 Covid-19 cases so far, 60,263 patients have recovered till date. The recovery rate now stands at 92.1%.The Covid-19 toll, meanwhile, increased by two to 705. Among the deceased was a 45-year-old woman, who didn’t have any comorbidities. She was admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital n April 11 and died of Covid-19 bronchopneumonia 36 hours later. The other victim was an 80-year-old asthmatic, hypertensive man, who died after battling the virus for the past 14 days. It is to be noted that the district has recorded five Covid deaths in a span of 48 hours.The spike in daily cases has forced the city corporation to reintroduce triage centres. However, only two would be set up now, against five during the first wave. Dr S Raja, city health officer, said they had set up a triage centre at the ESI Hospital three days ago. “We are in the process of setting up another one in a wedding hall at Ramanathapuram. This will help save on manpower and make hospitalization process less cumbersome. People we screen in the triage centre could instantly be admitted to the ESI Hospital, if hospitalization is required.”Triage centres could also easily identify the positive cases that could be allowed to remain in home isolation. In fact, the number of people in home quarantine has shot up to 168 on Thursday, from 68 on Sunday. “We are more confident about allowing a patient to remain in home isolation after taking their chest x-ray and testing blood sugar levels and BP. If people want to home quarantine, they have to compulsorily come to triage centres after testing positive for the virus,” Dr Raja said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/civic-body-reintroduces-triage-centres-as-534-more-test-ve/articleshow/82091535.cms||---
---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots: No bail to man who pointed gun at cop||NEW DELHI: Questioning his conduct, Delhi High Court on Thursday dismissed the bail plea of Shahrukh Pathan, who had pointed a pistol at a policeman during the communal violence in northeast Delhi in February last year. The court said the gravity of the offence didn’t permit it to grant the relief. “The role attributed to the petitioner is not confined to participation in the mob of rioters but of heading the large crowd, holding a pistol in hand and releasing open fire shots. The video clipping and pictures played before this court have shaken the conscience of this court how petitioner could take law and order in his hands,” Justice Suresh Kait noted while dismissing the plea. Whether Pathan had any intention or not to kill the policeman or any person present in the public with his open air pistol shots, it is hard to believe that he had no knowledge that his act might harm anyone present at the spot, the court observed. “Keeping in mind the gravity of offence committed by the petitioner as also the facts of the present case, I am not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner,” Justice Kait said. Pathan (24), whose picture showing him pointing a pistol at unarmed Delhi Police head constable Deepak Dahiya during the communal riots had gone viral on social media, was arrested on March 3, 2020 from Uttar Pradesh’s Shamli district. Police booked him under Indian Penal Code and Arms Act. The court said the allegations levelled against Pathan were that during riots that occurred on February 24 last year on the road between Jaffrabad Metro station and Maujpur Chowk, he was party to the huge crowd that had unauthorisedly gathered and threw stones, petrol bombs and fired gun/pistol shots. The court also took a serious view of some contents mentioned in the petition. “Highly derogatory and serious allegations have been made against the Government of India, ministers and judge of this court, which is deprecated, and the Bar is suggested to not make such claims until and unless supported with factual and material evidence in a particular case,” it said. Pathan sought bail on the ground that the alleged incident had taken place on February 24, 2020 and the FIR was registered on February 26 last year, so there was 50 hours’ delay in lodging the case. He claimed he was being made a scapegoat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-to-man-who-pointed-gun-at-cop/articleshow/82091540.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||No lockdown, Haryana revises Covid guidelines||CHANDIGARH: To avoid spread of Covid-19 in public gatherings, the Haryana government on Thursday decided that not more than 200 people can gather in open spaces during public functions and not more than 50 in indoor functions. Similarly, not more than 20 people would be able to attend funerals. Directions have been issued in this regard to the deputy commissioners (DCs) to issue advisory in their respective districts to ensure that night-time ceremonies should be shifted to the day time and the Navratra programmes should also be held during the day. The state government, however, has hinted that it would not impose lockdown. “Last year, economic activity had stalled due to the lockdown, which took about six months to get back on track. Therefore, we have to keep in mind that the economic cycle should continue in the state and that no one is adversely affected either,” said Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Khattar has announced these fresh guidelines after presiding over a meeting called to review Covid-19 cases and vaccinations in the state. While deputy CM Dushyant Chautala was present in the meeting physically, home and health minister Anil Vij joined the meeting through videoconferencing. The CM said people should keep in mind as to what was unavoidable and what could be avoided. This time the spread of Covid-19 started from educational institutions, so there was a need to be more vigilant, Khattar said. Khattar claimed there was proper arrangement of oxygen, ventilators and beds in the state and there was no need to panic. It has also been directed that the district administration should plan at its level to deal with the situation and also make an appeal to the people regarding the same. The CM directed the officers that all the meetings should be held online or through webinars so that the movement of people could be reduced. CM asks farmers to end the stirThe CM appealed to the farmers that they should withdraw their movement on humanitarian grounds. If they had to protest for any of their demands, they could do it when the situation improved. Khattar said it was the constitutional right of every person to protest and they had no problem with those who protest, however, due to the pandemic life may be put in danger, so this was not the right time to protest. He also directed the DCs to contact the agitating farmers and try to persuade them. Beds in schools, dharamshalas, if needed: VijDuring the meeting, health minister Vij said there were two ways to prevent Covid-19 from spreading. The first method was lockdown and the second strictness, he added. “We want the situation to be dealt with strictness instead of imposing lockdown in the state. We can withstand resentment of people by acting strictly but cannot see people dying. This time Covid-19 is more aggressive. Last year, the number of cases increased gradually, but this time it is a matter of serious concern that about 5,500 cases are being reported in a single day. So we have to create containment and micro containment zones. He said that beds can also be installed in schools, dharamshalas if needed,” he added. Monitoring black marketing of RemdesivirExpressing possibility of black marketing of Remdesivir, Vij said for this, checking should be done by deploying drugs teams to catch them. He said people living in home isolation must be checked at least once in two days at home. For this, an app had been created.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-lockdown-haryana-revises-covid-guidelines/articleshow/82093625.cms||---

The deceased, identified as Khushi Gupta, could not be rescued while three other inmates of the house managed to escape unhurt. “Khushi, daughter of cloth merchant Ramesh Gupta, got trapped on the first floor of the two-storey building and was charred to death. Her body was recovered after the flames were doused,” said Kalinjar inspector Rajiv Yadav. Locals said they heard loud shrieks from the house of Gupta at around midnight. Sensing trouble, they rushed to the spot only to find Gupta’s cloth showroom and his first storey house engulfed in flames. They immediately alerted the fire department and police control room. Several fire tenders were pressed into service. The fire could be controlled after exercising hard till 9am on Thursday morning. Preliminary investigation by the fire department revealed that a short circuit in the shop triggered the fire. The police have started a probe into the matter. Ramesh Gupta, his wife Mohini, their daughter Khushi (14) and son Aryan (10) lived in the first storey of the house near a bus stand in Katik Chabutra locality. Ramesh, his wife and son managed to escape as soon as they noticed flames but Khushi was trapped.

---||Allahabad||Nishad Party to lay foundation for 180ft Nishadraj statue tomorrow||Lucknow: Nishad Party is set to showcase its strength on April 17 when it will lay the foundation stone for the 180-ft tall statue of Nishadraj, the king of Nishads, at Nishadraj Fort in Shringverpur, Prayagraj. According to workers, the party is determined to restore the lost glory of the Nishad king. Mythology has it that Nishadraj was the friend, host and confidante of Lord Ram. “Nishad Party is making people aware about the event. The first phase of panchayat elections are over and people are also free of agricultural work,” said founder-president of the party, Sanjay Nishad. “The event will be held as per plan on April 17 to mark the birth anniversary of Nishadraj. He was born on Chaitra Shukl Panchmi and was four days older than Lord Ram,” he said. Nishad Party has also planned a ‘bullet yatra’ (motorcycle rally) and a ‘padyatra’ to mark the occasion. The foundation laying for Nishadraj’s statue will also mark the start of party’s campaign for state assembly elections due next year. The party has been celebrating the birth anniversary of Nishadraj since 2013. To bring Nishad community under one roof, Rashtriya Nishad Ekta Parishad was formed in Gorakhpur in January 2013. Nishad (Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal) Party was registered in August 2016 and contested UP assembly elections for the first time in 2017. The party caters to non-Yadav OBCs and has a following among those who find themselves a misfit in politics centred around upper castes, SCs and Yadavs. That Nishads have emerged into a consolidated chunk of voters in UP is clear from the fact that every political party wants to win them over. In 2019 Lok Sabha elections, SP-BSP-RLD combine wanted Nishad Party as an ally but the deal could not be sealed and the party alligned with BJP. However, Nishads are now upset with the BJP government for not fulfilling its promise to accord SC status to the community. Installing the statue of Nishadraj, when the Yogi government has already proposed beautification of Nishadraj Fort, is party’s effort to come on its own. “Nishadraj Fort in Shringverpur is in a bad shape. Nishadraj gave his army to Lord Ram which helped him defeat demon king Ravana. Political parties have also been using Nishads as a ‘sena’. It is high time that the community withdrew its support from these political parties and become powerful on its own,” said Sanjay Nishad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/nishad-party-to-lay-foundation-for-180ft-nishadraj-statue-tomorrow/articleshow/82092667.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Kochi||Kerala: Pooram fans divided on holding fest in Covid times||THRISSUR: Though the government has officially given its clearance for conducting Thrissur Pooram complying with Covid protocols, there are serious doubts even among a section of the organisers about the practicality and relevance of holding the event amidst a surge in infections. A few sections of Pooram fans have launched social media campaigns highlighting the consequences of conducting the event amidst reports that the test positivity rate in the district has rose to 14.04%. Chief Secretary V P Joy said on Thursday Pooram can be held by complying with the laid down restrictions. As per the restrictions, only those who have Covid negative certificates or have been vaccinated can enter the Pooram ground. He said the organisers have informed the government that there is enough space in the Pooram ground to accommodate a large number of spectators, and that Covid protocols can hence be followed. “I don’t know how these conditions are going to be enforced. There are reports that only about 16,000 people will be allowed to enter the Pooram ground,’’ said Thiruvambady devaswom president professor P Chandrasekharan. Usually, about five lakh people turn up for the event, and some sections of the organisers fear not many will come this time amidst the pandemic. A drastic slide in visitors at Pooram exhibition will affect its economic viability also. “We have to keep in mind the impact of the event on the society. The test positivity rate may shoot up further. I had told the city police commissioner that I’m worried about the consequences of holding such an event amidst a surge in infections,’’ said Chandrasekharan. “The main rituals of the Pooram must be conducted as so much of preparations had already been made. We are ready to avoid the non-essential components,’’ he said. He said associated events like sample firework displays and Chamayakazcha (exhibition of elephant accoutrements) can be avoided.  Senior journalist C A Krishnan said Pooram organisers have expressed solidarity with the people by cancelling the event during periods of war and famine in the past. He said the event was dropped when there was communal tension in Thrissur in 1920. During the Quit India Movement in 1942 the organisers scaled down the festival. It was dropped in 1962 during the India-China War. Last year, only basic rituals were held. The organizers have a tradition of standing with the people during times of crises and they should do so now, Krishnan said in his Facebook post, drawing wide support. Meanwhile, the condition of minister V S Sunilkumar, who has been admitted to the Thrissur Medical College Hospital after testing positive for Covid-19, remains stable. Efforts are on to identify his contacts. Vaccine shortage has forced the closure of the two mega vaccination camps in Thrissur. The district reported 704 cases on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pooram-fans-divided-on-holding-fest-in-covid-times/articleshow/82090412.cms||T Ramavarman

---||Ahmedabad||Court raises ‘serious doubts’ on govt’s bed availability claims||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Thursday expressed doubts about the state government’s claims on availability of Covid beds at hospitals across the state, particularly when complaints about unavailability have poured in from all corners.While advocate general Kamal Trivedi informed the court about the number of Covid hospitals and 53% occupancy for the 71,021 beds across the state, Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia said the court has “serious doubts on this figure”, particularly the 47% vacancies and that too amid so much noise about beds not being available and patients not being admitted to hospitals. “How does this figure appear to be correct?” the CJ asked.When the government law officer explained how patients opt for certain hospitals, resulting in non-occupancy at others, judges said they are not concerned with Ahmedabad only, but with infrastructure and facilities available throughout the state. “Today, the situation in smaller districts is much worse,” the CJ said.The court was told later that the occupancy of beds was 53% on April 12 because those numbers included beds prepared at Covid care centres for asymptomatic patients, where people do not prefer to stay.The judges expressed concerns about isolation facilities for such asymptomatic persons and those living in small houses where relatives test positive. The judges asked what the government’s plan would be for a three-year-old child, whose mother tests positive and whose father is either out or quarantined. The government informed the court about isolation facilities being created in various districts.The chief justice said some institutions have come forward by converting their facilities into isolation centres. The HC also has, after consultation with all judges, decided to convert its judicial academy and auditorium buildings for such people “from our fraternity” who require isolation after their family members test positive. These facilities will be available to family members of the registry and lawyers can also be accommodated. The HC asked the state government to take care of food and medication for people isolated at these facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-raises-serious-doubts-on-govts-bed-availability-claims/articleshow/82090438.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Poor show by students shocks CBSE||KOCHI: Ever since the online classes for CBSE students in the state began last year during the pandemic, teachers and educationists have raised criticism about the effectiveness of the classes. That has been validated now as the students of Class X and XII are paying dearly with poor performance in the model exams, which were held offline recently. The teachers of CBSE schools said that the online classes and exams have led to a high deterioration in the standards of learning and it was visible when they wrote the exam in the offline mode for the first time in the academic year. Several students who have performed high in online exams, which were held in the previous months, have failed in the recently conducted offline model exams. Moreover, the number of students, especially Class XII students, scoring above 90% has reduced significantly, forcing even high performers to attend remedial sessions. Teachers are now taking extra efforts in the remedial classes to compensate for the loss of marks. The offline model exams, with three-hour duration, were held for the first time by most schools in the 2020-21 academic year over the last one month. Until then, online exams were held in which each having less than two hours of duration. Teachers said they were not sure about the credibility of the online test. Even though schools used advanced software to ensure that students write the exam without doing any malpractice, it was not foolproof. Moreover, about 40% marks of online exams consisted of internal assessment and oral test, making it easier to score high marks. “In the online exams, there were only around three students who scored less than 450 marks out of 500, which means majority of students scored above 90% marks. On the contrary, only three or four students scored more than 90% marks in the offline mode. Most schools face this issue and both teachers and students are shocked by the late realisation of the teaching and learning effectiveness,” said the principal of a leading school in Ernakulam. Also, unlike in the pre-Covid times, the failure rate has increased by at least 400% in many schools. “In our school, earlier only less than three out of the whole 150 Class XII students used to fail in one or more exams. It has shot up to around 30 now. Even those students who had never attended remedial classes earlier are now attending the sessions. Many parents too were hesitant to send kids to remedial session as if it was a shame. But after realizing the situation, they push the students to attend the remedial sessions now,” said a Class XII teacher. The issues are now being discussed at Sahodaya level. “With the exam having postponed again, more classes will have to be conducted. We hope students will have more serious approach toward the board exams,” said Juby Paul, general secretary of Kochi Metro Sahodaya and principal ToC-H Public School, Vytilla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/poor-show-by-students-shocks-cbse/articleshow/82090449.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

The ordeal began on Wednesday 7am when the couple tested corona positive and the judge continued dialling the hotline number till Thursday 10am after a prominent hospital insisted on online registration on the integrated command centre’s toll-free number before admission. And after he watched his wife sink and gasp to death at their Gomtinagar residence on Thursday morning, his heart-wrenching letter that has since gone viral captures the crumbling Covid care infrastructure in the state capital. A senior Supreme Court lawyer, Pradeep Rai, who managed to speak to the family of the 67-year-old retired judge narrated their ordeal to TOI. Rai, who’s vice-president of Supreme Court Bar Association, said, “The letter viral on social media is true. The judge told me when he contacted a hospital, the staff categorically told him to register online and admission was possible only after confirmation.” The letter reads — “There is no one to help us in cremation of the body, please help us….Since 7 am (Wednesday) I have made over 50 calls to numbers provided by district administration, but no help came in form of medicine or hospital admission. Due to negligence of the administration my wife (64) succumbed on Thursday at 10 am.” When TOI contacted district magistrate Abhishek Prakash, he did not respond. However, advocate Pradeep Rai confirmed that by evening, the judge’s wife was cremated with help of relatives. The retired judge is the brother of a sitting judge of Allahabad High Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/retd-judges-wife-gasps-to-death-after-covid-helpline-goes-cold/articleshow/82092690.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Deliberate inaction by Haryana in checking pollutant discharge in Yamuna, DJB tells SC||NEW DELHI: Facing a water crisis due to “deliberate inaction” by Haryana government in containing discharge of pollutants in the Yamuna, the Delhi Jal Board has told the Supreme Court that this has resulted in rise of ammonia level in water which could not be purified in its treatment plants and sought a direction to the neighbouring state to immediate take steps to curb the pollution. With Delhi and Haryana governments blaming each other for the drinking water problem in the national capital, the DJB said the neighbouring state was taking advantage of its geographical location as an upper riparian state in asserting “right to pollute the river”. “The state of Haryana has an abundance of available drinking water, with the per capita availability of drinking water being far higher than that of the NCT of Delhi. It is an upper riparian state that is serviced not just by the river Yamuna, but by various other rivers such as Markanda, Somb and Ghaggar. As a lower riparian state, the NCT of Delhi is dependent on the respondents to ensure the supply of clean and adequate water to the NCT of Delhi to meet the drinking water needs of its people,” the DJB said in its response filed in the apex court. The board said it was forced to approach the SC as the right to clean drinking water is a fundamental right and Delhi faced a severe water crisis in the summer season when the demand for water was at its peak. “The continued actions/inaction of the respondents have led to large-scale reduction of up to 30% in water supply in many areas supplied by the Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla water treatment plants, and has a direct and potentially devastating impact on the right of residents of the NCT of Delhi to clean and adequate drinking water. On April 4, the ammonia level in Yamuna at the point it enters the Wazirabad reservoir was 4.4 ppm, which is much higher than the ammonia level that the plants of the board can process for purification,” it said. "This has resulted in the Wazirabad water treatment plant functioning at 71% of its capacity, the Chandrawal plant at 84% of its capacity and the Okhla plant at 86%, causing largescale water shortage" the board said. Refuting the allegation that the board was using “outdated” water purification technology due to which water could not be purified, it said high ammonia content of the water flowing into Delhi made it virtually impossible to achieve effective disinfection by chlorination, with up to 68% of the chlorine reacting with ammonia and becoming unavailable for disinfection. "There is no largescale diversion of water by the board and the deficiency in the level of the Wazirabad reservoir is wholly attributable to lack of adequate water supply by the respondents. It is further submitted that the board/NCT of Delhi have over the years sought to make various innovations to ensure that the flow of water from Haryana to Delhi becomes more efficient, and there is less water lost on the way. These include commissioning of the Carrier Lined Channel in 2014 and the Twin Mains in 2015. These efforts on the part of the NCT of Delhi to make its water supply more efficient are continuously being used by the respondents as an excuse to not supply enough water to the NCT of Delhi," the DJB said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/deliberate-inaction-by-haryana-in-checking-pollutant-discharge-in-yamuna-djb-tells-sc/articleshow/82091592.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: No SSC & Inter 1st year exams; 2nd year papers postponed||HYDERABAD: Amid surging coronavirus cases in Telangana, authorities on Thursday cancelled the class 10 (SSC) exams and Intermediate first year examinations in state-run schools, while postponing the Intermediate second year exams. The decision comes a day after the CBSE cancelled the class 10 examinations and postponed class 12 exams. The Telangana government also decided to do away with the 25% weightage of Intermediate marks in the Eamcet this year. Officials also said they will review the situation and take a call on the Intermediate second year exams which was originally scheduled to begin on May 2. “A review will be held in the first week of June and future dates for examination will be announced with at least 15 days’ notice for the exams,” an official said. “Considering the present pandemic situation prevailing in the state and keeping in view of the CBSE notification, the government hereby cancels all class 10 exams to be held from May 17,” Chitra Ramachandran, special chief secretary (education), said in a release. This year 4.59 lakh Intermediate first year students and 4.73 lakh Intermediate second year students had paid the examination fee, while 5.2 lakh students had registered to appear for the Secondary School Leaving Certificate Examination (SSC). The government has decided to prepare the SSC results based on a criteria to be developed by the board later. “Any candidate who is not satisfied with the marks allotted will be given an opportunity to sit in an exam as and when the conditions are conducive,” an official said. The state has also decided to give minimum pass marks to all Intermediate second-year students, having backlogs in subjects. The Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education commissioner and secretary Syed Omer Jaleel said while first-year students will be promoted to next year without examinations, they will have to appear and clear exams at a later stage. “They will be awarded marks based on their performance in the examinations, which will be conducted as and when the situation becomes favourable. If they fail in those exams, students will have to appear for supplementary exams and clear them,” Jaleel told TOI. While parents and students are happy with the decision made by the state government, managements, especially those from the budget schools, are not very happy with the decision as they said that the state should have postponed SSC exams, instead of cancelling them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-ssc-inter-1st-yr-exams-2nd-year-papers-postponed/articleshow/82092698.cms||---

This, it was felt, would ensure patients are not denied medical treatment if they test positive while undergoing routine treatment. The DM also assured that action would be taken against sale of Covid medicines in the black market.“I told the IMA delegation from GB Nagar that just like they had helped the administration by treating Covid patients in their hospitals last year, similar steps should be taken by them again as the infection is spreading quickly now. The idea is to provide all patients with early and necessary treatment,” DM Suhas LY said.The DM further told the delegation that they should coordinate with the district health department and pitch in in whatever form they can. The help could be in the form of treating Covid patients in their hospitals till allotted beds in Covid hospitals, providing an expert team of doctors, medicines, medical equipment or ambulance facility, etc. “For this, due Covid protocols should be followed,” the DM said.Dr NK Sharma, president of IMA, GB Nagar, told TOI that while the delegation extended all support to the DM, they urged him to check on black marketing of critical medicines such as Remdesivir and oxygen cylinders by local operators. “Some chemists have resorted to black marketing of critical medicines during these tough times when serious patients are filling up hospitals,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/dm-meets-ima-over-treatment-in-pvt-hosps/articleshow/82092692.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

A sitting gram pradhan, Aasiya is the daughter-in-law of the family, whose members have had an uninterrupted victory run since their patriarch, Mohammad Ali, won the first pradhan’s election in 1952. Daringapur is a hamlet in Risauli Gauspur sub-division of Barabanki. This time too, Aasiya is confident of her re-election as gram pradhan. Talking to TOI, her husband and Barabanki zila panchayat member, Haji Mushtaq, 50, said, “My grandfather Haji Mohammad Ali was elected unopposed in the first gram pradhan election in 1952. And he remained village head till his death in 1965. The mantle was passed on to my father, Faqeer Baksh, who was elected and continued in the post till 1995. After the seat was reserved for women, my mother, Hajira Khatoon, was elected and she held sway till 2005. I hit the hustings when the seat became unreserved and was elected pradhan.” The first big challenge for the family came in 2010, when the Daringapur seat was reserved for Scheduled Castes. To retain control, the family put their munshi, Tilak Ram Rawat, a Dalit, in the fray. And Rawat too got elected. “In 2015, I fielded my wife, Aasiya Khatoon, for the post of pradhan and I contested for the post of zila panchayat member. We both won. This time too, my wife is contesting for the pradhan’s post and I am contesting for membership of zila panchayat from Risauli Gauspur of Barabanki,” said Haji Mushtaq.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/this-village-impregnable-fort-of-a-family-for-70-yrs/articleshow/82092699.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

After the first wave of the pandemic, most of the places in Idukki had emerged as popular destinations. Tourism stakeholders say that hotel bookings are being cancelled. "After the first Covid-19 outbreak, normalcy had returned, November onwards. The second wave has been a shock to us. We don't know how to manage the situation," said a resort owner in Munnar. The dip in footfall at the Eravikulam National Park explains the situation. "Only 460 people visited the park on Vishu day. The per day capacity of the park is 2,880 and after the initial wave, the numbers had reached almost 3,000 on some days," said range officer Job J Neriamparampil. District Tourism Promotion Council secretary-in-charge, Gireesh PS said: "The arrivals have dropped by over 50 percent in all centres within three days. After the first wave, arrivals had increased in Munnar, Vagamon, Ramakkalmedu, Aruvikuzhi, and Thekkady."

Advocate Chetan Pandya narrated his ordeal to find an empty bed at a hospital for a relative and submitted that the portal is updated only twice a day, and stale information is misleading for people desperately in search of medical care for ailing people.The chief justice asked the government to take the portal’s operation under its control. “You need to modify this system and it needs to be corrected. You cannot leave this to the association. Take control of it and it should be updated with all details on how many beds are available for general patients and how many for Covid patients,” the CJ said. The CJ insisted that bed vacancies be immediately updated on the website and not just twice a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-told-to-take-over-ahna-portal-update-it-more-frequently/articleshow/82090480.cms||---

According to an audit report of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, a trust constituted by the Centre for construction of the temple, the cheques bounced due to lack of funds in accounts of donors or a technical glitch. Talking to TOI, Trust member Dr Anil Mishra said, “Banks are trying to resolve the technical errors and we are asking devotees to donate again. Among the cheques, around 2,000 were collected from Ayodhya.” VHP had launched a countrywide crowd-funding drive between January 15 and February 17 and at least Rs 5,000 crore was collected. However, the final figures are yet to be declared by the trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/temple-donation-15k-cheques-valued-at-rs-22-crore-bounce/articleshow/82092705.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Lucknow||Allotted beds, but patients still struggle to get admitted||Lucknow: Even as distress calls by critical Covid patients desperate for a bed continued to deluge health and administrative officers, lack of coordination between designated hospitals and Integrated Covid Command Control Centre (ICCC) is compounding their miseries. Sample this: Confusion over bed allotment made several Covid patients wait for two to three hours at the gate of Balrampur Hospital on Thursday morning. These patients reached the hospital in ambulances allotted by the ICCC and were told that a bed has been allotted to them. However, when they reached the hospital, the staff were clueless. One of them was Mahanta Devi (70), a Gomtinagar resident. Her son Madhusudan Kushwaha told TOI, “After I informed the ICCC about the deteriorating condition of my mother on Wednesday night, it took the centre about nine hours to allot a bed in Balrampur hospital and send an ambulance. However, when we reached the hospital at 10am on Thursday, the staff refused to admit her, saying the Covid management portal is not showing that the bed has been allocated to my mother.” Kushwaha said, the hospital staff told him to talk to the ICCC. “I called the centre again to clear the confusion, but lines were engaged. I then again pleaded with the hospital to admit my mother. It took at least two-and-a-half-hours for the staff to consider my request and admit her.” Similarly, Rashmi Agarwal, a resident of Hazratganj, had to wait for two hours outside Balrampur hospital to get her 51-year-old husband admitted to the Covid facility. “Blood oxygen level of my husband was dropping and he had acute chest pain. ICCC sent an ambulance to shift him to the hospital 10 hours after I informed the centre. We reached the hospital, the staff said the portal has no update on bed allotment and refused to admit him.” When Rashmi’s request went unheard, she called her brother who works in the UP secretariat. “He called up senior officers who intervened to get my husband admitted to the hospital,” she said. Rashmi also informed that there were about 12 such patients, who waited along with them. When contacted, Dr V K Panday, nodal officer, Covid facility, Balrampur Hospital, said, there might be a delay in admitting patients due to a technical glitch in the integrated online portal of bed allotment. “We called a meeting to rectify the problem. It was decided that there will be no delay if a patient comes with a referral from the CMO office whether allotment shows in integrated online allotment portal or not,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/allotted-beds-but-patients-still-struggle-to-get-admitted/articleshow/82092739.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Parents happy, managements say SSC move hasty||HYDERABAD: Even as parents and students welcomed the decision by the state government to cancel SSC exams and postpone intermediate second-year examinations, private school managements said the decision has been taken in haste and termed the cancellation of SSC exams as unnecessary. Parents said that the state has taken the right decision as conducting exams amid the pandemic would have put the lives of lakhs of children and their family members at risk. “We welcome the decision taken by the chief minister in the prevailing situation. The current strain is spreading very fast and conducting exams would have made children super spreaders. It would have put elderly and those with comorbidities at home and in the neighbourhood at risk,” said V V Sharma of Indian Parents Association. They said the state should wait until the current Covid situation comes under control to conduct inter second-year examinations and announce plan to conduct these exams in advance. Telangana Parents Association and Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) also welcomed the decision. They, however, said the state should form a committee and come with a cope up mechanism so that learning loss is compensated in coming years. “We are happy as parents as we paid the fee and the child is getting promoted to next class. But what about learning loss? Last year, students had at least attended schools for entire year and prepared for exams, this time classes were conducted hardly for a month. The students learned nothing,” said Venkata Sainath, HSPA. The student organisations questioned why the state wants to conduct intermediate exams at a later stage when they are going to take weightage of inter marks in the EAMCET examination. “Why not pass intermediate second-year students based on first-year marks? Further, when the board is saying that they will conduct first year exams at a later stage, how are they expecting students to study both first and second-year syllabus in same year,” questioned Venkat Balamuri, NSUI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parents-happy-mgmts-say-ssc-move-hasty/articleshow/82091690.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Ahmedabad||Set up RT-PCR facilities in smaller centres: Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: Taking into account the uncertainity of how long Covid-19 pandemic is likely to last, the Gujarat high court on Thursday asked the state government to ramp up testing and create permanent RT-PCR testing and CT scan facilities in smaller districts in the coming days. The court has also sought a report on Covid testing that is going on at present across the state. The judges insisted that the government should promote entrepreneurs by extending loans to establish laboratories with RT-PCR testing facilities, which require nearly Rs 25 lakh to Rs 30 lakh. While thAMC’s drive-through testing initiative, the judges said that they were more concerned with testing facilities available for common man at the grassroot level. They asked the government if the common man’s five-day long wait for RT-PCR testing has been reduced. The government answered in the affirmative, but also submitted that the laboratories have been overwhelmed with the rush, and this also causes delay in declaring results. The judges also pointed out that the government affidavit did not talk much about testing facilities in smaller districts. The advocate general said that except Dangs, all districts have RT-PCR facility. Advocate Amit Panchal countered this and submitted that six districts – Dangs, Tapi, Narmada, Gir-Somnath, Mahisagar and Dwarka – do not have this facility. Justice Bhargav Karia of the division bench pointed out that a major district like Anand also did not have this facility, and people come to Ahmedabad for testing. The government said that there are two facilities in Anand district including one facility for TrueNat system. The chief justice insisted on having more CT scan facilities in small towns and districts and said that looking at the present condition when RT PCR tests too cannot detect Covid-19 cases, CT scan facility assumes greater importance and the facility along with MRI facility should be installed at smaller places. Advocate Anand Yagnik pointed out that number of testing facilities is abysmally low in remote places, particularly in tribal districts. He demanded that the district and taluka panchayats and all the municipalities should be equipped with the facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/set-up-rt-pcr-facilities-in-smaller-centres/articleshow/82090497.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: ULB polls on April 30 set stage for another TRS-BJP slugfest||HYDERABAD: The TRS and BJP are gearing up for yet another political battle as elections to Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (GWMC), Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) and five municipalities will be held on April 30. This will be eighth election in Telangana after the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 and fourth election after the BJP’s stunning victory in Dubbak assembly bypoll last year. The Telangana State Election Commission (SEC) on Thursday issued a notification to hold elections in two municipal corporations and Siddipet, Atchampet, Nakrekal, Jadcherla and Kothur municipalities. Counting of votes will be taken up on May 3. Elections will also be held for nine vacant seats in various municipalities, including Lingojiguda (ward 18) in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. State election commissioner C Partha Sarathi said nominations will be accepted between April 16 and 18, while candidates willing to withdraw can do so on April 22. Sarathi said the elections will be held under strict Covid-19 guidelines. Only five members will be allowed for door-to-door campaigning and public meetings should be conducted as per the guidelines of the government. Convoy vehicles should be split into two sets by maintaining a 10-metre gap, while roadshows will be allowed with one hour gap each. The SEC said polling stations will be sanitised a day before the election staff arrive there. “Social distancing, providing sanitisers and creating awareness among voters is mandatory,” he said. Meanwhile, the ruling party and the BJP have started preparations for the urban local bodies (ULB) elections, especially in Greater Warangal, which is the second biggest city in Telangana after Greater Hyderabad, and KMC. TRS working president KT Rama Rao and ministers from the two districts have already toured the towns and kicked off developmental works before the election notification was issued. Both BJP and Congress have also held preparatory meetings on the forthcoming polls. The TRS is banking on development agenda in the two major municipal corporations. The ruling party is on a high, having won the graduates MLC constituencies of Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda and Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar, which are spread over 70 assembly segments in the state. The BJP and Congress were relegated to third and fourth places in the March polls. While the TRS is confident of retaining the two municipal corporations and five municipalities, the BJP is hoping to repeat its performance of GHMC polls in the ULB polls. The party has some presence in some of the ULBs and wants to make an impact by winning them. In the previous elections, the BJP had won just one out of 58 divisions in GWMC and drawn a blank in Khammam. State BJP chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar, however, expressed confidence of wresting both the corporations this time round. “We had just three corporators in the GHMC in 2016, but our numbers have risen to 46 in 2020. Similarly, we will create history in Warangal and Khammam municipal corporations by securing the mayor seats,” Sanjay said. Party sources said the state leadership is keen on winning Siddipet municipality, which is the home district of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and finance minister T Harish Rao. It is likely to depute Dubbak MLA M Raghunandan Rao as incharge for Siddipet. The election is also going to be an acid test for Congress as it had won 10 seats in Khammam in the last election in alliance with the CPI, which had bagged two divisions. In the 2016 GWMC elections, Congress had bagged four out of 58 wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ulb-polls-on-apr-30-set-stage-for-another-trs-bjp-slugfest/articleshow/82092777.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Aurangabad||Police nab 1, recover 29 stolen two-wheelers in Hingoli dist||Aurangabad: The local crime branch of Hingoli district police has arrested a 26-year-old man who, along with two of his close relatives, allegedly stole 29 two-wheelers from different parts of the region. During the probe, police found that the suspects would pose as dealers of used two-wheelers. They would give false impression that the bikes were seized by banks for defaulting on loan instalments and they have purchased them through auctioning process. The key suspect has been identified as Sachin alias Raju Khillare of Gadad Gavhan village in Jintur of Parbhani district. The other two accused include his maternal uncle and latter’s son. Since Sachin landing into the trap of the police, the suspect duos have gone underground. Preliminary probe has revealed that these suspects are criminals on police record, but for past sometime, they have managed to remain off the radar. Police have also found that the suspects would travel to distance ranging from 50 to 300 km for stealing a bike. Hingoli superintendent of police Rakesh Kalasagar said, “The suspects not only stole two-wheelers from different adjoining districts, but also forged vehicle documents before selling them to gullible customers. The vehicles stolen from the districts like Parbhani, Hingoli, Washim, Buldhana, Akola and Nanded have been recovered from them. “On nabbing the other two suspects, we are hopeful of detecting some more vehicular theft offences,” said Kalasagar. Police said that as part of modus operandi, the suspects would travel to different districts in state transport buses and lift vehicles from urban as well as rural areas. The suspects were well aware of the fact that not all the vehicular theft cases are registered instantly and they have used this window period for taking the bike to their home town where they would change its registration plate number and also forge documents accordingly. People, who have ended up getting duped by these suspects, have now started coming forward. Police are recording their statements for making them witnesses in case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-nab-1-recover-29-stolen-two-wheelers-in-hingoli-dist/articleshow/82088993.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Meerut||Stray incidents of arson, clashes & booth capturing mark 1st phase of panchayat polls in west UP||Meerut/Agra/Bareilly: The first phase of panchayat elections were held in 18 districts of Uttar Pradesh on Thursday amid sporadic episodes of arson, clashes and loot of ballot boxes. Western UP’s three districts, which went to the polls in the first leg, were hit by the stray incidents of violence. In Saharanpur, two village pradhan contestants and their supporters fought a pitched battle in Jaroda Pada village early Thursday morning, leaving several injured. A car was damaged and another was set on fire by supporters of Naveen Tyagi and Rakesh Singh. Saharanpur’s superintendent of police (rural) Atul Sharma said, “Clash broke out between the two groups at 4am. Both the sides were trying hard to convince the voters. The injured have been sent to hospital and one person has been taken into custody. Peaceful polling was conducted in the village.” The district witnessed yet another tragic incident when three persons, including two women, returning after casting votes met with a tragic end when a speeding car hit them. 55-year-old Rekha Dhiman, Rukhmani Dhiman and Yashpal, 43, were killed in Sorana village. Four others were injured. While in Agra, police arrested 26 people, including two village pradhan candidates, after they allegedly looted two ballot boxes from a polling booth after a clash amid allegations of fake voting in Rihavali village. Talking to TOI, Agra’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Muniraj G, said, “They (the accused) will also be booked under NSA. The ballot boxes will also be recovered soon. Police force has been deployed in the area to avoid any untoward incident.” “During the clash, three persons including village pradhan candidates Malkhan Singh and Layak Singh were injured,” said SP (East) K Venkat Ashok. Agra’s district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said that sub-divisional magistrate and police personnel were present when the incident took place between the two groups. “We are sending a report to the election commission regarding the incident. Date for re-poll will be decided by them accordingly,” he said. Another ballot box was looted in Agra’s Chandsaura village as the polling was drawing to a close at 6pm. In Rampur, DM and SP rushed to Bilaspur area after allegation of bogus voting “to provide advantage to BJP-backed” candidates. Security has been tightened around the polling booths and all the voters were cross-checked, said a senior official. Situated on the border of UP and Uttarakhand, Bilaspur has a large Sikh population. In most of its villages, BJP-backed candidates were facing opposition. Two persons from this area have lost their lives during the protests against the farm laws. Block president Ravinder Kaur told TOI, “They had captured the booth and were casting fake votes. My husband Ujjawal Deedar Singh is contesting for BDC from here. We were not allowed to deploy an agent on the booth to keep an eye. I was also not allowed to stay at the booth. I have raised this issue with the election commission and senior police officers. I hope that they will cancel the elections at Ramnagar booth number 273.” But BJP minister and MLA from Bilaspur constituency, Baldev Singh Aulakh, told TOI, “Ujjawal Deedar Singh and his supporters had opened fire at few people campaigning for my brother. One of them sustained a pellet injury as well which is why an FIR was registered. They didn’t get any booth agent because their agent was from another village.” Violence was also reported after polling in Hathras’s Tharora village. Locals attacked Sehpau police station and pelted stones on police personnel. One policeman was thrashed. According to sources, several residents of the village turned violent after one person, who was allegedly picked up by the police, was allegedly beaten up by policemen. ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna said exact details were not immediately available and that he has sought information on it. “The situation was now under control. Additional police force has been deployed in the area to avoid any further escalation of violence,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/stray-incidents-of-arson-clashes-booth-capturing-mark-1st-phase-of-panchayat-polls-in-west-up/articleshow/82089702.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Lucknow||No Remdesivir in med stores, stocks dry up in pvt hosps||Lucknow: Even after the state authorities managed to get 25,000 injections of anti-viral drug Remdesivir from Gujarat on Wednesday evening, the city-based medicine market and private hospitals allegedly did not receive a single vial till Thursday evening. General secretary of Lucknow wholesale medicine market, Suresh Kumar, said: “We have not received the drug. The consignment which reached the city from Gujarat was for government-run hospitals. We have no idea as to when the vials for medicine market will be received.” Another dealer, Siddharth Pandey, who supplies medicine to military hospitals, said: “We can only wait for the consignment, nothing can be done.” According to the Lucknow unit of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), only 10-15% of available Remdesivir drugs is present with private hospitals engaged in Covid-19 treatment. “The stock of Remdesivir maintained by private hospitals will exhaust soon. The administration has been informed about the situation and we are waiting for a positive response,” said a senior doctor affiliated with IMA. Meanwhile, government authorities informed TOI that the stock of Remdesivir injection that arrived from Gujarat has been sent to two government hospitals. There is no stock left with CMO office storage units. However, there is no clear guidelines whether the drug is only used in government hospitals. “We provide Remdesivir injection on the basis of severity of the condition. It does not matter whether the requirement is in a government or a private unit,” said Dr RV Singh, in charge of storage unit at CMO office, Lucknow. By late evening, district magistrate Abhishek Prakash issued a written order to local drug controller Brijesh Kumar Yadav and Madhuri Singh to ensure that no medicine was sold at exorbitant rates. “The authority must coordinate with local medicine dealers and ensure all medicines are available in market for people,” the order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-remdesivir-in-med-stores-stocks-dry-up-in-pvt-hosps/articleshow/82092771.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Zydus’s Covid-19 vaccine to be for children too||AHMEDABAD: Cadila Healthcare (also known as Zydus Cadila), which plans to roll out its much-awaited ZyCoV-D vaccine in second half of May or in June, will also be administered to children if all goes as planned, said two company officials in the know of the matter. For the third generation DNA-based vaccine against Covid-19, Zydus has set up a production facility with capacity of 120-150 million doses. It has plans to double it soon after the launch given the worsening situation in the country, according to the officials. While there are no vaccines available in the country for children, Zydus Cadila is to start clinical trials for this age group too. In the US, Johnson and Johnson has carried out clinical trials on children of this age group, the results of which are awaited. Cadila Healthcare is presently carrying out Phase-3 clinical trials involving 28,000 participants, including children and adults, to test the efficacy of the vaccine in protecting against the SARS Cov2 virus. The trial is being carried out at 40 centres across the country. The company has got promising data in terms of safety and efficacy in the two earlier trials. The Phase 2 trial also involved participants in the age group of 12-18 years, said sources. The three-dose vaccine is likely to give the company some edge over competition, given the mutations in the virus. The plasmid DNA when introduced into the host cells would be translated into the viral protein and will elicit a strong immune response mediated by the cellular and humoral arms of the human immune system, which play a vital role in protection from disease as well as viral clearance. “The results of Phase-3 trials are expected sometime in mid-May after which Zydus Cadila plans to approach the Drugs Controller General of India for final approval to roll out,” said one of the two officials quoted earlier. A senior executive of the company when contacted declined to comment on the matter. Zydus has built a strong portfolio of drugs for the treatment of Covid-19. The company has recently submitted a proposal to DCGI for repurposing its hepatis drug Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b or PegiHep in hospitalized Covid-19 patients after it got promising results in Phase-3 clinical trials. Zydus Cadila has also launched the cheapest generic version of antiviral drug ‘remdesivir’ in India for treatment of Covid-19 patients. On Wednesday, Mansukh Mandaviya, minister of state for ports, shipping and waterways and chemicals and fertilizers said the government has given necessary approvals to take the monthly production capacity by seven manufacturers from 38.80 lakh vials per month to 80 lakh vials per month. The minister said that the manufacturers of remdesivir have agreed to reduce the prices to less than Rs 3,500 by the end of this week. An official of Zydus Cadila said the company is presently selling the vaccine at just Rs 899 per vial, and it will continue to sell at the same price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/zyduss-covid-19-vaccine-to-be-for-children-too/articleshow/82090539.cms||Maulik Pathak

Around 58,700 patients were discharged in April 8-14 period as against the addition of around 71,900 new cases. During the two previous weeks (April 1-7 and March 25-31), the recovery rate was 67%, while during March 18 to 24, around 49% patients were discharged in the region. Health experts said a majority of the patients were showing mild symptoms and recovering within 12-14 days of getting infected. “Early diagnosis and treatment is a crucial factor in recovery. We have been appealing to the citizens to avoid delay in getting treatment and not ignore the symptoms,” Sanjeev Wavre, assistant medical chief at PMC, said. Wavre said despite the rise in cases, the PMR’s overall recovery rate has stayed above 84%. On Wednesday, more patients recovered in the city than the new infections, he added. A health department official said the region’s overall recovery rate has improved since the last four days. “For almost one-and-a-half month, the region’s recovery rate was dropping. However, it started moved upward after April 11 and reached 84% on Wednesday evening, reporting the highest recovery rate of last seven days. On previous occasion, the recovery was over 84% on April 7,” the official said. An increase in recoveries also led to a drop in active cases in the region. On Wednesday, the region had 97,192 active patients as against 99,976 on Tuesday. According to the data released by the district health office, both Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations and rural areas have maintained more than 80% recovery rate so far. Pimpri Chinwhad has a recovery rate of 85.8%, followed by the rural areas (84.8%) and Pune municipal limits (83%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmrs-weekly-recovery-rate-rises-to-82-highest-since-mid-march/articleshow/82091704.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Hyderabad||Five held for woman’s murder at Hyderabad's Saidabad||HYDERABAD: Five persons have been arrested for their alleged role in the murder of Manjula Kanodia at Lokayukta Colony in Saidabad on April 12. They committed the murder after Manjula’s husband failed to return the money he had borrowed from them. Saidabad police arrested Mohammed Imran, 28, a petty businessman from Tappachabutra, Basheeruddin Qureshi, 25, a butcher from Karwan, Syed Arshad, 21, a sofa maker from Asifnagar, Syed Irfan, 22, a car driver from Jhirra, and Mirza Wasim Baig, 25, a salesman from Karwan. Manjula’s husband Parimal Kanodia used to run a medical shop in partnership with others. According to Saidabad police, Parimal had taken loans from many people and invested in the business. Imran’s mother Mehraj Begum, on the advice of her relative Khaiser, had invested Rs 11 lakh in Parimal’s business after he showed them two medical stores at Koti and Abids, saying that he had partnership in them, Saidabad inspector K Srinivas said. Mehraj withdrew money from a chit fund and also mortgaged gold to give money to Parimal and the latter gave post-dated cheques and promissory notes in the name of Khaiser and he also gave some blank cheques to Mehraj Begum as collateral. After borrowing the money in 2019, Parimal paid Rs 20,000 every month to Mehraj Begum for a few months. After the lockdown, he stopped payment, police said. Mehraj asked Manjula about the whereabouts of Parimal and the latter said she did not know. Mehraj’s son Imran suspected that Manjula knew about the whereabouts of her husband. On April 12, Imran along with his four friends went to Manjula’s flat and asked her to call Parimal. Manjula told them that she was unaware of Parimal’s whereabouts and even claimed that she divorced Parimal. As she started admonishing the five for coming to her house in the night, Imran pulled out a knife and stabbed her to death, the inspector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/5-held-for-womans-murder-at-saidabad/articleshow/82091713.cms||---
---||Meerut||BJP given district panchayat poll ticket to man booked for reciting Hanuman Chalisa in mosque||MEERUT: Five months ago, a lesser-known proponent of population control law Manu Pal Bansal, 42, was challaned with a Rs 5-lakh personal bond, which he had to pay if he “disturbed the peace” again. His crime: Reciting Hanuman Chalisa in a mosque located in his native village Vinaypur of Baghpat district. Today his happiness knows no bounds. BJP has given him party ticket for the district panchayat ward Pilana. With a garland of currency notes hanging around his neck and no mask whatsoever, Bansal is now seen with folded hands moving about the cluster of villages seeking votes. “The party has seen my good work and hence I am given a bigger responsibility to serve the masses,” he says. When asked if the reward was for his Hanuman Chalisa act in a mosque in November last year, he waves his hand in disagreement. “I wasn't asked to do it. I did it on my own will and without any objection from the other community as well. I had taken permission from the cleric in charge of the mosque before that. I do not understand where the controversy is in that act. I have been given a ticket because the party functionaries feel I can work intensively for the upliftment of our society. I have very good relations with members of the minority community also for they know that unlike others I will not shy away from participating in their good and bad times,” he says. Notably, Bansal’s act had not gone down well with the local minority community. After the incident, the mosque’s managing committee reportedly removed Ali Hasan, the Imam of the mosque. Bansal also feels that if he wins, it will give a boost to his endeavour for the demand of a population control bill. Bansal is the local representative of an outfit – Jansankhya Foundation. “Obviously, my endeavour will get a boost with the new position. I can strengthen the movement against population explosion,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bjp-given-district-panchayat-poll-ticket-to-man-booked-for-reciting-hanuman-chalisa-in-mosque/articleshow/82089711.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Lucknow||No bed in Lucknow hospitals, kin rush Covid patients to other districts||LUCKNOW: Even after trying for three days when family members of Sanju Srivastava (62), a resident of Jankipuram extension, could not get a bed in any of the Covid hospitals in Lucknow, they rushed her to a hospital in Etawah in a critical condition on Wednesday night. Despite all the effort, she died on Thursday afternoon. Like Sanju’s family, many in the city are now taking their Covid patients to hospitals in other districts after not getting bed in hospitals here. Recalling the trauma, Sanju’s told TOI: “She tested positive on Sunday and her condition started deteriorating from Monday. We took her to a private hospital, but it said that she needed to be admitted to a Covid facility. As her blood oxygen levels were gradually dropping, we made several distress calls to Integrated Covid Command Control Centre and senior officers but in vain,” he said. “Finally, on Wednesday morning, she was allotted a Covid hospital. But, when we called up the hospital, the staff told us that there was no vacancy. We again made a distress call to health officers, but they did not respond. Later, with the help of our family doctor, we rushed her to a hospital in Etawah, but she could not be saved, " he added. Similarly, Divyanshi Mallick, a resident of Aashiana, rushed her 52-year-old mother to a private hospital run by her relative in Faridabad, Haryana, when she did not get a bed in any of the Covid hospitals in Lucknow. “My mother got a Covid-19 positive report on April 12. As her condition was deteriorating, we called Integrated Covid Command Control Centres several times to get a referral for a bed in a Covid facility in the city, but numbers were constantly engaged. Then, we on our own went to five Covid hospitals, but all rejected admission on grounds that we don't have the referral from the health department," she told TOI. On the advice of the family doctor, Mallicks arranged four oxygen cylinders to support the patient. "Finally, our relative who is a doctor and owns a hospital in Faridabad asked to bring her there.

Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte confirmed the approval and said this is the first such nod for any state and the Maharashtra government has budgeted Rs 150 crore for expansion of the plant at the Parel facility. The approval has come on the basis of recommendations by the technical committee and Haffkine has been given one year to roll out the vaccines. “Initially, there were two options, one of fill-and-finish in which the bulk vaccine would be obtained from Bharat Biotech and would be packaged into vials at Haffkine. But this arrangement would not have added to the vaccine production capacity. So, we decided to seek transfer of technology so that we could manufacture the vaccine, which was the second option. Haffkine can manufacture 22.8 crore vaccines per year at the Parel facility,” Kunte told TOI. Besides the technology transfer, equipment will be made available by the Centre. Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical is one of the country’s oldest and premier biomedical research facilities and it has also manufactured vaccines for polio and snake bites. “We have been given one year’s time, but are hopeful that with the experience the facility has, we will be able to manufacture much before that,” said an official. He said it will help boost the production not only for the state, but also for the country. Thackeray had visited the Parel facility on March 20 where he had interacted with the management and asked them to send a detailed project report to the Centre seeking permission. An official said Maharashtra has sought a reservation of certain quantities of stocks for the state and the rest will be given to the Centre for distribution. The CM has directed a senior technical officer be appointed to oversee the project.

Now 33, he has left that life behind, come back to India for good and is contesting the panchayat election in UP. “I have decided to work for my village,” said Chaudhary, a BJP candidate for the district panchayat election from Ward 18, which goes to the polls on April 26. Chaudhary was just 19 when he left Meerut’s Kushedi village to study international business at the Erlangen Universität in Nuremberg. He went on to set up his own businesses and he moved to Frankfurt. While he was there, he established a philanthropic trust for his village. But two things made him realise he had to do more. “I had left when I was young. I had been sent to a gurukul in Kurukshetra, which didn’t encourage going home too often. Then, I was in Germany for 14 years. I had always longed to be home,” he said. “My parents are old. I need to take care of them. And after getting global exposure, I feel there is scope for a lot of change in India and, particularly, my region.” On those lines, one of his slogans goes, “Vikas kiya hai, vikas karenge; jan jan ka samman karenge (we have developed, we will do more, we will respect each individual).” Posters and air balloons dot the villages where he campaigns. His is a family of prosperous farmers deeply rooted in the region. His uncle is a former pradhan.  “My agenda is long-term. It is about imparting education and changing the mindset of people. Without that, there cannot be growth,” Chaudhary said. “I want to stay on in my region. Full-time politics requires a great amount of time and sacrifice. For now, I want to be home … I also want my four-year-old daughter to learn about the culture and traditions of our country.” His father, Mehkar Singh, is happy with his son’s trajectory. “Our country suffers a lot from brain drain. We need expats’ experience to build our nation,” he said. “I am proud that son thought of coming back from Europe to work for rural uplift.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/entrepreneur-returns-from-germany-to-contest-panchayat-polls-in-up/articleshow/82089707.cms||Sandeep Rai

While his family said on Thursday that it was murder, police, however, claimed that Manish Chaudhary alias Mintu Singh has killed himself. Chaudhary’s body was found on the driver’s seat of his car in Meerut’s Kankerkhera region on Thursday morning. A country-made pistol, a bottle of liquor and a glass were also lying by his side in the SUV, sources in police said. A BJP ward member of Meerut Municipal Corporation, Chaudhary had served a jail term for thrashing a sub-inspector in his restaurant three years ago. The policeman had come for lunch with a woman lawyer when an argument had broken out over the delay in serving the food. It was then that Chaudhary had allegedly attacked the policeman after a brief argument. The video of the incident was widely shared on social media platforms. Chaudhary was later booked and sent to jail. On Thursday, police claimed that Chaudhary shot himself dead after speaking to a relative over the phone. But the family was not convinced with the police version. Chaudhary’s brother-in-law, Kuldeep Dhama, has filed a police complaint alleging murder. “My brother-in-law had left home on Thursday evening. He had to settle some property deal and was carrying Rs 9lakh cash and some gold jewellery. He was fine and in good health. It seems someone has killed him,” Dhama said. Superintendent of police (city), Vineet Bhatnagar said, “Prima facie it is a case of suicide which can be corroborated by an audio clip which he had sent to a relative that points towards his desire to end his life. But we are probing the matter. Forensic teams have collected the samples and post-mortem examination has been conducted. Its report will make things clearer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bjp-councillor-who-had-hit-headlines-for-thrashing-cop-found-dead-in-car/articleshow/82089715.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: KGMU, Balrampur hospital made full Covid facility to curb beds crisis||LUCKNOW: In view of the exponential surge in cases in Lucknow, the state government has decided to convert KGMU and Balrampur Hospital into dedicated Covid-19 facilities.  The move is likely to increase the Covid bed strength in the city by 2,500-3,000. Efforts are on to increase the capacity of these units over the next two days. In the order, additional chief secretary health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad, said, “Following a decision taken in the high level meeting, KGMU and Balrampur Hospitals with their full bed strength will be acquired and converted into Covid hospitals with immediate effect. Non-Covid care in these hospitals will be stopped till the crisis situation eases out.” Soon after, the KGMU administration announced that all the non-Covid emergencies, except cardiology and obstetrics, will be diverted to other government hospitals. The order will be put into effect from April 19, said KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh. The move, however, has not gone down well with many including KGMU faculty and non-Covid patients and poses a big challenge to government hospitals. Already, KGMU – a multispecialty medical centre considered to be the lifeline of Lucknow and is preferred by patients, particularly economically weaker sections across the state - has suspended OPDs in many departments, except for those dealing with cancer treatment. Now, it will stop taking emergency patients through the Trauma Centre. This means, entire burden of the KGMU will fall on government hospitals. According to senior faculty members, KGMU has over 3,000 beds in all the 75 odd departments taken together. At present, about 700 patients in various departments are getting treatment. Further, the bed strength of the Trauma Centre is 162 with 10 operation theatres. It daily caters to 1,000 major and minor emergency cases related to medicine, surgery, orthopedic and neurosurgery among others. The cause of concern among people is mainly the management of emergency cases. There are 11 government district hospitals in the city including Balrampur Hospital, SPM Civil Hospital, Lokbandhu Hospital, RSM Hospital. “Of these 11 hospitals, three have already been converted into Covid hospitals. The rest altogether have around 160 beds in emergency wards. Three of them are for gynecology with 60 emergency beds and the other five have about 100 emergency beds. Most of them do not have specialized treatment expertise and infrastructure and refer complicated cases to KGMU,” said a senior KGMU faculty member.  The only option for multispecialty emergency treatment will now be available at RMLIMS which has around 50 emergency beds, he added.  “What will happen to the non-Covid patients particularly those needing tertiary care expertise and infrastructure?” asked Dr PK Gupta of the Indian Medical Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-balrampur-hospital-made-full-covid-facility-to-curb-beds-crisis/articleshow/82092784.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Covid-19 norms flouted as campaigning wraps up||Kolhapur: The heated campaign for the Pandharpur-Mangalwedha assembly bypoll ended on Thursday with flagrant violation of Covid-19 rules like wearing of face-masks, maintaining social distance and gathering of not more than 200 people. Solapur district collector Milind Shambharkar had recently issued orders stating that the prohibitory rules would not be applicable for the poll campaigning and allowed campaign rallies and meetings with not more than 200 attendees. However, in public meetings of leaders of both major parties, the attendance was in thousands. Recently, the district administration registered a case against the organisers of both NCP and BJP rallies due to violation of Covid norms. At the start of the campaign around 10 days ago, the contest looked easy for the NCP, which has fielded Bhagirath Bhalake, son of sitting MLA Bharat Bhalake. However, the BJP deployed top guns like leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and party’s state president Chandrakant Patil for the campaigning. While Fadnavis addressed six rallies in a day, Patil was seen on the ground till the last day of the campaigning. This is the first assembly byelection challenge for the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). On last day, Congress state president Nana Patole addressed a rally at Pandharpur while district guardian minister Dattatray Bharane held small meetings in Mangalwedha villages. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his address recently, had exempted the constituency from curfew orders. A total of 19 candidates are in the fray. The voting will be held on Saturday and counting on May 2. The MVA leaders made emotional appeals to citizens to vote for Bhalake while BJP leaders slammed the MVA government over the recent controversies related to the home department and handling of Covid-19 pandemic. The BJP also raked up local issues such as denying of dam water to Pandharpur-Mangalwedha section by MVA leaders and even they raked up MVA government’s repeated locking down of temples. The BJP has fielded Samadhan Autade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/covid-19-norms-flouted-as-campaigning-wraps-up/articleshow/82089008.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Covid shadow looms over small manufacturing units||COIMBATORE: At 9am every day, 36-year-old P Maniraj reaches his manufacturing unit that makes spare parts for paper cup-making machinery at Ganapathy in Coimbatore. His work day stretches beyond midnight, with just a couple of hours break in the afternoon and late evening. Back in January 2020, Maniraj had 12 people working in his unit, the fund flow was regular, raw material prices were stable and no one had heard of the dreaded pandemic that was to strike India a month later. "It looks like a different era now. I was planning to expand my business, canvassing clients, supervising workers and checking the quality of the products. Now, I have to operate the machines myself and cannot step out of the unit at all," he says. Maniraj says production has come down by 40% in the past year and his monthly business has come down from around `8 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.  Clientele has dwindled from 40 to 15 and the workforce from 12 to four. While five to six of his workers who had gone home for election, refused to return, another three guest workers returned home due to the prevailing Covid-19 uncertainties. Most of his revenue is spent on the building rent, interest for the loan and electricity bills. He invested Rs 70 lakh to procure machines and another Rs 10 lakh to Rs 12 lakh to procure raw materials. As banks were not supportive, he had borrowed about 90% of the invested money from a private finance company for an interest of 26%. It’s not just Maniraj. Rising raw material prices, dwindling production and a worried workforce have left many the small and micro industries, the engine that powers the manufacturing sector in the state, neck-deep in trouble.  Coimbatore has more than 50,000 MSMEs, each employing anywhere between 10 to 100 workers making pumps, wet grinders, spare parts for automobiles or pump sets. The district also has a large number of foundries that supply products across the country. With the number of Covid-19 cases rising sharply coupled with skyrocketing prices of raw material, small industrialists in Coimbatore are staring at a bleak future. Another industrialist P Prabhakaran said the money flow has almost dried up in the past few months. "It is because traders who had been selling raw material on credit basis now demand immediate payment and the payment for the finished products are delayed by at least three months," he said. He said there is a huge difference in price of raw material between the days when orders are finalised and when they are procured. "But our clients are ready to pay the revised price. Most of the time we end up manufacturing the products at a loss," he said. Due to the prevailing labour shortage, time taken to manufacture a product has increased at least by 50%, said M N Senthil Kumar who employs 16 workers and is in need of six more people. Senthil Kumar who supplies spare parts to machineries in bigger industries. C Siva Kumar, president of Coimbatore Tirupur Districts Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs Association (COTMA) feels they cannot bear the brunt of another lockdown and small industries have taken all precautionary measures to contain Covid.  "We have been following all the guidelines, especially wearing face masks, sanitising our hands and maintaining social distancing, without waiting for the officials to impose it on us," he said. The plight of guest workers was worse as they are in constant fear over another lockdown. Some of the guest workers have started to leave the city without wanting to wait till the last minute and suffer like the previous year. Codissia president Ramesh Babu said at least 10% of the workers have left Coimbatore in panic, along with the routine goers who take long leave and visit their native place once a year. J James, district president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises said, "many of the guest workers have started to seek permission to leave the city fearing another lockdown. We have assured them that all their expenses including food, accommodation and transportation, if at all a lockdown is imposed, will be taken care of. It is only after the promise that they decided to stay back."  Similarly, we have also been advising all the workers to vaccinate themselves and have been organising camps but it is helping only 20% of the workers who are aged above 45 years, he said. As price of raw material is another cause of concern, the MSMEs have made several representations to the state and Union governments urging them to form a price monitoring committee to control the rising prices. Industrialists say they are disappointed as the government remains insensitive to their situation. Earlier this week, as many as 19 industrial associations came together to discuss their next course of action to control the raw materials price rise. In the meeting, they decided to study the impact of the price rise on each sector and bring it to the notice of the public. They also decided to discuss it with their counterparts in other states to understand their situation and take up the issue at the national level.

The multiple murders took place at Juttada under Pendurthi police station limits in Visakhapatnam city on Thursday. Police said that the rape accused man (33) was the main target, but he and his eldest son are the only survivors now as they were not at home during the attack. The assailant (49) entered the house in the early hours of Thursday after he found out that the family — which had shifted to Vijayawada following the rape case —had returned to the locality after two years to attend a wedding. He hacked the victims one after another with a sickle. Bodies were found strewn at different places in the house with blood all around. Officials added that the assailant did not run away after committing the crime. He was arrested from the spot with the bloody sickle in his hand. The dead included the rape accused’s father (57), wife (30), son (2), daughter (6 months) and mother-in-law (53). A distant relative, who was present in the house, was also killed. Cops said that the rape accused, though married, had become close to the assailant’s daughter. In 2018, he had allegedly called the girl to his house and offered her a soft drink laced with a sedative. When she fell unconscious, he allegedly raped her several times. The man was arrested and was out on bail while on trial. Police officials also claimed that his wife has been accused of blackmailing the rape survivor for money by showing her semi-nude photos. His other relatives also resorted to blackmailing the girl. The police had registered a rape case after the girl’s brother noticed threatening WhatsApp messages on her phone and lodged a complaint. When the girl’s family questioned the man and his family, the latter allegedly threatened them with dire consequences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/father-hacks-6-of-family-over-girls-rape-in-vizag/articleshow/82092792.cms||Nalla.Babu

The startup bagged a prize money of $100,000. Sreedath Panat, a fourth year PhD student in mechanical engineering at MIT, is one of the co-founders of the student startup AgZen, along with fellow student Vishnu Jayaprakash, Maher Damak (co-inventor) and Kripa Varanasi (co-inventor and chairman), who is professor in mechanical engineering at MIT. Apart from the second prize, AgZen has also won a $300,000 Owl Investment Prize and other investment prizes bringing the grand total to $502,000. According to Panat, AgZen’s mission is to eliminate pesticide pollution and help farmers around the world save $20 billion per year. “Only two percent of sprayed pesticide reaches its target due to the inherent water repellency of plant surfaces. This inefficiency forces over-spraying of up to 50 times by farmers and results in the pollution of soil, water sources and the atmosphere. Pesticides have a market size of $60 billion globally and $5 billion in the US and contribute up to 30% of production cost for certain major crops,” he said. “AgZen, a pesticide alternative spray and formulation technology startup, has developed patented technology that uses proprietary food-safe additives which, when mixed with agrochemicals and sprayed through our proprietary sprayers greatly enhances retention of droplets to plant surfaces,” he said. “We have completely de-risked our product with over two years of field trials in the largest farms in the world and demonstrated that our spray and formulation technology can reduce pesticide usage by 50% on average,” Panat said. This year’s Rice Business Plan Competition had 440 teams from across the world of which 54 student-founded startups were shortlisted. Panat’s research focuses on sustainability in solar energy and agriculture. He graduated from IIT Madras in 2017. Panat is the son of Padmanabhan Namboodiri, retired regional editor, Kerala Kaumudi, and Lalitha, who works with Kerala Gramin Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/mit-student-startup-co-founded-by-koz-native-wins-502000/articleshow/82090577.cms||---

To aid fasting Muslims during Ramzan, helplines being run by both Shia and Sunni clerics have been active and flooded with queries regarding Ramzan as well as Covid-19. There are women centric helplines, too, where questions are being answered by women educated in Islamic laws. “Saving a life in Islam means saving all of humanity and if a person wishes to donate plasma after recovering from Covid-19 through the help of convalescent therapy, then he should do so. Donating plasma or blood will not break your fast,” said Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali who runs the helpline within the Islamic Centre of India. “For people suffering from diabetes and observing roza who are suggested to take insulin injection can do so before iftar,” he added on answering another query. Shia Ramzan helpline by the office of Iran’s senior cleric Ayatullah Al Uzma Shirazi, run by Maulana Saif Abbas as its representative, too has been receiving several queries. One prominent query that the callers have put forth is if a person is not able to keep the roza due to weakness or old age, then is he required to give ‘kaffara’ (religious donations made in Islam for a broken fast). The person was told that the religious donation is not required in that case. Similarly, a breastfeeding mother who is not observing roza is not required to give ‘kaffara’, but is required to five Fidyah (religious donation made in Islam on missing or breaking a roza).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cleric-rozedars-can-donate-plasma-blood-to-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82092797.cms||Aditi Singh

---||Chennai||Big-budget films keep TN box office in positive zone||Despite an increasing number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the second wave, more people are taking refuge in the world of films, according to footfalls at cinema halls across Tamil Nadu. But all eyes are for the big banners, stars and action that the big screen experience makes even better. A line up of big film content over the past few weeks has ensured steady collections at the box office, making both producers and theatre owners happy, while small-budget films remain more of an OTT hit.While a film like ‘Sultan was lucky to release on April 2, when theatres were permitted to let in audience up to 100% of a theatre capacity, the latest Tamil hit ‘Karnan’ could enjoy that opportunity for just the opening day, when it released on April 9. The state government introduced a fresh round of Covid restrictions on April 10 in an attempt to curb the alarming increase in Covid positive numbers in Tamil Nadu and theatres were limited to allow patrons only up to 50% of their capacity. Interestingly ‘Karnan’ made the same money in one week that ‘Sultan’ made in two weeks. For the small-budget films, success has been elusive. "It is not just about good content. It also has to be big. Unlike the Telugu film industry, where the audience loves the theatre experience and ensures small films with good content, such as ‘Uppena’, become big hits, the Tamil audience wants to venture to theatres now only for films big stars," said G Dhananjayan, vice-president, Tamil Nadu Active Film Producers Association (TNAFPA). His film ‘Kabadadaari’ was one among several small films that did not do well at the box office in the past five months. "I did a social media research. The Tamil audience are clear that small films are for small screen (OTT and television channels) and the big-budget films are for the big screen. They would venture out, despite the pandemic, only for those and are not willing to take that risk for small films. There is a paradigm shift in the way the audience now looks at a film. As a result even the business model in the way small films are produced need to be looked at," Dhananjayan said. For the big banners, the going has been good for the past three weeks, but the industry is anxious whether it can sustain this. "First ‘Sultan’ did well at the box office and now ‘Karnan’ is having a good run with youngsters thronging theatres. But family audience is yet to return to theatres like the pre-pandemic days. Despite that, the collections are decent and we can sail through if this sustains by lining up good films regularly in the coming weeks. But there is also a fear in the industry that more restrictions could be imposed like night curfew, which could do away with night shows or lockdown during weekends. We do not know. But if imposed, it could affect the industry," said S R Prabhu, who produced ‘Sultan’."During normal times too single screens across Tamil Nadu over the past five years have been reporting an occupancy of a mere 30%-35%. Hence the 50% capacity restriction has not really affected theatre collections. Film producers should understand this and line up their films for release without waiting for eternity. This will help the industry to safely tide over the Covid crisis," said leading distributor and exhibitor Tirupur K Subramanian. Multiplexes, which account for 70% of the theatre collections despite accounting for only 30% of the total number of screens across the state, are not complaining. If there is a sustained demand for tickets on weekdays, they operate an additional screen, since not all screens in a multiplex run all the four shows barring weekends. Weekdays normally only the evening shows do well. Hence, even for multiplexes, the average occupancy would work out around 30% only. "It was ‘Master’, which released for Pongal festival weekend, that brought people back to theatres and the film did well at the box office for almost a month, when it was released on OTT. The collections fell drastically after that, while theatres were starved of big content for almost another month. Then ‘Godzilla Vs Kong’ happened. While the English version did average business, the Tamil dubbed version had a great run for over two weeks," said K Meenakshi Sundaram, vice-president, Mayajaal, the 16-screen multiplex on East Coast Road.Are there enough big films to be lined up for release in the coming weeks? For April 23, ‘MGR Magan’, a medium-budget film starring actor Sasikumar has been confirmed. The month of May could see the release of actor Siva Karthikeyan’s ‘Doctor’ on May 13. Vijay Sethupathi’s ‘Yaadhum Oore, Yaavarum Kelir’ and Vijay Antony’s ‘Kodiyil Oruvan’ could also hit the theatres next month, but no official word is out yet on them. In the case of actor Ajit Kumar’s ‘Valimai’, there could just be an update, as has been the film’s trend off late. "No hero from any language is sitting at home. Everyone is out busy shooting. But not many are getting ready for the release, as many are waiting for a conducive time. For the present that looks likely to be year 2022," said an industry expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/big-budget-films-keep-tn-box-office-in-positive-zone/articleshow/82086773.cms||D Govardan
---||Lucknow||Tussle between faith & pandemic in Ayodhya||AYODHYA: In a tussle between faith and the pandemic, the Ayodhya administration which has so far ensured low-key Navratra celebrations in compliance with Covid protocols, faces a big challenge of stemming the inflow of seers from Haridwar kumbh to Ayodhya on Ram Navami day. As per tradition, seers from established akharas and monastic seats visit Ayodhya on Ram Navami, which falls on April 21 this year, to seek blessings of Ram Lalla. The pilgrim footfall is likely to soar on the last day of Navratra this year due to the onward journey of hundreds of devotees from Haridwar kumbh and the religious fervour over Ram temple construction. Talking to TOI, Acharya Yugal Kishore Sharan Shastri, mahant of Saryu Kunj temple, Ayodhya, said, “it will be a pious moment for seers and pilgrims returning from mahakumbh to pay obeisance at Ramjanmabhoomi. Many sadhus from Ayodhya who are attending the kumbh will also return on Ram Navami. So, we expect a big congregation on Ram Navami day.” After peaceful conduct of panchayat polls on Thursday, the Ayodhya administration is now hammering out a crowd-control strategy on Ram Navami, particularly inflow of seers from Haridwar kumbh. District magistrate A K Jha said, “No one will be allowed to enter Ayodhya on Ram Navami day without a negative RT-PCR report, not older than 48 hours. If needed, district borders will be sealed and the administration won’t allow any religious congregation.” Fears of a pandemic surge have been compounded by the spike in Covid cases among devotees and seers in the kumbh. According to Haridwar's chief medical officer S K Jha, at least 1,700 devotees in the Kumbh Mela area have been infected with the virus till April 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tussle-between-faith-pandemic-in-ayodhya/articleshow/82092804.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

Preliminary probe pointed to the eldest son, Deepak, who may have killed others before ending his own life and also setting flat on fire. The dead have been identified as Sunkari Bangaru Naidu (55), his wife Dr Sunkari Nirmala (50) and sons Deepak (21) and Kashyap (19). Naidu, who was working in Bahrain, returned to Visakhapatnam a few years ago. His wife was a homoeopath. The family was from Gantyada in Vizianagaram and stayed in Bahrain for 10 years before coming to Vizag. Police officials said there were stab and laceration wounds on the bodies of Naidu, Nirmala and Kashyap. Deepak’s body was found in a bathroom with no injury marks. He was found wearing a suit and tie. A senior officer told TOI they suspect that a family argument may have led to the tragedy. The elder son may have stabbed his parents and younger brother and either took his own life or was asphyxiated while trying to escape after setting the house on fire, suspect cops Police officials said neighbours had heard loud noises at 2 am on Thursday and two hours later they noticed smoke emanating from the flat. Fire tenders were called in. The fire personnel broke open the front door and entered the flat only to find the bodies lying in the hall and bedroom. The apartment has CCTV cameras at every strategic point and 24-hour security. CCTV footage revealed that no one from outside had entered the apartment on Wednesday night. The last person to enter the flat was Naidu at 8.56 pm. Police commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha said they are looking at different angles, including accident, suicide pact and homicide. A murder case has been registered at PM Palem police station. The bodies have been sent to King George Hospital for autopsy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-of-family-found-dead-at-home-flat-on-fire-in-ap/articleshow/82092806.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Kochi||HC: Can’t attribute contributory negligence||Kochi: Contributory negligence cannot be attributed to a pillion rider who is not wearing a helmet at the time of a traffic accident, the high court has held. The ruling by Justice PV Kunhikrishnan was while setting aside Tirur motor accident claims tribunal’s finding of contributory negligence by a pillion rider who was not wearing a helmet and then reducing the compensation amount due to the legal heirs of the deceased pillion rider for that reason. Petitions filed by National Insurance Co. Ltd and Kadeeja Musliyar and five other legal heirs of the pillion rider were considered by the high court. In the judgment, the court referred to a Supreme Court decision (Mohammed Siddique vs National Insurance Company Ltd) of last year in which violation of Section 128 of Motor Vehicles Act (having more than one pillion rider) was involved and contributory negligence was alleged. Through the decision, the apex court had said that violation of Section 128 by itself cannot lead to a finding of contributory negligence. The high court said in the judgment, “Section 129 deals with the wearing of protective headgear. When the Apex Court observed that if there is a violation of Section 128 of the Motor Vehicles Act, that alone is not a reason to conclude that there is contributory negligence, the same principle is applicable in a case in which there is a violation of Section 129... Simply because there is a violation of Section 129…, there is no presumption that there is contributory negligence...” In addition to violation of section 129, some additional evidence is necessary to attribute contributory negligence, the court said. The court also cautioned that the judgment should not be taken as a licence to ride without helmet and directed for strict implementation of Section 129.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-cant-attribute-contributory-negligence/articleshow/82090589.cms||---
---||Chennai||When the big boats stay in, smaller ones are out to play||On the first day of the 61-day annual fishing ban in the state on Thursday when all was quiet with the big mechanised boats anchored at the harbour, the sea was left to the smaller traditional and fibre boats to cast their net wide. At the Koyambedu harbour, the usual jostling with tonnes of fish from trawler boats was replaced by the occasional sounds of a lone small boat bringing in their catch of the day. Venturing a couple of kilometres into the sea with their nets, the smaller boats are considered to be more sustainable and do not come under the purview of the annual ban that is in place to allow fish to breed. While the small boat owners anticipate higher price for their catch in the absence of the supply from big-ger boats in the next two months, the larger fishing community has raised concerns about their loss of income over the past year. Deep sea fishermen of Tuticorin and Rameswaram said they remained off the sea for more than 135 days last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the cyclone alerts during the monsoon. Pointing out at the frequent weather alerts asking them not to go fishing during the northeast monsoon, they reiterated their demand of shifting the ban to November and December. Fishermen also said their livelihood has been affected due to the diesel price rise and urged the government to reduce it. And insisted an increase in the dole to `15,000 per fish-erman, against the existing `5,000 during the two-month ban.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/when-the-big-boats-stay-in-smaller-ones-are-out-to-play/articleshow/82091733.cms||---

It would help patients and their relatives finding beds in hospitals and expert doctors would advise them on the next course of action.The declaration came during inauguration of Covid-19 facility at National Cancer Institute (NCI), which would be offering 200 beds, including ICU to needy patients at its campus near Jamtha. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, NCI general secretary Shailesh Joglekar and medical director Anand Pathak shared the dais. MP Vikas Mahatme, MLA Praveen Datke, and mayor Dayashankar Tiwari graced the event.“My office along with that of Gadkari would work jointly with the centre to provide succour to needy patients. The pandemic situation in entire Vidarbha is really worrisome. But not all patients need hospitalisation,” Fadnavis said. He added that the current situation had led to panic among patients and all of them want to get admitted and also want injections like Remdesivir. It led to crowding of hospitals and shortage of crucial medicines.“At the counselling centre, such patients would be guided by expert doctors on whether they need hospitalisation,” he added.NCI, run by Abaji Thatte Services and Research Institute, would be offering 20 beds with ventilators and remaining 80 with oxygen. “Though it’s a dedicated cancer institute, it decided to start 200 beds within a week to help Covid patients. From Friday, it will start with 60 beds and soon plans to reach 200 within a week. As per the request of divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, NCI had also started HRCT scan and kept two machines for the purpose for Covid patients. With these 200 beds and 500 more proposed to be started by NMC and district administration, it would provide a big respite to needy patients,” he said.BoxDon’t know how long Covid will last: GadkariExpressing concern over the prevailing situation, Gadkari said no one can predict how long the Covid-19 pandemic would last. “It’s going to be bigger with the second, third and fourth wave, but we need to fight it. We’ve made oxygen available from Bhilai and its transportation would be done from Visakhapatnam. A medical devices park at Visakhapatnam run by the Government of India had devised a ventilator. If we get donations, we can get 1,000 such devices to city hospitals.”The minister added that even in case of Remdesivir, he had asked an expert from Wardha named Kshirsagar to apply for its manufacturing approval. “If approved, Vidarbha could become self-sufficient in Remdesivir manufacturing. I would also suggest NCI to have its own oxygen producing plant, which would be helpful to others as well. We’ve plans for such a plant at AIIMS soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-to-start-counselling-for-covid-patients-through-rss-ngo/articleshow/82091730.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Bihar's Covid tally crossed the 3 lakh mark on Thursday even as the death toll has reached 1,675. The number of active cases went up sharply by 22.5% to 29,079 from 23,725 on Wednesday. The positivity rate, too, rose sharply to 6.05%, which stood at 4.7% on Wednesday. Patna district, too, reported its highest single-day spike with 2,105 new cases on Thursday. The district tally has climbed up to 66,913, while 56,109 people have recovered, and as many as 10,318 are battling with the disease. As patients queued up, many private hospitals in Patna were forced to decline admission to critically ill Covid patients due to lack of oxygen supply. Some even had to discharge admitted patients. Pankaj Kumar Mehta administrator and nodal officer for Covid at the Medizone Hospital, Kankerbagh, said 90% of hospitals in Patna are facing an acute shortage of oxygen supply. Even as the hospitals struggled to cope with the spike in demand for oxygen, the state government swung into action by ordering oxygen manufacturing plants in the state capital to divert 90% of their supply from industrial units to hospitals to meet the shortage. As per Patna DM Chandrasekhar Singh, private hospitals of Patna are generating a demand of 10,000 oxygen cylinders per day while the plants can refill only around 7,000 cylinders. Meanwhile, the rise in Covid fatalities has choked the two PMC crematoriums in Patna. Seeing the huge rush, Patna municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma on Thursday said Covid victims would be cremated free of charge at the ghats managed by the civic body. The PMC charges Rs 300 for electric cremation and Rs 10,000 for wooden pyre cremation. On the case fatality rate (CFR), the state reported a 0.3% rise, which stood at 4.7% on Thursday. Patna recorded the maximum Covid deaths at seven, taking the overall district toll to 486, as per data provided by the health department.

---||Delhi||In two months, Delhi saw 35 days of ammonia spike in water supply||NEW DELHI: Along with battling the overwhelming fourth wave of Covid cases, the capital has also been facing water supply issues. Data from the quality control department of Delhi Jal Board shows that during the last two months alone, ammonia levels in the Yamuna were at 0.9 ppm or above for 35 days. DJB has a capacity to treat up to 0.9 ppm of ammonia levels in raw water, but beyond such high levels, neutralisation of ammonia with chlorine gas on a regular basis leads to creation of toxic and cancer-causing chloramine compounds. Data from Wazirabad pond shows that its water level remained below the standard 674.5 ft level for 25 days. A senior DJB official said that even a decrease of 0.1 ft in the pond affects the water uptake by the treatment plants. “The levels during February and March have even gone down to 670.7 ft, even as a Supreme Court ruling mandated the maintenance of a standard 674.5ft levels,” the official added. On Wedneday, Delhi had recorded pollution levels 8 times higher than the maximum limit, while the pond level was 3.2 feet lower than the normal level. Jal board officials argue that the pollutants, such as dyes, chlorides, and ammonia-based chemicals, come from Panipat industrial dye drain. “We can treat the other impurities, but ammonia treatment beyond 0.9 ppm is not feasible. DJB is planning to upgrade the water treatment plants by installing ozonation units, but even the modern plants can’t treat such high levels,” the official said. Delhi has been frequently facing supply disruptions due to rise in ammonia levels. TOI had earlier reported that the city has witnessed 20 multi-day long episodes of ammonia-related water supply disruptions in the last two years. DJB claims that the two main sources of ammonia are dyeing units in Panipat and intermixing of industrial waste in Sonipat where two canals carrying fresh water and industrial pollutants run parallel with a sand wall just a few inches wide separating them. “A breach in the wall and overspilling pollutes city water supply. We have asked Haryana to concretise the wall, but no progress has been witnessed after dispute over payment for its expenses,” an official said. While the capital needs to expedite the much delayed upgradation of its treatment plants, officials say interstate agencies like CPCB and Upper Yamuna River Board, too, need to crack down on polluting units in Panipat and push for reinforcement and concretisation of drains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-two-months-delhi-saw-35-days-of-ammonia-spike-in-water-supply/articleshow/82091801.cms||Paras Singh

Rosy picture shown by the government is far from reality,” a special division bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah observed. The bench, formed on the direction of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol, took up urgent virtual hearing which continued for two hours from 5.30pm. The court asked state government to buy portable x-ray machines and other medical equipment for Covid centres in districts so that people don’t have to rush to Patna. It also sought to know from the government about availability of pulmonologists at these centres. The government, however, replied that pulmonologists have not been deployed at the Covid care centres. The court also directed the state government to hold daily press briefing over Covid situation. It said the information about level of infection in a person should be mentioned in RT-PCR test reports. The court expressed concern over shortage of medical oxygen at the hospitals. An interlocutory petition (IA) highlighting print media reports, including several published in TOI, about patients running for oxygen was filed by the high court administration which had taken suo motu cognizance of the matter. A PIL was also filed by one Gaurav Kumar Singh, which was tagged with the IA. Health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit appeared before the bench virtually. Additional advocate general Anjani Kumar was also present despite being tested Covid positive. Centre’s additional solicitor general K N Singh submitted during the hearing that doctors have apprised him about short supply of medical oxygen in the state. To this, the health secretary said the state government has decided to bring oxygen from three states and a detailed reply regarding would be submitted at the next hearing. After petitioner’s advocate Sumeet Kumar Singh, referring to an article published in TOI, submitted that there is also short supply of Remdesivir drug, the bench directed him to go to the open market on Friday and try purchasing the drug. The court also asked the government to explain that beds of Medanta Hospital at Kankarbagh are not being used for Covid-19 patients. The health secretary said three rounds of meetings have already been held with the hospital authorities in this regard. The high court will next hear the matter on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-to-govt-boost-health-infra-in-districts-stop-showing-rosy-picture/articleshow/82089679.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The driver told court that passengers and he had objected to one of the accused who was performing stunts on the bike on a crowded Chembur road. Rupesh Shivgan, Sunil Lodh and Ajay More were found guilty for offences relating to assaulting or using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty, hurting a public servant during discharge of duty and wrongful restraint. Six witnesses, including the driver, Dilip Shinde, deposed. Shinde told court that on August 18, 2014, the roads were crowded as it was Dahi Handi. He said when the bus reached Chembur naka at 8.40pm, an accused was performing stunts in front of the bus. Shinde said he requested the rider to take the bike aside, but he did not pay heed. He said only after other passengers told him did he move but hurled abuses. Shinde said some others came there and started banging on the bus with their hands. He alleged that the accused followed the bus on the motorcycle, continuing to bang on the bus. Shinde said when he slowed down, they took the motorcycles in front, forcing the bus to stop. He said they entered from the front door, punched and kicked him. Shinde said police arrived and caught the accused. He said in the interim the conductor and passengers urged the accused to stop the assault. Among other witnesses were the conductor and a senior citizen, who was on his way home from Dadar TT. While he confirmed the incident he said he did not see the faces of those who assaulted the driver. The court relied on witnesses’ statements to convict the accused. It, however, acquitted the accused on charges of intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace. “At the most prosecution witness 2 (Shinde) stated that while on motorcycle the accused were abusing, but no words uttered by accused has been stated by ,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-bikers-get-a-yr-in-jail-for-attacking-best-bus-driver/articleshow/82091807.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Lucknow||Gross mishandling of Covid in UP: SP||Lucknow: Accusing the BJP of gross mismanagement in handling of Covid-19 crisis across the state, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday said people are suffering only due to the insensitivity of the state government. “People suffering from Covid-19 infection are in pain and their near and dear ones are feeling helpless in the absence of beds in hospitals, adequate testing facilities and sufficient number of ambulances and all this because of the growing insensitivity of the ruling BJP towards the sorrows of the people,” Akhilesh said. The former UP CM said it is perhaps for the first time that there are queues at cremation grounds, crematoriums and graveyards. “All the more shocking are reports that people are being charged extra money for the last rites of their near and dear ones,” he said, adding that there are complaints that Rs 1,500 is being charged from the family members of people who have died of Covid-19 infection and are being taken to Meerut’s Suraj Kund Shamshan Ghat. “My information is that similar complaints have been made at the highest levels about similar corrupt practices in Lucknow,” Akhilesh said. Attacking the Yogi government over spread of Covid-19 infection, Akhilesh said 5,433 people tested positive in Lucknow in a day which was a record and a total of 1,22,118 cases have been reported of which 1384 people have died. “This only explains the extent to which the infection has spread and the insufficient arrangements in place by the government to handle a pandemic of this magnitude,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gross-mishandling-of-covid-in-up-sp/articleshow/82092809.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Cancel all routine surgeries to save oxygen, says task force to govt||MUMBAI: The state task force has requested the government to cancel all elective surgeries and admissions in hospitals in a bid to save medical oxygen. Maharashtra health officials are estimating oxygen demand to touch 2,000 metric tonne by the end of the month, far outstripping the state’s daily production capacity of 1,250 MT. The task force came out with the recommendation following an April 12 meeting chaired by head Dr Sanjay Oak. “Cancel all routine surgeries and routine admissions to the hospital, this will save a significant amount of oxygen,” the task force has advised. It also said every hospital must form an oxygen audit committee that would be responsible for oxygen usage in the hospital. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the task force, said even routine surgeries such as hernia or knee replacement may require doctors to give oxygen to patients. “We may be able to conserve some volumes if these surgeries are temporarily put on hold,” he said. Elective surgeries appeared to have slowed down following the surge, as it is. KEM dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said many patients have themselves chosen to wait till the situation improves. In private hospitals, such as Holy Spirit in Andheri, the number of non-Covid beds has already shrunk to 60 while more than double of that number is allocated for Covid, said executive director Sneha Joseph. Palghar district collector has appealed to both hospitals and patients to delay non-Covid surgeries. Dr Manik Gursal issued instructions to hospitals in the district to discharge non-Covid patients who are on the road to recovery and reserve the beds for critical Covid patients. While elective surgeries can be pushed to a future date, emergency ones can go ahead as per schedule. Hospitals have been asked to ensure not more than one person is allowed with a non-Covid patient.  Vasai-Virar has been facing a severe shortage of oxygen cylinders. Ten Covid patients in two private hospitals in Nalasopara had died of alleged shortage of oxygen on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cancel-all-routine-surgeries-to-save-oxygen-says-task-force-to-govt/articleshow/82090603.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Ahmedabad||GCCI, HRA want nod to deliver food in curfew||Ahmedabad: With the night curfew from 8pm to 6am imposed in some 20 cities of Gujarat, restaurants have seen their earning plunge in the past month or so. To alleviate the situation and businesses survive, the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) on Thursday made a representation to the state government asking that food deliveries be allowed during curfew hours. A similar representation was also been made by the Hotels and Restaurants Association (HRA), Gujarat, to the Prime Minister’s Office. GCCI urged the government to permit deliveries till 10pm through online food delivery players or by restaurant staff with valid identity cards. HRA Gujarat representatives urged the government to allow food delivery till midnight. “This will help the industry to survive and no major government relief be required. Families of delivery workers who survive on a single income will also be able to sustain themselves,” the representation said. Gujarat has at least 35,000 hotels, restaurants, small food joints and cafes which provide employment to some 10 lakh persons. According to HRA Gujarat, the hospitality industry has been in a crisis for the past year and the majority of small entrepreneurs have been unable to survive such a long period, forcing many to close down their businesses. “This move will be a big relief to a number of migrants who live in Gujarat for employment or education, and are managing by ordering food from outside. Other beneficiaries will be Covid patients who are dependent on outside food,” the representation by GCCI said. According to restaurant industry players, 85% of revenues of restaurateurs come in the evenings but with the 8pm curfew, this is lost. “Order volumes have declined by at least 50% over the past month. This comes when the industry had barely started to recover in terms of revenues and order volumes,” said Dilip Thakkar, a member of the Food Entrepreneurs’ Alliance (FEA), Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gcci-hra-want-nod-to-deliver-food-in-curfew/articleshow/82090611.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

She also advised the government to take concrete steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus and asserted that it is ''futile'' to invest time and resources in ''hiding'' this tragedy. ''I want to make a request to the government of Uttar Pradesh. It is futile to invest time, resources and energy into hiding, suppressing this tragedy. Instead, the government must take concrete steps to stop the pandemic, save lives and prevent the spread of infection. This is the need of the hour,'' she said in a tweet which also contained a video of workers fixing tin sheets outside the Baikunta dham crematorium to prevent people from taking videos of the funeral pyres. A video of the scene at Lucknow’s biggest crematorium showing several pyres burning together in a long row went viral on social media on Wednesday. Priyanka had also convened a meeting of UP Congress leaders and workers on Wednesday and asked them to help distressed people in this time of crisis in every possible way. Meanwhile, UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu also condemned the government. “The so-called think tank of Team-11 has failed to save the loss of lives due to the pandemic which is spreading faster than they had anticipated. The government must take concrete steps to check the spread now or UP’s capital will become Wuhan,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/priyanka-flays-govt-on-covid-situation/articleshow/82092810.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Mumbai||Mumbai case count in 15 days of April 2.4 times the tally for September 2020||MUMBAI: On Thursday, when the state registered over 60,000 cases for the third time this month and the city reported fewer than 9,000 cases, the second Covid wave’s severity hit home -- the viral infection’s tally for the city in the first fortnight of April is 2.4 times the tally in September 2020, which was the first wave’s peak. While 57,755 cases were registered in Mumbai in September, the city has a tally of 1.38 lakh in April so far. In Maharashtra, the April 1-15 tally (8.2 lakh) is 1.4 times the September 2020 tally of 5.9 lakh. “The second wave is going to be >2x the first at least,” tweeted economist Shamika Ravi of Brookings Institute on Thursday. The total cases in the state touched 36.3 lakh. The state reported 349 fatalities, the second-highest daily toll for the second wave; the total deaths touched 59,153 on Thursday. “We have been saying from Day 1 that the second wave is more infectious than the first one. So it is not surprising that the numbers are higher,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. The cold comfort is that the death rate in Mumbai continues to be low. “While in absolute numbers, the deaths may seem to be climbing, the case fatality rate in Mumbai is less than 0.5,” added Dr Gomare. Mumbai’s total cases touched 5.5 lakh and with the city adding over 50 deaths for the second consecutive day, the total deaths reached 12,197. The only silver lining is the possibility that the second wave has already peaked in Mumbai. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government’s task force on Covid, said Mumbai was showing signs of plateauing. “Stability is coming about in numbers though we may see an increase in deaths as there is always a lag between the peaks in cases and deaths,” he said. The Covid timetable is of three weeks, said Dr Joshi. “One cannot presume one is okay within a week as one could deteriorate in the second week. We are seeing people, mainly younger people, coming in with cytokine storm in the second week of the infection,” he said. Meanwhile relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar warned of shutting down essential services like vegetable markets or local trains if people did not follow Covid restrictions laid down by the government. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the shortage of anti-viral injection Remdesivir and oxygen supply will be normalised in 4-5 days as production of injections will be augmented by companies soon and oxygen supply from other states will be done to Maharashtra. Meanwhile, Navi Mumbai had 1,036 fresh positive cases and six deaths, taking the Covid count to 81,939 and toll to 1,242. In Panvel, 532 new cases and one death were detected on Thursday, taking the total caseload there to 42,451 and toll to 711.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-case-count-in-15-days-of-apr-2-4-times-the-tally-for-sept-2020/articleshow/82091821.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Nambi Narayanan welcomes verdict||Thiruvananthapuram: Former ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan has welcomed the Supreme Court decision to have a CBI probe to unearth the conspiracy behind the ISRO espionage case. However, the police officers who investigated the case said they were not heard before finalizing the report by the Justice D K Jain committee. The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the CBI to look into Jain committee report on senior state police officials who allegedly framed Narayanan in the espionage case of 1994. While welcoming the decision, Narayanan said he has been strongly demanding this ever since the SC and national human rights commission had found that “it is a totally fabricate case.” However, he said not just the role of the state police but the role of central intelligence bureau also should be probed to unearth the conspiracy angle. “Those who were questioned in the case and all the police officials involved in the investigation should be brought under the CBI investigation,” he said. Narayanan said he will not single out any officer for the conspiracy. “Let the CBI probe it and submit its report before the Supreme Court. It is a fabricated case and there is high-level conspiracy involved. I was subjected to harassment for no fault of mine,” he added. However, the police officers who had probed the case, although welcomed the CBI probe, alleged that the Jain committee report has been made without hearing them. “The committee not even called me once to take my version. I have registered this protest to the court concerned,” said Sibi Mathews, who was the then DIG and head of the team which investigated the case. S Vijayan, the then circle inspector, said the committee did not do justice to them. “I was willing to depose before the committee and give all the details about the probe. However, the committee did not even call me once. Let the CBI conduct probe, I will provide all the details I have,” said S Vijayan, who was the first to report the case. Two other officers, K K Joshua, the then DSP, and R B Sreekumar, the then deputy director of IB in Kerala, are also involved in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nambi-narayanan-welcomes-verdict/articleshow/82090621.cms||---

Addressing the Association of Indian Universities’ 95th Annual Meet and National Seminar of Vice-Chancellors through video conferencing, the PM said, “Babasaheb Ambedkar gave a strong foundation to independent India so it could move forward while strengthening its democratic heritage.” The event was hosted by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Open University, Ahmedabad. The PM also launched four books related to Ambedkar, authored by Kishor Makwana.Talking about his philosophy, the PM said Dr Ambedkar considered knowledge, self-respect, and politeness as his three revered deities. “Self-respect comes with knowledge and makes a person aware of his or her rights. Through equal rights, social harmony emerges and the country progresses. Our education system and universities have the responsibility to carry the country forward,” Modi added. On National Education Policy, the PM said that every student has certain capabilities. “These capabilities pose three questions before the student and the teacher. First, what can they do? Second, what is their potential if they are taught properly? And,third, what do they want to do? The answer to the first question is the inner strength of the students. However, if institutional strength is added to that inner strength, their development will get expanded and they will do whatever they want to do,” he said. The PM said the new policy is aimed at fulfilling Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan’s vision of education that frees and empowers the student to participate in national development. “Education management should be undertaken keeping whole world as a unit, but also, focusing on Indian character of education,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/b-r-ambedkar-was-a-man-of-universal-vision-says-pm/articleshow/82084991.cms||---

The zoo was dedicated to people on March 27 by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Since then, it has been receiving an average 3,500 visitors every day. On weekends, the number goes up to 4,000 to 5,000. “It’s a new zoo and there is a curiosity in people. Carnivores are as popular as the snake house and aquarium,” said director H Rajamohan. Under the state government’s ODOP (One District One Product) scheme, there are shops inside the zoo to promote such products. “Two shops are functional that have Gorakhpur’s local products like terracotta. We are writing to district magistrates of other districts for other shops to exhibit more pf ODOP products,” said the director. One of the biggest attractions of the zoo is a 7D theatre. The Zoo administration will go for a e-tendering to find the bidder to run the theatre. By now, it has 154 animals, while it can house up to 387 animals. Rhino from Assam would come once elections in Assam are over. To get zebra, Lucknow zoo is coordinating with other zoos to get the animal under an exchange programme. It was after a long wait of over a decade that the Gorakhpur zoo got ready. It was approved in 2009-10 by the Mayawati government, but could see the light of the day in the Yogi government in 2021. Though it was one of the projects which the Yogi government immediately took up for revival after coming to power in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gorakhpur-zoo-big-hit-among-animal-lovers/articleshow/82092815.cms||Neha Shukla

Sachin Kothari, of the Jain International Trade Organization (JITO), Nagpur, said, “Our last year’s experience to offer free food and medicare services at the Pachpaoli quarantine centre has come in handy to help Covid patients this year. From April 11, we have started our services at the MLA Hostel.” “We are helping out Covid-hit Jain community members who have been mostly indoors due to their socio-economic status and religious abstinence. They prefer to confine in their small premises instead of moving into quarantine centres and turning silent victims. This way, they may be posing threat to other family members. Hence, we started a food facility for patients,” said Kothari. “When people learn they are Covid positive, they panic and feel helpless. Hence, the JITO help desk guides them first and offers counselling from doctors via teleconferencing, and suggests them to go to the quarantine centre where we provide free Jain food, snacks, milk, and oxygen cylinders if need felt. In the adverse condition, we also help them get beds. As beds were not available here we sent two patients to Amravati,” says Ujwal Pagariya, chairman of JITO. “The JITO is also offering free food to home quarantine patients where the entire family has turned Covid positive. Last year, we collected plasma via donation camp and those in need are also being given plasma,” says Kishor Chhajed. A group of young people, mostly chartered accountants, under the aegis of Agrasen Hostel and social worker Hiru Paliwal have started offering home delivery of tiffins for Rs 100 each to Covid patients in the city only. “Earning money is not our motto but people don’t value something that comes for free. We are group of chartered accountants and businessmen supplying food for a social cause. Our business establishments are closed and we are using services of our staff as delivery boys,” said Mukesh Agrawal, a chartered accountant. The service is being offered to senior citizens and people whose family members have turned Covid positive and getting food is an issue for them. tiffins are supplied based on advance bookings. “There are orders for around 300 meals daily but we don’t know how far we will be able to continue,” says Agrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-covid-cases-swell-ngos-gear-up-to-offer-services/articleshow/82091816.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Lucknow||MSME min seeks Central aid for small enterprises||Lucknow: MSME minister Sidharthnath Singh on Thursday held a virtual discussion with Union minister Nitin Gadkari on how to implement the Centre’s Micro and Small Enterprises Cluster Development or MSECDP scheme in UP. During the discussion, Singh informed Gadkari that the state required financial aid from the Centre for setting up a glass beads cluster in Varanasi. Similarly, he added, final clearance had to be given for a brassware utensils cluster and terracotta and pottery cluster in Gorakhpur. The UP minister said that there were other clusters which the state government can develop with assistance from the Centre. These include leather footwear in Saharanpur, wooden processing carving in Sambhal and Moradabad, sheet metal in Lakhimpur, Chikankari in Barabanki, handloom and processing and packaging of spice and grains in Jhansi, rice in Chandauli, leather goods in Meerut, jute rope yarn in Azamgarh, jute wall hanging in Ghazipur, zari zardosi in Badayun, mould design development plastic in Gautam Budh Nagar, metallurgical in Mathura and readymade garments in Kanpur. Singh said that a toy cluster has to be developed in Jhansi, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Chitrakoot and a DPR would be presented to the Centre at the earliest. “Industrial estates have to be set up in Prayagraj, Kanpur Dehat, Farukkhabad, Lucknow, Sitapur and Jaunpur. Other than this, flatted factories have to be set up in Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Aligarh and Gaziabad for which a DPR would be sent to the Centre soon,” Singh said. He also requested Gadkari to simplify the process of giving clearances under the MSECDP scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/msme-min-seeks-central-aid-for-small-enterprises/articleshow/82092819.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On Thursday, 8,126 new Covid cases and 20 deaths were reported in the state, taking the total number of active cases to 63,650 and deaths to 4,857. The test positivity rate is 13.34% now. "More testing, more vaccination and enforcement of protocols are what we are aiming at in the next two weeks," said chief secretary V P Joy, giving details of decisions taken at the meeting. The meeting decided to test 2.5 lakh people in the next two days. Both antigen and RT-PCR tests will be part of the augmented testing on April 16 and 17. The target audience will include, irrespective of symptoms, those aged below 45 who have come in contact with masses, those above 45 but not vaccinated, contacts of those tested positive for the virus, those who participated in the electioneering process, OPD and IP inmates of hospitals and those from containment zones and clusters. While ruling out a total lockdown, the meeting decided that all shops, restaurants, bars and cinema halls should close at 9pm. Only emergency services like medical shops will be allowed to function after that. "There is no plan for a total shutdown. By enforcing the Covid protocols and by self-maintaining the protocols, we can bring down the cases; we should take care for the next two weeks,’’ Joy said. Not more than 75 persons will be allowed at functions, meetings or marriages conducted in halls. A maximum of 150 persons will be allowed for outdoor functions. The limits were 100 for indoor function and 200 for outdoor earlier. All functions should be ended in two hours. There will be regular monitoring of public functions in the next two weeks. Prior permission should be taken for all functions while all religious heads have been asked to regulate the crowd at festivals and religious functions. The local bodies and the health department have been asked to strictly monitor the bus and railway stations, tuition centres and other public places to ensure that Covid protocols are followed. The district authorities have been allowed to impose more restrictions in containment zones if needed. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a Facebook post later that irrespective of the increased restrictions, transportation facilities would be made available for students to appear for examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-goes-into-overdrive-2-5l-tests-in-next-two-days/articleshow/82090656.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP BJP scales down mass contact drive||Lucknow: The sharp spike in Covid-19 cases has not only forced senior functionaries of UP BJP to remain confined to their homes and offices but has also compelled the party to scale down its grass roots campaign drastically for the ongoing panchayat elections. Sources said the party brass has asked the divisional and booth level functionaries to carry out mass contact programme with bare minimum workers. “The prevailing situation does not permit party workers to move out in large numbers and meet people…rajneeti apni jagah hai par suraksha bhi zaroori hai…(politics is important but safety is of prime importance),” said a senior BJP functionary confirming that door-to-door campaign may have to be suspended in districts with high caseload. UP BJP vice-president and in charge of panchayat elections, Vijay Bahadur Pathak said the party has cancelled all big campaigns in view of coronavirus surge. “Even door-to-door campaign has been scaled down significantly. Instead of 5-10 party workers, only 1-2 activists will meet voters as part of door-to-door campaign,” he told TOI on Thursday. While state BJP general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal has tested positive for coronavirus infection and quarantined in party office, state unit chief Swatantra Dev Singh is holding meetings with booth and divisional level functionaries through video conferences. Singh had earlier been carrying out exhaustive tour of districts to hold booth and ward level meetings. Pathak, however, maintained that the party would try to carry out campaign to make people aware about the preventive steps which need to be taken to keep the virus at bay. “We cannot provide masks and sanitizers to the needy because of the model code of conduct but we can surely make them aware about the preventive steps which need to be taken under prevailing situation,” he said. Another senior BJP leader said that during the first coronavirus wave, the party helped the people, including migrants who returned in large number following the lockdown. The party had then provided ration and other essential commodities to the needy. “It is again the time to look beyond politics and work for the people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-bjp-scales-down-mass-contact-drive/articleshow/82092832.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Jaipur||Govt imposes weekend curfew in Rajasthan from Friday 6pm to Monday 5am||JAIPUR: In a major decision to curb the second Covid-19 wave by ensuring low mobility, the state government on Thursday night announced a weekend curfew from Friday 6pm to Monday 5am. However, emergency services such as milk and LPG supply, banking services will be exempted. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot announced the decision to impose the weekend curfew at 11.30pm in a tweet. At recent meetings, Gehlot had spoken of taking stringent measures to control the Covid spike in the state. The curfew will not affect campaigning for bypolls in the three assembly seats of Sujangarh, Sahada and Rajsamand. In one of his tweets Gehlot said, “Those exempted from night curfew including milk supply, LPG and banking services won't be affected.” He also appealed to the public to cooperate and follow Covid appropriate behaviour.In the second wave, Covid has not only become more transmissible, it has started affecting the younger population more and is leading to severe illness than the earlier one. During the peak of the first wave in November last year, the 21-30 age group contributed only 18% of Covid cases in the city, but in April 1-9, the figure has risen to 23.6%. In March this year, the same age group accounted for 20.8% of all cases. Meanwhile, the percentage for the above-60 age group, which accounted for 20.3% of positive cases in November last year, has fallen to 14.6%. This shows the younger population has become more vulnerable in the new surge of pandemic. “A shift in critical patients towards the younger age group has been observed. The first wave was progressive but now the second wave is aggressive with steep rise in the number of infections. It is catching those in the age group of 20-40 years. Also, even those who do not have any comorbid condition are developing many complications,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College and head of state’s group of doctors for Covid treatment. Children under 10 have also been found to be infected in increasing numbers. In just nine days of April, 114 under-10 children tested positive in the city. Compared to this, for the whole of March, only 59 children in this group were diagnosed with Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-imposes-weekend-curfew-in-raj-from-fri-6pm-to-mon-5am/articleshow/82091874.cms||Ashish Mehta

According to statistics released by the state government on Thursday, as many as 2,24,106 people were engaged under MNREGS on April 1. This shot up to 9,51,583 by April 14, suggesting how the Centre’s scheme has come in handy in providing employment in the rural areas amid a surge in corona cases. A state government spokesperson said that the status of employment of people under MNREGS was a projection of state government’s effort to provide jobs to rural masses close to their home. He said that the scheme had proved to be boon to the scores of migrants who had returned in large numbers following the corona triggered lockdown. “The state government wants to arrest migration of people from rural to urban areas in search of jobs during the pandemic,” he said, adding that the work of water conservation through construction of ponds was being carried out on a large scale under MNREGS. Besides, the scheme is also engaging people in works related to construction of roads and drainage system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/over-7-lakh-get-jobs-under-mnregs-in-14-days-in-state/articleshow/82092846.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The BJP members’ lawyer, Jeet Gandhi, during the videoconferencing hearing before a vacation bench of Justices S C Gupte and Abhay Ahuja, said the meeting went against the October 2020 HC order. He complained that the duo received notice of the online meeting on Thursday itself giving no time to scan documents with regard to the 35 items on the agenda. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare representing BMC said the agenda was circulated on April 9 for the meeting originally scheduled to be held physically on Wednesday at 2pm, and again on April 12, when the timing was changed to 1pm. It was decided to conduct a virtual meeting only after the latest ‘Break the Chain’ SOP was issued on Wednesday as marriage hall assembly has also been reduced to 25 guests. Hence, he said, there was no violation of any rules. The bench asked the petitioners “why can’t voting (on agenda items) be done online, when courts are conducting hearings online”, but also observed that time has to be given for memb-ers to scan the documents before the meeting. The court asked Sakhare to take instructions from the BMC chief and standing panel head on why the meeting could not be rescheduled for Friday. Sakhare said they both agreed. Gandhi too agreed and HC disposed of the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-standing-panel-virtual-meet-today-after-2-bjp-netas-move-hc/articleshow/82091916.cms||Swati Deshpande

Rajnath Singh, who is MP from Lucknow, also spoke to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath twice, requesting him to provide space to defence authorities for raising makeshift hospitals. Lucknow is witnessing a surge in Covid cases and the city’s medical infrastructure is inadequate to face the medical crisis. Talking to TOI, Diwakar Tripathi, lok sabha representative of Rajnath Singh, confirmed that the defence minister has requested the CM to provide banquet halls and open space in the Indira Gandhi Pratishthan or the BBD Academy to teams of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for raising the medical infrastructure on its own cost and provide beds and oxygen to patients. Tripathi said that during the Defence Expo last year, the DRDO had signed an MOU with the UPEIDA to set up its own dedicated offices and infrastructure in Lucknow for the promotion of the state government’s defence corridor. “Since the DRDO already has a chain of command and military hospitals in and around the city as well as the expert medical manpower, it can immediately intervene provided the district administration gives it space for setting up makeshift hospitals. Rajnath Singh has been constantly in touch with doctors, BJP workers, officers and leaders of various unions, offering them the help they need. “On an average, Rajnath has been calling at least 50 people every day since the last week,” Tripathi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rajnath-offers-drdos-makeshift-hospitals-for-city/articleshow/82092850.cms||Subhash Mishra

This road stretch will be closed to traffic between 11pm and 6am. Vehicles, however, were allowed to ply from the RTO towards Jehangir hospital since August. Essential service providers, who need to travel during the night hours, will have to take the alternative route via Alankar bridge. They have to take a left turn towards Pune railway station, then right at Maldhakka Chowk and cross Shahir Amar Shaikh Chowk to go towards their destination. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic division) Rahul Shrirame stated that if required, the traffic can also be diverted from Mangaldas Chowk. In that case, the commuters can take a left turn at IB Chowk and then go towards their destination via Alankar Chowk, Pune railway station, Maldhakka Chowk and Shahir Amar Shaikh Chowk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-work-prompts-traffic-diversion/articleshow/82090746.cms||---

Preliminary investigation has found that the woman, Padma Gandam, was shaken after her husband, Shankar, died at a government hospital in Loha tehsil, about 296km from here, and ended her life along with the child. Superintendent of police Pramodkumar Shewale told TOI that the two bodies were taken out from the lake soon after receiving information from villagers. “We have registered a case of accidental death at the Loha police station and are conducting further investigations,” he said. Police said the couple hailed from Andhra Pradesh and were part of a group that had come to Nanded to work at construction sites. The couple has two daughters, aged five and seven, whom the woman left at home while they were sleeping while walking out with her son, Lalli. The family lived in a rented house near the Balaji temple in Loha town.

---||Goa||Curchorem council chief to face no-trust motion today||Margao: Balkrishna Hodarkar, chairperson of Curchorem Cacora Municipal Council (CCMC), will be facing the no-confidence motion moved against him by six councillors at a meeting scheduled for Friday, barely two weeks after he was elected to the post by a wafer-thin margin. The opposition panel needs to win over two more councillors to their side for the no-confidence motion to be passed. On Thursday, all opposition councillors, besides a couple of other “fence-sitting” ones, went incommunicado, thereby lending an element of suspense to the episode. Significantly, while all the signatories to the motion are known to owe allegiance to power minister Nilesh Cabral, the Curchorem MLA has claimed that 10 of the 15-member council are on his side. Two no-confidence motions moved against Hodarkar earlier had fizzled out after they were rejected by the director of municipal administration on procedural grounds. The first no-confidence motion against him was moved by 10 councillors on April 1 in a dramatic fashion, less than 30 minutes after he was declared elected. The director of municipal administration, Gurudas Pilarnekar, refused to consider the motion on technical grounds, and conveyed his decision to the councillors on April 5. Aggrieved over this, nine councillors moved another no-confidence motion against Hodarkar the next day, which was also rejected by the director of municipal administration on April 9, also on procedural grounds. The very same day, they moved yet another no-confidence motion, this time, however, signed by six councillors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/curchorem-council-chief-to-face-no-trust-motion-today/articleshow/82091937.cms||---

In a letter to the Lucknow district magistrate, Pathak urged to use the money for setting up make-shift hospitals and arranging oxygen gas cylinders for Covid patients. In his letter, the second this week, the minister said, “The community centres, Kalyan Mandaps built by government for marriages and other celebrations and the state guest houses be converted into make-shift L1, L2 and L3 hospitals and adequate availability of the oxygen cylinders should be ensured round the clock.” He also asked the DM to set up centres for RTPCR testing, arranging oximeters and providing medicines to home isolation patients through telemedicine. In his first letter on Monday to senior health officials, the minister had expressed his anguish over the acute shortage of medical facilities in the district. He had said that he was flooded with requests of patients and attendants but could not help them as the health facilities in the city are already overstretched. After criticizing officials for being insensitive towards the people suffering from the vagaries of the pandemic in his previous letter, Pathak this time has offered to assist the district administration in augmenting health facilities for Covid patients with his MLA development funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-law-min-donates-rs-1cr-for-enhancing-health-facilities/articleshow/82092862.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Hospitals warn of discharging patients if oxygen, drugs run out||NAGPUR: Facing acute shortage of medical oxygen and every day challenges in getting crucial drugs, private hospitals raised an alarm on Thursday, informing relatives of Covid patients that they won’t be able to guarantee treatment if stocks are exhausted. Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) convener Dr Anup Marar said the intention behind alerting relatives, through consent forms in some cases, is to ensure relatives don’t turn violent or vent their ire on the hospital. On March 26, a couple of hospitals had discharged Covid patients while some had told relatives to shift patients after they ran out of oxygen. The district administration had intervened to ensure oxygen and Remdesivir supply continue. Yet, the same problem took a serious turn on Thursday with some hospitals stopping admissions amid bed crisis. KRIMS Hospital director Dr Ashok Arbat said they have run out of Remdesivir and oxygen for admitted patients. “On Friday, we may not have any option but to ask relatives to shift their patients. There is no support from the administration in arranging the crucial life saving drug and gas,” he said. Kunal Hospital director Dr Shishir Shrivastav said there is acute shortage of essential drugs like Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, ad Itolizumab. “Other essential drugs like low molecular weight heparin, methyl prednisolone, favipiravir and doxycycline are also getting difficult to procure. Also, there is a constant fear in our minds regarding oxygen supply,” he said. Dr Shrivastav added, “We hope no catastrophic event takes place on our premises. If the situation does not come under control soon, then it may become difficult for private set ups to continue amid severe shortages and charged emotions of public.” “Why is public taking out its frustration about lack of beds, oxygen, remdesivir and tocilizumab on private hospitals? How can hospitals be held responsible? People should contact NMC and district collector control rooms for these issues. If violence continues, many private hospitals will close down their Covid admissions as they are unnecessarily facing flak,” Dr Marar said. Amit Somani, director of Kingsway Hospitals, said so far they haven’t asked any patient’s relative for consent form but admitted that they have started facing problems in maintaining Covid patients. “We have highlighted all this at different levels in the government and local administration. They are making efforts but results are yet to be seen. We have an acute shortage of remdesivir, which is very serious as we have 250 patients admitted and our per day consumption is 180 to 200 vials. We are also 50% dependent on industrial oxygen supply as our own O2 plant is facing problems since Thursday evening. Oxygen has become a serious issue because of more O2 beds being set up everywhere, which is the need of the hour,” he said, adding the government needs to ensure supply of remdesivir and oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hospitals-warn-of-discharging-patients-if-oxygen-drugs-run-out/articleshow/82091932.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

With rising Covid cases, Mumbai airport on Thursday announced that all flight operations will be moved to its T2 terminal in Sahar from April 21. Currently, domestic flights are operated out of two terminals of Mumbai airport, T2 and T1 in Vile Parle. When domestic flights restarted after lockdown on May 25 last year, all flight operations at Mumbai airport (domestic and international) operated out of T2. From March 10, IndiGo, AirAsia, GoAir, TruJet and Star Air moved most domestic flights to T1. But with rising Covid cases and government restrictions, the airport decided to go back to last year’s practice. “All passengers of GoAir, Star Air, Air Asia, TruJet and IndiGo are requested to get in touch with their airlines for further queries,” Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) said. “During challenging times, Mumbai airport has been working closely with stakeholders and regulatory and government bodies to curb spread of the virus. The airport is strictly adhering to guidelines laid down by ministry of civil aviation and government of Maharashtra,” MIAL added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-from-april-21-all-domestic-flights-from-t2-yet-again/articleshow/82091943.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Psychological Covid’ is a new ailment afflicting the healthy||Nagpur: On hearing the news that his office colleague is Covid-19 positive and seeking a bed to get himself admitted, Vilin Patil started feeling a bit warm. Soon, he had soreness in the throat and he felt he couldn’t breathe properly. “Fortunately, my wife, who is a health worker, had a pulse oxymeter and thermometer. When we checked, my body temperature and SPO2 level both were absolutely normal,” Patil said. Nowadays, there are many like him who are experiencing ‘psychological Covid-19’. Many factors trigger this condition. Near and dear ones getting infected, ambulance sirens heard throughout the day and night, rules and regulations changing every other day and social media overflowing with the Covid-19 related negative news are some of them. Due to this, many of those who haven’t get infected yet, start feeling some symptoms of Covid-19 psychologically. “I have been counselling such patients who don’t have Covid-19 but still feel they have it,” said Dr Nikhil Pande, a psychiatrist. “Earlier, those in the 50+ age group were showing such conditions. But, now, even 18-year-olds are getting psychologically hit,” Dr Pande added. According to Dr Pande, the symptoms like body feeling ‘warm’ inside and having infection in throat etc are so common that one can easily feel Covid-infected after thinking of it for a while. “Such patients run to centres where testing is free. I know some who have tested themselves many times and are still negative,” he added. “One feels such symptoms immediately after getting the news of some friend infected or even simply after hearing an ambulance on the road,” said psychiatrist Dr Akshay Sarode, who is also the district mental health programme officer. “We must stick to basics like using masks and sanitizers, and maintaining Covid distance. The second wave is more intense and we are finding patients in almost every household. So, people may feel that they are next,” Dr Sarode added. Psychologists said that many have developed illness anxiety about Covid-19. Deserted streets, no normal life, more ambulances than other vehicles on road, people wearing white PPEs in hearse vans, police vans making announcements about distancing, restrictions and NMC’s system announcements about Covid-19 in major squares in city are also creating a psychological impact on people. Bombarding of Covid-19 related negative news especially in the social media, deaths, serious illnesses, hospitalization bills-related stories are also affecting the mental health of people. Dr Sarode suggested that physical movements and various form of exercise helps release chemicals like endorphins which keep one happy. “Staying at home but maintaining physical activity adds into your physical as well as mental fitness,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/psychological-covid-is-a-new-ailment-afflicting-the-healthy/articleshow/82090754.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

In a high level meeting of the empowered group of secretaries on medical supplies for Covid-19, the availability of essential medical equipment and oxygen during the pandemic was reviewed. The current oxygen stocks of the country including the industrial oxygen stocks with the manufacturing plants are more than 50,000 metric tonnes.

The government maintains there is sufficient production capacity of around 7,127 MTs for oxygen in the country, and as per need, the surplus oxygen available with the steel plants is also being utilised. The country has a daily production capacity of 7,127 MT of oxygen per day. Against this, the total production has been 100% since past two days. On April 12, the medical oxygen consumption in the country was 3,842 MTs, that is 54% of the daily production capacity.

The Centre initiated mapping of 12 high burden states with highest caseload of active Covid-19 cases to oxygen sources. These states are Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. “Sources of medical oxygen and their production capacity was mapped to match the requirement of states and an indicative framework has been developed to guide the states on the sources of medical oxygen,” an official statement said. The Centre is also working to expedite completion of 162 oxygen manufacturing plants at hospitals that have been sanctioned under PM-Cares. Besides, the Empowered Group directed health ministry to identify another 100 hospitals in far flung locations for consideration of sanction for installation of such plants. With the surge in Covid-19 cases in the second wave exceeding the previous peak, the share of serious cases under hospitalisation has also increased significantly as compared to the situation earlier in mid-August when cases were rising rapidly. Currently, around 4.5% of active cases are estimated on oxygen support, whereas 2.31% are in ICU and 0.46% cases are on ventilator. In mid-August 2020, when the cases were rising, 2.43% of active cases were on oxygen support whereas only 1.77% cases were in ICU and 0.25% were on ventilator. The Centre has asked the states to make rational use of medical oxygen and ensure there is no wastage of oxygen. Besides, the Centre has instructed the states to set up control rooms to ensure smooth supply of oxygen to the districts as per need, review requirement of cylinders and tankers.

The directive comes two days after TOI reported that despite state government directives that no hospital, Covid or non-Covid in government and private sector will refuse treatment to Covid patients, a number of facilities are reportedly denying treatment even in emergency cases. “A case will be registered against any hospital which turns down patients. It will be based on the recommendations of the district magistrate and the chief medical officer concerned. The medical education department has issued orders in this regard to all the commissioners, DMs and CMOs in the state,” a government spokesperson said. Principal secretary (medical education) Alok Kumar said protecting lives of the people was the priority of the government and no negligence on the part of hospital administrations would be tolerated. Assuring people that there was no shortage of ventilators, bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) machines in government hospitals and medical colleges, the government spokesperson said it had already been purchased in adequate quantity.He said there were more than 5,000 ventilators, 1,600 HFNC and 1,000 BIPAP machines in medical colleges and hospitals in addition to those in private hospitals. The government is also ready to purchase more if required, he added.On the availability of oxygen, the spokesperson said several oxygen plants had been set up in medical colleges and hospitals. “Oxygen plants are also being set up in government medical colleges in Saharanpur, Ambedkarnagar, Azamgarh and Banda, and at autonomous state medical colleges in Firozabad, Ayodhya, Basti and Bahraich.

---||Hyderabad||Rampant Remdesivir use triggers shortage in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: A massive increase in demand for Remdesivir due to indiscriminate use of the drug has led to a shortage, said health officials. As a result, health authorities have now asked doctors to prescribe it only for moderate cases of Covid-19. “While people are thinking of Remdesivir as a game chancer, it is not true. The drug should be used rationally and only in moderate cases of Covid-19. It should not be used in asymptomatic cases, in mild or very severe cases also. It is still an under-trial drug,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, Telangana. Doctors have been prescribing the drug in cases with all levels of severity and this indiscriminate use has led to an acute shortage of the drug. Many patients who actually need it are often left in the lurch, with families knocking on all doors to get it. “I was asked to get a remdesivir injection and after scouting for it everywhere, I got one from a distributor through reference. However, it is four times the original cost now. The hospital just wrote a prescription and asked us to get it,” said a patient’s attender, who bought the injection earlier this week. Officials say the drug is known to cut hospital stay in moderate cases as well as reduce the viral load in such cases. “We have been receiving less than 50% of the order that is placed usually for nearly two weeks now. Patients are forced to buy the drug for themselves. We are just handing them a prescription,” said a representative from a mid-sized hospital in the city. The shortage of the drug has also led to a surge in price from less than Rs 1,000 to Rs 4,000 now. However, there is no shortage of the drug in government facilities currently. “We are asking doctors not to prescribe the drug indiscriminately and use it only for moderate cases,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rampant-remdesivir-use-triggers-shortage-in-city/articleshow/82090767.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pre-arrest bail for man accused of killing wife||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday granted interim anticipatory bail to a man from Navi Mumbai and his kin accused of cruelty and murder of his wife last May on a personal bond of Rs 25,000. The court directed that the complainant be made a party to the case. An FIR was registered at CBD Belapur police station in January. This month, a Thane sessions court rejected their plea for pre-arrest bail, said their counsel Aniket Nikam and advocate Ashish Satpute. Nikam argued that the case appeared to be a counter blast as “every” criminal offence was invoked, including murder, culpable homicide not amounting to murder and dowry death in the same FIR. The man said he was not in touch with his wife since 2017 and the FIR discloses no case against him and his sister. Arguing for relief before Justice P D Naik via video-conference, citing extreme urgency, Nikam said the accused are real brother-sister and FIR was filed on a “false” private complaint by the sister’s husband. Nikam said the man had, after his wife’s death, urged the police seeking a probe against his brother in law for her death. The HC adjourned the hearing to April 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pre-arrest-bail-for-man-accused-of-killing-wife/articleshow/82091964.cms||---
---||Delhi||Districts achieve over 100% target for contact tracing||New Delhi: Amid a rapid increase in coronavirus transmission, all 11 districts are going beyond the fixed target to carry out contact tracing of Covid positive cases. The percentage of contact tracing is at an all-time high and no district is lagging in the exercise. Some of the districts have reported over 100% target achievement. It is also one of the reasons behind the steep rise in the number of total tests being conducted in Delhi daily. According to an official district-wise data sheet on contact tracing for April 13, the average contact tracing among all districts was 31.3 while the target is 30. Since the movement of individuals is comparatively less restricted now as compared to the months of previous year, when the country was either in full lockdown or in partial lockdown, a positive individual is likely to have met more and more people before realising that they are infected with the coronavirus. When a person is found positive, the local health workers get the details of his close contacts, including those at workplace, his home and the places he regularly visited. The field health officials like ASHA workers and others then get into action to screen and test them. “In some cases, the number of contacts traced is even greater than 40. It depends on the movement of the individuals and his contacts. But all contacts are traced and tested,” said a health department official who did not want to be identified. East district leads all districts in contact tracing with 36 contacts traced for each Covid positive person. North East district is second with 33.5 contacts traced, followed by Shahdara (32.1), North (31.1) and South West district (31). Central district, New Delhi, North West, South and South East and West districts have traced 30 or more contacts for each Covid-positive person. The contact tracing is an essential public health tool used to stop the transmission provided it is done timely and all the contacts are effectively screened. The idea behind rigorous contact tracing is to alert the people who might have come in contact with someone infected with Covid-19, and to check the further spread of the virus. “Through contact tracing, many people come into the notice of the health authorities and are kept under monitoring. Those who test positive are immediately provided necessary healthcare services. Without effective contact tracing, these people will end up transmitting the coronavirus to more people. Early detection of the coronavirus is essential for fast recovery of patients,” said an official. In different Covid review meetings, stress has been laid on maintaining the current level of contact tracing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/districts-achieve-over-100-target-for-contact-tracing/articleshow/82108893.cms||AlokKNMishra

As beds fall short, the 108 call centre is now telling the patients’ relatives to first ensure there is a confirmed bed in the hospital they want to reach. If not, the centre provides the number of NMC helpline or other officials for them to reach out. Only if patient or the relatives confirms a bed is available, the ambulance is sent. The system has been put in place following instructions form local administration in view of shortage of hospital beds, said sources. Dr Krishnakumar Uikey, operational head of 108 service for Vidarbha, said the centre has responded to over 14,800 calls from Covid patients in Nagpur district, since the first case was reported last year. In March there were 37 calls a day and in April it has been 49 per day so far. With 11 vehicles deployed in the city and 40 in rural areas, vehicles can still reach the patient in 20 minutes within city limits. Considering the turnaround time, 11 vehicles are enough to meet the current demand, he said “If a patient does not call back with available bed, the centre also makes a follow up call to ascertain the situation,” said Uikey. He said there was no shortage of oxygen in the 108 ambulances. There are over 200 ambulances in entire Vidarbha. Another 300 vehicles are run by private operators. They said not only the vehicles are falling short, there was severe dearth of oxygen too. For most Covid patients, oxygen facility has to be there in the ambulance. Ravikant Kanekar, the president of Nagpur Ambulance Association, said these days he was in a position to respond to only half of calls received. Other ambulance operators also told of similar situation. The private ambulances are allied with private hospitals. “The patients normally get operators’ number from the hospitals. However, a number of patients prefer to go to the government hospitals. There it takes anywhere between two and four hours to get a response,” said Kanekar. Most of the time, entire oxygen gets used up during the wait. A refill can only happen the next day due to shortage. Till then no other Covid patient can be taken, he said. Kanekar said the prices of oxygen have also gone up. Its Rs 1,000/- for a large cylinder as against Rs 700 earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/108-ambulance-now-sent-only-if-you-have-confirmed-hospital-bed/articleshow/82090776.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Lucknow||UP: Death toll crosses 100; 22,439 new Covid cases in 24 hours||LUCKNOW: With over 1.49 lakh new cases added over the past two weeks, UP’s Covid-19 tally crossed the 7.6 lakh mark on Thursday. As many as 22,439 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours and as many as 104 persons died because of complications caused by the pandemic infection in the same duration. Official bulletin on Covid-19 indicates that the situation has changed drastically in the past 15 days. Consider this: On March 31, the Covid-19 tally for UP stood at 6,17,194. The consistent surge over the past 15 days added 1,49,166 new cases in the state taking the tally 7,66,460 till now. The number of active infections has in fact spiralled – from 9,848 on March 31 to 1,29,848 on April 15. The increase is 13-fold or 1218% in absolute terms. Likewise, the deaths have also gone up tremendously – 8,811 on March 31 to 9,480 on April 15. This means that 669 lives were lost in a matter of 15 days besides translating into 44 deaths every day. Experts and health officials have pointed out that the virus in action in the state at the moment appears to be very contagious. “Unlike last year, one positive case is transmitting the infection to more than 2-3 persons and entire families are getting infected. Earlier, families getting affected were not as common as it is now. Though we are not getting enough time to study data, then the pattern is at least 60-70% more common,” said a senior member of the state surveillance team. Data speaks for the trend. Consider the case positivity rate (CPR) for UP. “State’s cumulative CPR till March 31 was 1.77% but that for the first 10 days of April was 4.4%. It increased to 5.34% on Thursday,” said Dr Vishwajeet Kumar, social scientist and epidemiologist. It may be noted that CPR refers to the number of persons testing positive among tested is a crucial tool to measure the extent of pandemic. Meanwhile, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad urged people to follow Covid-19 prevention protocol in the strictest possible manner in individual and public interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/death-toll-crosses-100-22439-new-covid-cases-in-24-hours/articleshow/82092889.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Chandigarh||Thapar varsity falls under RTI ambit: SIC||Chandigarh: The Punjab State Information Commission (SIC) has declared Thapar University, Patiala, as a public authority and directed the institution to provide required information to the appellant. A spokesperson of the commission said that RTI activist Akash Verma had sought information under the RTI Act but Thapar university dismissed his application, stating that it is a private deemed to be university under Section-3 of the UGC Act 1956 and not a public authority. Verma had then approached the commission by filing an appeal against the order passed by the university. The spokesperson informed that Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology was established by the then Pepsu Government in 1955 after an agreement with the Mohini Thapar Charitable Trust to promote technical education in the state. Under the agreement, the joint charitable trust was created and Rs 30 lakh each by Mohini Charitable Trust and the Pepsu government was subscribed to the institute. On September 19, 1955, the Pepsu government issued a notification under Section 4 of the Land of Acquisition Act to the effect that land measuring 250 acres was likely to require for public purposes. The land was provided by the erstwhile Pepsu government, free of cost for the establishment of the respondent institute and state government and UGC gave grants to the said institution. Disposing of the appeal, the state information commissioner cited a Supreme Court decision in the case of DAV College Trust and Management Society (Supra) in which the apex court had held that if an institution is established on land given by the state then it would certainly mean that it is substantially financed by the government and is public authority and is obliged to comply with the provisions of the RTI Act, 2005.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/thapar-varsity-falls-under-rti-ambit-sic/articleshow/82091955.cms||---
---||Nagpur||People move to resorts, farms to escape Covid-19 spread in Nagpur||NAGPUR: The spread of Covid-19 in the city and other districts has triggered alarm, with some people who had left the city earlier for various works preferring not to return, and many leaving for safer destination, including to nearby forest areas. With daily death toll mounting to over 60, and positive cases crossing 6,000, citizens are contemplating shifting to safer places at least till the period of lockdown. On Thursday, the toll was 74 in the district and over 5,800 tested positive. Considering the upward coronavirus trend, those owning properties or farmhouses near forest areas and wildlife parks have already left the city. “The spread of Covid-19 raises questions about community transmission in Nagpur. Before Tadoba was shut down for tourism from April 15, I had reached here when simple restrictions were in force. Now my family has also joined me,” says Nikhil Abhyankar, who has a resort at Kolara gate. Abhyankar, who had earlier spent three months in the first wave at Kolara, said, “There can be no better place than living near forest. There is open space, no traffic, greenery everywhere, and no Covid-19 cases. Moreover, we don’t come in contact with people, especially when tourism is closed. Our stay also helps maintain the property.” There are others like Saurabh Kurve, of Wardha Road, who has moved to Navegaon with his family in Tadoba buffer. Kurve, who also owns the property, is even offering a package inclusive of food and snacks for those who wish to take a break from the uncontrolled Covid-19 spread in city. “There are no coronavirus cases here,” he adds. Manish Sharma has shifted with his family to his farmhouse near Madhya Pradesh side of Pench, and now doesn’t want to return. “The Covid-19 spread in Nagpur is the reason,” he admits. Sharma said, “The farmhouse is my winter home. I had come here from Nagpur in October last when normalcy had returned and stayed for two months, but now that coronavirus has spread alarmingly, I’ve got a reason not to return. The place in eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of Pench is a ‘global village’ with all modern facilities like internet, telephone etc and all consumables available like any other city.” “I’ve been enjoying organic farming and have developed a nursery. There is no pollution and a peaceful atmosphere. My friends call me and miss the place and want to move out of the city looking at the haphazard development in Nagpur, which has fast turned into a polluted city. The density of the city was one of the major reasons for Covid-19 spread,” says Sharma. Echoing the feelings, progressive farmer Diwakar Deshpande (75), a resident of Nagpur, who owns 32 acres agricultural land in Dhamangaon, was keen to spend the summer vacation with his family members at Nagpur but has dropped the plan. “All the agriculture and allied activity is over and crop too has been harvested. Before the onset of monsoon, I hoped to spend summer time with my family but looking at the spread of coronavirus it seems impossible. It is better I stay at my farm than take a risk,” says Deshpande.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/people-move-to-resorts-farms-to-escape-covid-19-spread-in-city/articleshow/82091946.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

According to police, the woman, who widowed three years ago, is in urgent need of financial assistance. In her complaint, the woman alleged that identifying himself as a clerk, Ajay Tyagi of Moradabad met her at a district office in Sambhal and assured her of all help in availing benefits under several government schemes while asking her to transfer Rs 2,000 to a bank account. “In September, on the pretext of meeting an official, Tyagi took me to a desolated place, where a friend joined him, and both raped me and made a video of the crime,” alleged the woman, adding that they threatened to make the video public if she disclosed the crime to anyone. Accusing police of inaction, the woman alleged that despite lodging a complaint, police refused to register an FIR. “I had reached out to Asmoli police station, but they refused to register a case, saying there was no senior officer present at the station house and asked me to come later. I even tried to reach out to senior police officers, but to no avail,” she alleged. After getting “no help” from police, the woman knocked at the court’s door for justice in March. Following the additional chief judicial magistrate’s (ACJM) intervention, both accused were booked on April 13.Meanwhile, denying the charges, Asmoli police station SHO Ranvir Singh told TOI, “She could have approached the SP (city) if local police failed to take cognisance. She lives with a relative of her husband in Nakhasa, but had approached Asmoli police station with a complaint. Following the court order, an FIR was registered against accused Amit Tyagi and an unidentified person under section 376D (punishment for gang rape) of the Indian Penal Code. A probe has been ordered, based on which further legal action will be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/two-booked-seven-months-after-raping-woman-on-pretext-of-assisting-her-in-availing-widows-pension/articleshow/82089956.cms||Maria Khan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: High-flow tube is guzzler of oxygen, avoid it, says task force||MUMBAI/PUNE: The state Covid-19 task force has advised hospitals to discontinue the use of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) cannula as it guzzles oxygen and instead use non-invasive ventilation while treating Covid-19 patients with respiratory distress. Maharashtra is currently using up almost all of the 1250 MT oxygen that is produced in the state daily. “Stop the use of HFNO machines until further notice. The HFNO machines use a very large quantity of oxygen, sometimes up to 80 litres per minute,” Sanjay Oak, chief of the task force, said in an advisory released on April 12. Mumbai’s 150 Covid hospitals are currently utilising around 235 metric tonnes of oxygen daily. Civic chief I S Chahal said that the supply currently meets the demand, but looking at the trajectory of the pandemic, a demand for more supply has already been conveyed to the state. The task force has also said that the use of oxygen cylinders should be left for hospitals. “Use only oxygen concentrators for home care, leave cylinders for hospitals and health care facilities,” the advisory underlined. The experts have also emphasised that every bit of oxygen wastage in the state should be prevented. “Fix all leaking oxygen outlets, valves and pressure gauge. Also, make sure oxygen flow meters are off when patient does not need oxygen,” the advisory said. Public health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday said the Centre had allowed the state to lift oxygen from Gujarat, Telangana, Chattisgarh, and that a committee of health commissioner, FDA commissioner and transport commissioner has been formed for the movement of oxygen. He said 50 nitrogen tankers had been converted to oxygen tankers. “We are also making some changes in the guidelines to be followed while giving oxygen to ensure that it is used judiciously,” he said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Static for 15 days, petrol falls to Rs 96.83, diesel Rs 87.81||MUMBAI: After remaining unchanged for 15 days, petrol and diesel rates fell in Mumbai on Thursday. The price of petrol has reduced to Rs 96.83 a litre from Rs 96.98 and diesel is retailing at Rs 87.81, down from Rs 87.96. Both motorists and transporters are happy the prices did not cross Rs 100 for petrol and Rs 90 for diesel. An official from an oil marketing company said rates fluctuate based on international crude oil prices and the rupee-versus-dollar rate. Prices have fallen at a time fewer vehicles are expected on roads due to the 15-day lockdown in Maharashtra. Prices fell across various other districts too, including Parbhani, where the petrol rate is the highest in the state. Parbhani, which was inching close to the Rs 100 mark, has seen the price drop Rs 98.98 from Rs 99.14. Rates in Thane and Navi Mumbai recently dropped by 15 paise for petrol and diesel; on Thursday they stood at Rs 96.94 for petrol and Rs 87.92 for diesel. If the drop in rates continued, as indicated by sources in the oil industry, it will ease the burden on transporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-static-for-15-days-petrol-falls-to-rs-96-83-diesel-rs-87-81/articleshow/82090772.cms||Somit Sen

---||Noida||Bennett University joins elite group powering media innovation globally||GREATER NOIDA: Bennett University joins an elite group of research institutions powering media innovation globally. The Times School of Media and the Computer Science Engineering Department of the university have been chosen as the Asia-Pacific lead partners of the prestigious Collab Challenge organised by the JournalismAI team of POLIS, the journalism think tank of London School of Economics and Political Science. Earlier, LSE had announced the names of Knight Lab at Medill School of Journalism, Northwestern University, as the lead partners for the Americas and BBC News Labs and Clwstwr as the lead partners for Europe, Middle East and Africa. This is the second year of the JournalismAI Challenge which has been launched by POLIS with the support of Google News Initiative. Its goal is to explore innovative solutions to improve journalism via the use of artificial intelligence technologies. Rahul Dass of the Times School of Media and Tapas Badal of the Computer Science Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Bennett University will be coordinating the APAC Challenge on behalf of the institution. The Research Question that Bennett University has framed for the APAC region is “How might we use AI and audience insights to help newsrooms design more relevant and interactive news narratives?” Building on previous work developed by the Times School of Media in collaboration with the Computer Science Engineering Department at Bennett University, the team will devise innovative storytelling methods to reach hitherto unreached audiences by extracting insights from datasets and social networks. The research question framed by Knight Lab, Medill School of Journalism, is “How might we use AI technologies to innovate newsgathering and investigative reporting techniques?” Building on the experiences of Knight Lab, the team will explore opportunities for using methods such as entity extraction, knowledge management, computer vision and image analysis to help journalists work through data and derive insights for deep, rich storytelling. This team will focus on democratising these techniques for newsrooms and journalists of varying technical aptitude. The research question framed by BBC Labs and Clwstwr is “How might we use modular journalism and artificial intelligence to assemble new storytelling formats?” The team will explore opportunities to tell journalistic stories in different ways to different people in different contexts. The focus will be on developing new storytelling formats. Media organisations in the Asia Pacific interested in participating in the challenge should send a mail to Lakshmi at lakshmi@journalismai.info with the subject line “APAC Collab Challenge”. Applications close on April 30 at 11:59pm GMT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/bennett-university-joins-elite-group-powering-media-innovation-globally/articleshow/82108915.cms||---

The deceased have been identified as Vaishali Thorat, Aarohi (6) and Piyush (3). They were residents of Gevrai Tanda, a small hamlet on the outskirts of the city. The alleged incident took place on Thursday morning in a farm behind the Nirlep company. Assistant inspector Vishwas Patil said: “Prima facie, it appears that domestic violence and dispute with the in-laws could be the primary cause for the woman taking this extreme step.” On learning about the incident, a team led by sub-divisional police officer Rahul Nehul rushed to the spot. Later, a fire brigade team, led by chief fire officer RK Sure, reached the spot and fished out the three bodies.

---||Nagpur||Remdesivir retail sale stopped, yet pharmacies getting prescriptions||Nagpur: Even as the district collector has stopped the retail sale of Remdesivir injection, an acute shortage of the anti-viral drug is making relatives of Covid positive patients run around searching pharmacies with doctor’s prescription. On April 12, the collector office had allotted 100% quota of Remdesivir to Covid hospitals but the situation has worsened in the last two days. On April 13, the hospitals could get 68% of their demand, which declined to 40% on April 14 and April 15 too. In the last two days, TOI has come across prescriptions issued by several hospitals asking the kin to arrange the anti-viral injection. The latest order from collector Ravindra Thakare has categorically asked hospitals and their pharmacies to collect the allotted quota of Remdesivir from the distributors and stockists after it is received from the suppliers. “We would look into the issue,” said Thakare. According to an insider, some hospitals are facing genuine hardships and are issuing prescription under the fear of being targeted by the patients’ kin. “Many times, the relatives are demanding the prescription. If we cannot provide the injection due to shortage and refuse to prescribe it citing an official order, then the hospital staffers and doctors risk getting attacked by the relatives,” said Dr Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA). “The hospitals are partially able to meet the requirements for Remdesivir. As the demand is not being fulfilled due to valid reasons, we are in a dilemma whom to administer the injection and whom to leave out,” said Marar. According to a pharmacist, the kin are demanding Remdesivir by showing prescriptions from different hospitals. The allotment list for Remdesivir showed that a hospital got 30 vials on April 12, around 50 on April 13, another 30 on April 14 and the same quantity on Thursday too. Relatives of a patient were found running pillar to post with a prescription from the hospital. Similarly, relative of yet another patient was trying to buy Remdesivir from retailers from a hospital which had got 32 vials of the injection on April 13 and another 20 on April 14. It’s reliably learnt that staffers at some hospitals are involved in pilfering the injection and selling it outside at a higher price. “There are also rumours of people bringing Remdesivir injections from Mumbai and other places too and selling the same at a higher price,” said a source and added that a couple of hospitals are over-charging admitted patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/remdesivir-retail-sale-stopped-yet-pharmacies-getting-prescriptions/articleshow/82089963.cms||Soumitra Bose

Kishan Reddy said the master plan should reflect the present needs and aspirations of people of the HMDA areas. The junior home minister said he has been receiving several complaints from farmers on the master plan which is not in tune with what they had aspired for. The Union minister of state, in his letter, said that while the purview of HMDA is big, there is lack of coordination among officials at the field level to execute various works. He also claimed that due to high-level corruption, illegal structures were springing up all over the area. Kishan Reddy said farmers are upset as the plans to convert land parcels into various zones were not favourable to them. He said a lot of time has already been consumed in converting the land parcels into zones. The minister also pointed out that expect for the land parcels meant for environment protection, all other land parcels could be converted into residential zones. He also asked the state government to undertake repairs for various service roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/make-changes-in-hmda-master-plan-kishan-to-cm/articleshow/82091692.cms||---

This is the first time that such an incident has come to light at the hospital.The son son had come to take his deceased father’s body at around 10am. He claimed that he was waiting outside the hospital and had made repeated inquiries, but the body was not being handed over.These and other issues regarding management of Covid hospitals have come to light since Wednesday. The hospital is reeling under a shortage of workers, particularly class four staff. The company providing manpower has already been asked to look into the matter. Hospital superintendent Dr R A Aiyer said that some delay in handing over the body takes place as after informing the relatives, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is informed for an ambulance, a place for cremation is identified and the body is sanitized and wrapped as per protocols. “There is a dead body disposal team that looks into these issues and coordinates things,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/delay-in-dead-body-disposal-sparks-row-at-ssg-hospital/articleshow/82089717.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Strengthen fort structures before monsoon arrives, urge experts||HYDERABAD: Heritage experts have called for strengthening structures — particularly the inner, outer fortifications and ramparts — of the Golconda fort before the arrival of monsoon. This, as extreme rainfall could result in further weakening of the monument. The fort was mainly built using stone and mud with limestone mortar rarely used during its construction. Huge boulders were joined together with a mud paste while building the fortification and ramparts. Areas where the mud has loosened should be identified and repaired so that the structure can withstand heavy rainfall. Heritage experts warn that Hyderabad has, of late, been witnessing erratic rains with episodes of heavy to very heavy rainfall and the Golconda fort may witness more incidents of wall collapses. City heritage expert Dr Mohammad Safiullah told TOI that there are several weak points in the fortification and ramparts. “When I inspected the monument, I found that limestone mortar was rarely used for fortification. The Qutub Shahis had built the structure in such a way that all rainwater comes downhill without stagnation. The fort is at an altitude of 400 feet. Over the years there has been no maintenance, and this led to stagnation of rainwater and seepage. The fort was damaged at three places last year as rainwater could not drain out,” Safiullah said. The heritage expert said parts of the monument, particularly ramparts, should be thoroughly inspected and weak points should be strengthened. Construction of toilets is also causing water to stagnate, he said. He added that focus is more on security rather than maintenance. Vegetation must be removed as existing cracks could further widen as roots grow, he said adding damaged parts are yet to be restored. Meanwhile, Intach city convener P Anuradha Reddy said there should be better coordination between the central and state archaeology departments. She said the ASI should make the state government its partner in protection and maintenance of the monument. Since encroachments come under the state purview, she suggested the ASI should take help of state government in removing illegal structures. “The Qutub Shahis built Golconda fort about 500 years ago using technology that would make the grand monument withstand vagaries of nature for generations to witness its architectural, acoustical and seismological marvels. All that the magnificent fort would require was a little maintenance to keep the stone fortifications strong. However, encroachments, unscientific planning, illegal structures coupled with decades of neglect have weakened the Golconda fort,” Anuradha Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/strengthen-fort-structures-before-monsoon-arrives-urge-experts/articleshow/82091486.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Hyderabad||High court directs civic body to pull down illegal buildings in three weeks||HYDERABAD: Telangana high court on Thursday directed Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation to raze illegal structures within three weeks and also collect demolition costs from builders of such buildings. Judges said that there was no point in punching a hole in these structures and directed GHMC zonal commissioners to pull them down totally. When three zonal commissioners informed the court that several unauthorised buildings have been identified, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy told them to crack the whip immediately while hearing a PIL. The judges also directed the principal district judges in the zones to resolve all illegal structures cases expeditiously. State counsel Harender Pershad said authorities had filed vacate stay petitions in all the cases. Commissioners of Kukatpally, Secunderabad and Khairatabad quoted a sample data of 2019, indicating around 140 illegal structures in each of the zones had been marked for demolition. When Pershad informed the court that a majority of builders had obtained status quo orders from civil courts and high court, the judges said: “Scores of areas in Gachibowli falling under Serilingampally zone alone may surprise you with more than 1,000 status quo orders.” Seeking updated affidavits from all the six zonal commissioners, the judges said Charminar, LB Nagar and Serilingampally zonal commissioners have not filed their reports. Referring to the report of the Secunderabad zonal commissioner, the judges said owners of 42 buildings out of 46 identified illegal structures had obtained interim orders against demolition. They also expressed a doubt whether GHMC officials were hand in glove with errant builders and whether they were giving time to them to obtain restraint orders from courts. “This can be seen from the fact that only two officials and one staff member have been punished for wrongdoings in the three zones,” the judges said and added that the status of the charge memos issued to four others was not indicated in the reports. The case was adjourned by the court to June 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-court-directs-civic-body-to-pull-down-illegal-buildings-in-three-weeks/articleshow/82091498.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Hyderabad||Form body to preserve historic structures: HC to Telangana, Centre||HYDERABAD: Telangana high court on Thursday directed the state and central governments to form a committee of experts to ensure protection, renovation of historical monuments. This, to protect structures like the Golconda Fort, Qutub Shahi tombs in Hyderabad and 27 other such monuments all over the state. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said this to advocate general BS Prasad and assistant solicitor general Namavarapu Rajeswara Rao after resuming hearing in a PIL taken up the court, based on a report by TOI. The report had highlighted the plight of these historical structures due to official negligence. Centre’s assistant solicitor general Rajeswara Rao informed the court that he had paid a personal visit to Golconda on Wednesday. He said that as many as 153 complaints were given by central archaeological authorities to the state government and its officials about mushrooming illegal structures within a 100 metre radius of the Golconda fort. We have been giving these complaints right from 2010 and none of them are acting on our complaints, the ASG said. The bench said there is a need to constitute a committee to oversee the protection and preservation work. “The state is only interested in organising a sound and light show at the historic fort for the purpose of collecting ticket prices from the tourists,” the bench said. It suggested that the state culture department secretary be part of this committee. “The Centre’s superintending archaeologist, the head of archaeology at JNTU should also be there in the committee,” the bench said. Acceding to a suggestion from senior counsel L Ravi Chander, the bench included a person from the Agha Khan Institute as a member of this committee. “We want a redevelopment plan that concentrates both on the fort and also its vicinity,” the bench said while posting the case to June 10. The bench added that the state culture secretary should convene the first meeting of this committee by April 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/form-body-to-preserve-historic-structures-hc-to-state-centre/articleshow/82090970.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

As many as 4,800 odd were running when the first lockdown was clamped, and after the gradual relaxations that followed later. Sources say as the norms were gradually relaxed, industries could get registered by giving a self-declaration. Eventually as many as 4,800 units, which included those located outside MIDC’s estates, could operate. The units all clubbed altogether employed 2.06 lakh workers at that time.Going by the current norms, not more than 700 units, which employ 30,000 odd workers, are eligible to operate under the current framework, said government sources requesting anonymity. However, there was little compliance on Thursday due to the confusion over rules.Industrialists TOI spoke to said no decision has been taken on the wages to be paid during the shutdown period. The contract workers are paid only on the basis of attendance. However, there is a liability towards workers on rolls, but no decision has been taken yet. There is no clarity from the government also, they said. “It may be difficult to pay for the lockdown period, may be the payments will be done in a staggered manner,” said an industrialist.In Butibori, the largest industrial estate of the region, almost 50% of the units were closed. These mainly include fabrication and engineering units, a source said. An online meeting between the industries department, local administration and industry representatives was held on ThursdayThe new guidelines allow only units engaged in manufacture or supply chain management of essential commodities to operate at rated capacity. Essential commodities include pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, food products, veterinary medicines and farm related inputs.Industrial units having continuous production process, which means the plants cannot be started and shut down easily, are also allowed to operate with 50% capacity. The units will have to make arrangement for the workers to say within the premises, said joint director (industries) AP Dharmadikari during the online meetingHe said non-essential units can also operate if there is a facility for workers to stay at the unit. The units can also operate if arrangement is made to bring workers straight to the workplace from their dedicated place of stay. Even export oriented units have been allowed to work.Sources in industries’ associations said small and medium units will also not be in a position to make the stay arrangement for workers. The government has also made it clear that industries, except pharmaceuticals, will not get oxygen supply. This too has led to a number of units shutting down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-700-industrial-units-can-operate-in-latest-curbs/articleshow/82089965.cms||Shishir Arya

As the victim Jayesh Chaudhary, 32, lay dead in the car, his brother is seeing wailing inconsolably even as others with him try to comfort the youngster. The victim was from Vedanchha village of Palanpur taluka, sources said. Jayesh was also suffering from cancer, locals in Vedanchha told TOI The victim’s relatives created ruckus and vented their anger against the hospital management. Hospital in-charge PJ Chaudhary said,” “What can we do when the infrastructure has been stretched beyond its capacity?.” He said that the authorities had informed the kin about non-availability of beds and other paraphernalia, but they stayed put in hope of getting some assistance even as the patient was on the verge of death when he reached the hospital.“The patient who died in the car had 90% infected lungs. How can we admit when we don’t have a single a bed available? There are 126 beds and 135 patients while oxygen line is available on 85 beds only. All are occupied,” said Chaudhary. The deceased was first taken to a private hospital and then referred to Palanpur civil hospital. Corona threat looms large across Palanpur as new cases continue to surge in the district.

---||Nashik||Relatives watched helplessly as patients died gasping for breath||Nashik: His emotions ranging from sorrow to anger, Vicky Jadhav cannot believe his 65-year-old grandmother Sugandha is no more as he sat outside the Zakir Hussain Hospital in Nashik. “Her body was shaking. I rushed to the doctors and nurses, but they were busy attending to other patients. I was helpless. When I returned to my grandmother’s bedside moments later, I found her motionless,” he said, adding that the oxygen supply at the hospital had been problematic for quite some time. Several distraught relatives of patients, who could only watch as their loved ones died after struggling to breathe following the tragic oxygen tank leak at the hospital on Wednesday, vented their anger at the doctors and nurses. Patients’ relatives are usually not allowed inside the Covid hospital. However, during the commotion following the leak, many relatives entered the wards. Another woman, who lost her 23-year-old son due to the oxygen supply disruption, squarely blamed the hospital doctors and staff. “I want my son back and I won’t leave the doctors. I will sue them all. I had not brought my son here to die. The doctors killed him,” she said, adding that she had seen other patients too dying before her eyes due to lack of oxygen. The woman’s husband, Kirsing Mahale, who was also breathing laboriously, said their son’s name was Pravin and that they were residents of Shivajnagar, Satpur. Pravin had been admitted to the hospital about nine days ago. “He was doing well earlier in the day. There was no sign to suggest that he could die a couple of hours later. My wife and other family members entered the ward during the confusion following the leak,” Mahale said. Parikshit Waliker, whose 44-year-old brother Pramod succumbed, said his sibling had been admitted around 12 days ago. “He was critical and was put on a ventilator, but his oxygen level had improved since. On Wednesday, the doctors had expressed satisfaction over his condition. They had told me that he will be shifted to the general ward and will get discharged within the next 2-3 days,” he said. “I was happy. But all of a sudden, tragedy struck. I was on the hospital premises when the incident occurred. I lost my brother due to the negligence of the hospital management,” he said. Waiker’s mother too was admitted to the hospital and was on oxygen last week. She was shifted to the general ward on Tuesday. Santosh Wagh, whose 46-year-old sister was on the ventilator, said she had been admitted to the hospital four days back. “Her health was improving. On Wednesday morning, her oxygen level was at 92 and she was showing signs of recovery. This unfortunate incident took her life,” said Wagh, who was not at his sister’s side when the incident took place. Taking into account the mental state of the relatives, the city police deployed strict bandobast outside the hospital. Police commissioner Deepak Pandey, DCP Amol Tambe and other senior officials of almost all police stations visited the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/relatives-watched-helplessly-as-patients-died-gasping-for-breath/articleshow/82185539.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The cops mostly remained in their shell and not much checking was done.The city police, barring a few cavalcades and bike marches at Gittikhadan, Sitabuldi and central Nagpur, mostly stayed off the roads. Lanes in various localities remained chock-o-block with people moving round without mask. There was crowding at shops and roadside vendors. There was rush in lanes of Mominpura, Bhaldarpura and surrounding areas. Though markets and shops at Itwari, Ramdaspeth and Sitabuldi remained closed, this didn’t discourage wanderers from visiting the places. City police could penalize only 67 persons for not wearing mask, 52 for failing to comply with Covid distancing norms and fined 57 vehicle riders. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said he would review the situation and look into the issue. According to hotelier Tejinder Singh Renu, he did not feel any difference on the road with police not checking violators on vehicles. “If police don’t pull up their socks and take strict action, there would be no proper enforcement of this extended restriction,” he said. RTI activist Abhay Kolarkar said police were spotted visiting buildings, apartments and work sites to create awareness but they could not control crowd on the roads. “With so many relaxations and offices opened, it’s not easy to control the crowd. We need a lockdown like that was imposed last year,” he said.On the other hand, the nuisance detection squad of Nagpur Municipal Corporation carried out patrolling in markets in all the 10 zones of the city and penalized traders and individuals found violating the Covid-19 norms.The civic cops took action against ready-made garment shops, saree shops, beauty parlours etc that remained open despite order to remain shut. “In all we took action against 15 establishments and recovered Rs1.45 lakh fine from the violators,” said NDS commandant Veersen Tambe. The NDS team penalized four garments stores and saree centres in Gandhibagh zone. The team also found a steel unit functioning in the industrial area under Lakadganj zone.The squad penalized a hardware shop near Mankapur Square and an automobile shop near Jaripatka police station under Mangalwari zone.The team found many traders clandestinely running their outlets. Many electrical equipment shops had displayed air-coolers and were seen negotiating with customers.On Zingabai Takli Road, many non-essential shop had kept grocery items to evade action, as per the squad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/crowding-traffic-on-roads-as-cops-found-wanting-in-enforcing-curbs/articleshow/82089977.cms||---

According to police, the woman, who widowed three years ago, is in urgent need of financial assistance. In her complaint, the woman alleged that identifying himself as a clerk, Ajay Tyagi of Moradabad met her at a district office in Sambhal and assured her of all help in availing benefits under several government schemes while asking her to transfer Rs 2,000 to a bank account. “In September, on the pretext of meeting an official, Tyagi took me to a desolated place, where a friend joined him, and both raped me and made a video of the crime,” alleged the woman, adding that they threatened to make the video public if she disclosed the crime to anyone. Accusing police of inaction, the woman alleged that despite lodging a complaint, police refused to register an FIR. “I had reached out to Asmoli police station, but they refused to register a case, saying there was no senior officer present at the station house and asked me to come later. I even tried to reach out to senior police officers, but to no avail,” she alleged. After getting “no help” from police, the woman knocked at the court’s door for justice in March. Following the additional chief judicial magistrate’s (ACJM) intervention, both accused were booked on April 13. Meanwhile, denying the charges, Asmoli police station SHO Ranvir Singh told TOI, “She could have approached the SP (city) if local police failed to take cognisance. She lives with a relative of her husband in Nakhasa, but had approached Asmoli police station with a complaint. Following the court order, an FIR was registered against accused Amit Tyagi and an unidentified person under section 376D (punishment for gang rape) of the Indian Penal Code. A probe has been ordered, based on which further legal action will be taken.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/two-booked-seven-months-after-raping-woman-on-pretext-of-assisting-her-in-availing-widows-pension/articleshow/82089974.cms||Maria Khan

Most of the beneficiaries were rickshaw-pullers, labourers, destitute, beggars, and homeless,” said Sanjay Kasodhan, who runs the centre near Chitnavis Park in Mahal. The centres remain open for a limited period and each centre may not serve more than 300 thalis. The reason is that as per the GR issued on April 15, 2021, the state government has doubled the target of thalis from one lakh to two lakhs for the entire Maharashtra. “When Covid was under control, the target was one lakh thalis and each centre served 150 thalis in the city for Rs5. Now that the target has been doubled, we assume we will have to serve 300 thalis, though there no such directions from the district administration,” said Kishore Thakre, who runs a centre near Daga Hospital.For serving meals at Rs5 per thali, the government pays a subsidy of Rs45. Now, the operators will get Rs50 as a subsidy as thali is being served free of cost. Yet, the centres are not ready to serve more than 150 thalis the reason being that during complete lockdown when they served up to 1,000 thalis, the centres were paid money for 375 thalis.“The balance payment has still not released though the operating cost has increased due to food inflation and maintenance and labour cost. Besides, the district officials have also not released payment for the last two months,” said Thakre.The district administration failed to reveal the figure of how much was paid to registered street vendors who are to be given Rs 1,500 and rickshaw owners Rs2,000. Among other benefits, the state will grant Rs 1,000 to each person for two months under the Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Yojana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/on-day-1-poor-served-more-than-1500-shiv-bhojan-thalis/articleshow/82089979.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Chandigarh||Political parties try to tap scattered Dalit vote bank||JALANDHAR: Even as there is renewed focus on wooing Dalit voters, with Shiromani Akali Dal and BJP announcing their plans to have a Dalit deputy CM and CM respectively if voted to power, Dalits in Punjab remain fractured on caste lines. While Dalits remain a crucial support base for the Congress, they have been voting for different parties. The Congress has strong base among different Dalit communities and Punjab has 39 scheduled castes. Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh has also accused SAD and BJP of failing to uplift Dalits. It was the BSP which dented Congress support base among Dalits and broke its almost hegemonic control over the Dalit constituency in Punjab. However, BSP also became an example of how Dalits remained divided on both caste and political lines. Despite efforts by its founder, the late Kanshi Ram, the party could not really become a face of all Dalits and its support base largely remained confined to Adidharmi/Ravidassia community. The other big SC community, Valmiki/Mazhabi, stayed away from the party. Despite being known as a Dalit party, maximum vote share of BSP was 7.67% in the 2004 parliamentary elections in Punjab, which has 32% SC population. While the two big communities are estimated to comprise around one fourth of the total population, they remain socially and politically divided. Shiromani Akali Dal has also been getting reasonable share of Dalit voters. Out of its four MLAs in Doaba region, three are from reserved seats. While three come from Ravidassia/Adidharmi community, SAD has its support base among Mazhabi Sikhs also and the party has managed to make some inroads into the Valmiki community. Over the past decade, BJP has made earnest efforts to woo Dalits. In 2012, they made a member of Dalit community, Bhagat Chunni Lal, their legislative party leader. In 2014, the party chose its first Dalit state president in Vijay Sampla, who was taken into the union cabinet despite being a first time MP. Despite all this, BJP faces a distinct challenge as Dalits appeared united in Punjab only when they protested during the Bharat Bandh call of April 2, 2018 against dilution of provisions of Prevention of Atrocities on SC ST Act by Supreme Court and against demolition of Ravidas temple in Tuglaqabad in September 2019. Although BJP has a Dalit MP from the state in MoS Som Parkash, the pattern of voting here made it clear that Dalits, along with Sikhs, played a crucial role in blocking the Modi wave in Punjab. “Dalits remain divided in Punjab and there is clear friction between Ravidassia/Adidharmis and Mazhabi/Valmiks but so far BJP has not been able to make inroads among them. Anti-BJP narrative has been dominating in these two bigger SC communities,” said Adi Dharam Samaj founder and head, Darshan Ratan Rawan, a major organisation of Valmikis. Meanwhile, sources in the BJP said their party has been working among Dalits and second consecutive MoS in union cabinet from Punjab is a Dalit. “Like they did in UP, in Punjab too, RSS has been working silently to reach out to Dalits and has been able to build a reasonable network among them,” said a BJP leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/political-parties-try-to-tap-scattered-dalit-vote-bank/articleshow/82092010.cms||IP Singh

The last 1,000 deaths have been recorded in 16 days, as the toll began to surge rapidly due to lack of beds in government and private hospitals. The sudden increase in active cases have left all Covid hospitals jampacked with many dying without even before reaching hospital. The day reported 74 deaths — which are highest-ever — and 5,813 cases on Thursday. The previous highest 73 deaths were recorded on April 8. For 11 days this month, the cases have remained above 5,000 mark while testing was higher than 15,000 on 13 days and April 13 witnessing highest 29,122 tests. Such had been the rush that NMC had to suspend RTPCR swab collection for three days to clear the backlog. Total 2.75lakh tests have generated 76,811 cases in April. The sample positivity rate for the month is 27% while case fatality ratio is 1.1%. Cases in the 15 days of April at 76,811 are now higher than any month in the pandemic. At 48,457, the month of September had reported the highest cases last year. This was surpassed in March which ended at 76,250 in that month alone. April has so far recorded 876 deaths. Highest fatalities of 1,746 took place in March followed by 1,327 in September last year. The span for the latest 1,000 Covid deaths during the ongoing second wave is shortest of the pandemic. At the first wave peak, the shortest duration was 31 days for the jumps from 1,000 to 2,000 and 2,000 to 3,000 in Aug-Sept-Oct. It had taken the district 185 days to cross the 50,000 mark on September 11 last year while it took 235 days to clock 1lakh cases. Since then, the span has been getting shorter. Back to back reporting of high number of cases has left 64,110 active cases in the district. As per officials around 90% of them are in home isolation. Yet, the remaining 10% needing hospitalization have badly strained the health infrastructure and services in the city. In fact, many home isolated patients too have been advised anti-viral and anti-biotic drugs which are also in great demand. Meanwhile, one Covid positive woman inmate passed away at Regional Mental Hospital. So far 83 inmates have tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/district-crosses-3-lakh-cases-6k-deaths/articleshow/82090873.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM writes to PM on need for more oxygen||MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray, in two letters to PM Modi on Tuesday, raised concerns over the spike in Covid cases in Maharashtra and stated that according to projections, the state’s caseload is expected to double from 5.64 lakh to 11.9 lakh in the next two weeks. Thackeray said the state needs more liquid oxygen and the requirement could be 2,000 metric tonnes by month-end against the current consumption of 1,200 MT. Thackeray wrote two letters to PM Modi on the first day of the Marathi new year, Gudi Padwa (April 13), seeking his cooperation in the light of emerging challenges due to the second wave of Covid-19. The CM stated there were 10.5 lakh active cases in the country during the September 2020 peak. “Based on the current projections and highly transparent testing, the state alone expects 11.9 lakh active cases in the state by the month end,” he wrote. He further said the biggest concern was to get liquid medical oxygen. Thackeray said the state is crossing its manufacturing capacity, that is 1200 MT, and projected demand for oxygen will be 2,000 MT by April 30. Thackeray sought permission to airlift and transport oxygen from steel plants in the eastern and southern parts of the country under the National Disaster Management Act. He welcomed Centre’s decision to ban export of Remdesivir and demanded that authorities grant compulsory licence as per Section 92 of Indian Patents Act to facilitate approval to exporting units to produce and sell Remdesivir in domestic markets. The CM also urged the PM to declare the pandemic a ‘natural calamity’ so that the state can use the state disaster response fund (SDRF) to provide financial assistance to those impacted. The state has been allocated Rs 4,294 crore for the year under the SRDF and has already approached the Centre to disburse at least 25% for various Covid-19 management measures. The state is expecting Rs 800 crore as the first instalment from the Centre. The CM said notifying the pandemic as a natural calamity would allow the state to pay relief of Rs 100 per adult per day and Rs 60 per child per day during the period of lockdown to those registered under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana and priority household ration card holders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cm-writes-to-pm-on-need-for-more-oxygen/articleshow/82092009.cms||---

---||Nagpur||NMC centres crowded as RTPCR test resumes after 3-day break||Nagpur: As swab collection for RTPCR test resumed on Thursday after a break of three consecutive days, all the centres of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) witnessed heavy rush. Citizens had been waiting since Sunday for the test to begin as it considered gold standard to confirm Covid-19. The centres were only performing rapid antigen test (RAT) until Thursday as four public labs were clearing backlog. The exact number of tests conducted would be known on Friday.On Thursday, hundreds of citizens were turned back from centres which reached their daily swab collection limit. At some places, fights were reported among citizens waiting outside these centres. In a bid to clear the rush, some centres made doctor’s prescription or positive report of a close contact mandatory. “We closed the gates and announced that only those with a prescription or is a close contact would be tested. Still, many waited and reached the registration desk. We offered them rapid antigen test but they insisted on RTPCR,” said Dr Meenakshi Singh, in-charge of Pachpaoli centre. Centre officials said the number of genuine citizens was much more than their day’s capacity and there is urgent need to work in double shifts and increase manpower. Some officials said they received calls from patients whose treatment couldn’t start due to lack of RTPCR tests. “NMC had directed us to consider antigen positive report but many with symptoms had tested negative in RAT. Emergency surgeries and pregnancy cases were pending,” they said. At RPTS testing centre, many had queued up from 5am to ensure they are among the day’s first 300. “We kept 25 viral transport media (VTM) tubes for emergency cases. Those too were taken in no time. Some patients said they were unable to get admission,” said a centre official. Though the backlog has been cleared, citizens would still need to wait for a day to get the report from all labs except, CSIR-NEERI. Samples from RTPS centre are processed at Neeri lab and the results are given the same day. At PWD quarters in Raj Nagar, the queue extended onto the road. The centre had put up pandal for citizens but many had to stand as no chairs were provided. Meanwhile, more private labs refused to provide home collection due to heavy workload and manpower shortage. This forced more people to visit NMC centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-centres-crowded-as-rtpcr-test-resumes-after-3-day-break/articleshow/82089997.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

After the agenda to issue completion certificate was tabled in the building planning committee (BPC) meeting, the JDA has directed the assistant town planner to submit a report. The project, Palacia, has been in the news for all the wrong reasons since its inception. Sources said the extension was provided after approving revised layout plan of the project in the BPC meeting in 2018. “The deadline of luxury residential complex Palacia was set May 2021. Now, the project is completed and we will carry out an inspection and issue a layout plan,” said a source. It was informed, on July 26, 2013, the Congress government had permitted the height of the building to be revised from 15 to 30 metres, after considering the location of the plot on Prithviraj Road. The BJP government, which came to power in December 2014, withdrew the order issued by the Congress government, keeping the height of the building to the original 15 metres. The JDA also cancelled the layout plans approved for 30 metres during a BPC meeting. However, in 2017, the UDH department revoked its previous orders and permission to construct the building to its revised height of 30 metres was provided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-asks-town-planner-to-submit-report-on-luxury-realty-project/articleshow/82090878.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Congress moves HC for probe into free injections offered by C R Paatil||AHMEDABAD: In what could spell trouble for Gujarat BJP chief C R Paatil, the Gujarat Congress on Thursday moved the Gujarat high court seeking an inquiry into Paatil and BJP MLA Harsh Sanghavi allegedly hoarding and distributing 5,000 remdesivir injections while the drug is in short supply and its sale is restricted by law. Leader of opposition in the Gujarat assembly Paresh Dhanani sought an inquiry by an expert committee or the government, into the procurement and distribution of the controlled antiviral drug from the Surat BJP office last week. He sought criminal, civil and departmental action against those involved or those who may have aided Paatil in procuring such a large quantity of the injections that had been manufactured by Zydus Healthcare Ltd. The petition was filed through advocate Anand Yagnik. Dhanani demanded the constitution of an expert committee with neutral persons to inquire into the hoarding, distributing and selling of 5,000 injections to people under the provisions of various laws – the Pharmacy Act, 1948, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act. He claimed that after the central authority’s order to control the sale of the drug, an act of hoarding requires an inquiry. The petitioner stated that when questioned by the media, Paatil refused to divulge the source of the medicine. He also said that a BJP leader claimed that the stock was procured from outside the state, but the manufacture seems to have taken place in Gujarat. Thus an inquiry is necessary into who sold the 5,000 injections to Paatil; who bought them and provided them to Paatil; with whose help the injections were procured during such a shortage; who are his friends and licensed druggists who procured the stock from Zydus Healthcare Ltd; whether this was a voluntary act on the part of the company; whether a manufacturer can en mass provide remdesivir injections to a political personality; and whether the law permits a political party to commit such an obviously illegal act of hoarding an important antiviral drug during a shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cong-moves-hc-for-probe-into-free-injections-offered-by-paatil/articleshow/82092014.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Despite HC orders, no extra beds for patients||Nagpur: A former captain of VCA junior cricket team died recently of Covid-19 after he failed to get a bed in any hospital. The second wave of Covid-19 pandemic is proving more deadly with hundreds of patients succumbing to it in the last couple of weeks, many of them failing to get the oxygen or ventilator beds in the city. Social workers blamed it on lack of planning by both, the government and civic authorities in upgrading the health infrastructure of the city.When many PILs were filed last year, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court had passed a slew of directives to both the government and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to increase beds and other infrastructure in city hospitals, particularly at Government Medical College (GMCH) and Mayo Hospital (IGGMCH).State health minister Rajesh Tope visited the city on September 24-25, when first wave was at its peak, and had instructed to add 400 beds at GMCH to make it a 1,000 bed unit. The government had assured the HC in November it would do so but that remained only on paper. Only recently, when the cases spiked again, the GMCH added a measly 100 beds.Activists slammed the administration for leaving the patients to fend for themselves. According to them, the patients have started going to Amravati, Akola, Bhandara and even to Hyderabad in search of hospital beds.Anu Chhabrani, running an NGO Together We Can, which is helping the administration in managing the crisis, blamed it on the leaders who failed to take steps when patients’ numbers were less. “Now, they’re ordering the bureaucrats, who were doing their job sincerely. These leaders should have boosted health infrastructure instead of making flyovers and bridges. It would have helped save hundreds of lives. We have been bringing hospitals and funds to the administration for Covid patients, but under diktats from the leaders, no one is paying heed to our appeals,” she said.Social activist Shailesh Pandey suggested the administration must take over all marriage halls for quarantine of positive patients. “It would need only basic arrangements like beds, mattresses. These places generally have multiple toilets. Quarantine of positive patients (who do not require hospitalization) will contain spread of the virus,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-hc-orders-no-extra-beds-for-patients/articleshow/82089985.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Ahmedabad||Issue remdesivir usage advisory, HC tells state govt||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Thursday asked the state government to come out with a complete advisory on the use of remdesivir for Covid-19 patients, after the state government continued to claim that it is being over-prescribed, which is leading to shortage and black-marketing. The HC division bench also asked the government to make a statement, if it wants to, on the sufficient availability of remdesivir so that people need not panic. To this proposal, advocate general Kamal Trivedi said it is difficult to claim that the government has sufficient stock. After repeated assertion by the state government that remdesivir is being unnecessarily prescribed by doctors and its use is limited in hospitalization and under medical supervision, the judges took the government to task. The judges said that the state government has got a panel of expert doctors with whose help the government can come out with a statement or open letter on “what is remdesivir, how and it is to be given, to whom it is to be given, and where it is to be given”. The bench added, “This will clear confusion among people, particularly when WHO and ICMR have different perceptions on this subject.” The judges told the state government that if it believed there is unnecessary hype over remdesivir, it should come out with a statement and advisory on use of the medicine. The CJ said, “Unnecessarily, remdesivir has been made like amrit; anyone who drinks it will become immortal. The state should have seen that remdesivir is not given that much of important if it was not all that relevant.” On the issue of hoarding and black-marketing of the medicine, the high court asked the government to deploy its machinery to control and supervise the issue. It commented, “Your resources are not properly utilized. They are being wasted. Remdesivir is available, but according to you it is being hoarded.” The judges also said that a patient has no option but to get the medicine, if doctor prescribes it. This has not only created a hype, but it has benefitted those who have hoarded remdesivir and are now selling at higher price. The judges underlined how some people are gaining benefit from the phenomenon “by selling the medicine at four times its price”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/issue-remdesivir-usage-advisory-hc-tells-state-govt/articleshow/82092012.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||CCTV footage shows salon owner felt giddy, collapsed||Aurangabad: Police heaved a sigh of relief after the CCTV footage, retrieved by the crime branch team, on Thursday morning showed the 50-year-old haircutting salon owner felt giddy and collapsed while interacting with policemen. News of Feroz Khan’s death had sparked tension on Wednesday afternoon, when the staff working at the salon and some of his relatives claimed that he fell and sustained a head injuring after some policemen pushed him for keeping his shop open in violation of the Covid norms. Reacting to the latest development, police commissioner Nikhil Gupta expressed anguish against those who used social media for spreading false news. The rumours attracted large crowds at the Osmanpura police station, leading to the transfer of police inspector Dilip Tare, PSI Pravin Wagh and constable Sandeep Dharme to the police control room. Gupta also immediately ordered an inquiry headed by crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav into the incident. “Though the policemen called the salon owner to inquire about his shop being kept open, but CCTV footage shows they did not assault the man. In the footage, he is seen collapsing when the policemen were speaking with him,” Aghav told TOI. “We suspect that Khan banged his head against the shutter’s latch when he fell, which led to a head injury. The preliminary autopsy report has concluded that the man died of heady injury. A detailed report and forensic analysis is awaited,” said Aghav. DCP (Zone-II) Deepak Girhe told reporters that the action against the three policemen will be revoked and that they will be transferred back to the Osmanpura police station from the control room. The probe has also revealed that in the recent past, Khan had undergone surgeries and was under treatment for a heart ailment. It is suspected that he might have panicked and felt giddy due to the police action, as he was caught violating the restriction orders by keeping his shop open, following which he fell. Khan was first taken to a private hospital, which referred him to theGMCH , where he was declared brought dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cctv-footage-shows-salon-owner-felt-giddy-collapsed/articleshow/82089217.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to Navrangpura police officer, accused Devang Thakar, a resident of Balmukund Society in Ranip, was hired by Saviour Annexe hospital on Ashram Road on January 02, 2021. He was given charge of billing and taking care of oxygen level at the hospital which was recently designated as a Covid-19 facility. Apart from that, he was sometimes sent to a civic body run pharmacy store on VS hospital campus to bring remedesivir injections for Covid patients. On April 10, he called up Dr Riddhish Patel, the manager of the hospital, and informed him that he was going on leave due to some emergency at home. So, Patel and another colleague went to VS hospital to procure remedesivir injections. However, the pharmacist told Patel that he had already given 30 injections to Saviour Annexe hospital. The pharmacist showed some documents to Patel who realised that someone had stolen documents of patients to get the injections. His Aadhaar card had also been submitted at the medical store. On inquiring into the matter, Patel found that Thakar had forged his Aadhaar card and had procured the injections to sell them in black market. Patel approached Navrangpura police who traced Thakar to Ranip and arrested him under charges of cheating, forgery and submitting forged documents as genuine along with charges under the disaster management act, the essential commodities act as well as the drugs and cosmetics act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hospital-staffer-uses-fake-papers-to-get-remdesivir/articleshow/82092023.cms||---

Once the proposal is approved by the finance department, amendments will be made in the allotment policy. An official said, “The empowered committee is chaired by the UDH minister. Though, orders allowing EC to allot land at 30% reserve price were issued, a nod is required to make amendments in the policy.” In 2015, the state government had made an attempt to tighten norms in allotting land at concessional rates and a transparent policy was devised. In the new policy, norms were fixed to allot land to schools, universities, hospitals and other social institutions falling under development authority, housing board, urban improvement trust jurisdictions. However, after coming to power, the previous government had ceased the right of urban local bodies (ULBs) including EC to allot land at concessional rates to educational institutes, hospitals, trusts, newspapers, social and religious organisations. Such land allotments will now be done by the state government after examining the requirements of the applicant. A source said, “As the process to seek permission from the state government was cumbersome, an exercise to provide official powers to EC is under way. Though, EC already has powers and has recently allotted land for stadium in Chop recently.” “In absence of availability of developed land, the state government or EC can allot undeveloped land at 20% of DLC rates. Moreover, if the premier institute will invest Rs 50 crore, the land will be allotted on 50% rates and if it invests Rs 100 crore, it will be allotted at 25% rates,” said a source||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/udh-may-empower-panel-to-allot-land-at-30-of-reserve-price/articleshow/82090904.cms||---

Elaborate arrangements were made to control crowds at temples that opened doors to devotees since wee hours but turnout was not even one-fourth of what was expected. Belur Math was perhaps the only place where the expected number of people turned up in two slots. Kalighat temple waskept open since 1am but only one-fourth of the usual numbers turned up. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee visited the temple at 5pm on Wednesday and offered puja. “Usually she comes after midnight to offer her prayers for the new year but this time she came a day early,” said Dipankar Chatterjee, secretary of the sevayats of the temple. Dakshineshwar temple too saw about one-third of the usual numbers offering Poila Baisakh prayers. The temple was kept open since 5am to facilitate the pujas but only very few turned up. “Elections and Covid coupled with the heat might have prevented people from turning up. We, however, kept watering the courtyard so that it did not heat up and devotees could stand comfortably,” said temple trustee, Kushal Chowdhury. Belurmath saw a large turnout of more than 5,000 people in two slots— 8:30am to 1am and 4pm to 6pm. At College Street, the usual scene of adda over book releases with popular authors moving from one publisher to another was missing.

A senior official in the health department confirmed to TOI that a total of 68 "top seers" in Haridwar have tested positive for Covid-19 between April 5 to 14. In the wake of the increasing number of Covid cases in the sadhu community in Haridwar, Niranjani Akhada, one of the largest naga sanyasi akhadas and the second most powerful after the Juna akhada, has announced it will now exit the mela. According to the mela administration, 332 people (of 14,915 tested) reported Covid positive on Thursday. The administration doesn’t have any record of the total number of Covid deaths among those attending the religious fair. Of the 13,415 tested on Wednesday, 119 were positive; 79,301 people were tested since April 12 and 745 found positive. Secretary of the Niranjani Akhada Mahant Ravindra Puri said that "most of the saints and their followers" in the camps at Haridwar have Covid-19 like symptoms due to which saints of the akhada have decided to end the mela from April 17. Director-general of health Dr Tripati Bahuguna said, “The private hospital where Mahamandaleshwar Kapil Dev Das was admitted has shared information with the health department that the seer was admitted to their facility on April 12 and he breathed his last on April 13. He had kidney ailments beforeCovid-19 struck him. He was undergoing dialysis too.” The place in Kankhal where the seer had been camping houses 10,000 more saints and followers. Haridwar CMO Dr SK Jha said a health department team would visit the area on Friday, sanitise it and collect samples of all those staying there. Meanwhile, 33 policemen on their way back from Kumbh (between January and April 15) also tested positive. Many of them had reportedly taken both doses of the coronavirus vaccine. This came even as Mahant Hari Giri, general secretary of Akhada Parishad, apex body of all 13 akhadas, said, “It is right that (Covid) cases are increasing and we are discussing with the representatives of all 13 akhadas about the situation. We will take a final decision soon.” The Kumbh mela will end on April 30 officially and the next royal bath is on April 27. The Akhada Parishad is planning to take part in the next royal bath but only a few saints will go for the dip.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/2nd-largest-akhada-exits-kumbh-after-nirwani-head-dies-from-covid/articleshow/82090041.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Nagpur||Allow home delivery for non-food category items, says retailers’ assn||Nagpur: Appreciating efforts taken by the Maharashtra government to curb the surge of the pandemic, the Retailers Association of India (RAI) has appealed to permit non-food category retailers to make safe and contactless ‘home deliveries’ of orders taken on phone and other electronic means. RAI says it is the unified voice of Indian retailers and “works with all the stakeholders for creating the right environment for the growth of the modern retail industry in India”. In addition to food and FMCG items, citizens also need clothing, personal care products, baby products, electrical and hardware items, work-related and kitchen-related essentials and other non-food items when at home to meet their daily needs, stated RAI. The association said allowing non-food retailers to carry out home deliveries will ensure that people have fewer reasons to step outside, there is the easy availability of non-essential supplies and stricter adherence to social distancing. Expressing his views, Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, RAI, said, “Citizens also need non-food items such as clothing, hardware, electrical, household kitchen items among others on a daily basis. To enable fulfilling these needs without hardships, all sizes and formats of non-food retail should be allowed to take orders over phone and other electronic means for home deliveries. The store premises can be allowed to be opened to the limited extent of fulfilling home delivery orders while being closed for walk-in customers. This ensures social distancing and convenience to customers.” “The entire retail industry including non-essential retail is keen on joining the war against Covid-19 by following social distancing protocols and safety measures, and serving customers through non-contact deliveries. Shutting down non-food retail is not the solution. Instead, there is an urgent need for stricter surveillance to ensure that all rules with regards to safety and hygiene and, social distancing norms are being followed by one and all,” said Rajagopalan. According to Rajagopalan, removing roadblocks at the local level will not only help curb the spread but will also help save millions of livelihoods and help revive the economy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/allow-home-delivery-for-non-food-category-items-says-retailers-assn/articleshow/82103940.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Kolkata||In Bidhannagar, pitch set for a Sujit-vs-Sabyasachi poll fight||Kolkata: A tough contest is on the cards for the prestigious Bidhannagar assembly constituency that has about 2.3 lakh electorates covering the entire Salt Lake with its added areas and a large part of South Dum Dum municipality area. The constituency goes to polls on April 17. The battle here is primarily between the sitting Trinamool MLA Sujit Bose and former mayor of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation — BJP’s Sabyasachi Dutta. Both Bose and Dutta have a sizeable number of followers and public support. The Congress has also fielded the Congress-Left-ISF alliance (Sanjukta Morcha) supported candidate Abhisek Banerjee, a data solution architect by profession who has over 16 years of experience in the IT industry. In 2016, though, the contest was between Bose and Congress’s Arunava Ghosh, an ex-Trinamool MLA who was in the state assembly as an Trinamool MLA from 2001 to 2006 before quitting the party. Bose got 66,130 votes, but narrowly defeated Ghosh by a margin of only 6,988 votes. The BJP that had fielded Susanta Ranjan Pal as their candidate came in a distant third with 21,735 votes. Since then, the BJP has slowly been gaining foothold in Bidhannagar. As per constituency-wise results in the last Lok Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP had led from Bidhannagar with Trinamool MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar receiving only 58,956 votes, whereas BJP’s Mrinal Kanti Debnath got 77,872 votes. Issues ranging from bad condition of roads and insufficient street lights to shortage of drinking water supply and need for a systematic waste disposal system have always been residents’ demand. “Salt Lake being a modern planned township, the expectations of residents from the elected government representatives is also higher,” said a Trinamool party worker. Both Bose and Dutta already has a mass following, with both of them regularly meeting residents to listen to their grievances on various issues. Both are trying to reach out to the voters in the run up to the polls by scaling up their campaigns with road shows, rallies and public meetings. Former BMC MMiC Devashis Jana and Mriganka Bhattacharya, the former councillor of South Dum Dum municipality, who has been instrumental in developing the Bangur area, joined the BJP along with a few others. Both Bose and Dutta are confident. Bose said that he didn’t bother about those who jump from one party to another. “I have won three times from this constituency and hope to win for the fourth time with the blessings of the people. I will continue all the development work,” he said. Dutta said: “I am yet to lose any election in which I have contested so far. I was the person who helped the sitting MLA and minister to see the gates of the assembly in 2009,” he said. Banerjee, the Sanjukta Morcha candidate, said that the aim was to have an overall development of Bidhannagar. “It is the need to have a ‘Smart Bidhannagar’ with overall civic development,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-bidhannagar-pitch-set-for-a-sujit-vs-sabyasachi-poll-fight/articleshow/82090940.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Speaking to the media, he said TDP and BJP have no moral right to seek votes in the state. “We challenged Naidu if he was ready to accept the result of Tirupati by-election as a referendum on Jagan Mohan’s two-year rule.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Cost of life-saving gas up to Rs 25 a litre||AHMEDABAD: The surge in patients needing assistance in breathing has led medical oxygen prices to shoot north. Oxygen prices have risen by 47% over the past fortnight, manufacturers and re-fillers say. “Medical-grade oxygen prices have climbed to Rs 25 to Rs 30 per cubic metre depending on location. Prices before this surge in Covid cases were around Rs 17 to Rs 22,” said an Ahmedabad-based oxygen re-filler. Oxygen re-fillers procure liquid oxygen from large players, who have raised their rates from Rs 11.5 per cubic metre to Rs 16.50, industry players say. The large oxygen manufacturers are sourcing oxygen from multiple locations, which has added to their costs, sources said. Chetan Patel, founder of Shree Ram Oxy Gas, said, “We have increased prices since Monday to Rs 15.2 per cubic metre plus freight charges. This was earlier Rs 13.2. We have now diverted our entire supply to medical requirements and have stopped industrial supply. Prices for industry are different and are driven by demand and supply. We need to compensate for lost revenue and raised prices marginally.” Apart from the increase in prices of liquid oxygen supplied by the primary manufacturers, re-fillers have also seen transportation and labour costs increase. Large-scale manufacturers or primary manufacturers supply liquid oxygen to re-fillers, who distribute oxygen in cylinders to hospitals and industrial units. There are big hospitals that have built liquid oxygen storage tanks to ensure uninterrupted supply. However, smaller hospitals largely rely on cylinders. “Given the unprecedented surge in demand, we have to dispatch oxygen four times a day now and have also increased the number of transport vehicles. Also, the number of hospitals demanding oxygen has gone up,” said an oxygen manufacturer, who did not wish to be quoted. “Workers are now working round-the-clock against eight to ten hours earlier. They thus have to be paid double the wages they were paid earlier,” added another manufacturer and distributor of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cost-of-life-saving-gas-up-to-rs-25-a-litre/articleshow/82091243.cms||---

Therefore, we have formally submitted a memorandum to District Transport Authority seeking clarification,” he said.gAkash Chhabadiya, a hawker who sells fast food on the roadside, said he approached the local corporator about help avenues but to no avail. “We only came to know about the different dos and don’ts as a part of current restrictions. While there is a mention of relief package for the weaker sections, the government should shed more light on platforms, where such help can be accessed,” he said. Civic activist Rajendra Datey-Patil said the labour department and social welfare department should play an active role in reaching out to disadvantaged groups. “The timely help is essential for the affected groups.

Two auditors will work in shifts so that patients can file complaints if they are overcharged. Apart from 25 auditors, two nodal officers have been appointed to oversee the auditors and take complaints from patients. “Auditors will also look into bed reservation. 80% of all beds are allotted through the ward war room only. The hospitals have to update real time bed vacancy data on the BMC dashboard,” a senior civic official said. The state government has also fixed charges for the 80% reserved beds in private hospitals, and Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Chahal has directed auditors to verify all bills before they are issued to patients. “If any discrepancy is observed, hospital must be told about it. Hospitals are also expected to display charges of bed, PPE kit and masks on notice boards,” the official explained. “If there is any substance in the complaints, action against the hospital owner/trustee should be proposed,” said Chahal in a circular issued last week. Municipal chief auditor Sitaram Kale said patients can send their complaints via email. For hospitals from Fort/Colaba to Bandra (West) and (East), complaints can be sent at COVID19NODAL1@MCGM.GOV.IN.

On the other hand, Dr Meshram claimed that officials were rude and abused her before closing down the clinic and she also filed a police complaint against them. However, the major development happened on Thursday, when a large number of people raised spontaneous demand of allowing Dr Meshram to re-start her clinic as they find her ayurvedic remedy effective on Covid-19. The public pressure was so much that former minister Adv Sulekha Kumbhare met Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari on Thursday and raised the issue. Mayor also announced to issue directive and allow Dr Meshram to open the clinic again from Friday. The NMC officials and the doctors have their own explanations regarding the closure of clinic. But, series of events in last two days show that people believe in the doctors of ayurveda and are taking their medicines. TOI found that Dr Meshram’s clinic in Buddha Nagar near Shitla Mata Mandir in Indora Chowk was one of the highly in-demand traditional medicine centers. Dr Meshram claims to give medicine that cures Covid-19 and people also claim that their Covid-19 has cured by the so called traditional medicines. When we spoke to patients, doctors and experts about the traditional medicines, we found that many ayurveda doctors are claiming to have treated Covid-19. Dr Mohan Yende of National Integrated Medical Association said that a significant number of ayurveda doctors are treating hundreds of patients and also curing them. “It’s not a miracle drug or potion, but proved therapy in ayurveda. Many doctors are providing it to patients. We have testimonials of thousands of patients,” he said adding that NIMA is promoting practitioners for documentation, research and review of their treatment. “Soon, we will be coming out with a solid documentation of our therapy,” he claimed. Vaidya Anand Chamat, who runs such clinic in city claimed that he has treated many Covid-19 positive patients. “To avoid infection, we use telemedicine or call some close relative to clinic and prescribe medicines after knowing symptoms. Patients with about 8 to 10 CT score have recovered by my medicines,” he said adding that ayurveda doctors also have developed protocols, have some fixed medicines, herbs, etc for Covid-19 treatment. Vaidya Swanand Joshi claimed that Covid-19 has symptoms belonging to respiratory, digestive and circulatory systems and a well-judged combination of medicines can relive all symptoms. “No system of medicine can assure 100% result in 100% subjects. Traditional medicinal system not only provides treatment but recommends lifestyle changes to not let one fall ill,” he said. “There is wide variety of medicinal plants along their specific combinations, bhasma of minerals, kshar (alkaloids) that can get absorbed quicker thus acting quickly and impeding progression of disease,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-shuts-clinic-of-ayurveda-doc-mayor-asks-to-re-open-it/articleshow/82090990.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Along the service road at Thaltej Crossroads, four ambulances carrying bodies of Covid victims were lined up outside the crematorium. In an hour, by 11.15pm, there were eight more ambulances queued up. Opposite the entrance to the crematorium, a line of 20 cars with family members of the deceased waiting, some inside their vehicles, some on the road, some on the sit-out outside the entrance. “I’ve been here for a relative’s cremation for an hour now. It is likely to take another hour or so as there are two more people ahead of me. What to do. I’m have to wait,” said Sharad Dave (name changed), who was at Thaltej late on Wednesday night. The 5,000 Covid deaths in Gujarat on Thursday may seem like just a number, but the reality on ground is gruesome leaving not just the kin of victims but even frontline workers shaken. Govind Kumar, a 43-year-old Hatkeshwar resident drives mortuary vans in the night shift. Usually, there is one body per van. At times there are two. After getting clearance from the morgue, I drive them to the crematorium, help the family and my job is done. It is not an easy back-and-forth. There’s invariably a queue at the crematorium and we have to wait an hour or two at the very least. It’s good to wait: Because I will ferry fewer bodies.” “Then there are horrible days. Tuesday night was a nightmare. I took 13 bodies from the hospital to the crematorium. I barely had the time to eat or rest,” said Govind, who was near his van at the crematorium outside Thaltej late on Wednesday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/torturous-waits-for-grieving-kin-at-crematoriums/articleshow/82090955.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Kolkata||Old and new: A tale of two contrasting worlds||KOLKATA: Just like the name, Rajarhat-New Town assembly segment offers a clash of two contrasting worlds. On one side, there are residents living in tall high-rises overlooking six-lane roads and cycling lanes, smart bus stands and multinational hotel chains.  On the other side, there are people living in tiled roof huts beside canals and dusty roads, still struggling for basic healthcare and regular supply of drinking water. There are very few assembly segments in the state where the changing demography, difference in lifestyle and aspirations between the new mobile population and the older settlers is more evident than this, as it goes to polls this Saturday. “Development has happened only in the New Town part of our constituency. Here, we still don’t have filtered water supply at pockets in Rajarhat, several areas still have a heavy concentration of arsenic. The nearest government hospital is in Salt Lake and for any emergency, we are forced to go way up till RG Kar Hospital,” said Shaukat Rahman, a resident of Patharghata village in New Town. Residents of Patharghata, Majhipara, Chandpur and Sikharpur villages — all under the Rajarhat unit of the constituency — speak of similar problems. While residents here said that they have benefitted from schemes like Kanyashree and Rupashree and free ration provided by the state government during lockdown, they also levelled allegations of corruption against the lower level workers of the ruling party. “Most youths here are jobless and are lured into syndicate activities for quick money. This should stop,” said a resident of Jatragachhi. The New Town end of the constituency in turn demands amenities like better connectivity, more public transport options, end to stubble burning and active measures to control mosquito menace in the high-rises.  “It’s a developing town which will have some shortcomings but overall we are happy with the developments,” said Bibhas Chatterjee, a resident of a high-rise complex near New Town bus stand. A Left bastion since 1962, TMC’s Sabyasachi Dutta breached the fort for the first time in 2011. Having defected to BJP, the two-time MLA Dutta is now contesting from neighbouring Bidhannagar, forcing TMC to bank upon one time Left leader and Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation’s deputy Mayor Tapas Chatterjee. “Dutta did nothing for this segment and has fled to another constituency knowing he would have lost from this segment had he fought for BJP. People know the kind of developmental activities I do and I am confident of win,” said Chatterjee. BJP has fielded software developer and entrepreneur Bhaskar Roy, who shifted to New Town seven years ago.  “The urban segment of this constituency comprises only 3% of the electorate. But the 97% rural segment has been ignored by the ruling party. My vision is to construct a super-speciality hospital, advanced crematorium, better government schools and stop bike and car racings on the high-speed corridors,” said Roy, a poll debutant. The CPM has also fielded a strong candidate, Saptarshi Deb, the son of former housing minister Gautam Deb. “Left has always been a strong contender in this segment.

After the first cub’s death, the second cub had been receiving due care. But its health deteriorated before it died around 10.30 pm on April 14,” an official statement said. Honorary wildlife warden Kishor Pathak blamed the zoo authorities for the cubs’ deaths. “There are well-established protocols for handling cubs that are rejected by their mothers after birth. The zoo does not have qualified and skilled staff to follow such protocols. That is the cause for the untimely deaths of the two newborn cubs,” he said. Recalling similar incidents in the past — including the deaths of two leopard cubs in March, 2016 —Pathak demanded that the zoo be closed with immediate effect. “The central zoo authority of India was right in ordering the closure of the Aurangabad-based zoo in the recent past. But the decision was reversed due to political pressure. The zoo should be closed and all creatures housed in it must be shifted as soon as possible till the facility is shifted to new place with all approved staff in place,” he said. Wildlife activist Hemant Chhajed said the flaws in the process of the cubs’ post-death formalities. “As a tiger is a schedule-I wildlife animal, an officer of the rank of deputy conservator of forest must at least be present during the post mortem and other formalities. The zoo authorities violated the crucial norm,” he said demanding a high-level inquiry.While acting zoo director Shaikh Shahed did not respond to phone calls or text messages made to him , seeking his stand on death of cub.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/second-tiger-cubs-death-in-aurangabad-zoo-draws-flak/articleshow/82089259.cms||Prasad Joshi

A woman has suffered 70% burn injuries in the incident and her father-in-law has lodged a case against seven people. The woman was referred to Jodhpur in a serious condition. The family members of the woman allege that representatives of the company sprinkled petrol on her and tried to burn her alive, while a few people say that annoyed over being asked to vacate, she tried to self immolate. Kan Singh, the father-in-law of the victim lodged a case against seven people under Sections 323, 307, 143, 427, 447 of IPC for trying to burn her alive and forcibly removing her from her house. Sangad police reached the spot and started the investigation. The villagers demanded justice for the woman. Kan Singh said that he and his family are doing agriculture work since 40 years in Chodiasar village. He and his relatives have joint land and he has 46 bighas in his account. On Wednesday, the project manager and other people, including Rajendra Singh, Narveer Singh, Umed Singh, Bhawani Singh, Aidan Singh, Ganga Singh, Kanwar Singh and others, of an under-construction solar power project company came and started demolishing his hut and asked his daughter-in-law to come out. She didn't come out and protested, so they sprinkled petrol and set the hut on fire, in which she was seriously burnt. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/woman-suffers-severe-burns-as-solar-firm-staff-sets-hut-on-fire-7-booked/articleshow/82090946.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: International flyers’ count almost touched 1 lakh in March||HYDERABAD: Despite the second wave of Covid-19 setting in, air travel saw an upward movement out of Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, during the first quarter of 2021 (January to March). In fact, the international flyers' count last month -- though still far from pre-Covid times -- almost touched the one lakh mark, show official records. Domestic footfall during this period too remained significantly high, hovering in the 9.9 lakh to 10.5 lakh per day bracket Until October-November 2020, these daily numbers were as low as 25,000 (average). While admitting to a marked improvement in air traffic movement in the first three months of the year, industry sources said that majority of these international bookings comprised students returning for their courses in the US and Canada or professionals travelling to Dubai for work. "These are the destinations that have seen maximum traction. There has also been a decent footfall to places like Maldives for leisure," said Abdul Majid Faheem, chairman, Travel Agents Federation of India (Hyderabad chapter). Domestically too, travellers have been flying in and out of the city both for work and social commitments, sources added. Going forward though, airline operators and agents fear that the numbers might drop drastically, with Covid-19 numbers spiralling out of control. "During the first three months of the year, we had recovered to at least 70% to 80% of our pre-Covid business. But now, bookings are plummeting again. We are witnessing cancellations and have started offering waivers (it allows passengers to book for a later date) to passengers. That’s not a healthy sign. We fear our April numbers going to be very poor," said an official from an airline firm. Agents too said that the holiday season – it usually begins by the end of April – is looking bleak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/international-flyers-count-almost-touched-1l-in-march/articleshow/82090961.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Police said the arrest of the person would depend on the statements of the survivor, which will be recorded on Friday before a magistrate. “The girl is admitted to hospital for treatment of her injuries. She had narrated her ordeal to an NGO and accused her father of raping her for two years and also named a person. But we are yet to verify this allegation and would proceed after recording her statements,” Luni SHO Permeshwari.The girl was taken to hospital in an injured condition after her father beat her and nit her nose on Wednesday. She alleged that her father had been raping her for the last two years since she was 13 years and beat her constantly all these years. The girl’s mother had left her long ago after her father suspected her character. Since then, she had been living with her father and her grandparents. But considering the girl not to be his biological daughter, he treated her inhumanly. Interestingly, the girl who preferred to remain silent and termed her injuries caused by beating only, opened up about her ordeal only after an NGO came to see her in the hospital. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-arrest-man-for-raping-daughter/articleshow/82090997.cms||---
---||Kolkata||After election duty, parties ask workers to guard EVMs||Kolkata: For about 50 men and women from each of the five Kolkata constituencies where polls have already been held, the routine has been a rigorous one from April 10. It will continue to be so till May 2. They have been asked by their parties to ensure the safety of the EVMs, now stored at six different venues of the city and guarded by no less than five companies of CAPF personnel. The party workers are on this duty from five to eight hours a day. For their fellow workers in the districts, where voting is over, the routine is almost the same. Take the example of Raja Sen from Behala. “Each councillor was tasked with choosing five to six persons who were willing to keep an eye on the EVMs for the next three weeks. As I have the experience from Lok Sabha polls, I was chosen. There are six persons — working in shifts, one person per candidate — who have access to the same floor or area where the EVMs are stored at the Vivekananda College. Each one of them stays inside between five and six hours before another joins duty. They have all got the requisite permission from the returning officer. Each party is allowed up to five representatives,” said the Trinamool worker. TMC sources said everything has been planned with clockwork precision. Sen has also been instructed not to eat Biryani “from strangers”. “We will also not share tea with people whom we do not know. Didi has asked us to bring homemade food for a month with Covid cases surging again,” said Sen. At the districts, too, the process remains the same. “We are here at the Diamond Harbour Womens’ University from April 6. The EVM rooms are well guarded,” said Md Shamim of Diamond Harbour constituency. The BJP, though, says it has faith in central forces. “We are putting up camps only in a few constituencies where we believe TMC can foment trouble. But we have trained at least six persons per assembly who are staying inside counting centres, where designated party representatives are allowed, on a rotation basis,” said Shyamal Basu, party working president of a seat where polling is over. The CPM is banking on its local supporters to maintain round-the-clock vigil. “Being an organized party, we have set up camps locally. The local leadership is arranging for people to keep an eye on EVMs,” said Ratna Dutta, the party state committee member. Gourab Basu, a CPM woker from Behala, said that their party workers were present near strong rooms in three shifts — each lasting for six to ten hours — daily.

---||Hyderabad||Kidney patients seek inclusion in vaccine priority list||Hyderabad: Patients suffering from chronic kidney disease are demanding that they be included in the vaccination beneficiaries’ list, as they are more prone to the Covid-19 virus. Many visit hospitals twice a week, apart from frequent visits for check ups. Telangana has nearly 15,000 patients on dialysis, around 5,000 kidney transplant patients and nearly 60,000 patients who are in various stages of kidney disease but not yet on dialysis. “Vaccine is not being given to us because of the ‘above 45 year’ age criteria. The government should allow us to get vaccinated based on a doctor’s prescription. We have already had over 25 kidney patients succumb to Covid-19 during the last couple of months,” said Bhagavan Reddy Dakoori, chief executive officer, Cheyutha foundation, which works for kidney patients. Getting infected with Covid-19 would be an additional burden on kidney patients who often struggle financially. “As soon as a person faces kidney disease, they lose their savings and earnings go down. Many become unemployed due to the constant requirement of leaves. While few states have made a provision of monthly pension for kidney patients, our state has not done anything so far. We should be considered for pensions. This pandemic has doubly hit us,” said a patient, who lost his part-time job during the pandemic. While Telangana government helps by providing medicines worth Rs 9,500, it only covers 50% of the cost, say patients. “Patients have to take it (medicines) in Hyderabad which is far for many. We request medicines to be issued at district area hospitals and medical colleges wherever available,” added Dakoori.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kidney-patients-seek-inclusion-in-vaccine-priority-list/articleshow/82091018.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Chandigarh||‘UK variant confirmed in 70% samples sent by PGI’||Chandigarh: The UK variant was confirmed in 70% of the samples sent to the National Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) by PGIMER, said the institute’s director on Thursday. Dr Jagat Ram said the high transmission rate of the UK variant leaves no room for any compromise with Covid-appropriate behaviour. With Covid-19 cases surging at a much higher rate in the second wave than the first, it was being assumed that the UK variant could be responsible for this. And this has been proved by the latest findings of the PGIMER samples sent to NCDC. “The PGI’s department of virology had sent 60 positive samples to the NCDC, New Delhi, last month. It was found that 70% had UK variant and 20% had 681 H mutant of the virus. One sample was found to have double mutation. Majority of the samples were from Chandigarh,” said Dr Jagat Ram.Issuing a note of caution, Dr Jagat Ram said, “Considering the high transmission of Covid-19 by the UK variant, it is suggested that everyone should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour by wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and frequent use of sanitiser and hand washing. Avoid crowded places and non-essential travel.” Stressing the need for vaccination, he said, “The priority groups of the population should get vaccinated to protect against this disease and reduce its intensity. It will also help in breaking the transmission chain.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/uk-variant-confirmed-in-70-samples-sent-by-pgi/articleshow/82089984.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Inferior quality masks flood Hyderabad's Begum Bazar, traders ignorant||HYDERABAD: A trader at Begum Bazar, Harish Dewasi, who used to sell stationery goods for over a decade, is now selling masks after a slowdown in business. “After schools were shut, my stationery business collapsed completely. I have to pay Rs 20,000 rent per month for the shop so I decided to start selling masks, as there is a huge demand for them,” said Dewasi, admitting he did not know much about quality. “The hand sewn masks sold by me will surely protect against the virus,” said the 40-year-old nevertheless. Like him, several traders in the city have entered the mask trade with no idea about norms that need to be followed. Experts say many of these masks do not meet basic standards including quality of fabric, stitching requirements, sterile packaging, certification and branding with the manufacturers’ name. Several traders in fact agree that they have just used the window of opportunity to meet their financial needs. Satish Bhatia, who used to sell apparel, has now switched over to the mask business. “Starting price of masks in my shop is Rs 5 and good quality masks sell up to Rs 50 per piece. I could not revive my business after the prolonged lockdown, but selling masks has helped manage finances,” he said. He said he was selling masks manufactured with non-woven material, which are safe. Incidentally, even a cobbler at Begum Bazar was spotted selling masks apart from footwear. Hundreds of small-timers are selling masks in Begum Bazar, said to be the largest commercial marketing hub in Telangana. Over 90% of the masks do not have layers and use common fabric, even sarees, bedsheets, as per traders. “For manufacturers, Begum Bazar is like a goose that lays the golden eggs, if they can supply masks within 24 hours,” a trader, doing spice business at Begum Bazar, told TOI. Customers at the market said lower costs were a huge draw for masks available on the streets. Lokesh Reddy, a customer who came to Begum Bazar to buy masks for his family, said, “I cannot afford buying N95 masks, so, I prefer these masks.” While the state government is imposing a penalty of Rs 1,000 for not wearing a mask, there is no mechanism to control sale of inferior quality masks, complained, home-maker, Latha, who was also spotted at the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/inferior-quality-masks-flood-begum-bazar-traders-ignorant/articleshow/82091054.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Kolkata||West Bengal assembly elections 2021: Local issues hold the key to battle for Panihati||KOLKATA: In Panihati, Nirmal Ghosh, the Trinamool candidate, is easily the most heavyweight leader. He is the outgoing chief whip of Trinamool Congress, a four-time MLA and one who virtually has the last word in the Panihati municipality. Ahead of the declaration of elections, four councillors switched allegiance from the TMC, claiming Ghosh was turning the area into a family show. The factionalism has, for now, been swept under the carpet but occasional fissures are still visible. Add to it the fact that the BJP — like in other parts of North 24 Parganas — has grown exponentially here. From a mere 3700 votes managed in 2016, it polled more than 64,000 votes in the Lok Sabha elections. The TMC here led by a little more than 9700 votes. There are a host of issues that locals say need immediate attention. “But perhaps nothing needs more attention than the drainage facility. Even the Panihati state general hospital needs improvement,” claimed Debasish Dutta, an LIC agent. However, Ghosh is confident of a fifth win. “I stay with my voters throughout the year. Whether it’s road, street light or drinking water, I’ve completed several projects. Locals know whom to trust,” he said. The BJP has put its bet on Sanmoy Banerjee, the same candidate whom Ghosh had defeated while he was in Congress five years back. “The bad conditions of roads and sewerage system are the priority issues. I also raise my voice against extortion and syndicates. If I win, I will fight to bring transparency in administration”, Banerjee said. The Sanjukta Morcha candidate, Tapas Majumdar, is not a pushover either. “The TMC’s development has been lopsided. The BJP candidate was in the Congress before betraying us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/local-issues-hold-the-key-to-battle-for-panihati/articleshow/82091082.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

The 50-year-old woman, a vegetable seller from Jammikunta, succumbed at the isolation centre after Jammikunta municipal authorities admitted her there. She was forced to sleep outside her rented house at Ambedkar Colony in Jammikunta as the house owner allegedly did not allow her into the house after she tested positive on April 8. Also, there was no separate toilet for the tenants. The aggrieved woman then went to the Jammikunta fruit market but was asked to leave the place by the organisers there. Jammikunta municipal commissioner Anisur Rasheed told TOI that the woman was found sleeping on a vegetable cart under a bridge. When locals asked her, she said she had fever. Rasheed said the woman was shifted in an ambulance to the isolation centre at the instance of municipal chairman Rajeshwar Rao. Officials said the family did not show any concern for her. While her husband was indifferent, her two sons feared they too would get infected. With her family not taking her to the hospital, her condition deteriorated, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shun-by-kin-covid-ve-woman-dies/articleshow/82091077.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Those not coming forward should be named and shamed. In other states people are waiting in long queues to get jabbed, while our facilities are underutilised,” said the adviser. Parida also urged different associations and societies to come up with a list of 100 eligible persons so that the administration could organise special camps for them. “Any group, association or society can approach us with a list of 100 eligible persons and we will arrange a special camp near their place. Also, our ambulance will pick up old and disabled eligible persons for vaccination if they register with us,” he added. He said, “The RWAs should encourage people in their localities as the drive can be successful only with the support of the public.” ‘First name, shame your officers’ “The UT administration should first name and shame their officers, including IAS, IPS, PCS and HCS officials, doctors, engineers and others, who have not taken Covid vaccine. The administration should display names of officials who have taken vaccination and also of those who have not on their official website,” said Pooja, a resident of Sector 45. “There is no coordination between different departments of the UT administration. People are forced to make rounds of hospitals to collect their reports and even telephone numbers released by the administration for Covid positive patients under home isolation are of no use. UT should first focus on getting things in order,” said Rajender Pandey, a resident of Sector 44.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/name-and-shame-those-not-getting-jabbed-says-parida/articleshow/82090023.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

It has also shut its general OPD, all specialty clinics, and operation theatre from Thursday to ‘prevent spread of Covid-19 infection from the hospital’, according to a circular issued on Wednesday by the chief medical superintendent (CMS). The circular states emergency facilities such as Covid-19 and flu clinic, casualty, emergency, and train calls will be attended round-the-clock. Periodic medical examination (PME) will be conducted for limited employees as per the schedule while maintaining strict Covid-19 protocol. There will be restricted indoor admission for serious non-Covid patients who will be taken in for a transit period before being shifted to another tie-up hospital or in any state government hospital as railway hospital has not been designated a dedicated Covid hospital by the NMC, the circular added. The hospital has also started a Covid helpline and has made alternative arrangement for general OPD at Ajni health unit from April 19. On Thursday, the Central Railway also started constructing a dedicated entry to the hospital from Mohan Nagar side which could be in preparation to turn it into a full fledged Covid hospital. Central Railway spokesperson & DCM Vipul Suskar said, “We are still in talks with NMC to allow railway hospital to treat Covid patients fully. We are operating flu OPD and have shifted other services to Ajni as a preventive step.” However, National Railway Mazdoor Union (NRMU) working president Habib Khan slammed the delay. “We agree that if railway hospital is dedicated for Covid patients there will be problems as there are two DRM offices and control rooms in the same campus, but the issue can be solved by barricading these areas,” he said. “It is a war-like situation. Central Railway has the guns but is not fighting the enemy. Patients, including railway employees, are dying on the streets. We cannot sit quietly when we have ventilators and O2 beds. At present, hospital is only giving O2 support to Covid patients,” Khan said. “When the railway is asking its employees to join duties, it is also its responsibility to give treatment to them. If you are unable to treat employees turning positive, do you have the moral right to ask them to work. Beds are not available even after DRM/ADRMs intervention,” said Debashish Bhattacharya, NRMU divisional president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/crly-hospital-to-provide-transit-support-to-covid-patients/articleshow/82091209.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The reason being mass manufacturing of low quality masks that are being provided at cheaper rates by others. The state has 1.72 lakh registered women self-help groups (SHGs), but a mere 1,400 SHGs are involved in stitching of cloth-made masks. In spite of a huge demand for masks many SHG groups said they would not be making masks this time around. Making the most of the situation, some manufacturers are producing poor quality masks. Mission for Elimination of Poverty in Municipal Areas (MEPMA), Secunderabad Cantonment Board in-charge, Prakash said, “In SCB, there are 1,800 SHGs and they stitched over 50,000 masks during the first wave, but this year, they are not involved. Masks are now available everywhere at cheaper rates.” State mission coordinator, MEPMA, Telangana, G Padma, she said, “in the first spell of Covid-19 pandemic, women SHGs produced 26 lakh sewn masks.” Speaking about the high standards mantained, she said, “We are following all specifications such as GSM and quality norms while stitching masks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shgs-shy-away-from-making-masks/articleshow/82091146.cms||---

Five persons have been arrested, while seven, including three women, are at large. The women were hired by the gang to befriend people on social media platforms and later make them invest money. The thugs posed as employees of a life insurance company and made people believe and invest in fraud schemes in hope of profitable returns. Three of the gang members had worked for big insurance companies and hence had access to the data of defaulting customers and also, they knew the work culture. It was hence not difficult for them to dupe innocent customers. The police succeeded in exposing the cyber fraud gang, while investigating on a complaint by Yogesh Roat who had transferred Rs 43.37 lakh to the gang. Dungarpur SP Sudhir Joshi said Yogesh had called at a customer care number to enquire and close his insurance policy of Rs 2 lakh. The executive gave him a mobile number and asked him to communicate with the senior. When Yogesh spoke to the person at the given number, the man offered a plan, requiring investment of Rs 40 lakh and getting Rs 70 lakh in return. Yogesh, through various transactions, transferred Rs 43.37 lakh on the given number and when he called for the return, the mobile number was discarded.

The gang is told to have duped many people in the four states, including Bharatpur, Dholpur, Ajmer, Bhilwara, Sawai Madhopur, Jhunjhunu, Pali and Dungarpur districts in Rajasthan. They had made a fake courier company registered at Maharashtra and had a bank account in the name of GMS courier. The people who fell in their net transferred money to the account, which the accused men distributed among themselves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gang-that-made-rs-2-5cr-through-ponzi-schemes-busted-5-arrested/articleshow/82091133.cms||---

---||Udaipur||Gang that made Rs 2.5 crore through ponzi schemes busted, 5 arrested in Rajasthan||UDAIPUR: Dungarpur police on Wednesday busted an inter-state gang of criminals who had made Rs 2.5 crore by duping people from Rajasthan, UP, Delhi and Maharashtra through different ponzi schemes. Five persons have been arrested, while seven, including three women, are at large. The women were hired by the gang to befriend people on social media platforms and later make them invest money. The thugs posed as employees of a life insurance company and made people believe and invest in fraud schemes in hope of profitable returns. Three of the gang members had worked for big insurance companies and hence had access to the data of defaulting customers and also, they knew the work culture. It was hence not difficult for them to dupe innocent customers. The police succeeded in exposing the cyber fraud gang, while investigating on a complaint by Yogesh Roat who had transferred Rs 43.37 lakh to the gang.

---||Jaipur||Phalodi jailbreak: Two more inmates held, 13 still at large||JODHPUR/JAISALMER: Police have arrested two more prisoners on Thursday from two different places in Jodhpur and Jaisalmer who had fled from Phalodi jail with 14 other inmates on the night of April 5. Before this, police had arrested one prisoner from Bikaner while 13 continue to be out of the police net yet. Those arrested on Thursday have been identified as Rajkumar Bishnoi, an accused under NDPS Act, and Shaukat Ali, a murder accused. Police arrested one Amre Khan for providing shelter to Shaukat Ali who was caught from canal area in Mohangarh under Jaisalmer close to India-Pakistan border. He was about to cross over to Pakistan. SP (Jodhpur Rural) Anil Kayal said that both of them were arrested after an untiring chase of three days by many police teams following intelligence input about their whereabouts. “These prisoners had been constantly changing their locations covering Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Bikaner in vast stretches of desert. Our teams continue to trace their locations and chase them day and night for three days straight,” said Kayal. Before this, one inmate Mohan Ram Bishnoi had been arrested by Bikaner police from Bajju area where he had been hiding at the farm of his brother for three days. Police had to chase him for over a kilometre in desert sand to catch him at night. It may be noted that police have also arrested Manish Bishnoi who was instrumental in staging this escape and had coordinated with the inmates in jail through phone. He was present with two vehicles near the jail and had dropped all the 16 inmates at different places after picking them up from jail the same night. According to the investigation so far, it has been learnt that the prisoners awaiting bail had planned the escape assuming the difficulty in getting bail on account of corona pandemic. Some of these prisoners had mobile phones with them and the plan had been finalised by three prisoners, including Shaukat Ali, caught by police on Thursday. In the interrogation, Mohan Ram disclosed that all the 16 prisoners had full idea about what and how to be done for escape. They rushed out of the unlocked gate of the jail without any resistance from the jail guards and headed straight in the direction where two vehicles had been waiting for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/phalodi-jailbreak-two-more-inmates-held-13-still-at-large/articleshow/82091172.cms||Ajay Parmar
---||Ahmedabad||Once loss-making, GSPC group makes its mark||Ahmedabad: In a year when the economy faced serious downturns due to Covid-19 pandemic, Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) group has emerged as a leader in the natural gas value chain. The group has, over the years, moved away from its core business activities of hydrocarbon exploration and production activity after it faced huge financial losses in the past. GSPC, the flagship company of GSPC group, caters to about 32-33% of natural gas demand in Gujarat. The company has been able to increase its gas marketing outreach from 17 million metric standard cubic meters per day (MMSCMD) in 2019-20 to 19 MMSCMD in 2020-21. The transformation of GSPC from an E&P to gas trading company started about four years ago after the company exited its KG Basin block that was sold to ONGC few years ago. Slowly but surely, it started exiting the hydrocarbon blocks and is currently left with only a handful of oil and gas producing assets. The loss-making company that was pulled up by CAG time and again in the past, earned an operating profit of Rs 1,183 crore for 2020-21. The turnover of GSPC in FY 2020 was Rs 15,348 crore, whereas the estimated turnover in FY 2021 is Rs 13,200 crore, said a government official in the know of the matter. “The EBITDA of GSPC in FY 2020 was Rs. 1,681 crore whereas estimated EBITDA for FY 2021 is expected to be around Rs 1,300 crore. This is despite the Covid lockdowns and related impact on gas consumption, especially the low pricing,” he added. The GSPC group, promoted by the Gujarat government, has a strong presence across the entire natural gas value chain through its 12 companies and institutions under umbrella. The flagship company GSPC supplies cleaner fuel to bulk users such as power, fertilizer and large industries as well as a large base of retail customers through City Gas Distribution (CGD) networks. The top line of GSPC increased at 20% CAGR from Rs 10,590 crore in FY18 to Rs 15,123 crore in FY20. The profit after tax registered a whopping CAGR of 179% and stood at Rs 2,742 Crore in FY20. For nine months period ended on December 31, 2020, the company clocked profit after tax at Rs 555 crore, up by 20% year-on-year basis.GSPC LNG Limited (GLL) had last year commissioned a 5 million tonnes per annum LNG receiving, storage, and regasification terminal at Mundra.While GSPC harnesses and procures natural gas, Gujarat State Petronet Limited (GSPL) builds infrastructure that transmits gas. GSPL has already put in place a pipeline network of about 2,696 km, covering 25 districts in Gujarat. It is developing cross-country pipeline projects of over 4,800 km covering 9 states through its two subsidiaries, GSPL India Gasnet Ltd and GSPL India Transco Ltd.Another GSPC group company, Gujarat Gas Limited (GGL), is India’s largest city gas distribution company with presence in states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana. The market capitalization of GSPL and GGL, the two listed entities of GSPC group, is about Rs 50,000 crore. The robust business growth of these two companies have seen their share prices surging for over a year now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/once-loss-making-gspc-group-makes-its-mark/articleshow/82085058.cms||Maulik Pathak

A huge rush was observed outside the Shiv bhojan thali centres in the district on the first day of the 15 days of stringent restriction. Most beneficiaries are the poor workers and some students stuck in the city but their mess has been shut. As per the directions of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the meal which used to cost just Rs 5 per plate is being distributed free of cost for the coming month. The meal is served between 11 pm and 1pm every day. Sudhakar Jagdale, a driver, said, “My work has stopped due to the stricter restrictions. Earlier, I used to eat one time at the centre and for dinner, I ate at a roadside eatery. The government can charge for thali, but it should ask centres to serve the meal twice a day.” Every centre is given a specified quota of thalis. For instance, the centre in front of the Central Administrative Building of Kasba Bawda has a quota of 150 thalis for which the operator gets the remuneration. Now, the operators are planning to provide chargeable thalis for additional beneficiaries arriving at the centres. Yogesh Salokhe, the operator of the centre said, “For those who are left out after the fixed quota of a free meal, I have started to serve the same meal at a low cost.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/serve-shiv-bhojan-thali-twice-a-day/articleshow/82089318.cms||---

In June 2020, Thackeray had announced assistance of Rs 4,000 per family under the Khavti grant scheme under which Rs 2,000 was to be transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries, and essential items, like wheat, rice and dry pulses, worth Rs 2,000 was to be provided to them. Admitting that the scheme was not implemented last year due to financial crunch and administrative reasons, tribal development minister K C Padavi told TOI: “...this time the process to provide relief to tribals has already started.” Of the nearly 1.1 crore tribal population in the state, 45-50 lakh are eligible for the assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-revives-relief-package-to-help-tribals/articleshow/82092275.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

According to police, Jafru Khan had kidnapped the girl from her house and took her into a room inside the mosque. “Khan had also attempted to push the girl into the well. The girl, however, managed to escape and later informed her parents about the incident that had taken place on April 1,” Bhiwadi DSP Hari Ram Kumawat said on Thursday. The accused had thrashed the girl and asked her to keep mum saying if she opened her mouth, she will have to face dire consequences. “The incident came to light when the rape survivor’s mother called up her husband stating the girl went missing on April 1 and did not come home till the evening. Later, they went to the mosque where the girl was crying for help following which Khan fled from the scene,” the officer added. Police after registering an FIR lodged a case under appropriate sections of IPC and POCSO Act. “Finally, we managed to arrest the accused on Wednesday. We are now aiming at filing an early chargesheet for speedy justice,” the officer added. Along with the accused, police also arrested the brother-in-law of the accused for harbouring Khan. “He was arrested from Gaondi village of Bharatpur on Wednesday,” the officer said.

The personnel were largely deployed for security and crowd management. Director General of Police (DGP) Ashok Kumar said, "A major part of the Kumbh Mela had been completed with the Baisakhi shahi snan on April 14. Hence, 50% of the total force deployed there has been withdrawn." About 15,000 police personnel, including paramilitary forces, and over 5,000 volunteers were deployed in Haridwar to tackle the massive rush during the third shahi snan. The force strength is being reduced since not much crowd is expected in the remaining days of Kumbh Mela, the DGP added. The next shahi snan is scheduled on April 27 and the mela will end on April 30, according to the official notification. Around 14 lakh pilgrims took the holy dip in Ganga in Haridwar Mahakumbh on the occasion of Baisakhi shahi snan, which is the third and most important royal bath of the Mahakumbh. While the first bath was held on March 11 on the occasion of Mahashivratri, the second took place on April 12 in which over 30 lakh devotees took the holy dip, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-third-shahi-snan-police-force-in-kumbh-reduced-by-half/articleshow/82090054.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Due to this, those who teach subjects that cannot be taken online are being deprived of this financial assistance,” said Shabbir Sheikh, president, Telangana Private Teachers Forum (TPTF). Some schools are even refusing to sign form B, which is mandatory to be able to benefit from the scheme, say teachers. “My school is not accepting my form. Saying the quota is full. I really don’t know whom to contact,” tweeted Muhammed Saqlain. The Hyderabad district collector reached out to him. Another teacher, Mrutunjay Rao, said: “Since the school management is giving only Rs 4,000-Rs 6,000 salary, I stopped taking online classes and asked the school management to release the dues. Now, the management has refused to enlist me as a beneficiary.” School managements, however, denied all allegations and put the onus on the government. “Earlier, we were informed that those who have attendance registered till March are eligible for the scheme. Later, the government said that only those who are registered under the unified district information system (UDISE) of education are eligible. The UDISE data is not updated after 2017-18 due to which many teachers are not benefitting from this scheme,” said S Madhusudhan, general secretary, Telangana State Recognised School Managements Association, adding they have represented this matter to government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/missing-from-cash-rice-dole-beneficiaries-list-teachers/articleshow/82091225.cms||Preeti Biswas

Similarly, the new price at Gandhinagar is Rs 7,020, at Dahej Rs 2,240, at Halol Rs 2,110 and at Saykha Rs 2,420.The decision to increase the allotment prices was taken at the 511th board meeting of GIDC on March 30. The revised rates will now apply in all cases of new allotments, transfers, non-utilization penalties and similar charges.The move surprised industry associations and was widely criticised. According to sources, various representations have been made to review the decision due to the grim economic situation. Requests have been made to defer the move by at least one year as this will hamper growth and delay investment decisions.“We have made several representations to GIDC to not increase allotment rates. After the pandemic, industry is barely surviving. The state government has not increased jantri rates so why does GIDC need to increase rates. At least 20 industry associations have made representations about this,” said Ajit Shah, president, Sanand Industries’ Association (SIA).Shah also said that in Sanand, 75% of the land has been allotted of which only 30% has been utilized, where units are operational or construction work is under way. “If the land is not being utilized, what is the point of increasing rates. How will it attract fresh investment?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gidc-raises-plot-allotment-prices-by-15/articleshow/82085025.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi weekend curfew: Public transport only for those in essential services||NEW DELHI: If you are not engaged in essential services and not exempted from night and weekend curfew restrictions imposed in the capital, you will not be allowed to enter a Delhi Metro station or board a Delhi Transport Corporation or Cluster Scheme bus from 10pm on Friday to 5am on Monday. Like the restrictions in place during the night curfew since April 6, public transport such as Delhi Metro, DTC and Cluster Scheme buses, autos and taxis will also be allowed to function during the weekend curfew, but only for the transportation of those in the exempted categories and following Covid safety protocols. A Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) official said the entry to the Metro from 10pm on Friday to 5am on Monday would be allowed only to those passengers engaged in essential services as per the government order, after verification of their valid identity cards by DMRC or Central Industrial Security Force personnel. A DTC spokesperson said buses of the corporation would operate as per the weekend schedule. Sources said passengers who were found not carrying valid IDs proving that they were engaged in essential services would not be allowed to board DTC and Cluster Scheme buses during the weekend by marshals present in these buses and they would ensure that the restrictions were followed. Frequency and number of buses may be decreased if it is found after a review that the footfall has come down. Sources in DMRC said that usually, the footfall was lower during the weekend, particularly on Sundays, compared with morning and evening office hours on weekdays and there shouldn’t be much problem in regulating the passenger traffic and ensuring only those in exempted categories travel by the Metro. Sources in an app-based cab aggregator company said cabs would be available during the weekend but only for essential travel. Drivers said that while they were already reeling under lower demand for cabs since March last year, the weekend curfew would mean there would be negligible passenger traffic for two days in the week. “Almost 75% of our customers are now working from home, which has affected our livelihood. By imposing the weekend curfew, the government has snatched away the opportunity to earn anything for two days in a week,” said Kamaljit Gill, president of Sarvodaya Drivers’ Association of Delhi. “Many drivers are already finding it difficult to pay EMIs of bank loans taken for buying their cabs,” Gill said. Weekend is the time when many people leave for short getaways but the curfew will mean people would avoid venturing out and the business of tour operators will be affected, said Sanjay Samrat, president of the Delhi Taxi, Tourist Transporters Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-weekend-public-transport-only-for-those-in-essential-services/articleshow/82091250.cms||Sidharatha Roy

MIDC is already in talks with the civic body and the district administration to facilitate vaccination of the industrial workers. The state government has released new orders related to breaking the chain of Coronavirus, putting severe restrictions with effect from Wednesday evening. As per the new order, industrial workers must get vaccinated and undergo rapid antigen tests after every 15 days until they are vaccinated. “We have plans for four vaccination centres each in Satpur and Ambad industrial areas. We are in the process of identifying the locations in both the areas,” said Nitin Gavli, the regional officer of MIDC, Nashik. “We are expecting the vaccination centres to start within a week,” he added.According to Nikhil Panchal, the vice-president of Ambad Industries & Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA) said the vaccination is mandatory for only people above 45 years of age. But people from this age group are working in management and human resource departments. “The workforce involved in the manufacturing process are mainly below 45 years of age. Hence, we want the government to allow people from all the age groups, who are working in industries, to get vaccinated,” said Panchal.Meanwhile, around 70% of the industries started operations in both the MIDC estates in the city on Thursday. Moreover, many industries have already been shut for the past few days due to lack of oxygen as the supply has been diverted for medical purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/satpur-ambad-in-nashik-midc-to-have-8-vaccination-sites/articleshow/82089366.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Kolkata||Colleges, universities fear delayed admissions, curtailed semester||Kolkata: CBSE postponing their Class-XII board exams for the pandemic has once again raised the spectre of delayed admissions to undergraduate courses in colleges and universities in the city. Colleges will not only have to postpone their admission schedules but also tweak the academic calendar and cut down on holidays so that they can cover the syllabus within the curtailed semester period. Though CBSE has already postponed its Class XII boards indefinitely, CISCE or the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education are yet to make any announcement. ISC and HS are still supposed to be held from May 4 and June 15 respectively. In the pre-pandemic years till 2019, colleges issued admission forms by the third week of May after Plus-II results were published. Many institutes, such as St Xavier’s College, started the process immediately after ISC and CBSE Class XII results were published, before HS scores were announced. In 2020, the pandemic pushed the schedule back and UG admissions started in August. Some colleges and universities continued the process till January this year. While the first semester usually starts in August, in the last session, it started in the third week of December, as a result of which students got only three months to study six months’ syllabus. At J D Birla Institute, the admission committee will meet next week to decide on the modalities and timeline of UG admissions. “Class-XII results, along with personal interview of candidates, is the only criteria we follow to admit students here. If the exams are delayed, the results, too, will come late,” said principal Deepali Singhee.  Pointing out how delayed admissions left them with very little time, the principal of a south Kolkata college said, “We got only three months to cover the syllabus after UGC instructed us to wrap up the semester by the third week of March. Science students did not have access to labs and libraries were shut for all. Teachers conducted online classes even on Saturdays and other government holidays to make up for lost time. If admissions are delayed this year, the entire cycle will have to be repeated.” Most college principals TOI spoke to said whenever the admissions began, the process would entirely be online even this year, too, due to the pandemic. “We took help of technology a lot. We have strengthened our online admission system and augmented the capacity,” said AsokMukhopadhyay, principal of Seth Anandaram Jaipuria College. Presidency University’s entrance examinations for admission to UG courses are slated for August 7 and 8. “We still have a few months. If required, we might review the schedule after dates for all school-leaving examinations are declared,” said an official. On-campus classes for all colleges and universities have been suspended since March last year and online lessons have been the only mode over the past year. “The way Covid cases are surging again, we are not sure whether we will be able to return to physical classes any time soon,” said another principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-universities-fear-delayed-admissions-curtailed-semester/articleshow/82091255.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pray for Ramzan at home, avoid visiting mosques, advise doctors||MUMBAI: A day after Bombay high court rejected Juma Masjid Bombay Trust’s plea to allow mosques to hold prayers during the holy month of Ramzan, some Muslim doctors have counselled members of the community not to insist on praying at mosques or to hold congregational prayers anywhere else. “During these times where there is a tsunami of new cases, it is important that we pray indoors in our homes. We must avoid mass prayers in our society buildings too as we don’t know who is a carrier or who is the super spreader,” said consultant endocrinologist and diabetologist Dr Altamash Shaikh. He added that prayers are a must, but it is equally important that we maintain distance, use masks and wash and sanitise our hands frequently to save ourselves and other fellow humans. Many said that while the right to follow religious practices is important, the public order and safety of citizens during the Covid-19 surge is of paramount importance too equally. “I would advise my Muslim brethren to avoid going to the mosques for prayers during Ramzan,” said physician and diabetologist Dr Wasim Ghori. He also cited a saying of the Prophet. “It is also part of the sayings of Prophet Mohammad that during medical emergencies and inclement weather, one should not go to the mosque for prayers,” added Dr Ghori. Citing an example of Delhi, where the Delhi high court has allowed 50 people to offer namaz at the Nizamuddin Markaz of the Tablighi Jamaat, some Muslims here want permission to offer namaz in adherence to all guidelines prescribed. However, given the explosion in the number of Covid-19 cases, now even doctors are saying that it is advisable not to offer prayers at the mosques. A couple of a days ago, some Muslims were pressing for the demand to allow at least 50 Muslims to pray at mosques for Ramzan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pray-for-ramzan-at-home-avoid-visiting-mosques-advise-doctors/articleshow/82092334.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Kolkata||Teachers get lessons to become ‘smart’||Kolkata: The rising graph for Covid cases has led schools to surmise that the new academic year will also be online. Most institutes have by now invested in their teachers, training them in online systems and making them “smart” to handle another year of digital teaching. Right from enrolling for digital training to attending webinars on virtual classes, teachers have slogged the entire year and equipped themselves. Many schools have enrolled in programmes run by British Council to train teachers. The CBSE has a tie-up here and many schools affiliated to it are choosing this platform. All DPS schools are also sending their teachers to online teachers’ training courses conducted by DPS Society. “Additionally, we have been sending teachers for seminars on online teaching and workshops by Apple and Webex, US. Some publishers, such as OUP, Pearson Longman and Orient Blackswan, have been conducting workshops on online teaching for our teachers,” said Indrani Chattopadhyay, vice-principal at DPS Ruby Park. At Loreto Entally, teachers from classes I to VIII underwent a three-month training by Diksha (NCERT). Courses initiated by CISCE were also attended by them. “Ashoka University included our teachers in webinars focused on online teaching. Those really helped,” said principal Jessica Gomes Surana. Teachers felt online teaching was a paradigm shift from classroom lessons and it was not enough to be just able to speak on camera or read from books. “To hold a child’s attention, one has to continuously emote and use techniques that will keep surprising them. This comes with training. We made our teachers learn to use digital platforms, like Google Classroom,” said principal of La Martiniere for Girls Rupkatha Sarkar. Some schools fell back on the training given by National Accreditation Board for Education of Teachers. St Augistine’s Day School trained its teachers on this Nabet platform, said principal Richard Gasper. “Some schools have the Cambridge education system simultaneously. For such teachers, training is mandatory.” DPS New Town asked their teachers to attend workshops on Jamboard and Digital Board. Teachers have learnt on Visme, an online design tool to create presentations and graphics, said principal Sonali Sen. “Pear Deck is a perfect add-on tool that improves interactivity and visuals on teacher’s slides.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/teachers-get-lessons-to-become-smart/articleshow/82091297.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Delhi||CM seeks 3,600 more beds at central, civic hospitals||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday that two municipal hospitals, Hindu Rao and Swami Dayanand, should be made fully Covid-19 facilities, which would add 900 beds. To augment the health infrastructure in the city, Delhi government has requested the Centre to increase 2,700 Covid beds in its hospitals. This will take the bed capacity in Delhi to around 20,000, the chief minister said after a review meeting.Delhi is expected to get 18,000 Remdesivir injections by April 18 to overcome shortage. Health officials said the vaccine stock would last the next six-seven days.Regarding delay in test results, Kejriwal said the sample size must be reduced to enable laboratories hand over reports in 24 hours. Referring to an asymptomatic patient creating a ruckus on being refused admission to a hospital, the chief minister said an order should be issued to allow directing such patients to Covid Care Centres so that they felt safe and in the care of doctors. Delhi government has written to the Centre to consider journalists as frontline workers who need to be vaccinated.

---||Mumbai||Informal sector worst hit in Mumbai by exodus of workers||MUMBAI: Dharavi has been spared the Covid-19 scourge in the second round, but its labourers working in the 15,000 one-room factories have started moving out. Leather and textile units are shutting down, while pottery has no takers. “Leather is not an essential item so we cannot sell. Most of the workers are from the Muslim community and have preferred to go home for Ramzan. Only those factories that already have orders are operational. We foresee a longer lockdown,” said Chandrakant Pote, who runs a showroom in Dharavi. Bhaskar Shetty, who is actively associated with Kumbharwada, said while the workers are local, there is no demand and transport for their goods. “Hotels would buy pots used for serving food, but now there are no orders. Transportation is a huge issue,” he said. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant civic commissioner, G/North ward, said around 30% of workshops have shut and labourers started leaving before the weekend lockdown when textile units closed. “Generally there is huge demand for clothes during Ramzan, but not so this time. The exodus, however, is not as much as last year,” he said. Electricians, carpenters, plumbers, masons, tailors, gardeners, all in the informal sector, are daily wage earners and are finding it difficult to continue to stay on in the city and have preferred to go back home. “Many of those leaving live here alone. Those with families have not moved so far,” said Balraj Dharmagiddha, a local social worker in Dharavi. For Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), increase in material cost and a cash crunch are two immediate worries even as the first day of lockdown-like curbs went off without any major crisis across the state. K Nandakumar, chairman MSME (western region), Confederation of Indian Industry, said the government this time has shown more consideration and trust. “What is essential for essential is essential. This clause in the state notification has helped. A parent company (classified as essential) now needs to certify a certain item is essential for its operation. The government has framed broad guidelines for companies to operate during the lockdown,” he said. Nandkumar estimated at least 50% of the manufacturing sector is operational. “Of the 64 million MSMEs, 99% are micro and they cater to large industries in a 1-5 km periphery. Travelling is not an issue as company ID is sufficient. The government has even done away with travel passes,” he said. He said all manufacturing units and large industries will see a material increase in cost as well as a cash crunch as units need to provide accommodation for workers. “Last year was bad. Now there will be some disruption of the supply chain as it is not just transport but loading and unloading of goods and raw materials which involves people and there may not be enough personnel. Besides, one Covid- positive person can lead to a unit being shut,” he said. Nandkumar said the state must ask the Centre and RBI to allow banks to let every functional industry draw 10% extra of the total loan. R Srinivasan, CEO, TTC-MIDC Industries Association, said the only issue is carrying out Covid tests for workers. “We have sought permission for tests to be conducted on campus,” he said. Eknath Sonawane, member, Thane Small Scale Industries Association, said there was no problem right now as supply was regular. P Anbalagan, CEO MIDC, said 60% of units are operational and labour is not an issue this time. “Electricity consumption will help determine how many units are operational,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/informal-sector-worst-hit-in-mumbai-by-exodus-of-workers/articleshow/82092338.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Ahmedabad||Heart repaired with minimal incision||Ahmedabad: Kanhaiya Lal Suthar, a resident of Jodhpur, would run out of breath with the smallest of exertions. As the owner of a truck and bus body making unit, Suthar had to work with heavy machinery daily. He is the sole earning member of a family of eight. “During consultation, we got to know about his specific requirements of minimal time for recovery in addition to aesthetics,” said Dr Anil Jain, a city-based cardiac surgeon and director of EPIC Hospital. “We thus planned a surgery which is minimally invasive.” Dr Jain said that while the surgery is not rare, it has been limited in Gujarat so far. The method employed by Dr Jain and his team involved an incision of 3cm on Suthar’s right side of the chest along with the insertion of the aortic valve from his groin. “The conventional method requires opening up of the ribcage which takes up to 12 weeks to heal. It’s not advisable for elderly patients who have relatively weaker bones,” said Dr Jain. He said that Suthar did not favour the method. The other option he had was of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), another less invasive surgery. But the experts said that given the merits of this specific case, they opted for the minimal incision method. Moreover, TAVI is five to seven times more expensive than the minimal incision method, they added. Suthar’s heart after the surgery has shown a good response to the new valve, said Dr Jain. “In the Indian situation, it could be a good option for surgeons,” he said. “It not only reduces the scars of a surgery — a major worry among women — but can also be efficient and economical.” But it’s not for all, Dr Jain said. “The use of such a procedure is based on the patient’s history, specific requirements, and the type of the valve,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/heart-repaired-with-minimal-incision/articleshow/82085094.cms||---

The cause of his death is yet to be confirmed. Prem Singh, a resident of Chandigarh, was an MTech student at the department of earthquake engineering. According to the reports, he was quarantined on April 11 as he had come in contact with other Covid-positive students of the institute. On Wednesday, the officials found him unconscious and was first rushed to the institute’s hospital, and later, to a local civil hospital where he was declared dead. According to Sonika Srivastava, IIT-Roorkee media cell in-charge, “The student was not Covid-positive as his RT-PCR report was negative.” The family of the deceased student had requested the district administration for his body without any post-mortem examination. “The victim had been brought dead to our hospital on Wednesday. We have handed over the body to family of the deceased without any autopsy examination acting on the direction of the DM," said Dr Sanjay Kansal, chief medical superintendent of Roorkee Civil Hospital. Meanwhile, Haridwar — which recorded the highest number (613) of Covid-19 cases in the last four days — reported more than two dozen positive cases from IIT-Roorkee. “Out of 613 cases from different areas of Roorkee, 42 cases were reported from IIT-Roorkee, which takes the overall tally of cases at IIT-Roorkee to 235,” said SK Jha, Haridwar CMO.

---||Kolkata||‘Entrance tests may turn vital for Class-XI admission to new school’||Kolkata: As CBSE is yet to decide how Class-X scores would be drawn up in the absence of a board exam, school principals assume the pre-boards marks and assessments throughout the online academic year will be considered. It might not be an immediate worry for students who have already got admission to Class-XI in their schools, but those planning to change institutes for Plus-II level are apprehensive about the marks that will be calculated and whether Class-IX results will also be taken into account or not. Students planning to switch schools feel they might have to depend on the results of admission tests that will possibly be held by the said institutes as board results will not be there to refer to. “Most students who change school at this stage come from either the state board or CISCE. They wish to study the Plus-II CBSE course to prepare for competitive exams. In the absence of the board results, admission tests at this level will assume a greater significance,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal of Asian International School. Students also fear lack of uniformity as some schools had held offline pre-board exams, while many were forced to shift to online. “Naturally, marks of those who took the pre-boards in the online mode were better. Our school has been very strict and conducted only physical pre-board exams. So, how will this inequality be factored in?” said a Heritage School student. Some other schools that held offline pre-boards were Birla High School, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy and Asian International School. Some institutes have decided to add one-on-one interactions with students seeking new admissions. “Often many seeking new admissions are doing so within the same board because they have been denied a particular stream in their own school. So apart from an admission test, a face-to-face interaction makes it clear whether the child is ready for that stream or not,” said Seema Sapru, principal of The Heritage School. Most students feared those who had hoped to score high might suffer. “Admission tests and interviews are alright, but admissions are provisional and board marks are factored in. The law of averages always helps the average student, isn’t it?” said Tirthankar Sarkar, a parent. But schools are happy they completed pre-boards and projects and uploaded internal assessment marks on CBSE portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/entrance-tests-may-turn-vital-for-class-xi-admission-to-new-school/articleshow/82091355.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Delhi||Delivered for eateries in Delhi: Yet another blow||NEW DELHI: Thursday’s announcement of weekend shutdowns in the city to control the spread of Covid-19 wasn’t savoured by the hospitality industry. Already dismayed by the dine-in restrictions, restaurateurs said even the most robust pre-Covid days, delivery constituted just 20% of the business. Now, many of them appear to think staying shut would be better than running up daily losses. Zorawar Kalra of Massive Restaurants was quite certain delivery couldn’t sustain an eatery. While the new measures, he admitted, are sorely needed, these will threaten the survival of the industry. Amit Bagga, co-founder, Daryaganj restaurant, added that by allowing only delivery and takeaway, the state government was reducing restaurant operations to a mere 15% of normal business. Bagga said the only way restaurants could survive with such a reduced capacity would be if they were permitted to deliver round the clock. But, he pointed out, food outlets were not allowed to deliver beyond the 10pm deadline and the applications for e-passes for delivery staff were being turned down. Owners like Deepak Tandon of Wok in the Clouds, who run multiple outlets, are contemplating delivery operations from a single kitchen rather than keeping all units functioning in order to cut costs. Tandon said takeaway and delivery cannot cover the daily cost of keeping an outlet running. From seeing a recovery in the first quarter of 2021 and considering expansion and staff hiring, the world changed in a week, muttered Tandon. This was also a buzzing time of the year for Aivaz Asif of Karim’s Jama Masjid, his outlet being the busiest at night throughout the month of Ramzan. Having seen and dealt with several unprecedented changes, Asif resignedly began the rolling out of iftaar and dinner deliveries. “We have no choice but to adapt to any overnight change in the s ituation overnight,” he shrugged. However, Vanshika Wadhwa of Fio and Fio Pop was optimistic that delivery and takeaway would do much better than last year because people have now got used to ordering from what were once dine-in places. While her delivery numbers are encouraging, Wadhwa said this could not compensate for dine-in revenues, but would perhaps allow people to tide over the current crisis. “The order to close down has come from the government, so it is time to support each other in the industry and somehow hope to survive,” said Wadhwa. “There is no certainty about when all this will end. The authorities and space owners will have to support the restaurants.” Many chains, such as Impresario Entertainment and Hospitality, are now urging diners to order directly from the restaurants rather than through the aggregator apps to save them the commission payable on each order. “Unfortunately, this brings us to square one; the same place we were standing aimlessly a year ago at the peak of the pandemic. Once again, our restaurants are relegated to being delivery kitchens, a sense of pessimism has replaced our short-lived optimism and we are back at fighting for our mere survival,” laments Anurag Katriar, president of NRAI.

---||Dehradun||At Kumbh, Muslim saint who holds forth on Upanishads, Gita a big draw||HARIDWAR: With a U-shaped sandalwood paste tilak on his forehead, the traditional mark of a Vaishnavite seer, ochre-coloured shirt and sitting in front of a dhuni, Sri M seems like many of the other seers who have set up camp at the Bairagi Camp area of the Maha Kumbh. As he holds a discourse on the teachings of the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, it comes as a revelation to know that Sri M was born Mumtaz Ali Khan in a Muslim family of Kerala. At the Kumbh, he has set up his own akhada, Yoga Dham, where there are daily discourses from scriptures, sadhu seva (service to seers) and chanting of bhajans. "God is known by different names — Allah, Christ, Krishna and so many others. Despite different names, God is one and the same. Once we have this knowledge, we see that everyone is seeking the same thing," he says, eyes crinkling into a smile. Awarded the Padma Bhushan last year for his philanthropic and spiritual work -- his organisation Satsang Foundation runs schools and clinics for the underprivileged at Madanapalle in Andhra Pradesh-- the seer's story is interesting. Born into a prosperous Muslim family in Thiruvananthapuram, he says he was drawn to the yogic way of life since childhood. At the age of 19, he ran off from home to go to the Himalayas in search of a guru, walking all the way from Rishikesh to Badrinath, a distance of around 300 km, dressed as a wandering sadhu. Eventually after a number of adventures which he has detailed in his book 'Apprenticed to a Himalayan Master', he met his guru, a Himalayan yogi, in a cave beyond Badrinath and was initiated into the ancient Nath sampradaya (to which UP CM Yogi Adityanath also belongs). He travelled in the Himalayas with his guru for over three years during which he says his guru initiated him into the ancient scriptural teachings. He now gives talks on yoga sutras, Upanishads and other Vedanta texts combining textual knowledge with the experiences of his wanderings with his guru. At the Kumbh, despite the Covid scare, a sizeable number of people had gathered to hear his discourses. "It is rare to find a self-realised spiritual teacher who can talk about ancient wisdom in a way that you can instantly relate to it," said Amit Kharmate, an entrepreneur from Kolhapur. Many of the seer's followers are devout Hindus -- a large sprinkling of them from west and south India-- and for them, the fact that he was born a Muslim has never been a point of concern. "Even Kabir was born a Muslim but had disciples cutting across religions," said Mahender Borana, a follower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/at-kumbh-muslim-saint-who-holds-forth-on-upanishads-gita-a-big-draw/articleshow/82090115.cms||Atul Sethi

The trade and industrial body has intervened so that oxygen can be made available to patients who need it at home and at Covid care facilities. Office bearers said that the idea behind the initiative is to make the cylinders available to the oxygen suppliers in the region as the demand for oxygen has increased exponentially. “The industrial oxygen is not helpful for Covid patients and since the supply for industrial usage has also been reduced, industries would be having empty cylinders with them which can be used to supply medical oxygen for patients at home or at Covid care facilities,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/make-empty-oxygen-cylinders-available-sgcci-to-industry/articleshow/82089972.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Other states could adopt Maharashtra template on Covid restrictions’||MUMBAI: Maharashtra government’s move to not impose a complete lockdown and try to reduce “crowding” is being viewed as a scientific measure that, unfortunately, has come a “bit too late” to help the state. “The Maharashtra move is a template that other states across the country could adopt,” said Dr Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist with the Public Health Foundation of India. The second wave of the Covid pandemic started in Maharashtra in the third week of February with others state registering a steep increase only now. Dr Babu said that by imposing prohibitory orders till May 1, the state has ensured that crowding is prevented. “Crowds are the major root of transmission. If the fear of police action can prevent crowds, then the number of Covid-19 infections in the state could drop after a fortnight,” said Dr Babu. Health economist Ravi Duggal from the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan said it is “good” the state hasn’t opted for a full-fledged lockdown like last year. “However, some more thought should have been put into improving vaccination numbers and ways to intensify the ‘testing, tracing and treatment’ approach,” said Duggal. A senior doctor said the “restrictions” should have come earlier to prevent the sharp trajectory of cases. The state has registered over 7.5 lakh cases in April so far—higher than the tally (5.7 lakh) of September 2020 that was considered the worst Covid month in Maharashtra so far. However, a senior official said the government took care of people’s emotional health while ensuring there was no sudden announcement of a lockdown. “The state has been talking about the need to impose a lockdown for over two weeks to avoid panic due to the announcement,” he said. He also said the transport lines have not been touched, which means that people don’t have to be stuck in a place and can move to their hometown or come back to the city from outside without much hassle. “All essential shops have been allowed. There was no major incident of panic buying after the announcement. Also, a home delivery network of smaller shops has been set up since last year so most daily essential requirements have been taken care of in the cities,” said the official. Another important change that the government has made in the order issued on Tuesday is that they have done away with the mandatory RT-PCR/antigen negative report for vendors, e-commerce and food delivery personnel, staff at groceries and industries. They have only kept the rule for establishments like wedding halls, where servers and other staffers are in close contact with guests and for people who frequently come in and out of societies such as domestic help, drivers. This has been done to ease the load off testing labs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/other-states-could-adopt-maharashtra-template-on-covid-restrictions/articleshow/82092347.cms||Malathy Iyer

In addition, CR will continue running the 18 regular passenger trains daily.” According to CR estimates, between April 1 and 14, around 3.5 lakh people have travelled to their native towns. Around 1,400 people travel in each outstation train. “By the month-end, four lakh more passengers are expected to travel in CR trains,” said the official, adding that the present outflow is much than last year’s when 400 Shramik special trains were deployed to ferry six lakh migrants to their native towns. Soon after CM Uddhav Thackeray announced stringent curbs on movement of people and businesses on Tuesday evening, a large number of passengers thronged Lokmanya Tilak Terminus in Kurla to return to their hometowns. A CR official said, “We had anticipated this rush and immediately deployed four trains from Tuesday midnight to the wee hours of the morning. People were asked to book tickets at passenger reservation centres. Only those with confirmed tickets were allowed to board the trains.” Western Railway too is running summer special trains to north Indian from Bandra Terminus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cr-handles-passenger-rush-with-28-trains-a-day-3-5l-have-already-left-city-in-2-weeks/articleshow/82092352.cms||Manthank Mehta

NMC on Thursday started the walk-in interviews to recruit for various posts of doctors, lab technicians and nurses to treat Covid patients in its Covid care centres (CCCs) andCovid hospitals.NMC had floated advertisements of walk-in interviews for a total of 352 posts, including 1 post of MD (Radiologist) and MD (Microbiologist), 50 MBBS, 50 BAMS physicians, 100 staff nurses and 100 ANM (auxiliary nursing midwifery) and 50 lab technicians.Additional municipal commissioner Praveen Ashtikar told TOI they have received a good response on the very first day of the walk-in interviews. Of the 127 aspitants, two were MD,s nine MBBS, 35 BAMS, eight lab technicians, 21 staff nurses and 51 ANMs. NMC is facing a huge crunch of the workforce due to the rise in Covid cases. It has increased the beds in its CCCs and Covid hospitals, but the non-availability of the health workers remained a major issue.Earlier, NMC had appointed 1,300 health staff for various posts, but only 700 joined.

They have also decided to increase the number of vaccination centres and counsel those in home isolation.North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that in view of the increasing cases, a meeting was called to review the preparations of the municipalities.“In the meeting, it was decided that during the three-day weekend curfew, the corporations will carry out the sanitisation work. We have decided to use trolleys for the purpose and cover all busy markets/public places on priority,” said the mayor.“Also, when the footfall will be almost negligible in market areas, it would be easier for us to get the sanitisation done,” said east corporation mayor Nirmal Jain. EDMC has uploaded a list of 29 doctors on its website, who can be approached for counselling of Covid-infected patients. Th doctors can be consulted from 9 am to 9 pm.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Amid lockdown fear, workers leaving for their states||JAIPUR: In what reminds of the exodus last year, the labour migration has started, although these are early days. On Thursday morning, a crowd of about 500 labourers at the India Gate near Sitapura was seen scrambling to get into 100-odd buses bound for Bihar. Confirming that more and more workers are looking to go back to their towns and villages, transporters associations in the city said that in the past few days about 30 buses are going to various places in Bihar. Earlier, three to four buses would ply regularly. “It’s not only restricted to Sitapura industrial area only. Factory workers from all industrial areas have started going back to Bihar, UP and other places. In the past three-four days the number of buses going to Bihar has increased to about. Workers are ready to pay double and triple of the normal fare,” said Gopal Singh Rathore, a representative of a city transport association. But factory owners in Sitapura, VKI and Malviya Nagar industrial areas played down the movement of workers for not creating panic. While they admitted that there is a fear of lockdown among the workers and of getting stuck, they attributed the migration to the upcoming wedding season and Eid celebrations. “There are some workers who are leaving for their native places even though the numbers are small as of now. But the rush is unlikely to be last year because the train, bus and flight services are open. May be lessons have been learnt from what happened last time. Also, the government understands the consequences of shutting down industries. Some workers will go away but there would be enough to support the industry,” said Vimal Shah, president of Garment Exporters Association of Rajasthan. In fact, the government has exempted the manufacturing factories from the requirement of running operations with 50% capacity, ensuring continuity in work. In the railway station, workers could be seen carrying all their bag and baggage. When asked, one of them said he is going to attend a marriage in their family but did not offer an answer why he had to carry all his belongings for this short visit. Admitting that there is shortage of laborers, Digvijay Dhabriya, chairman of PHDCCI-Rajasthan, an industry in the state, said, “The unmarried workers hailing from a village or town stay in groups in rented accommodations. If two or three leave, their per head expenses increase. The fact that their friends are going home, others also follow suit. Dhabriya said that those who are going now will not return until the pandemic loses intensity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/amid-lockdown-fear-workers-leaving-for-their-states/articleshow/82090130.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: They have nowhere to go for chemo, dialysis||NEW DELHI: Binod Kumar’s chemotherapy session at Max Hospital in Shalimar Bagh on April 13 was abruptly cancelled after the hospital was turned into a full Covid facility. The 63-year-old anorectal cancer patient, under treatment since September last year, is in the grip of anxiety as he awaits information from the hospital. Kumar’s son, advocate Kishore Kunal, said, “My father has to undergo chemotherapy in six sessions. According to the schedule prepared by doctors, he has to have been hospitalised for three days and then rest at home for two weeks. He has undergone two chemotherapy sessions and the third one was scheduled to begin on April 13. But on Monday, we were informed the session stood cancelled.” The patient’s treatment course has consequently changed. “Due to the hospital not having free beds, my father’s treatment was altered after consultation with the doctor. His treatment began only on Thursday, and he will now need admission for four hours for chemotherapy and he will be given capsules to consume at home,” said Kunal. Like Kumar, there are hundreds of patients suffering from non-Covid illnesses who have had to postpone surgeries, procedures and follow-up examinations as many hospitals like Apollo Indraprastha, Max, Fortis, Manipal and Sir Ganga Ram have been consigned the task of dealing with Covid patients. Hospitals run by central and Delhi governments have also been turned into Covid-19 facilities in view of the massive surge in infection and the need for beds, both ICU and non-ICU, to treat corona patients. This has left families of patients undergoing treatment for non-Covid illnesses fearing complications due to the gap in treatment. Maheswar Rava, 62, came to Delhi from Guhawati on Sunday for liver transplantation. However, he and his four relatives were dismayed not to get a hospital bed. His daughter, Madhu, said, “My father’s condition deteriorated in the last one year because we couldn’t travel to New Delhi due to the pandemic. However, his transplantation is necessary at this stage. We have a donor, but it was impossible to get a bed for him at the hospital with which we were in contact for a long time.” She added, “My father tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday but we still couldn’t find a bed for him.” The family is currently staying in a hotel. “We arranged funds and came to Delhi for the transplantation. However, our stay in the city has been extended due to unavailability of beds and it will become difficult for us to meet these unexpected expenses. We plan to return home after my father tests negative for Covid,” Madhu added. Rajesh Shah, a gardener whose six-year-old daughter has to undergo eye surgery at a government hospital, will bide this time for a few days. “We got a bed for my daughter after a long time. And now we hear that only emergency patients will be treated.” Not wanting to take any risk at this stage, the family opted out of surgery for now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/they-have-nowhere-to-go-for-chemo-dialysis/articleshow/82091362.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The BSAs who fail to complete the geo-tagging before the deadline will have to face action,” reads an order issued by Vijay Kiran Anand, UP state project director. According to a report prepared by the state authorities, only seven districts have completed the geo-tagging work, so far. Notably, under “Operation Kayakalp”, several facilities — drinking water, blackboard, toilets, tiles, handwashing units, furniture and others — are being provided to the primary and upper primary schools. “A survey of these facilities and the geo-tagging should be completed, or else we would not be able to get the budget from the central government,” said Anand. Districts, where 100% of work has been completed, include Sant Ravidas Nagar, Ballia, Hathras, Jalaun, Deoria, Etah, Maharajganj, while the districts meeting less than 50% of the target are Chandauli, Gonda, Ambedkarnagar, Lalitpur, Hardoi, Agra, Lakhimpur Kheri, Shravasti, Unnao and Mathura. “If the work is not completed within two days, action will be taken against the erring BSAs, district coordinator (training) and district coordinator (construction),” warned Anand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/only-7-up-dists-complete-survey-of-govt-schemes-geo-tagging-of-schools-bsas-warned-of-action-if-survey-delayed-further/articleshow/82089380.cms||Ishita Bhatia

---||Delhi||Delhi: Hospital infra gasping as patients’ kin run from pillar to post for beds||NEW DELHI: Driving across the city on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday in search of a hospital bed for a Covid-19 patient seemed like déjà vu for Delhi University student Sanyam Bhagat. Last November, when Delhi was battling the third wave of Covid-19 cases, the 21-year-old had frantically searched for a bed for his 82-year-old maternal grandfather. When Bhagat, a resident of Ashok Vihar Phase IV, got a call at 5pm on Monday that his sister’s 59-year-old father-in-law had tested positive and was in a bad condition, he rushed to their house in Shalimar Bagh and took him to a private hospital where he got oxygen support but not a bed. “The hospital asked us to take him home. But his oxygen level was 82% despite the oxygen support. So my brother-in-law and his cousin went in one direction to look for a bed and I dashed to central and south Delhi with another relative,” Bhagat said. The two groups approached several hospitals in north, central and south Delhi for an ICU bed. “Since there is a night curfew and couldn’t risk taking uncle with us, we carried all the necessary papers to prove that we had a genuine reason to be out,” Bhagat said. They finally located an ICU bed in a nursing home in north Delhi’s Model Town at 9am on Tuesday. With the Covid pandemic on a rampage, 1,086 of the 1,250 Covid ICU beds with ventilators are occupied, according to the Delhi Corona application. Similarly, only 11.3% of the Covid ICU beds without ventilators are now available. And while ward beds have grown almost threefold this month and stand at 15,434, more than 70% of these are occupied too. Although 4,496 ward beds, 164 ICU beds with ventilators and 290 ICU beds without ventilators are shown as available, families complain that the availability isn’t evenly distributed and because most people prefer private hospitals, very few beds are unoccupied in these hospitals. When Zakir Nagar resident and businessman Irshad Alam’s diabetic mother suddenly complained of breathing problem on Monday night, he took her to the nearest nursing home. “I always take my mother, who is 65-year-old, to this nursing home but this time, they turned us away, saying there was no ICU bed available. I then took her to all the big hospitals in southeast Delhi, but in vain,” said Alam. “At around 2am, the 43-year-old gave up and brought his mother home. We gave her some homemade kadha (home remedy for cold and flu) and hoped her situation wouldn’t deteriorate,” said Alam, who finally managed to get a bed in a government hospital in south Delhi on Thursday evening. Rajiv Kakria, member of Greater Kailash-I RWA, said the residents’ body has arranged for oxygen concentrator machines and these have come to the aid of those unable to find a hospital bed. “The problem is the uneven distribution of hospitals,” observed Kakri. “I’m a Greater Kailash resident and though there are many good hospitals in the neighbouring areas, all these are occupied and the beds I’m getting are in distant Dwarka.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hospital-infra-gasping-as-patients-kin-run-from-pillar-to-post-for-beds/articleshow/82091381.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: For street vendors, new norms mean total shutdown||JAIPUR: For street vendors, the night curfew is turning out to another nightmare that they suffered last year. As per the new guidelines, now they have to shut shop by 5pm which is just about the time they start their business of the day. In the past few days, they were getting two hours to serve their clients but now they have to sit at home. “We open at about 4 pm. In normal days, we would continue till 11 pm and on average we do business of about Rs 6,000 per day. But because of the 8pm curfew we had to shut shops by 7pm. The income was hardly manageable but we had no other things to do. But things would be different from Friday when we have to close the business completely,” said Manas Kumar Rana, who sells omelets, egg chowmein, etc on a Malviya Nagar street. Rana said during the night curfew last time, he had to go back to his home town in West Bengal. He came after the curfew was lifted in January. The 5pm curfew kicking off from Friday would render most of the roadside food vendors jobless. Many have come to the city from various parts of the state and outside to make a living out of these small ventures. But now they are at the crossroads again. Two months ago, the sight of students in Bapu Nagar lit the hopes of Kamlesh Sharma. A vada pav seller, Sharma said business was coming back to normal. “Most of the business happens in the evening hours. The restrictions wiped out 80% of my business. And now I have to close down as the curfew timings have been advanced,” said Sharma, who hails from Dausa but has settled in the city with this two sons after a decade into the business. He said even if I keep my shop open during the day, very few would turn up because it’s very hot. “People won’t prefer to stand in the sun and have vada pav. I don’t have any other skills to pick up an alternate job,” added Sharma. When asked if has availed the government’s mudra loans, Sharma said he had approached a bank but could not fulfil the paper work that was required. Stories of people coming from outside to find livelihood opportunities in the city and pandemic upending their lives are everywhere. “My friend and I came to the city from Cooch Behar about three years back. After the lockdown last year, my friend decided to go back. I stayed hoping things would improve with time. But things are now different. I fear I have to also go back,” said Subal Barman, a street food seller in Raja Park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/for-street-vendors-new-norms-mean-total-shutdown/articleshow/82090138.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Volunteers can deliver food to homes: Bombay HC on Jain trusts’ plea||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday asked the Maharashtra government and two religious Jain trusts to “find a solution” and suggested that community volunteers may be roped in to deliver “pious food” from temples to homes of devotees for the nine-day Ayambil fast. Two Jain trusts had approached HC with an urgent petition to permit an Ayambil fast for nine days from April 19 to April 27, both days inclusive, by allowing devotees to “take away pious boiled cooked food from the premises of the religious trusts.” The HC bench of Justices S C Gupte and Abhay Ahuja heard their plea briefly on Thursday. The judges said, “We must find a solution…and see that the government’s SOP is also not frustrated,” and posted the matter for hearing on Friday. Shree Trustee Atma Kamal Lab Labdhisurishwarji Jain Gyanmandir Trust and Sheth Motisha Religious and Charitable Trust filed the petition. Their main prayer was to quash the state diktat and allow them and “other 48 Jain trusts” to open their Jain temples with SOPs in place. Their counsel, K P Shah, however, submitted that they were at this stage “not praying’ for the opening of temples.” The urgent relief was for a limited purpose of the upcoming Ayambil fast that starts on April 19 when particular boiled food sans salt, spice and various other ingredients has to be consumed, which is difficult to make at home, the plea said. The lawyer for the trusts said restaurants and bars are allowed home delivery under the ‘break the chain’ SOPs, but religious trusts are not. The challenge was to clause 5 of the April 13 SOPs. The HC observed the trusts were not asking for re-opening of temples, only for food collection by devotees. Additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan said even food collection cannot be permitted under the SOPs, as the trusts seek devotees visit places of worship to collect food parcels themselves, and it may lead to a congregation. She said restaurants are permitted only home deliveries via online orders, people are not allowed to visit restaurants for takeaways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/volunteers-can-deliver-food-to-homes-bombay-hc-on-jain-trusts-plea/articleshow/82092359.cms||Swati Deshpande

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday alleged that the central government has failed to provide regular supply of vaccines in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Assam, which has led to the closure of vaccination centres at many places in these states.He asked the Centre instead of spreading misinformation on the availability of vaccine, it should have officially issued advisory saying that it will take some time for the vaccine to become available instead of blaming the states of mismanagement. This would have helped instil confidence in the system, said the chief minister in a series of tweets.Gehlot said, “I hope that the Union minister will come out with the truth in the interest of common people instead of making false statements on corona infection and vaccination.”There was no harm in telling the truth that the availability of vaccine in the country is low and the state governments must adjust their vaccination programmes accordingly.He claimed that the central government had allowed 10% vaccine wastage, but in Rajasthan, the percentage of vaccine wastage is only 7%. Rajasthan has the highest vaccination rate in the entire country.The chief minister said, “Initially, even the medical fraternity was apprehensive on vaccination, but we encouraged people to get vaccinated by creating confidence in everyone and people have come forward in large numbers.”Following the guidelines of the central government, the Rajasthan government worked hard to increase the speed of vaccination to 5.81 lakh vaccines per day and reached the first position in the country. He said shortage of vaccine is hampering the fight against corona.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centre-must-come-out-with-truth-on-vaccine-availability-gehlot/articleshow/82091385.cms||---

Majority of the patients who are being diagnosed with Covid belong to areas which are outside the Walled City. In the first wave, Areas such as Ramganj, Ghat Gate, Bhrampuri, Subhash Chowk, Manak Chowk and adjacent locations such as Shastri Nagar, MD Road and MI Road were the worst hit, but this time around, areas which are far away from the old city are reporting increasing number of cases. Areas such as Malviya Nagar, Vaishali Nagar, Jhotwara, Sodala, Vidhyadhar Nagar, Pratap Nagar, Jagatpura, Mansarovar, Jawahar Nagar, Tonk Road, Bani Park and Adarsh Nagar are continuously reporting more than 50% of the daily new infections. Health department’s teams are busy in conducting contact tracing in the areas. “Earlier, Ramganj and other adjacent areas of the Walled City were worst-affected and a containment zone was created covering almost the whole Walled City. With the help of police, JMC and other departments, measures were taken to contain the spread ofthe virus and it took almost three months to bring the situation under control. Amid the second wave, cases are being reported from other areas which are outside the Walled City,” said a senior health department official. Till August last year, 23 people had died of Covid in Ramganj only while 5,157 were placed in institutional quarantine and more than 1 lakh isolated themselves at home. In the second wave, the virus has infected more people from outside the Walled City. “Carelessness while attending marriages, traveling in local transport without wearing masks and flouting guidelines has increased number of cases in several areas of the city,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/in-second-wave-areas-outside-walled-city-worst-hit/articleshow/82091388.cms||---

It is now upon the people to analyse what the government has done for them in the last four years.” He added, “BJP needs to answer people over the issue of unemployment, migration, and lack of development,” he added. On the other hand, the CM, while addressing an election meeting at Arya Inter College, Deghat, said, “The development works carried out by late Surendra Singh Jeena will always remain in the hearts of the locals.” For the Salt by-poll, the BJP gave its ticket to his brother Mahesh and the Congress went for Ganga Pancholi who lost the 2017 assembly polls by a low margin of 2,904 votes.

But we are trying to get more injections from different sources. As far as LMO is concerned, the daily use has gone up to 10,000 cylinders. But we have arrangement of 29,000 cylinders per day,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary, health.The health department was in touch with an exporter, whose supply of remdesivir outside the country was stuck after Centre imposed a ban on export of remdesivir injections. But due to some quality issues the state government did not procure it.The health department is supplying remdesivir to government hospitals on a daily basis as per the need. For private hospitals, the health department has made a proforma compulsory to be filled to authenticate that the patient actually requires remdesivir. “Remdesivir should be given to patients in first 9-10 days, when the virus replicates. It helps in recovery, but it does not prevent mortality. For preventing mortality, steroids and anti-thrombotic drugs are useful,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS medical college.The protocol says, treat the viral stage with an anti-viral (like remdesivir) in the symptomatic phase, adding that remdesivir has a role in the first 10 days of infection as it helps in reducing symptoms’ duration. Can use in patients with CT severity score less than 8 with dense consolidation, high fever without raised CRP, especially in elderly.The state government will procure oxygen from Inox firm in Alwar. Earlier too, it had procured it from the same firm during the first wave. Also, help of police department has been sought for ensuring that the supply should not be affected due to farmer’s agitation.BOX:Only 1.1L doses administered on ThursdayOnly 1.11 lakh doses were administered in the state on Thursday due to inadequate availability of Covid-19 vaccines amid limited supply from the Centre.

The administration has asked the devotees to witness the ceremonies from their homes on the temple website.Executive officer of the temple, K Chelladurai has said that from April 15 to 30, devotees would be allowed for darshan in the temple from 6am to 12.30pm, and from 4pm to 9pm, except when the procession of the deities is held within the temple. People would be allowed for free darshan only through the eastern tower entrance leading to the Amman sannidhi.

The western and northern entrances are closed to public entry, he added.Masking is mandatory for entry into the temple, and people would be scanned with thermal monitors at the entrances. Sanitizing hands before entering the temple is another important rule to be followed. Children in the age group below 10 years, elderly above 65 years and people with comorbidities have been asked to refrain from visiting the temple as a safety precaution.As safety lockers for keeping cellphones at both entrances have the capacity to hold only 300 phones at a time, the temple authorities have asked the devotees to leave their gadgets at home.

The state government is anticipating that more beds will be required in the coming days as the number of active cases in Jaipur rose to 9,204 while the state’s figures touched 49,276 on Thursday. In the last 24 hours, 33 persons died, while 6,658 tested positive taking the casualty count to 3,041 and infection numbers to 3,87,950. In September 2020, the health department had declared the 300-bed Jaipuria Hospital as a dedicated Covid facility, but as the first wave slowed down, the government reserved only 100 beds. However, 300 beds will be reserved for Covid patients now. Health secretary Siddharth Mahajan on Thursday issued orders that will come into effect from April 19.

---||Delhi||Amid dip in air traffic, DIAL to decide by month-end if T2 needs to be kept open||NEW DELHI: The unprecedented surge in Covid cases is threatening to take IGI back to last summer when only Terminal 3 was operational. With air traffic falling sharply, sources say, a review will be conducted by authorities by the month-end to decide whether T2 will remain open. The reopening of Terminal 1, which was initially expected by March-end, will happen on traffic-driven need. Incidentally, Mumbai airport on Thursday announced that all international and domestic flights would operate from its T2 from next Wednesday (April 21) as the traffic now could be handled by a single terminal. Delhi’s T3 handles both domestic and international traffic. If the numbers keep falling, then it may also again be IGI’s only operational terminal till things start improving. Sources said Delhi International Airport Ltd would by the month-end see how the pandemic pans out and affects passenger numbers to take a call on keeping T2 open. DIAL was yet to comment till the time of going to press. T2 was reopened for domestic flights last October when domestic air travel started picking up after being allowed to resume in May end. T1 is yet to reopen since last March. The fall in air traffic has been so steep that Delhi-Mumbai, which are among the world’s busiest domestic routes, didn’t figure in the list of top 10 busiest routes within a country this month, according to data shared by UK-based air consultancy firm OAG on Thursday. Delhi-Dubai and Mumbai-Dubai remained on the list of top 10 busiest international routes. Airlines said international traffic to India had fallen by about 5%. The surge in Covid-19 cases has led to a strong sense of deja vu among both airlines and airport operators. Scheduled domestic flights restarted on May 25, 2020, with about 30,000 passengers travelling across the country on day 1. This number kept growing as things improved. March 27, 2021, for instance, saw 2.8 lakh domestic passengers on 2,336 flights. This number fell to 1.9 lakh domestic passengers on 2,141 flights on April 14, according to the aviation minister’s tweets. Indira Gandhi International Airport was on average seeing 1.2 lakh passengers (both domestic and international arrivals and departures) in the past couple of months. Now, the footfall has plummeted. “Currently, domestic flights are operating at about 55% occupancy. So, a 180-seater aircraft will have 90-100 passengers these days. The situation is going back to square one of last summer, unless the curve subsides fast,” said an airline official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/amid-dip-in-air-traffic-dial-to-decide-by-month-end-if-t2-needs-to-be-kept-open/articleshow/82091396.cms||Saurabh Sinha

---||Aurangabad||Little impact on industrial sector due to Covid curbs||Aurangabad: The newly introduced Covid-19 restrictions have caused not a significant impact on Aurangabad district’s industrial sector as majority of the units have export-related obligations or are considered as continuous process industries, among other identified categories that have been exempted from restrictions, said stakeholders. Kamlesh Dhoot, president of Chamber of Marathwada Industries and Agriculture (CMIA), on Thursday said that Aurangabad is known as an automobile hub and is largely excluded from curbs due to export-related commitments. “In terms of employment, Aurangabad, is a little affected due to the new Covid-related restrictions as compared to last year. Automobile manufacturing companies and ancillary firms have been allowed to work by following Covid prevention norms and, therefore, employment is not much affected,” he said. Aurangabad has around 4,500 industrial units, including MNC, MSME and OEM, with considerable chunk of them dealing with automobile manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, among other industries. Prasad Kokil, vice president of Confederation of Indian Industries, Marathwada zone, said that the industrial firms involved in production of white goods have been affected in Aurangabad. “Aurangabad also is a base for production of electronic appliances which is affected due to the new Covid-related regulations. Some local industries have been witnessing low schedules due to reduced demand by virtue of curbs on retails markets,” he said. Sanjay Kulkarni, an entrepreneur, said that no worker migration as such has taken place in Aurangabad unlike the one that took place during the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic last year. “The workers have a mindset to work, which is most vital factor in running of local industries. The government policies have considered interests of this workforce while framing Covid-related regulation which has proved as a win-win situation for all,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/little-impact-on-industrial-sector-due-to-covid-curbs/articleshow/82090157.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: UG medical exams postponed again, will now be held in June||MUMBAI: Exams for over 40,000 undergraduate students from medical and other health science courses across Maharashtra, which were scheduled to commence April 19, have been postponed to June. The decision has come in the wake of the surge in Covid-19 cases across the state. Exams for students from first, second and third year of health science courses, including MBBS, have been postponed for the second time. While most students and parents are against the conduct of these exams amid the pandemic, some parents are concerned about the impact on the next academic session, which will now be delayed by six months. These exams are usually held in December. Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh announced the exam postponement decision on Thursday, after consultation with the chief minister. The exams will now commence June 2 as per the new timetable issued by the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS). A detailed schedule of the exam will be released soon. Ajit Pathak, exam controller from MUHS, said the state has taken the decision considering the pandemic situation and appeals from students. The exams were earlier scheduled on March 23, and then on April 19. Final-year exams for MBBS and other health sciences courses have already been conducted by the state. Brijesh Sutaria, parent of a third-year student, said he is relieved with the postponement as students are facing a lot of difficulties in hostels. Many are sharing accommodation, so it is inconvenient to study in the confined place while following social distancing norms, he said. There are students who are also down with Covid-19 who will be unable to appear for the exam at this point, said a students’ representative. Initially, the university had indicated that the exams would be conducted in February, but then they were scheduled in March. They were again postponed and scheduled in April. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, pointed out that June will be too late for the exams, as it will have an adverse impact on subsequent academic sessions too. “The government should have conducted the exam in January or February when Covid cases were less. Students who are in their third year now will go to final year after these exams. Their session will be delayed by a few months, and there will be a shortage of interns next year,” said Shenoy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-ug-medical-exams-postponed-again-will-now-be-held-in-june/articleshow/82092381.cms||Yogita Rao

So I came to the chamber and found the arrangements very satisfactory,” said B Priya, a beneficiary. As many as 490 people above the age of 45 got vaccinated on Thursday in the TNCCI camp.On the concerns of cold storage at the camps, assistant city health officer Ismail Fathima said that the government has the best cold storage chain system for Covid-19 vaccines and that people should come forward to get themselves vaccinated without delay.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: IB cancels boards, schools to follow non-exam route||MUMBAI: After the CBSE cancelled class X exams and postponed class XII tests, the International Baccalaureate has also announced a non-exam route for schools in India. To strengthen predicted grade accuracy globally for schools on both routes (exam and non-exam), the IB has provided schools with customised predicted grade distributions for each subject. The Maharashtra education department had written to the IB board to reconsider the dates for their examinations. IB had simultaneously also consulted schools to seek feedback about the on-ground situation. The IBDP (Class XI and XII) students can take the non-exam route and middle years’ programme (up to class X) will be awarded on basis of alternative tasks given by the board. “The IB has informed schools of our decision not to hold examinations in India due to the rising cases of Covid-19 and following ongoing conversations with our schools, associations and education boards. We intend that the results of students in India should be awarded using coursework marks and predicted grades for the May 2021 session, as described in the awarding model outlined in February,” said the board in an official statement. The details of the process have been shared with the affiliated schools. School principals have welcomed the move, but are wary of the solution. The May series last year too could not be conducted due to the pandemic and students were awarded in a similar pattern. “Conducting examinations is the most reliable way to assess students’ achievements, but the decision was taken considering the safety of students and teachers. It may not benefit all the students. We will know the impact after the results. Last year too, most parents were upset with the results,” said the principal of an IB school in the city. Last year, the IB had said that the predicted grades were higher compared to past years, but several students complained otherwise. This year, the IB has given more guidelines within which teachers have to submit their predictions. “While teachers feel these predicted grade distributions are not aligned with student performance, the IB is developing a process that will allow schools to request a different grade distribution and provide evidence that supports their claim,” the board had said in a previous announcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-ib-cancels-boards-schools-to-follow-non-exam-route/articleshow/82092392.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar

However, without any hesitation, Mansoori broke his fast for a noble cause by donating plasma for two women Covid-19 patients. This effort earns him praise from various walks of live. Through social networking platforms and blood donor groups, Mansoori came to know that two women, including 36-year-old Nirmala and 30-year-old Alka, with blood group A+ need plasma. “Immediately after seeing these messages, I rushed to the hospital and volunteered for my plasma donation. Since I had done it in past after getting recovered from Covid-19 in September, I knew the plasma donation procedure,” said Mansoori while talking to TOI over phone from Udaipur on Thursday. Doctors took him for antibodies test and found him to be fit for plasma donation as he was found with good antibodies. “While the doctors asked me to get ready, they had also asked me to have something. That’s why I had to break my roza and had something from the hospital itself and donated my blood,” Aqeel said. While making this bold decision of breaking his roza, Mansoori did not hesitate for a second. “Mainey Apna Insaani farz nibhaya, mujhe koi geela nahin (It was my responsibility as a human and I have no regrets),” Mansoori added. Even, while offering Isha ki Namaz in the evening, he prayed for the wellbeing of the two women. “Allah sey dua karoonga dono mahila theek ho jayen (I will pray to almighty Allah for the recovery of both the women),” he added. A day after on Thursday he started his roza for Ramzan. “I have donated blood for more than 17 times. Since my recovery from September 2020, I have donated plasma thrice. I will urge everyone who is recovered from Covid-19 should go for an antibody test and in case of any need or emergency must donate their plasma,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-breaks-roza-to-donate-plasma-for-two-women/articleshow/82091401.cms||Ashish Mehta

Even state capital Chennai was humbled as it could collect only Rs 5.20 lakh on the day.The fines were collected by the police, revenue and local body officials from people for either not wearing facemask or not following social distancing. The breakup showed Rs 4.38 lakh was collected from 2,193 mask violators and Rs 17,000 from commercial establishments that did not maintain social distance. The district police alone accounted for Rs 4.55 lakh of the total collection. The district has witnessed an average of more than 200 cases over the last two days with 244 recorded on Thursday alone.  “We have collected a fine of Rs 29.62 lakh over the last one week,” Tuticorin SP S Jayakumar said. These fines were collected during the intensive drives conducted from April 8 to 14. In the eight days, Tuticorin district police registered 14,215 cases against people not wearing masks. A sum of Rs 28.43 lakh was collected from them at Rs 200 eac while Rs 1.19 lakh was collected from 238 commercial establishments for not maintaining social distance. While this is several times the fines collected by many districts from the beginning of the month, Tuticorin SP said that it was not an uphill task for the district that has 52 police stations. “Each police station registered around 40 to 50 cases a day,” he said.Jayakumar added that the teams at the station level were engaged in drives for not more than four hours a day — two each in the morning and evening. Registering 20 cases in two hours was not difficult. “Some argued with us, but the compliance has improved. We even registered 2,700 cases a day earlier this week. But it has gradually reduced to 2,100 cases as more people have started wearing masks,” he added. Jayakumar as well as district collector K Senthil Raj said that registering cases against violators will continue till there is cent per cent compliance and till the cases drop to zero.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/covid-norms-tuticorin-dist-tops-state-in-daily-spot-fine-collection-on-wednesday-nets-6-4l/articleshow/82092384.cms||M K Ananth

The collision left three people dead and nine missing. S Velmurugan, 37, of Ramanathapuram and Sunil Dhas of West Bengal are the only two to be rescued alive. Alexander is survived by his widow D Sumathi, 32, and two sons aged nine and seven years. Dhason has four children, including two daughters of which Sumathi is the youngest.Velmurugan, who reached Colachel from Mangaluru was sent to his native village Kannirajapuram in Ramanathapuram district. “I don’t know how I am going to face my family and villagers,” he lamented as his relatives Palani, Balamurugan and Manickam are still missing. A fisheries official from Ramanathapuram has headed to Mangaluru to coordinate the rescue of the missing fishermen. Fisheries officials here quoting officials in Kerala said that the remains of the damaged boat is nearly 100m deep, making the search and rescue difficult. Officials added that the state government has written to the director general of shipping to engage divers to search for the missing men. The government has also pressed for adequate compensation for the kin of the deceased and the survivors.Sumathi in a representation to the director of fisheries said the shipping company and those on board the ship have to be booked for murder.D Rani, wife of fisherman Denison from Tuticorin district, who also went missing made a representation to the government to search for her missing husband and his fellow workers and to ensure the safety of fishermen from such accidents.The Meenavar Orunginaippu Sankam also sought adequate compensation. “Most of the victims are the sole breadwinners of their family,” general secretary of the association, Johnson Charles said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/fishermen-killed-in-collision-laid-to-rest/articleshow/82092379.cms||M K Ananth

Fishermen appealed to the government to reconsider their long-pending demand of shifting the annual ban to November and December.Deep sea fishermen of Tuticorin and Rameswaram said that they remained off the sea for more than 135 days last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the cyclone alerts during the monsoon. Pointing out at the frequent weather alerts asking them not to go fishing during the northeast monsoon, they reiterated their demand of shifting the ban to that period.Fishermen also said that their livelihood has been affected due to the diesel price rise and urged the government to reduce it. Fishermen of Tuticorin accused fishing boats from Kerala of fishing along their shores when the native mechanised boats remain off the sea and and urged the government to put an end to it.They also pressed for increasing the dole given by the government to Rs 15,000 per fisherman, against the existing practice of Rs 5,000 for the family of a fisherman for the entire two-month ban. Traditional and fibre boats that can fish during the ban anticipate higher price for their catch due to the drop in catch as bigger boats will not go fishing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/shift-annual-ban-on-fishing-to-nov-and-december/articleshow/82092385.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi HC allows 50 to offer namaz at Markaz five times a day||NEW DELHI: With the Centre being unable to take a clear stand about banning gatherings at all religious places, the Delhi high court on Thursday allowed 50 people to offer namaz five times a day at Alami Markaz Banglewali Masjid in Nizamuddin during Ramzan. “A prima facie case is made out to allow devotees to perform namaz for Ramzan,” justice Mukta Gupta said, while ordering the Station House Officer of Nizamuddin police station to permit entry of 50 people five times a day to offer namaz only on the first floor of the mosque. The court pointed out that guidelines issued by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in June 2020 regarding reopening of religious places/places of worship and putting a cap on the congregations were still in force. It added that the permission was subject to any future notification by DDMA. Declining to increase the number of people or allow use of other floors of the mosque for offering prayers as sought by senior advocate Ramesh Gupta on behalf of Delhi Waqf Board, the court said, “Considering the fact that devotees require to perform namaz five times a day during the holy month of Ramzan and, at the same time, care has to be taken that Covid-19 doesn’t spread, the SHO is directed to permit 50 people on the first floor of the masjid.” “Please wake up to the grim situation in Delhi,” added the court. However, on repeated requests by Gupta that social distancing could be maintained on other floors of the mosque, the court permitted the waqf board to move an application before the SHO. The directions came after the court found that the status report furnished by police was silent on whether all places of worship were closed in accordance with the April 10 DDMA notification. “You have not mentioned in the status report if other religious places are closed or open. We find most of the religious places are open,” it said, reminding the Centre that the court had wanted to know this information on April 13. When the court pointedly asked the Centre’s counsel about the status of other places of worship, it was informed that Sacred Heart Cathedral was holding online mass on Sunday and at Kalkaji Temple, aarti was being done virtually. However, the Centre’s counsel admitted that physical darshan was also being permitted at the temple. In its report, police said the court “in its wisdom and discretion” may permit such people as it deemed fit and proper to perform namaz only on the ground floor of the mosque by strictly following all Covid-related protocols. The court was hearing a plea by Delhi Waqf Board seeking reopening of the Markaz, which was locked since March 31, 2020.

While the move was welcomed amid the resurgence of Covid-19, the response from schools and students was mixed.“Often, the importance of marks scored in Class X are underestimated. However, several higher education institutions like Indian Institute of Management take Class X and XII marks into consideration as well for admissions. Also, many students do not write the periodical tests and exams conducted during the course of the year since their focus is only on the final exam. But these tests may now be the basis of awarding marks,” said Jayendran Mani, correspondent, Sri Jayendra Group of Educational Institutions. He added that at least Class X students of CBSE boards have been given the option of improving their scores by writing an exam later and some can benefit from it if they are unhappy with the marks awarded.Teachers are also concerned over allotment of groups for Class XI since Class X board exam marks are often the basis for it. “We have to wait for more clarity on how the marks will be allotted and how we can begin the next academic year,” said S Meenakshisundaram, a Class XII chemistry teacher at a private CBSE school.Students said the cancellation has brought relief for them and their parents. “The cancellation has come as relief for our families since they were worried about us going to school in the new Covid-19 situation, especially with grandparents at home,” said L Divya, a Class X student. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cancelled-class-x-board-exams-raise-troubling-questions/articleshow/82092393.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune: Covishield reserves dry up at sites in PMC limits||PUNE: Hospitals within Pune Municipal Corporation limits are reporting a shortage of the Covishield vaccine. District officials said the PMC’s low reserves could impact the vaccination drive in Pune city. Pune rural and the PCMC still have sufficient quantities of Covishield. On Thursday, the PMC had just 15 vials (or 150 doses) of Covishield left at its Narayan Peth vaccine store, after 32,040 doses were distributed to hospitals recently. Also on Thursday, nearly 16,378 beneficiaries were given Covishield shots in PMC areas. “This is insufficient reserve for the nearly 180 sites in PMC limits. More Covishield doses were expected on Thursday, but they did not arrive,” a PMC official said. Officials overseeing vaccine supply said a fresh batch of Covishield is likely to land on Monday. The PMC’s Narayan Peth vaccine store holds the stock for Pune city. It sends out shots to 55 cold chain points, from where they are distributed to Pune city hospitals. An official from the district health department said, “The PMC had about 40,774 doses until Wednesday night, of both Covishield and Covaxin. Nearly 6,440 doses were Covishield and 34,334 were Covaxin. There is now seeing some shortage of Covishield, which could slow down the vaccination drive in Pune city. The next lot of Covishield is only expected to arrive on Monday." Another official said the focus, during the next few days, will be on providing second doses to Covaxin beneficiaries. Covaxin first doses were given to numerous people in Pune from March 13. “If there’s a Covishield crunch in PMC areas, Covaxin could be given as the first dose to many,” the official said. The district on Thursday received nearly 17,000 doses of Covaxin, with Pune rural allocated 12,000 doses, PMC getting 2,000 doses and the PCMC receiving 3,000 doses. “Pune district had received two lots of Covishield recently: 1.1 lakh on Saturday and 1.6 lakh on Monday. But the district has been vaccinating about 50,000 people every day. That’s why the doses are finishing up fast,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covishield-reserves-dry-up-at-sites-in-pmc-limits/articleshow/82091429.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Pune: Black-marketing of remdesivir increases amid acute shortage||PUNE: The black-marketing of antiviral drug remdesivir is on the rise in the Pune Metropolitan Region amid Covid surge and its acute shortage. In some instances, Rs7,000-18,000 was charged per vial when its purchase price is between Rs1,100 and Rs1,800. The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad police arrested 17 people in six cases of remdesivir black-marketing over the last one week. Five cases were in Pune city, in which 13 people were arrested. Another four men were held in the sixth case of black-marketing in Pimpri Chinchwad. In most cases, the vials were illegally procured from Covid care centres or Covid hospitals’ medical stores, the police said. “We have arrested nine men in four cases registered with Bharti Vidaypeeth, Dattawadi, Lonikand and Chandannagar police since a week. Investigations in all these cases revealed that the suspects had procured the remdesivir vials in small quantities either from the Covid care centres or Covid hospitals or attached medical stores,” additional commissioner of police Ashok Morale, the Pune police crime branch in-charge, told TOI on Thursday. Two cases, in which four men were arrested, were registered with the Bharati Vidyapeeth and Dattawadi police. The arrested persons had sold the drug at Rs5,000, Rs7,000 and Rs11,000 per vial. “We arrested five men after two FIRs were lodged with the Lonikand and Chandannagar police on Wednesday night on bid to sell remdesivir vials for Rs10,000 and Rs18,000 each,” Morale said. There has been an increasing demand for remdesivir in various hospitals after the spike in cases this month. Rampant and irrational use of the drug and inadequate supply added to the severe crunch. “Since the demand for vials has increased, we have instructed our crime branch officials to remain alert,” Morale said. Remdesivir’s retail price varies among companies from Rs4,500 to Rs5,400 per vial. The manufacturers sell it to medical stores attached to Covid hospitals for Rs1,100-1,800 per vial following the request from the state government and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “Private hospitals have been told to charge only 10% extra on the purchase price. The state government’s appeal to cap the drug’s price at Rs1,500 per vial is under consideration of the Union government,” said Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner (drug), FDA, Pune. “There was no allocation of vials to the district on Wednesday and Thursday for factors, including the rising caseload in adjoining states. The Centre’s curbs on export are likely to resolve the shortage within a day or two,” Pratapwar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/black-marketing-of-remdesivir-increases-amid-acute-shortage/articleshow/82091418.cms||Asseem Shaikh

These rogue apps, hosted on US-based Amazon Cloud and China-based Ali Cloud, are linked with Chinese companies and are operating in association with certain non-banking firms in India,.DGP M Mahender Reddy informed the high court on Thursday. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, while hearing a PIL filed by Kalyan Dileep Sunkara of Hyderabad, sought to know from the DGP by July 15 the action initiated against the key accused in the scam and those who assisted them from India through a fresh affidavit. Two non-banking financial companies (NBFC) located in Bangalore, Mad network technologies and Fin express financial services, were found to be assisting the Chinese rogue loan companies. The DGP, in his report, said that there are 14,906 NBFCs registered with RBI and the names of these two firms were not there in that list. Most of the loan apps are associated with these two unlicensed NBFCs. In Telangana, 66 FIRs were registered against these rogue apps.

As part of the first instalment to raise the loans in the form of bonds, the state government has got permission to raise Rs 8,000 crore from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This amount will be raised from April to June in multiple instalments. In the month of April, the government has planned to raise Rs 3,000 crore. Bonds worth Rs 1,000 crore were raised in the first 15 days of April, and another Rs 1,000 crore will be raised on the 27th of this month. The will borrow Rs 3,000 crore each in May and June through the auction at RBI. Till last budget, the state government had earmarked 17% of the funds for repaying the loans and interest payment. Since the formation of the state, the government has borrowed Rs 4 lakh crore either in the form of loans or guarantees. Direct loans amount to Rs 2 lakh crore, the remaining given as guarantees to various state government corporations. The state government also has to spend Rs 1,000 crore every month additionally due to PRC implementation. Till now, the state government was spending nearly Rs 1,400 crore for repayments. It is estimated that this figure will go up to Rs 2,000 crore per month. To manage the additional expenditure, the state had to take more loan, sources said. However, state government sources say that the long repayment schedules and lower interest rates will not burden the state much. “Even if there is long-term repayment schedule proposed by the state government, many are interested in giving the state government loans looking at the way the growth rate and development prospects of the state are,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-govt-set-to-borrow-rs-47500cr-this-fiscal/articleshow/82091444.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Western UP’s three districts, which went to the polls in the first leg, were hit by the stray incidents of violence. In Saharanpur, two village pradhan contestants and their supporters fought a pitched battle in Jaroda Pada village early Thursday morning, leaving several injured. A car was damaged and another was set on fire by supporters of Naveen Tyagi and Rakesh Singh. Saharanpur’s superintendent of police (rural) Atul Sharma said, “Clash broke out between the two groups at 4am. Both the sides were trying hard to convince the voters. The injured have been sent to hospital and one person has been taken into custody. Peaceful polling was conducted in the village.” The district witnessed yet another tragic incident when three persons, including two women, returning after casting votes met with a tragic end when a speeding car hit them. 55-year-old Rekha Dhiman, Rukhmani Dhiman and Yashpal, 43, were killed in Sorana village. Four others were injured. While in Agra, police arrested 26 people, including two village pradhan candidates, after they allegedly looted two ballot boxes from a polling booth after a clash amid allegations of fake voting in Rihavali village. Talking to TOI, Agra’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Muniraj G, said, “They (the accused) will also be booked under NSA. The ballot boxes will also be recovered soon. Police force has been deployed in the area to avoid any untoward incident.” “During the clash, three persons including village pradhan candidates Malkhan Singh and Layak Singh were injured,” said SP (East) K Venkat Ashok. Agra’s district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said that sub-divisional magistrate and police personnel were present when the incident took place between the two groups. “We are sending a report to the election commission regarding the incident. Date for re-poll will be decided by them accordingly,” he said. Another ballot box was looted in Agra’s Chandsaura village as the polling was drawing to a close at 6pm. In Rampur, DM and SP rushed to Bilaspur area after allegation of bogus voting “to provide advantage to BJP-backed” candidates. Security has been tightened around the polling booths and all the voters were cross-checked, said a senior official. Situated on the border of UP and Uttarakhand, Bilaspur has a large Sikh population. In most of its villages, BJP-backed candidates were facing opposition. Two persons from this area have lost their lives during the protests against the farm laws. Block president Ravinder Kaur told TOI, “They had captured the booth and were casting fake votes. My husband Ujjawal Deedar Singh is contesting for BDC from here. We were not allowed to deploy an agent on the booth to keep an eye. I was also not allowed to stay at the booth. I have raised this issue with the election commission and senior police officers. I hope that they will cancel the elections at Ramnagar booth number 273.” But BJP minister and MLA from Bilaspur constituency, Baldev Singh Aulakh, told TOI, “Ujjawal Deedar Singh and his supporters had opened fire at few people campaigning for my brother. One of them sustained a pellet injury as well which is why an FIR was registered. They didn’t get any booth agent because their agent was from another village.” Violence was also reported after polling in Hathras’s Tharora village. Locals attacked Sehpau police station and pelted stones on police personnel. One policeman was thrashed. According to sources, several residents of the village turned violent after one person, who was allegedly picked up by the police, was allegedly beaten up by policemen. ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna said exact details were not immediately available and that he has sought information on it. “The situation was now under control. Additional police force has been deployed in the area to avoid any further escalation of violence,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/stray-incidents-of-arson-clashes-booth-capturing-mark-1st-phase-of-panchayat-polls-in-west-up/articleshow/82090246.cms||Sandeep Rai

The seven-year-old boy was allegedly kidnapped by an ice-cream seller near Hathoda village on Wednesday evening. Using mobile surveillance, police managed to recover the boy and arrested the kidnapper, Deepak Gupta, 20. Depak told police that he was married to the kidnapped boy’s aunt Tarannum in Ludhiana. Recently, Tarannum came to Shahjahanpur along with their son and refused to return home, said Deepak, adding that he then kidnapped his brother-in-law’s son to ensure his wife returned home with their nine-month-old son. Additional SP (city) Sanjay Kumar told TOI, “After receiving information about the kidnapping, we deployed two teams and managed to recover the boy within 12 hours. It was a blind case as the name of the accused was not known initially. After gathering information, we managed to find the location of the accused. He was hiding in Mukarampur Piparia village and was planning to take the boy to Sitapur when we arrested him.” “Accused Deepak is a resident of Sitapur and he is a distant relative of the victim. He was thinking the victim’s father was the reason behind his marital discord, “he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-kidnaps-brother-in-laws-son-after-wife-refuses-to-return-with-son-arrested/articleshow/82087383.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Principal secretary of the disaster management department Asim Kumar Gupta has written to the Union government to disburse at least 25% of the amount for various Covid-19 management measures, including oxygen supply, procurement of remdesivir and other infrastructure costs.“The first instalment normally comes by June, but we are seeking an early sanction of funds so that we can take the measures,” Gupta told TOI.Nearly Rs 800 crore is expected as the first instalment. The funds were disbursed in April last year as well due to the pandemic and the total expenditure was about Rs 8,000 crore, stated Gupta. He said that the state would need the amount to purchase oxygen supply and various other infrastructure issues under the SDRF. Gupta added that it would be better if the Union releases the funds as early as possible as it would stretch the state budget. “We are hoping that they allocate the same soon,” he saidRecently, the state also wrote to the centre to treat the pandemic as a calamity. Officials said that only if the pandemic is defined as a natural calamity can individual benefits be given.The SDRF, constituted under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, is the primary fund available with state governments to respond to notified disasters. While the Union government contributes 75% towards SDRF allocation, the state would contribute the remaining amount. The amount remaining in the fund from last year is being used to build infrastructure, such as setting up Covid-19 centres, buying oxygen and medicines, among others. On April 15, the central government had directed the states to use 50% of their funds for specific items, considering the surge in cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-to-seek-25-of-disaster-management-fund-in-advance/articleshow/82091450.cms||Nisha Nambiar

He was picked up by one of his associates, who in turn dropped him at Zaheerabad on a bike.

Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said, “The public witnesses in the matter are residents of the same locality and the possibility of applicants threatening or intimidating them if released on bail at this stage cannot be ruled out.” It further noted, “The intensity and magnitude of the (northeast Delhi) riots can be gathered from the fact that 53 innocent lives were lost and a lot of public and private property was damaged/vandalised and looted and several vehicles, houses and business establishments were set on fire. These riots were part of a large-scale conspiracy hatched at various levels all over Delhi in the aftermath of enactment of CAA and NRC and the same did not take place spontaneously.” Sadiq and Shahnawaz had sought bail on the ground of parity as a co-accused had been allowed bail by Delhi High Court. Their counsel also cited the “long time” the trial was going to take. The prosecution argued that Sadiq was identified in a footage as wearing a yellow T-shirt and a pair of jeans and moving towards the scene of crime, where the policemen were allegedly assaulted. Shahnawaz was stated to have an audio clip on his phone, where he could reportedly be heard talking to a co-accused and admitting having thrown stones at police personnel. The judge said the bail applications of several co-accused, Mohd Ibrahim, Badrul Hasan, Mohd Arif, Shadab Ahmad and Mohd Saleem Khan and Mohd Furkan, assigned similar roles, have already been dismissed by this court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cop-murder-court-rejects-bail-to-two-riot-accused/articleshow/82091459.cms||---

Irked with the lack of coordination between PWD and the WRD, and the numerous excuses, Khaunte issued an ultimatum to the state government to release water within five days. He did not specify what his next step would be if the government failed to do so. “Tall promises, whether made in the assembly or outside, are not being fulfilled. Many parts of Porvorim, Soccoro, Penha de Franca and Salvador do Mundo face water scarcity,” said Khaunte. “The chief minister said that by March 31 this plant will be operational, but today on April 15, the plant has yet to get raw water from Tillari.” Khaunte said that the PWD is unable to ensure that the constituency gets regular water supply. He also accused the BJP of delaying the commissioning of the plant for political reasons. He also said that if the plant is not commissioned quickly, Porvorim will face an acute water shortage in April and May. “This plant was built because water from the Assanora plant is not sufficient. Now, PWD says that they don’t even have water to test the treatment plant. Tall promises, whether made in the assembly or outside, are not being fulfilled.

---||Ahmedabad||HC flays Gujarat government for ‘tsunami of corona’||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court rapped the state government for not heeding its earlier directions to remain cautious about an anticipated surge in Covid-19 cases. The HC reminded the government of the lapse after advocate general Kamal Trivedi said the present surge is like ‘a tsunami of corona’. During the hearing on Thursday, the bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia reminded the state government of its earlier order, passed in the suo motu petition filed last year, in which it anticipated a surge in Covid-19 cases as was seen in western countries and directed the state government to stay prepared with adequate Covid hospitals, beds, testing facilities and directed it to strictly enforce Covid safety protocols in public behaviour. The chief justice read out the directions and said, “All these suggestions were apparently not given due attention, and the result is this. Even people are taking it very lightly.” He added, “If this (earlier direction) was considered earlier, as for the situation now a little more of a push was required, if all these things had been done a little earlier, the situation would have been better.” Advocate general Kamal Trivedi explained to the court how the guard was lowered on various fronts, but the government is now fighting a war, and requested the court to see that people do not treat the government as irresponsible. While describing a move to reduce queues of ambulances outside Civil Hospital, he told the court, “Sometimes we get totally lost in the process...but the intention is not bad.” He accused the press of projecting that the government has bad intentions. To this, the chief justice replied that it was never a statement from the press. The press is saying that the government is not alive to the situation as it should have been. The CJ reminded the state government of the warnings issued by the Centre and said, “You have to go full throttle to control the situation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-flays-state-government-for-tsunami-of-corona/articleshow/82090396.cms||---

---||Agra||‘We never fought for hospitals but only temples & mosques,’ Aligarh SDM posts on FB, deletes soon||Agra: With the number of Covid-19 positive cases and the resultant toll rising at an alarming rate in the country, putting excessive pressure on the healthcare infrastructure and crematoria, Iglas sub-divisional magistrate in Aligarh district in a bid to merit people’s attention to the present-day political reality wrote on his Facebook post that “space crunch at hospitals is a reality” while adding that “we never fought for a hospital, we only fought for temples and mosques, which are closed today”. The SDM, however, deleted the post soon but, by the time, five people had shared it, 117 liked and 42 commented on it. “There is nothing new in what I wrote. Such posts are everywhere,” responded SDM Kuldev Singh when TOI contacted him. The SDM, however, did not give a satisfactory answer for the reason behind the post which he claimed to be “innocuous”. “Whether people admit it openly or not, but it’s a reality,” said Prof Aftab Alam of Aligarh Muslim University, adding, what the SDM wrote “is a general feeling of the people today”. “The Covid situation is alarming and the matters that should have been addressed urgently are not even on the priority list. The day-to-day issues such as healthcare infrastructure, education, among others, are not even on the poll agenda. The focus is, rather, on the caste, religion, temple and mosques,” added Prof Alam. Hailing the SDM’s FB post as “a reality”, social activist Maria Alam Umar said he didn’t say anything wrong. “At least a few officials have the guts to reflect on the reality amid this moment of crisis when people are dying every day due to the lack of healthcare infrastructure,” said Umar, adding that he presented “a clear picture before the government, which is the need of the hour”. Requesting anonymity, an official with the Aligarh district administration said any right-thinking person would express similarly as the SDM had done. People were penalised for not wearing masks and being exhorted to stay home even at the cost of their livelihood, but look at the election rallies and religious gatherings, where all Covid protocols were thrown to the wind, he added. A BJP youth neta, Nishit Sharma, however, doesn’t seem to be convinced with the SDM’s sentiments. “There is no comparison between temples-mosques and healthcare infrastructure. These are separate issues and should not be mixed. The government is trying its best. We should have faith.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/we-never-fought-for-hospitals-but-only-temples-mosques-aligarh-sdm-posts-on-fb-deletes-soon/articleshow/82090298.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

They also demanded that the meeting be livestreamed to ensure transparency. “If the media is not allowed in and it is not broadcast live, we will not come for the meeting,” said taxi union leader Chetan Kamat. To counter allegations that the union leaders tend to compromise with the Goa government, they said that they would not participate in the meeting but would send their wives and 10 other representatives to meet Godinho. “We will send a delegation of some of our wives and some of our boys to meet the government but it has to be live,” he said Kamat said that the government was trying to waste time and test the patience of the tourist taxi operators. Godinho has invited the taxi operators for a meeting on Tuesday but he has asked them to come for the meeting with an open mind and without any preconditions. Godinho has also made it clear that while he is not in favour of GoaMiles, the option of scrapping the app-based service is also not viable. The transport minister has hinted that the counter allotted to GoaMiles at the Goa International Airport may be withdrawn. This has done little to appease the agitating taxi owners who were joined by their families on Thursday. “We want GoaMiles totally scrapped. By removing the counter at the airport the government is not doing us a great favour. Removing the counter will only benefit Mauvin because his taxis run from the airport. Our demand has been to scrap GoaMiles for the last four years,” said Kamat. Tourist taxi union leader Bappa Korgaonkar said that till the state government takes a decision to scrap GoaMiles, the agitation at Azad Maidan in Panaji will continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cab-drivers-want-meet-with-mauvin-to-be-livestreamed/articleshow/82091467.cms||---
---||Pune||IB cancels Grade 12 exam, plans ‘tasks’ for Grade 10||PUNE: The International Baccalaureate (IB) board on Thursday announced that the May 2021 examinations for all schools in India offering IB diploma programme (Grade 12) will not be held this year, and the middle years programme (Grade 10) will be given an ‘alternative tasks’. According to the IB website, there are 188 affiliated schools in the country with 146 offering the diploma programme. In Pune, at least 12 schools in the district offer IB education. Since the examinations cannot be conducted in schools, the IB has created advanced alternative task assessments for Grade 10 students to complete online at home. Grades will be based on their performance, along with the portfolios and personal projects. The announcement about the exams comes against the background of the Covid-19 situation across the country. IB has found a way to hold Grade 10 exams when the CBSE has cancelled the standard X exam and the state board has postponed both the HSC and SSC exams, and is rethinking its decision to hold them. Robbin Ghosh, president of Victorious Kidss Educares, an IB school in Pune, said, the board has decided on students’ assessments to implement the alternate task route. “The IB has come up with technological advancements and assessment criteria that can help the examiners to adopt assessments to promote deeper learning skills that students need in a knowledge-based economy,” Ghosh added. Sandeep Chhabra, principal of Indus International, said, “IB has cancelled sit-down exams due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation in India. In Grade 12, there is a well-defined process of internal assessments which are externally assessed. This, along with the predicted grade submitted by the school, will enable awarding of grades to the outgoing batch,” he said. To strengthen predicted grade accuracy globally for schools on both routes (exam and non-exam), the IB has provided schools with customised predicted grade distributions for each subject. The Maharashtra education department had written to the IB board to reconsider the dates for their examinations.IB had simultaneously also consulted schools to seekfeedback about the on-ground situation. “We intend that the results of students in India should be awarded using coursework marks and predicted grades for the May 2021 session, as described in the awarding model outlined in February,” said the board in an official statement. The May series last year too could not be conducted due to the pandemic and students were awarded in a similar pattern. “Conducting examinations is the most reliable way to assess students’ achievements, but the decision was taken considering the safety of students and teachers. It may not benefit all the students. We will know the impact after the results. Last year too, most parents were upset with the results,” said the principal of an IB school in Mumbai .

She was pregnant for three months. Police have launched a manhunt for the accused, who have gone into hiding. The Thally police identified the deceased as A Venkatalakshmi, of Varathegoundanthotty village. “It was only recently that she got married to Seena, 27, of Malur in Karnataka, and moved to her husband’s place. She came home on Tuesday to celebrate the festival with her parents.” On Wednesday evening, a police officer said, the woman’s father Arunachalam, 60, had consumed alcohol. Her mother Maadevi, 54, scolded him for consuming liquor when his son-in-law and daughter had come home for celebrations. The duo subsequently entered into a heated argument. “Suddenly, Arunachalam took out a country-made gun from his room and Venkatalakshmi attempted to grab the weapon,” said Sangeetha, deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Denkanikottai division. “However, Arunachalam pulled the trigger with an intention to shoot his wife. His daughter suddenly came in their middle and the pellet pierced into her chest.” Hearing the gunshot, neighbours rushed to the spot and found Venkatalakshmi in a pool of blood. They rushed her to the primary health centre at Anchetty, where doctors declared her brought dead. The DSP said Arunachalam had managed to escape from the house after murdering his daughter. “We have registered a case and initiated the inquiry. A search is on for the accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-60-aims-at-wife-shoots-pregnant-daughter-to-death/articleshow/82091464.cms||---

Sandeep Patil, the sub-divisional engineer of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), told TOI on Saturday, “The survey is the first step towards land acquisition. We have been conducting meetings with farmers on regular intervals and explaining to them the importance of the project, compensation aspect, etc. This exercise has cleared many doubts of farmers. As a result, we could carry out the survey smoothly.” "We have made a comprehensive presentation, which is being shown during meetings with farmers. The compensation will be given on the lines of the Samruddhi expressway project," said a senior MSRDC official. During the survey, a team of officials from the MSRDC and land acquisition department recorded condition of the land and existing properties in the form of well, house, trees, among others. “Based on our findings and three years’ land deals, the state town planning department would decide the compensation amount for the farmers. Since the survey is done under camera, there wouldn’t be any confusion in future,” added Patil. The road /project, as per the estimation, requires about 763 hectares of land in 38 villages of these tehsils. The state government has already approved the project and made a budgetary provision of Rs26,000 crore for the work. The Western ring road will start from Urse village in Maval thesil, then it will go through villages of Mulshi, Haveli before connecting Mumbai-Bangalore highway at Kelavade village in Bhor tehsil. The land acquisition process for the eastern ring road is yet to be started. The road is aimed at reducing traffic congestion in Pimpri Chinchwad and Pune civic limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msrdc-completes-land-survey-in-haveli-mulshi-for-ring-road/articleshow/82091474.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Debate over different curbs on, BJP blames Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar||PUNE: The debate over the district having different night curfew timings compared to the rest of Maharashtra till May 1 continued on Thursday with state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil blaming NCP leader and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar for the arrangements. On Wednesday, the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations and the district collector’s office released identical orders, retaining the 6pm-7am night curfew timing on weekdays from Monday to Friday, besides the weekend lockdown from 6pm on Friday to 7am on Monday, till May 1. The rest of Maharashtra is, however, following the 8pm-7am night curfew timing as per the “Break the Chain” order released on April 13 by state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte. Patil, who represents Kothrud in the Assembly, said Pawar was “treating Pune as his fiefdom” and “unnecessarily separating Pune out of the state with such differential treatment, causing hardships to its citizens”. He said, “The timing of restrictions in Pune should be increased up to 8pm, like other parts of the state. The restrictions in Pune are not suitable when industries are allowed to function. It becomes difficult for the working people to reach home by 6pm.” Pawar, who is also the Pune district guardian minister, was not available for his comment on the issue and calls and text messages to him remained unanswered till the time of going to the press. NCP Rajya Sabha member Vandana Chavan, however, told TOI that she did not mind Pune going through a stricter regime because active Covid-19 cases were high in the district. “The difference of two hours regarding restrictions is important for us, as we need to control the crowd. The people of Pune should cooperate with the administration, as the restrictions are for only a fortnight. We need to break the chain of infection and bring down the case positive rate by imposing stricter restrictions,” she said. Senior BJP leader and Pune Girish Bapat told TOI that he had raised the same issue at previous meetings. “Why should there be two different timings? If other districts can follow the 8pm guidelines, Pune should be no exception,” he said. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said he was not even consulted before the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) decided to retain the earlier timings. “While the local self government bodies can take a call following the state government’s order, the PMC administration did not consult me about continuing with the previous timings,” he said. His Pimpri Chinchwad counterpart, Usha Dhore, said a separate set of restrictions for Pune were affecting the workers’ movement and she would discuss with the officials concerned on the possiblty to stick to state government’s orders. Member of Pune Platform for Covid Relief Pradeep Bhargava said the district was “singled out” and the longer hours of restrictions appeared “unfair”. He said, “It is causing inconveniences and disrupting essential work. If I am from a district with a much lower positivity rate and spread, as compared to cities such as Pune and Mumbai, I will seek lesser hours of restrictions. If we go by the intensity of spread and the logic that such restrictions bring down the infecion, then Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur should be in the same league.” Relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Gupta said one could not generalise the situation in any district. “The state government issues the guidelines and the local authorities have to take a call, depending on the situation at their level. They, however, cannot water down the guidelines. People should realise that the situation in Pune is different from any other place. If the local administration wants to bring in more restrictions, we have to allow them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/debate-over-different-curbs-timings-rages-bjp-blames-pawar/articleshow/82091477.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Over 100 Covid deaths for 2nd day, positivity rate soars to 20%||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 112 Covid-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, the second day running when more than 100 individuals have succumbed to the insidious infection in the city. Thursday's is the second highest toll in a single day across the country after Maharashtra, which reported 349 deaths. On Wednesday, 104 people had died due to Covid in Delhi. The rise in the daily death toll comes at a time when the hospitals are witnessing near collapse with the infrastructure and resources swamped by the humongous patient burden as the infection continues to spread faster than ever. On Thursday, the state health department said 16,699 persons tested positive out of total 82,569 tests conducted in 24 hours, a positivity rate of 20.2%, meaning one in every five persons who got tested proved positive. “This is a super spreader virus,” exclaimed Dr Shamsher Dwivedee, head of Covid Task Force, VIMHANS. “It has caused a cloudburst of cases and in the absence of ready infrastructure and manpower lead to more deaths.” Dwivedee added that VIMHANS didn’t have a single ICU bed available now for Covid patients. Delhi has 54,309 active Covid cases, according to data shared by the state health department shows. Of them, 26,974 (50%) are in home isolation, while 14,269 (26%) are being treated in hospitals and a few in the Covid health centres and Covid care centres. The total containment zones in Delhi currently stand at 8,661.Though Delhi government has attached some hotels to hospitals as additional Covid facilities, doctors say it isn’t easy to get the extra manpower to manage patients in hotels when medical staff are already overworked in managing admitted patients. AIIMS, Safdarjung and Lok Nayak hospitals are seeing a steady influx of infected individuals. “People rush to hospital when the oxygen saturation is very low. Some of them aren’t able to maintain respiration despite oxygen support and need a non-invasive ventilator or conventional ventilator,” noted Dr Arun Gupa, president, Delhi Medical Council. “Such facilities are scarce and I fear many of them may not be able to access them all though the government is making all effort to increase critical care beds.” As of Thursday evening, there were only 164 ventilator beds left for Covid patients in the city hospitals. The number of vacant Covid ICU beds stood at 290. However, families of many patients are still having problems related to information about Covid beds. This is worrying, because, as a doctor said, “There is no sign of the current wave of infection ending anytime soon. People need to follow extreme precaution to avoid picking up the Covid coronavirus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-100-deaths-for-2nd-day-positivity-rate-soars-to-20/articleshow/82091494.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Goa||Ahead of no-trust, HC stays disqualification hearing of councillor||Panaji: A day before the no-confidence motion is scheduled against Sakhali Municipal Council (SMC) chairperson Yeshwant Madkar, the high court of Bombay at Goa stayed the disqualification proceedings against Raya Parsekar before minister for urban development Milind Naik on Thursday afternoon and sought a reply from the minister. Petitioner Rajesh Sawal said a complaint was filed against him stating that he stands disqualified to continue as councillor. While the high court had directed the meeting to consider the no-confidence motion on April 16, the minister fixed the hearing for Thursday at 2.30pm. Expecting an unfavourable order, Sawal had approached the high court seeking relief. The court said that disqualification of an elected councillor is a serious matter and even the statute requires that such a councillor be given a reasonable opportunity before he is held guilty of any misconduct in the discharge of his duties, or any disgraceful conduct. “The allegations of malafide may have to be examined but having regard to the entirety of the facts and circumstances, we are satisfied that the proceedings scheduled before the minister on Thursday at 12.30pm are required to be stayed until the next date, which shall now be April 19, 2021,” the court said. Meanwhile, Congress alleged that the chief minister is “frustrated with the imminent defeat of chairperson Yeshwant…” and has now “stooped to a new low” by serving a notice to opposition councillor Raya Parsekar asking him to appear for the hearing at 12.30pm at Vasco while the no-confidence motion hearing is at 2.30pm the same day. Opposition Digambar Kamat said the BJP government was out to “murder democracy in Sakhali municipality” despite the high court “setting things in order”. “Right to vote is a constitutional right of every councillor and the government can’t take it away by adopting dirty tricks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ahead-of-no-trust-hc-stays-disqualification-hearing-of-councillor/articleshow/82092586.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Tempo driver, owner held in 3-month-old hit-&-run case||Pune: A tempo driver was arrested on Wednesday, three months after the death of a motorcyclist in a hit-and-run accident close to Jejuri. The driver, Chandrakant Nikam, was taken into custody from Turbhe with the help of the local police. A crime branch team of the Pune rural police, led by senior inspector Padmakar Ghanwat, arrested the tempo owner, Utttam Nikam of Purandar. Namdeo Khenat (36), an employee of a private company, was knocked down by a commercial vehicle coming from the wrong side on the Jejuri-Saswad Road around 9.30pm on January 9 when he was returning home on his motorcycle. Khenat had died on the spot.  “No one could note down the registration number of the errant vehicle because of the darkness at night,” Ghanwat said. “Our team collected CCTV footage from the temples, establishments and restaurants along the Saswad-Jejuri Road and identified the vehicle involved in the accident. But its registration number was not clear. We could decipher only the last three digits of the number,” he said. Ghanwat said the police had shared the three digits with Khenat’s brother Sandip. “On Wednesday, Sandip noticed a commercial vehicle at the Bopdev Ghat with the last three digits of its registration number identical to that of the vehicle we identified from the CCTV footage. He immediately alerted us,” he said. Ghanwat said assistant inspector Sachin Kale and his team chased the vehicle and forced its driver to stop at Saswad. “Its owner, Uttam Nikam, admitted during the questioning that his vehicle had knocked down a motorcyclist while trying to overtake a truck about three months ago. He also said Chandrakant Nikam was driving the vehicle,” Ghanwat said. “The investigation revealed that Uttam Nikam had made some changes in the vehicle after the accident. He repaired the damages caused during the accident so that no one could identify it,” Ghanwat said. In a similar case, initially what was thought to be a hit-and-run, turned out to be a case of murder.  The death of two women after a hit-and-run accident on April 1 involving a car at Nira in Purandar taluka, about 55km from the city, was a murder plot hatched by the paramour of one of the victims, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tempo-driver-owner-held-in-3-month-old-hit-run-case/articleshow/82091479.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Pune||Health freaks fret over restrictions||Pune: Citizens with health conditions have criticized the recent curbs in the state and the city where morning walks, jogging and cycling have not been allowed due to the rule that people can only step out for essential purposes. Many citizens said health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, or back or joint pain required regular exercise, which could not be done at home or on the premises of housing societies due to space issues. Aundh resident Chirag Baxi, who is suffering from hypertension with type 2 diabetes mellitus, said, “ All diabetics and people with implants have to exercise daily, else their condition tends to deteriorate. The government should consider this and allow people to take morning walks in a fixed time period, 6am-8am, for health reasons. People should be allowed to walk alone and not in groups.” Baxi said the senior citizens wanted to walk or cycle for health reasons, but were now scared because of the latest curbs. Working professional Sumit Chattopadhyay said, “I have been cycling for health reasons since 2018. I start at 5:30am and finish by 7:30am. During this period, there are very few people on the road. So the risk of Covid transmission is minimal. I have high blood pressure and cycling has helped me very much in calming this condition and losing weight. My doctor said I could also go off medication if I consistently follow my cycling regime. But the latest restrictions have become a problem. I haven’t been able to follow my regime after last Thursday.” Rahul Desale, a senior marketing manager at a city-based firm, who has been cycling and jogging alternately since the past 2.5 years for health reasons, said, “So many orders have come in the past few days saying different things. The gyms are closed, so we cannot exercise there. Now citizens cannot use open spaces for exercise. It is not possible to jog on the society premises because one needs to have a different terrain for this, otherwise it can cause an ankle injury. One can also not cycle on the society premises due to lack of open spaces.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-freaks-fret-over-restrictions/articleshow/82091484.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Goa||Speaker’s verdict on Congress, MGP petitions likely on April 20||PANAJI: The speaker of the Goa legislative assembly, Rajesh Patnekar, on Thursday issued notices to Congress president Girish Chodankar and MGP’s senior leader Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar to be present in his chamber on April 20 in the disqualification petitions filed against 10 former Congress MLAs and two ex-MGP MLAs. Patnekar is likely to pass an order on April 20, on both disqualification petitions. Patnekar recently told the Supreme Court (SC) that he would pass a final judgment in the disqualification petitions against 10 former Congress MLAs and two ex-MGP MLAs on April 20, instead of April 29. The SC has now fixed the matter for April 22. Congress had filed the petition before the apex court seeking a direction to expedite the disqualification petition filed against its 10 former MLAs. The application filed before the speaker by the 10 former Congress MLAs for cross-examination of Chodankar and the application for leading evidence are dismissed, while the application for extension of time to file a written statement is allowed. The 10 former Congress MLAs have already filed their replies. In August 2019, Congress had filed a disqualification petition before the speaker against the 10 MLAs who quit the party and joined BJP in July. Chodankar, who had filed the plea, had sought that the 10 MLAs be restrained from attending assembly proceedings and holding constitutional posts till the case was decided by the speaker. MGP had also filed a disqualification petition against deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar, who had quit the party to join BJP in March 2019. It may be recalled that on July 10, 2019, rebel Congress MLAs led by deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar joined BJP claiming that Congress legislature party had split. The other nine MLAs were Isidore Fernandes, Nilkanth Halarnkar, Jennifer Monserrate, Antonio Fernandes, Francisco Silveira, Wilfred D’Sa, Clafasio Dias, Filipe Neri Rodrigues and Atanasio Monserrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/speakers-verdict-on-congress-mgp-petitions-likely-on-april-20/articleshow/82091490.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Kerala CM must handle minority department’||KOTTAYAM: Stepping up its demand for making the functioning of the minority welfare department of the government non-discriminatory, transparent and just, the Catholic Church in the state has said that the chief minister should handle the department from the next government onwards. Interestingly, the Jagratha Samithi of the Changanassery diocese has raised the demand soon after the resignation of minister K T Jaleel who handled the minority welfare department in the Pinarayi Vijayan ministry. The church has made the demand after assessing the performance of the department in the current LDF and the previous UDF governments. It was Manjalamkuzhi Ali of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) who was in charge of the department under Oommen Chandy government. A letter has been sent from the church headquarters to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, LDF convenor A Vijayaraghavan, former chief minister Oommen Chandy, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, UDF convenor M M Hasan, KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran and the leaders of political parties which are the constituents of both the political fronts. One of the major concerns raised by the church was the 80:20 ratio in the utilization of the funds for the formulation and implementation of projects for the welfare of minorities. "As much as 80% of funds are being used for the welfare of the Muslim community and only 20% is used for the rest of the minority communities. We have been raising this issue for years. This is an unjust practice," said Joji Chirayil, PRO of the diocese. The church has also been raising its objections on the amendments made to the Kerala State Commission for minorities in 2017. Chirayil said the Catholic Church wants the chairman post of the commission to be made rotational so that all minority communities will get a representation. The church has also raised concerns over the appointment of officers under the minority welfare department. The Catholic Church had earlier come out in the open slamming IUML for opposing the state government’s decision to implement economic reservation. Changanassery archbishop Joseph Perumthottam, in a strongly-worded article, had said that it was sad that some communal forces are opposing reservation for the economically weaker sections without any valid reasons. He had also opined that one needs to suspect that IUML’s policies are becoming a threat to other communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-must-handle-minority-dept-church/articleshow/82090332.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Pune||Stop high-flow oxygen for Covid patients: Task force||Pune: The state Covid-19 task force has now advised doctors to use non-invasive ventilation, instead of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) cannula, as the latter method consumes more oxygen while treating patients with respiratory distress. The new advisory is a response to the increasing demand for liquid medical oxygen in the state. "Stop the use of HFNO machines until further notice. The HFNO machines use a very large quantity of oxygen, sometimes up to 80 litres per minute," Sanjay Oak, chief of the task force said in the advisory released on April 12. In Pune district, the daily requirement of liquid medical oxygen has touched 340 metric tonnes (MT). The district, currently, can supply 383 MT to hospitals, drawn from three plants in Pune and one 28-MT plant in Kolhapur. Demand then is fast reaching critical levels. Oxygen therapy for Covid comes in four forms: via regular oxygen masks, the HFNO, non-invasive ventilation and through invasive/mechanical ventilation. "The HFNO is excellent for seriously ill Covid patients. But many hospitals have already reduced its use as oxygen supply has gone haywire in Pune," said Mukund Penurkar, secretary of Associations of Physicians of India (API), Pune branch. Unlike non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilators that require a central oxygen system (piped gas by the patient's side), HFNO can be administered using oxygen cylinders. But small hospitals have stopped using it as the method is cumbersome and financially non-viable. "Ideally, HFNO also needs a central oxygen system. This is because we will have to change a jumbo cylinder quite frequently as HFNO takes 60 litres of oxygen per minute and a jumbo cylinder contains 1,000 litres of oxygen," said critical care expert Subhal Dixit, ICU director at Sanjeevan hospital. Very few critically ill patients actually need ventilators and among them, a tiny number can be treated using HFNO, instead of placing them on ventilators right away. "The HFNO is a beneficial method, but we need to regulate oxygen flow as per requirement. Sadly, this is not happening and there has been oxygen wastage," said Ruby Hall Clinic's chief intensivist, Kapil Zirpe. But HFNO plays a vital role when patients just cannot do with a regular oxygen mask. Approximately 20% of patients have reported hypoxia (breathlessness). The condition is usually cured via the mask. "But in some cases, oxygenation via a regular cannula (tube) is not enough to maintain blood oxygen levels. For such patients, the HFNO has proven to be beneficial. But the method has now taken a backseat," Zirpe said. Laxmikant Tapadia, a distributor of jumbo oxygen cylinders in Pune said, "Currently, my daily requirement is 100 jumbo cylinders. But I'm getting only up to 70 cylinders now. This has been the situation for more than a week. The worst hit are small and medium-sized hospitals."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stop-high-flow-oxygen-for-covid-patients-task-force/articleshow/82091507.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Kochi||Spike in cases: Authorities to tighten curbs, increase testing in Kerala||KOCHI: With Covid-19 cases rising like anything, authorities are planning to enhance testing, increase infrastructure and strictly enforce restrictions. Thrikkakara municipality has been declared a sensitive area, while pace of spread of the virus is fast in many other local bodies. The district administration has asked all the local bodies to chalk out action plan for containing the spread of the pandemic. “We have been trying to conduct maximum tests. In the next two days, we will be conducting 31,000 tests,” district collector S Suhas said. As many as 10 mobile teams for conducting tests have been floated and they have been provided with adequate facilities, including vehicles.  “We advise all people above 45 years to get vaccinated at the earliest. Public should use private healthcare institutions also for getting tested,” he said. Kochi corporation authorities have convened an all-party meeting for discussing the action plan. “We have convened the meeting on Friday. Based on suggestions at the meeting, a draft plan will be prepared and will be fine-tuned with the help of experts,” said mayor M Anil Kumar. A total of 8,823 tests have been conducted in the district on Thursday and the test positive rate on the day is 14.36%. More than 30% of the total ICUs in all the hospitals in the district are occupied. There are 214 ICU beds in the district and of these, 88 are in government sector. There are 64 ventilators in the government hospitals and 62 in private hospitals.  “We are planning to open Covid facilities at district hospital, Aluva, on Friday. There will be 100 oxygen-supported beds. The functioning of the Covid facility will be full-fledged in a year. The PVS Hospital, Kaloor, has 20 ICU beds. We are planning to increase this to 60. Given the pace of the spread of the virus, we will require more facilities,” an official with the health department said. The collector has asked employers to go back to operating their firms using 50% strength of employees. The remaining 50% should work from home. The collector conducted a meeting of merchants and hoteliers on Thursday. They have promised to deliver food and other items to customers after 9pm, Suhas said. The district administration is not planning to introduce any restrictions in beaches. “But, people should follow proper social distancing and other Covid-19 protocol while in beaches. The maximum number of people who can assemble indoors for a function is 100, while it is 200 in open spaces,” Suhas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/spike-in-cases-authorities-to-tighten-curbs-increase-testing/articleshow/82090336.cms||---

While Kotagiri taluk had received a few showers in March, Ooty had been experiencing a prolonged dry spell. Locals have been waiting for the summer showers since the first week of April, mainly for sufficient drinking water supply. While the core part of Ooty town received good rain, the surrounding areas witnessed moderate showers. The Coonoor town had experiencing good showers in the past two days. While Coonoor registered 19.5mm rainfall for 24 hours ending Thursday 7am, Hulical in Coonoor taluk received 21mm rainfall. Kodanadu recorded 16mm and Devala 22mm of rain. “Waterbodies and reservoirs in and around Ooty town received good rainfall. We expect a few more summer showers during this month,” an Ooty municipality official said. According to horticulture officials, the rain is beneficial for plants in the botanical and rose gardens in Ooty. “The standing vegetable crops are favoured by the good shower today,” an official said. Mercury had been fluctuating between 21 and 24 degrees Celsius, which is considered very warm in the hills, in the past weeks. On Thursday, with a cloudy sky, the maximum temperature recorded in Ooty was 18 degrees Celsius. Weather reports suggest that Ooty and surroundings would receive rain on Thursday night and Friday. “Water supply is a concern in the town during the summer. We hope for more showers in the coming weeks,” K Kumar, a resident of Ooty, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/summer-shower-cools-ooty/articleshow/82091496.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

I expect to get my money back soon as police have frozen the account before the fraudsters could withdraw the sum,” the complainant, who owns an industrial unit in Pimpri Chinchwad, said. The complainant said he had received a message on his cellphone in January. The message claimed that he had been chosen as a lucky customer by the telecom firm, which made him eligible to select a special SIM number. But when he tried to contact the number, there was no response. “The next day, I got a call from a man claiming to be the employee of the company. He asked me to take the opportunity, as there were very few special numbers left,” the businessman said, adding, “The caller asked me to transfer Rs 50,000 for the number, an amount which totalled Rs 66,000 post-tax (GST). I became suspicious when the person stopped accepting my calls after I transferred the amount to the said bank account via RTGS.” An offence was registered with the Wakad police under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Information and Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cybercrook-dupes-man-of-rs-66000-in-special-sim-deal/articleshow/82091488.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Ranchi||Campaigning ends, bypoll in Madhupur tomorrow||Ranchi: The high-pitched election campaigns at Madhupur assembly constituency for the April 17 bypoll came to an end on Thursday evening with both JMM and BJP remaining optimistic about their victory. As many as 3.22 lakh voters will exercise their franchise across 487 polling centres across the constituency on Saturday. Chief minister Hemant Soren, who was JMM’s star campaigner for party candidate Hafizul Hassan, flew back to Ranchi on Thursday afternoon. Hemant camped in Madhupur since April 9 and held five rallies in various blocks of Madhupur constituency and took part in public contact programmes as well. Hemant, who had been urging the electorate to vote for Hassan to strengthen his government, wrapped up his canvassing by paying tribute at the grave of late JMM stalwart Haji Hussain Ansari. Besides the chief minister, a battery of his ministers from the Congress party also canvassed for Hassan. While the mainstay of JMM’s canvassing was Haji’s legacy, Hemant attempted to woo the electorate by highlighting his government’s populist schemes, the management of Covid-19 pandemic’s first wave, employment generation under MGNERGS and criticising the Centre for the growing inflation. Meanwhile, BJP’s top guns, including its state president Deepak Prakash, legislative party leader Babulal Marandi, former chief minister Raghubar Das and others attempted to tilt the scales in the favour of their candidate Ganga Narayan Singh by criticising the incumbent government’s Covid-19 management, failure to generate employment for the youth and rising crime graph in the state. Prakash, who spoke to the media in Deoghar, said, “The CM has understood that the JMM candidate will lose. That is why his ministers are touring the constituency and offering money to voters. I have got information that JMM plans to misuse the government machinery. This is an election of paisa (money power) against pasina (hard work). BJP is fighting the polls with its hard work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/campaigning-ends-bypoll-in-madhupur-tomorrow/articleshow/82090730.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Decision to cancel exams, more curbs today, says J’khand CM||Ranchi: Amid the surge in Covid-19 cases and mounting casualties in the state, chief minister Hemant Soren on Thursday said his government will take a final decision on more restrictions and cancellation of the state board examinations on Friday. After returning to Ranchi following marathon bypoll campaigns in Madhupur on Thursday, Soren held a high-level meeting at his official residence to take stock of the Covid-19 situation. On the pendency of test reports, Soren said his government has decided to set up six RT-PCR labs in six districts and procure two COBAS machines (automated high-volume testing machine for Covid-19 virus) on a priority basis. The move follows complaints from people who said they have been facing delay in the recent week in getting their test reports. Health experts have said the delay in providing reports was one of the reasons for the spurt in cases. Soon after the high-level meeting, Soren said, "The pendency of Covid-19 test reports is an issue but we are acting fast to sort this out. We aim to test every person in the state and collected a huge number of samples. However, our labs are over-burdened and are unable to give the results in time. Hence, we have decided to add six more labs in Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Bokaro Chaibasa, Gumla and Sahebganj. Moreover, we are buying two COBAS machines for speedy results." On the issue of bed crisis, the chief minister said the problem is particularly in Ranchi because of the huge number of patients, including from other districts. "The government has now decided to set up 110 new ICUs in Rims and 750 more beds for Covid patients. Additionally, we have decided to take over CCL's 150-bed hospital in Ramgarh. This hospital will be under the jurisdiction of Rims so that patients from Ramgarh, Hazaribag and adjoining areas can be admitted there and still avail the services of Rims doctors," Soren said. The chief minister said he has scheduled another round of meeting on the situation on Friday to take several other important decisions. He said, “The CBSE has postponed its exams. We, too, have to take a call on the JAC board exams. Given the rise in the number of infections, we have to take more stringent steps to curb it. On Friday, expect some big decisions,” he said, stressing that the government has to move fast now because of the reverse migration witnessed in the state. “The Union government is running special trains for Jharkhand, UP, Bihar and Orissa so that people can return to their states easily. The migrants are coming back and we foresee a surge in infections. So, we are going to make some big decisions,” Soren added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/decision-to-cancel-exams-more-curbs-today-says-jkhand-cm/articleshow/82090744.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||207 Cov deaths in 1st half of April in J’khand, steeper rise expected||Ranchi: As many as 207 patients have succumbed to the Covid-19 virus in the first fortnight of April alone. Of them, 134 deaths have been reported between April 11 and April 14, making it the deadliest spell of the pandemic so far in Jharkhand. Between February 17 and March 31, the number of fatalities stood at 40 in cumulative. If public health experts and doctors treating the Covid 19 patients are to be believed, the death toll is expected to register a steep growth in the coming weeks. Dr Nishith Kumar of Ranchi’s Orchid Hospital, who has been treating Covid-19 patients since the outbreak of the pandemic, said the presence of mutated strains of the Covid-19 virus in Jharkhand is a major contributor to the rising deaths in the state. “During the first wave, most of the patients who succumbed to the infection were senior citizens and those above 50 years of age with co-morbidities. In the ongoing second wave, a major chunk of the patients who are being hospitalized are between 18 and 45 years of age, who have not been vaccinated yet. The mortality is even higher in this age group,” Kumar said. Another city-based doctor said, “The mutant strain is much more infectious than the first one. The mobile population, which is stepping out to work and study, is getting infected and in turn, is passing on the virus to the elder population at their homes, which is leading to a steep rise in casualties.” Dr Devesh Kumar, public health expert at Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), however said there is no scientific evidence to prove that the mutant strains found in Jharkhand are more lethal. “Last year, mildly symptomatic patients were also being admitted to the hospitals along with critical patients. Now, only critically-ill patients are being admitted, which is why the fatalities appear to be higher,” Kumar told TOI. As per Rims sources, of the 350 Covid-19 patients admitted there, nearly 240 are critical and on oxygen support. “With the number of active cases rising exponentially, the fatalities will increase too,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/207-cov-deaths-in-1st-half-of-april-in-jkhand-steeper-rise-expected/articleshow/82090760.cms||Dhritiman Ray

In a notification issued on Thursday, JAC said that further information in this regard would be shared soon. Notably, the practical examinations were underway since April 6. The decision of the state board came a day after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) postponed Class XII board examinations. Different sections of the civil society as well as political leaders, however, have urged the state government to altogether defer JAC Class X and Class XII main examinations, which are scheduled to start from May 4. Around seven lakh students are expected to appear in the board examinations across 2,150 centres in the state. Talking on the issue, JAC chairman Arvind Singh said: “The situation has worsened and it would be risky to conduct the examinations next month. However, we are awaiting directions from the government.” Congress MLA from Mahagama Deepika Pandey has requested chief minister Hemant Soren to defer the written examinations. In a letter, she requested the CM to take a decision immediately in the interest of the students. Jharkhand Parents Association (JPA) on Thursday also wrote a letter to the JAC demanding cancellation of the examinations to save the students and their parents from undue stress. JPA president Ajay Rai said that parents are concerned over the safety of their children due to the rising number of Covid cases. Rai said, “The fear is all the more palpable because not only scores of people are getting infected but they are also unable to get proper medical care.” Welcoming the CBSE’s decision, Private Schools and Children Welfare Association president Alok Kumar Dubey said the JAC should also promote the students of Class X and Class XII without making them take the examinations. He reasoned that students are apprehensive over taking the examinations amid deteriorating Covid situation. All Jharkhand Primary Teacher’s Association president Brijendra Choubey reiterated a similar demand. “Despite the precautionary measures, the students and the examiners would be under high risk.” Notably, primary teachers are also deputed for examination duties. The principal of Balkrishna High School, Divya Singh, said, “The written examinations must be postponed as the situation has worsened. Apart from the students, school staff are also quite afraid of participating in the examination process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/practicals-postponed-chorus-for-rescheduling-jac-written-exams-grows-louder/articleshow/82090771.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Currently, 340 contractual associate professors are associated with RU. The contractual professors also allege neglect despite performing several administrative works apart from teaching students. The professors, who are paid at the rate of Rs 600 per class, have not been given their salaries since March 2020, leading to financial crisis for many. Associate professor Sanjay Kumar said, “In view of the pandemic, RU had issued orders for online classes and has asked us to be present at the colleges between 10am and 4pm to conduct the classes. However, we were not provided with mobile phones, computers and internet connection. We are not even provided masks or a bottle of sanitizer.” Kumar added, “On April 9, a professor associated with the anthropology department of Simdega College died of Covid-19. We too run the risk of contracting the virus.” Professors said they have been facing issues since last year and all expenditure to hold classes were borne by them. However, when they presented the bills, they kept moving from one table to the other at RU and nobody was paid. Dr Rajan Mishra of Marwari college said financial condition of the teachers is pitiable. He said, “We are somehow running the online classes using our own mobile phones, tripods, laptops and data packs.” Nitin Mishra, a professor of Benaras Hindu University and K O College said he is hoping for early clearance of all his bills so that he can look for another job.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/profs-on-contract-at-ru-rue-delay-in-salary-disbursement/articleshow/82090779.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ghaziabad||Now, curfew from 8pm to 7am in Noida and Ghaziabad||LUCKNOW: Curfew timings in 10 districts with more than 2,000 active cases, including Noida, will now be from 8pm to 7am, instead of 10pm to 5am. Ghaziabad, which currently has 1,723 active cases, will also follow the new timings that were set to be enforced from Thursday night, officials said. According to a state government order, districts that report 100 or more cases a day or have more than 500 but less than 2,000 active cases will have the restrictions from 9pm to 6am. There are 27 districts in the state with 500 to 2,000 active cases, including Ghaziabad. As of Thursday evening, the 10 districts that have more than 2,000 active cases are Lucknow (35,865), Prayagraj (13,237), Varanasi (11,562), Kanpur (7,476), Gorakhpur (4,062), Jhansi (2,848), Meerut (2,756), Noida (2,334), Ballia (2,153) and Bareilly (2,013). Together, these 10 districts account for about 65% of the state’s 1,29,848 active cases. In Noida, two wholesale vegetable markets at Kasna and Dankaur will be shut for 24 hours till 3pm on Friday. “The two markets were sealed because of crowding. We will take strict action if we see violation of norms in market areas,” said Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY. GB Nagar currently has 2,334 active cases. In neighbouring Ghaziabad, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said the new timings would be followed from Thursday. “The restrictions will be the same as before. Officials from the district administration have been deputed in different places and SHOs of respective police stations have been entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that the guidelines are followed,” he said. The extension of the night curfew timings has evoked mixed response from traders and residents. Anirudh Vasistha from Vaishali Udyog Vyapar Mandal, a traders’ body, said: “The surge is evident and we will follow the new timings. But we also want to say that if this continues, our businesses will suffer. We suggest that a decision is taken after assessing the situation for a week.” Vikas Singh, an Indirapuram resident, said the new timing is difficult to follow for those going to work. “Since it is not a total lockdown, many people are going to work. Several people return around 8pm and now, they will get stuck and might have to face unnecessary harassment on the road for not following the directive,” he said. On April 7, the government had authorised district magistrates of places that are either reporting more than 100 cases a day or have more than 500 but less than 2,000 active cases, to decide on restricting movement as long as it does not impact essential services. The move came after the high court asked the state government to consider implementing night curfew. Several districts, including Lucknow, announced night restrictions within the next couple of days. “The number of districts following the new timings will change, depending on the number of cases being reported. However, it will be ensured that no essential activities are affected because of that,” said a government spokesperson.

---||Goa||Porvorim relies on three Ts as its numbers surge||PANAJI: With a daily average of about 40 new cases, the Porvorim primary health center that oversees the health of about 42,000 people under its jurisdiction, has been fighting a tough battle for the past several days. On Thursday, its caseload shot to 558 with over 70 infections detected. It has been left with no option than to scrupulously follow three Ts — tracking, testing, and treatment — to stem the infection chain. The centre comes after Margao, which has the highest caseload in the state. Health officer at the Porvorim primary health centre, Dr Vikas Naik said that the rise in cases in Porvorim is on the same lines as seen in other urban places such as Margao, Candolim, Ponda and Panaji where the surge has been high owing to a heavy movement of people. “These are the worst-hit areas. This time the infectivity rate is high. When there is a heavy movement of people the chances of infection spreading is also high, especially if people are not following Covid-appropriate behavior,” he said. Porvorim, Naik said, is not just a residential area, but also has a lot of commercial establishments as well as government offices. Besides, people from other parts visit it for work purposes. “When they work in Porvorim, they rush to us for testing and treatment. The cases recorded by us are high as compared to other centres,” he said. The cases that are from outside of Porvorim are subsequently referred to their respective centers, Naik said. On an average, the health centre collects about 100 to 150 swabs daily. Their numbers are also high as they have been undertaking extensive contact tracing and testing for many days, he said. The center is simultaneously conducting the vaccination drive. Barring one, no other area in Porvorim has experienced an outbreak yet. Cases are being reported from across its seven sub-centers. “There is not a single waddo or building where cases are clustered. We get cases reported from all over Porvorim and not specifically from one area. At only one building we had a concentration of cases last month and it was declared a micro containment zone by the collector,” Naik said. They also received help from the panchayat with regards to patients not staying in home isolation. Such complaints cases are referred to the district magistrate for further action. “But very few complaints are received,” Naik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/porvorim-relies-on-three-ts-as-its-numbers-surge/articleshow/82091576.cms||Bindiya Chari

---||Goa||Lame Excuses||A day after announcing that the new fines under the MV Act will come into force from May 1, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Thursday deferred its implementation and said if needed the state government will even approach the Supreme Court, while transport minister Mauvin Godinho said it will be implemented after a year. The reason cited by the government is that it needs more time to create awareness and improve the road condition. But what is surprising is that even after 18 months of the new MV Act formulated by the Modi government to bring discipline on the roads and imposing steep fines to act as a strong deterrent against gross violations, the state is still giving lame excuses of creating awareness and improving road conditions. If the Sawant government was sincere and serious about implementing the act, it would not have been dragging its feet for 18 months. A government, which is known to procrastinate on important issues concerning the state and the public, seems to have been proactive in reviewing a decision that will save people’s lives within 24 hours of announcing it. We are tempted to argue that the only reason for postponing the implementation of the act by at least a year is for the assembly elections to get over so that they do not hurt sentiments of some sections who are against it and may vote against BJP. By taking such a stand, the government has shown it lacks decision-making abilities and exposed its wavering policies. This doesn’t augur well for the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lame-excuses/articleshow/81977196.cms||---

Furtado stated that they preferably want the inoculation to be carried out within the jail premises as transferring prisoners to the vaccination site outside the prison would be difficult and fraught with risk. The jail has about 500 prisoners, including several foreign convicts. Over the past one and one and a-half-year, there have been at least four incidents of prisoners escaping from the prison. Having a vaccination camp inside the prison will best serve their interests, said jail authorities. “We are waiting to hear from the government. A vaccination camp can be held in the jail,” said Furtado. With regards to convicts of foreign nationalities, Furtado said that they will be inoculated as per their wish as vaccination is voluntary. The IGP said they have not reported any Covid-19 cases in the jail premises in recent months. Authorities have been taking all precautions for the safety of staff and inmates. There is an isolation ward created in the prison, and whenever a new inmate - either a convict or undertrial – is referred to the jail, that person is kept in that ward for a few days as a precaution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vaccinate-colvale-jail-inmates-as-well/articleshow/82091652.cms||---

While agreeing that tourism forms the backbone of Goa’s economy, he also said that by lowering its guard the government will devastate lives and also the state economy. “I request our state government to immediately stop all nightlife. The state also immediately needs to start compulsory testing of all foreign arrivals and also of all people coming from Maharashtra and Delhi,” said Lourenco. He said that thousands of people are moving all around the state without wearing masks with no punishment being levied on violators. He also said that casinos are flouting social distancing norms. “There is a dire need for the declaration of mini containment zones,” said Lourenco.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-has-no-answer-to-2nd-wave-cong/articleshow/82091681.cms||---

We wouldn’t want the students to suffer,” Board chairman Bhagirath Shetye said, even as he maintained that the examination would continue as scheduled from April 24 amid strict SOPs, including thermal scanning, social distancing and wearing of face masks. “There will be only 12 candidates in a classroom. If the classroom is bigger, we will increase the number ensuring a distance of two metres, but there won’t be more than 20 students in one classroom,” Shetye told TOI. “We have increased the number of centres to over 90. The exam will be conducted in 18 main centres, each of which has an average of five sub-centres.” Special provisions will also be made for candidates who find they are Covid-positive — or have family members who have contracted the virus — but are able to answer the exam. Such students should inform their respective schools or email the Board, Shetye said. Each of the 18 main examination centres will have isolation centres away from the main centre where such students can take the exam. Health workers will have to escort them from their homes to the isolated examination hall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/students-with-covid-can-answer-class-xii-boards-at-later-date/articleshow/82091698.cms||---

Pointing out that the sopo contractor has been “arbitrarily” appointed by the SGPDA, the association complained about “exorbitant” increase in the market fee by the SGPDA at the wholesale fish market. The association pointed out that though the contractor was appointed by SGPDA in December 2019 “purely as a stop gap arrangement” till tenders are invited for the purpose, the same arrangement is continued till date “for no reasons whatsoever.” The association also accused the contractor of failing to deposit completely with the SGPDA the sopo charges collected, and of deploying bouncers for what it called “organised loot and plunder.” Traders have demanded that the fees be reverted to the earlier rates and that the levy collection be done by the SGPDA through its staff. Meanwhile, the sopo contractor Milagres Fernandes claimed to have sent a legal notice to Ibrahim Maulana, the president of the Margao wholesale fish market association, accusing him of restraining fish traders from entering the market and thereby obstructing his business and maligning him. Refuting all accusations against him by the fish traders association, Fernandes said they were “politically motivated” as he was contesting the Margao civic polls from ward 1 of Fatorda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sgpda-stand-off-fish-traders-body-seeks-cms-help/articleshow/81977317.cms||---

The study is conducted by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay. Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) chairman Ganesh Shetgaonkar on Monday said, “Due to health problems, the IIT director, who was in charge of the study, was unable to submit the report. As he is yet to recover, it is not possible for us to say when exactly the report will be received.” Speaking to TOI, Shetgaonkar said that the final report is ready, and has been put up to the director’s approval. He also said that as on March 31, the board has scheduled a meeting to discuss the findings of the report. IIT-Bombay had asked GSPCB for the continuous ambient air quality monitoring system (CAAQMS) and the national ambient air quality monitoring programme (NAMP) data of six locations from the port town to assess the air pollution at Vasco during the lockdown. IIT-Bombay had been tasked with conducting a source appropriation study at Vasco following allegations of coal pollution in the town. The institute has completed data collection for the second phase of the study, and chemical analysis is in progress. The first phase report stated that coal is not the only mineral behind air pollution in the town. A senior GSPCB officer said that the interim report didn’t pinpoint the reason for pollution in Vasco. The second phase study will give details about the source of pollution. The first phase began in April 2017 and was completed in May 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iit-bombays-report-identifying-cause-of-vasco-pollution-delayed/articleshow/82091711.cms||---

While his family said on Thursday that it was a murder, police, however, claimed that Manish Chaudhary alias Mintu Singh has killed himself. Chaudhary’s body was found on the driver’s seat in Kankerkhera on Thursday. A country-made pistol, a bottle of liquor and a glass were also lying by his side in the SUV, police sources in said. BJP councillor had served jail term earlier for thrashing cop A BJP ward member of Meerut Municipal Corporation, Chaudhary had served a jail term for thrashing a sub-inspector in his restaurant three years ago.  The policeman had come for lunch with a woman lawyer when an argument had broken out over the delay in serving the food. It was then that Chaudhary had allegedly attacked the policeman after an argument. The video of the incident was widely shared on social media platforms. Chaudhary was later booked and sent to jail. On Thursday, police claimed that Chaudhary shot himself dead after speaking to a relative over the phone. But the family was not convinced with the police version. Chaudhary’s brother-in-law, Kuldeep Dhama, has filed a police complaint alleging murder. “My brother-in-law had left home on Thursday evening. He had to settle some property deal and was carrying Rs 9 lakh in cash and some gold jewellery. He was fine and in good health. It seems someone has killed him,” Dhama said. SP (city) Vineet Bhatnagar said, “Prima facie, it is a case of suicide which can be corroborated by an audio clip which he had sent to a relative that points towards his desire to end his life. But we are probing the matter. Forensic teams have collected the samples and postmortem examination has been conducted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bjp-councillor-who-beat-up-cop-found-dead/articleshow/82093955.cms||Sandeep Rai

The infant had tested positive on April 6. According to doctors, the infant experienced respiratory distress at birth and was put on formula feed. Her mother breastfed her for the first time on April 5 as her health improved. The hospital had been planning to discharge her the next day, but her health again deteriorated, officials said. An X-ray revealed that she had developed a chest infection, following which a test showed she was Covid-positive. On April 7, she had difficulty breathing, prompting doctors to put her on a ventilator and give a Remdesivir injection. Her condition improved slightly after being administered plasma twice, but she died on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-after-10-days-in-surat-hospital-15-day-old-dies/articleshow/82093961.cms||---

By evening it had reversed its order to convert Jaslok into a full-fledged Covid facility following an assurance from the Pedder Road hospital to increase Covid beds to 150 from 58. Sometime between the order and its reversal, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal hinted that other major private hospitals might become complete Covid facilities depending on need. “We will keep options open depending upon the future situation,” he said. In Delhi, 14 top private hospitals were converted into Covid facilities this week, adding 3,202 ward beds and 1,135 ICU beds to the pool. Sources said the non-Covid occupancy of beds in several big private hospitals in the city was being studied to gauge if some of them could be fully pushed into Covid care. Of the 20,044 Covid beds in the city, 6,190 are in the private sector. BMC order takes management at Jaslok by surpriseOn Thursday, merely 630 private beds were available, including just 14 ICU beds. Chahal said the demand now was mainly for private beds since most infections were coming from middle-class and affluent families. Last year, the BMC-run BYL Nair Hospital was made a full-fledged Covid hospital despite protests from medical students. The morning BMC circular on Jaslok had said the hospital would no longer be able to admit non-Covid patients. The BMC directed the hospital to discharge all stable non-Covid patients. It asked the hospital to transfer the non-Covid patients requiring tertiary care to nearby facilities within 48 hours. It said all patients admitted for elective surgeries were to be discharged by postponing the operations. It is learnt that the BMC order took the Jaslok management by surprise. Even after receiving the circular, the management is learnt to have asked doctors to proceed with their planned surgeries for the day as it would discuss the matter with the BMC. Consultants did not receive any communication to postpone or cancel surgeries. Over a dozen surgeries happened, including a transplant. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the Jaslok order was reversed but the hospital would now have to set aside 70% to 80% of its beds for Covid-19 treatment. “They have many non-Covid patients, including those undergoing treatment for cancer and undergoing transplants. The hospital said it may be challenging to shift them all,” he said. A spokesperson from Jaslok said: “Keeping in view the rising cases of Covid, we have increased the number of beds allotted to COVID-19 patients from 58 to 150 to support the current crisis. We continue our efforts in treating other critically ill chronic patients and procedures.” Jaslok has 225 operational beds, down from the 350-odd that functioned in pre-Covid times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-rolls-back-order-to-convert-jaslok-into-fully-covid-care-hospital/articleshow/82093968.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Star hotels tie up with private hospitals to house patients||MUMBAI: Soon, five-star hotels such as InterContinental at Marine Drive and Trident at BKC will be used as "step-down facilities" for Covid patients from major private hospitals in the city who are on the road to recovery or require minimal medical intervention. In a circular issued on April 14, the BMC has said that such facilities at star hotels will serve as an extension and an integral part of private hospitals. For patients who do not require emergency medical intervention, or oxygenation, ICU or ventilator beds will be moved to the hotels and hospitals linked to them will assess their clinical condition regularly. While Bombay Hospital is linked to Intercontinental, H N Reliance Foundation Hospital is with BKC's Trident. Hotel step-down facilities to have ambulances readyThe facilities will provide hospitality services in coordination with private hospitals. These hospitals may charge patients up to Rs 4,000, inclusive of taxes and meals, per day per bed. This amount will be paid to the hotels by the hospitals. The hospital will charge extra for medical expenses, doctor visits and other incidental charges. If a patient’s Covid-positive close relatives are willing to share a room, the hospital may charge up to Rs 6,000 for two beds. Any other positive, asymptomatic patient, too, can also utilise the service—after medical assessment by the linked private hospital’s medical team. MCGM has increased beds across all categories of Covid care facilities. Yet, there is a time lag in getting a bed, especially in private hospitals. If patients are shifted to a step-down facility, more beds will be freed up. “These will help initiate treatment on time and reduce the fatality rate,” stated a BMC circular. A senior civic ward officer said while they have started talks with private hospitals, such an arrangement can be executed only if they have the required staff. “While many hotels are willing to take patients as their business is any way reduced due to the restrictions, the hospital needs to have the required staff,” Dr Gautam Bhansali, who will be coordinating with Inter-Continental, said the hospitallinked hotel rooms will be for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients or those on their way to recovery with no oxygen or intravenous medicine dependence. “If a patient develops a sudden requirement for oxygen there will be five ambulances parked with oxygen support to ferry them to a nearest hospital.” Civic officials took the decision based on a calculation that if 33 major private hospitals can send a minimum of five patients to the hotels, it will free up to 200 beds a day. Bhansali said several hospitals, including Mahim's Hinduja and Chembur’s Surana, have shown willingness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-star-hotels-tie-up-with-private-hospitals-to-house-patients/articleshow/82093974.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The deceased woman was identified as 24-year-old Srivalli, a worker at a garment shop.

Elsewhere, in crematoriums across Gujarat, the constantly smouldering pyres were testimony to fatalities much higher than the state government’s official Covid-19 death toll. The Surat crematorium had three such oversized beds of wood meant to reduce the dead to ashes. Bulletins released by municipal corporations of four major cities officially state around 25 deaths each daily, but the mortalities are much higher. Bharuch has cremated 260 Covid dead in 8 days, official toll still 36At Vadodara’s SSG Hospital, the biggest hospital in central Gujarat, at least 180 people have died in Covid ICUs in the last nine days. The number of deaths in Covid ICUs in GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri, another major hospital in Vadodara, too, is no less. Sources said the Covid-19 ICU alone has seen 90 deaths since April 7, while ICUs on the fourth and fifth floors are seeing at least 15 fatalities a day. Together, the toll in these two government-run Vadodara hospitals alone is close to 350 in a week. In contrast, government figures put the total death toll of the pandemic in entire Vadodara district at 300 since the outbreak of the pandemic last year. In Bharuch, at least 260 Covid-19 victims have been consigned to the flames in the designated crematorium since April 7. The data was obtained from the crematorium register. However, the official death toll in Bharuch district since the beginning of the pandemic last year is 36. Coronavirus pandemic live updatesDharmesh Solanki, who handles cremations on the banks of the Narmada river, said, “Over the last one week, we are getting bodies of 22-25 patients daily. Nearly 7,500 kg of wood is being supplied every day.” In Ahmedabad, the last rites of about 100 bodies are being performed daily for the past four days across 10 crematoriums and burial grounds. Top sources said that in the past week at least 50 bodies of Covid patients have been handed over to their families every day. “In the past two days, this figure has crossed the 100 mark,” sources said. “If one considers 147 public and private hospitals treating Covid patients, the daily death toll in Ahmedabad is definitely not under 30 as reported by the government in the past three days,” a source said. Read AlsoCovid-19: Highest-ever single-day spike in India with 2,17,353 fresh casesIndia on Friday reported a record single-day rise of more than 2.17 lakh Covid-19 cases pushing India's total tally to 1.43 crore. In another grim milestone, the country added one million cases to its total tally in record six days, the fastest million added to the tally since the outbreak. TheRajkot district, too, has seen over 298 deaths in various Covid hospitals from April 8 to April 14. However, the death audit committee has officially declared 57 deaths which, it says, occurred “purely” due to Covid. On Thursday, another 82 people succumbed in the district. When TOI checked the records at two big crematoriums in Surat, there were at least 80 bodies brought daily, the majority being Covid-19 patients, from April 5 to April 13, after which three new crematoriums were started. In the newly built Pal crematorium, at least 20 bodies are being cremated daily. On Thursday, the official death toll released by Surat Municipal Corporation was 25. TOI spoke to a number of senior officials and medical professionals working in designated Covid-19 hospitals to decode the discrepancy. “It is true that more Covid patients are dying than the numbers released suggest,” said a senior health administrator. “Hospitals list out Covid victims with co-morbidities but this number is not included in the final death toll published by the government.” On Saturday, Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani denied reports that the state government was hiding the true count of Covid fatalities. “As per the guidelines of the ICMR, if a co-morbid patient dies, then a committee of experts decides the primary and secondary causes of death,” he said. “If that committee identifies the main cause of death as a heart attack, then even if the patient was infected, such a death is not counted as being caused by Covid.” “This drastically reduces the numbers as some 60% Covid-19 dead have co-morbidities. The government thinks that not giving out total death numbers helps prevent panic. However, it is not good to create a false sense of well-being,” said another health administrator. In Surat, pyres 18 feet long and eight feet wide, built to accommodate five bodies at one go, were placed at a distance of three feet from each other. The idea, the authorities said, was to reduce waiting time; the result was the dead being denied dignity in death. “When there is a huge rush of bodies, we are forced to cremate five bodies on one big pyre,” explained Pravin Patel, a Kailash Moksh Dham crematorium trustee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gujarat-covid-toll-higher-than-official-count/articleshow/82093975.cms||---

Police said they took action after a complaint was filed against Ramakrishna by a YSRC functionary citing his remarks during a news debate on television two days ago. In the debate, Ramakrishna allegedly called the CM ‘Narakasura’ and said he wouldn’t mind taking his life. After his remarks went viral, YSRC functionaries demanded his arrest and lodged a complaint with Pileru police, which booked him under IPC Section 506 (criminal intimidation) and 153A (incitement of enmity between different groups). Madanapalle DSP Ravi Manohara Chary confirmed the arrest, adding that police took action based on the complaint and after due investigation. “Television footage was given as evidence in the complaint where he (Ramakrishna) is heard making objectionable remarks against the CM and threatening of beheading him,” Chary told TOI. Meanwhile, Ramakrishna’s family members cried foul over the arrest and questioned the need to take him to a faraway police station instead of Madanapalle. This is not the first time Ramakrishna has been arrested. In December 2020, he was arrested by Madanapalle police for allegedly forging his deceased sister Sucharitha’s signature and issuing five cheques for repayment of debt and payment of salaries to staff in his degree college. The branch manager of Canara Bank lodged a police complaint following which he was arrested and later suspended. Ramakrishna last worked as junior civil judge in Chittoor district munsif magistrate court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/suspended-judge-held-for-making-threatening-remarks-against-cm/articleshow/82089964.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Former CBI joint director VV Lakshmi Narayana and others had approached the high court challenging the privatisation move of VSP. The HC division bench comprising Justice Jyomalya Bagchi and Justice M Ranaga Rao asked the Centre to clarify whether it considered the version of people who gave away their land for the steel plant and the alternative corrective measures proposed by the petitioners and the state government to make the plant profitable. Opposing the Union government’s decision to privatise VSP, Join for Development Foundation had filed a public interest litigation in the high court. Y Balaji, counsel for JD Foundation, argued that the move was unconstitutional and urged the court to direct the Centre to follow various corrective measures suggested by the petitioners and the state government to help the plant make profits. Senior counsel Adinarayana Rao said VSP has an emotional connect with the people of AP. Many locals who gave away their land to the steel plant have not received jobs and other compensation till now, he stated. Advocate general S Sriram, appearing for the state government, sought directions from the court to the Centre asking it to clarify whether it considered the suggestions made by the petitioners and the AP government. After hearing the arguments, the bench said the jurisdiction of the courts in regulating financial decisions taken by the Centre was limited. But as the petitioners and the state government have stated that the fundamental rights of people who gave their land to the plant are getting affected, the court said it was issuing notices to the Centre to explain whether it considered the alternative measures suggested by the state government. The matter has been posted for next hearing after four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vsp-disinvestment-hc-issues-notices-to-centre/articleshow/82089975.cms||Venu Lanka

Justice U Durga Prasada Rao posted the matter for further hearing on Monday. The counsel for the State Election Commission said issuing the model code of conduct four weeks in advance was not mandatory and it was left to the SEC’s discretion. TDP leader Varla Ramiah and others moved the high court challenging the MPTC and ZPTC election notification on April 1. On April 6, Justice U Durga Prasada Rao stayed the election process as the SEC did not follow the four-week model code of conduct as suggested by the Supreme Court. However, the AP government moved a house motion at the division bench on April 7, which permitted the state to conduct the election. The HC, however, asked the SEC not to declare the results. The HC single bench was directed to take up a detailed enquiry. The election was held later and the SEC and political parties are waiting for the HC judgment to take up the counting process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/zptc-polls-election-code-hearing-to-resume-on-mon/articleshow/82089981.cms||Venu Lanka

On April 7, citing the Union Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIT) directive, the Karnataka industries department ordered its sub-divisions to list laws which are a hindrance to ease of doing business. The DPIT order of March 2020 said there are 5,166 laws which are redundant and "do not add value in the current scenario". It set two 2021 deadlines - March 31 for itself and August 15 for states. No suggestions from industries: OfficialsAs of March 2021, DPIT set a target of repealing/ subsuming/ decriminalising 2,258 laws, while by August 15, 2021 3,392 laws were to be phased out. In Karnataka, as of March 31, 38 laws were either repealed, subsumed or decriminalised, including the controversial labour laws which remain in abeyance. While the Covid-19 pandemic gave states, including Karnataka, ample opportunity to withdraw or modify controversial laws, it also left governments with no voice from industries to suggest which laws were creating hurdles. According to industries department officials, no industry body has given suggestions on which laws were hindering fresh factories and units being set up. “When there is an opportunity, we expected FKCCI, KEA or KASSIA to come forward,” said an official. Karnataka Employers Association president BC Prabhakar said he’ll speak to other associations about this. Meanwhile, the industries department listed 285 laws which need to be either repealed by August 15. These include environmental clearances, exemption of approvals from certain departments, decriminalisation of laws by replacing jail term with hefty fines, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ease-of-doing-business-karnataka-may-repeal-323-laws/articleshow/82094029.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

---||India||UAE claims it mediated India-Pakistan ceasefire pact||NEW DELHI: UAE’s ambassador to the US Yousef Al Otaiba was quoted in international media reports as saying that the Gulf nation mediated between India and Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir and helped the two countries arrive at the LoC ceasefire agreement in February. In a virtual meeting, the ambassador seemed to be endorsing a media report that highlighted the UAE’s role in “bringing the Kashmir escalation down and sort of creating a ceasefire... and getting the relationship back to a healthy level”. There was no response from India to the reports quoting the UAE ambassador. The government has held that there is no role for any third party in resolving any outstanding issue between India and Pakistan. In fact, when the two countries decided to resume engagement in 2015 under a new formulation, India ensured that it was called comprehensive bilateral dialogue and not just comprehensive dialogue. There have, however, been reports of emissaries used to convey “messages” with references to the UAE and Saudi Arabia sometimes cropping up. India under PM Narendra Modi has seen ties with the UAE deepen with Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan playing an important role. Modi has received the UAE's highest civilian honour, the Order of Zayed. “They might not sort of become best friends but at least we want to get it to a level where it’s functional, operational, where they are speaking to each other,” Reuters quoted Otaiba as saying. The agency had earlier quoted sources as saying that top intelligence officers from India and Pakistan held secret talks in Dubai in January in a new effort to calm tension over Kashmir. According to the report, Otaiba also said Pakistan should play a helpful role in Afghanistan, where the US plans to start withdrawing troops to end America's longest war. It said the Emirati official voiced concern that an abrupt US withdrawal would constitute “reverse progress” by serving the interests of “the more illiberal forces” in Afghanistan. “The question is if the three parties (the US, Taliban and Afghan government) can reach an agreement that they can all live with,” Otaiba said. “It’s hard for us to see a way to stabilise Afghanistan without Pakistan playing a helpful role,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uae-claims-it-mediated-india-pakistan-ceasefire-pact/articleshow/82094016.cms||---

More than six teams have been formed to carry out inspections and investigate if patients require admission or are being kept unnecessarily in the facilities. The 13 private hospitals are Mayom, KK Healthcare, Pushpanjali, Sethi, Vardan, Life Aid, Cloud Nine, Yashroop, Sunrise, Aryan, Chirag, Sri Gobind and Kalyani hospitals. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram said action will be taken if the hospitals fail to reply within 48 hours. “We visited two hospitals, Medeor and SGT, to evaluate their bed status. We also checked the condition of Covid patients as well as the admission and discharge criteria. Our teams will carry out similar drives regularly,” he added. All hospitals are required to submit data with the administration and the health department twice daily about the status of Covid-19 patients and beds. They must also inform immediately about any Covid-related death. The hospitals also need to share details of beds with the department so it’s easier to transfer critical cases. “Hospitals cannot deny treatment to any patient and will have to provide a bed to a Covid-19 patient. There is a dedicated helpline number where patients can lodge their complaints in case of any inconvenience. The hospitals have been told to share details of those discharged, quarantined at home, transferred patients list and contact details for further monitoring of cases. Details of PPE kits, hospital staff dealing with Covid patients, ICU beds, ventilators and oxygen units should be provided to the administration as well,” Dr Yadav said. Two days ago, the district administration had ordered all government and private hospitals to ensure 40% of their total beds and 70% of ICU and ventilator beds are reserved for Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/notices-to-13-private-hospitals-for-not-updating-covid-bed-data/articleshow/82092389.cms||Ipsita Pati

On Thursday, soon after the ban on him ended, Sinha said security forces “should open fire if they come under attack, no matter who dies or survives”. Only three days back, the poll panel had indicted Sinha for “inciting forces”. Sinha said: “EC special observer Vivek Dube has said what I had said earlier. If there is any attack on central forces, the forces would open fire. There is no point seeing who dies.” TMC leader Jyotipriya Mullick said Sinha’s comment was a violation of the model code of conduct. “I will complain to the Election Commission urging it to ban Sinha for the rest of the campaign till Habra goes to polls on April 22,” he said. The political battle over the Sitalkuchi firing continued on social media on Thursday after BJP’s IT cell national incharge Amit Malviya released video footage of the incident on his Twitter handle, to assert that some villagers wielding bamboo sticks had hit the closed door of the polling booth — locked from inside — in an attempt to break it open. The video grab was released a day after TMC’s Derek O’Brien shared a clip on Twitter to claim that the Sitalkuchi firing was “a cold blooded massacre of innocent citizens”. Malviya said “CISF and the booth were attacked by a murderous mob” though the attack on CISF was not visible in the footage. The latest unverified clip shows some angry villagers kicking the closed door of the polling booth and hitting it with bamboo sticks. The third polling officer, in a separate interview to audio-visual channels, had given a detailed account of the attack by rowdies after they broke open the booth door. Malviya said the Sitalkuchi incident happened two days after CM Mamata Banerjee’s speech of April 8 and held her “responsible for the violence”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/despite-ecs-48-hour-ban-bjp-neta-courts-controversy-again/articleshow/82094037.cms||Sanjib Chakrabarty

---||Ranchi||No crisis of Cov beds in Ramgarh: DC||Ramgarh: After 660 active Covid-19 cases and 32 deaths, including four casualties in the last three days, Ramgarh deputy commissioner Sandeep Singh on Thursday took a stock of the situation and said he will ensure that the district does not face any crisis of beds to admit Covid patients in cases of emergency. Singh assured that Covid-designated hospitals still have vacant beds and efforts are on to increase them soon. He said, "Currently, there is no shortage of beds in designated hospitals, which included Central Hospital of the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) in Ramgarh town, Tata Steel Hospital in West Bokaro under Mandu block and sadar hospital in Ramgarh. The CCL hospital has 80 beds with six in ICU and 20 other beds with oxygen supply facility. It has been directed to add 40 more beds and ensure oxygen supply in all beds. The Tata Steel Hospital has 50 beds." Of the total 660 active cases, 117 were detected in the last 24 hours and 16 patients are on oxygen support, the district health department said, adding that on average, 1,000 samples are collected daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-crisis-of-cov-beds-in-ramgarh-dc/articleshow/82090636.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Surat||Exodus of migrants begins again||Surat: While memories of migrant workers resorting to violence last year demanding to be allowed to go to their natives are still fresh, migrant labourers employed in Surat’s textile and diamond industries have once again started moving out of the city in spite of the chief minister’s repeated assurance that there will be no lock down this year. However, anticipating a double whammy of lockdown and infection from the new strain of coronavirus, workers are seen ready to pay up to Rs 3,000 to get a berth in the private luxury buses leave from Sachin GIDC, Pandesara, Sahara Darwaja and Delhi Gate for Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and other states every night. While usual passengers are still scared to travel by train, two trains leaving for these northern states from Surat are filled with workers who are lucky to get confirmed tickets. Workers from these states are generally employed in city’s dyeing and weaving mills, and many others in diamond units. “Those workers who had shelved Holi holiday plans are now scared and want to head back home. Many had left the city for Holi, but after the cases started rising in the last 10 days, 35% of the workforce has either left or is going to leave in the next couple of days,” said Rajendra Upadhyay, operator of the Chhatth Manav Seva Trust. “This time workers fear getting infected and about who will take care of them if they contract the virus,” said Dharmesh Singh, vice-president of Bihar Vikas Parishad, adding that approximately 10,000 workers would have got infected in the last 15 to 20 days. “Some of them have been hospitalized, while others are under home isolation,” Singh said, adding that the situation this time is not about how to survive without money and food, but about life and safety. “There were 22 workers in the mill I work for but only 14 are left now. If the situation will not improve then I too will leave for home,” said Raju Pandey, who works in a dyeing mill in Pandesara. As the workers have started leaving, production too is being affected. “Earlier our daily production used to be around 4 crore metres, but it has now come down to 3 crore metres,” said Ashok Jirawala, president of Federation of Gujarat Weavers Welfare Association. He said that government should allow vaccination of workers because there is fear of the disease among the workers this time. “While mass exodus has not started in the real sense, yet many workers have sent their families back to their native places. Currently there is shortage of workers by 10% to 15%,” said Dinesh Navadiya, president of Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/exodus-of-migrants-begins-again/articleshow/82089771.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Ranchi||Hunt for Covid beds continue as live dashboard fails to provide real-time data on availability||Ranchi: The live dashboard launched by the Ranchi district administration to provide information on the availability of Covid-19 beds at the city-based hospitals failed to ease out the woes of patients with the date available online not matching with the on ground situation. While the dashboard, available at the district’s website ranchi.nic.in, was launched to help out patients, in reality, hospitals continue to deny admissions without references. Meanwhile, most of the times, the incident commanders either do not pick up calls or their phone remain switched off, exposing how the lack of proper implementation of government orders is causing chaos in the city. After Rinchi Trust Hospital didn’t answer calls from TOI, Santosh Kumar Shukla, incident commander attached with the hospital, said, “I have personally visited the hospital twice since morning and there are no beds. In fact, currently more than 10 patients are waiting to get admitted.” Ranchi district, the worst hit amid the second wave of Covid-19, on Wednesday recorded 1,273 fresh cases of the virus, pushing the active caseload to 7,641, and seven casualties. Contacted about the anomalies, district information officer of the National Informatics Centre (NIC), Ranchi, Shio Banerjee said, “I cannot comment on why the hospitals are saying that they do not have beds because we are only putting out numbers which are being provided to us by our data cell which is looking after the availability of beds.” However on being asked whether the website is reflecting the data on a real-time basis, Banerjee said currently it is not on a real-time basis, but they are working to make changes. TOI on Thursday contacted more than 10 hospitals which showed availability of beds on the portal, however, the authorities cited various reasons, ranging from running in full capacity to lack of manpower and denied to admit any new patient. Hospitals, including Jaslok, Maa Kalawati, Rinchi, Kanke General Hospital, Medanta, RPS and Gulmohar were showing availability of beds on the portal. However, when contacted, all of them denied having any Covid bed. An authority of MDM hospital near Booty More said, “We haven’t started treating Covid patients as we are in the process of completing the oxygen pipeline work in our wards. I do not know how the portal is showing we have oxygen-supported beds.” Meanwhile, a representative of Maa Kalawati Hospital in Namkum said, “We have beds but our doctors and other paramedics have deserted the hospital.” Rani Hospital on Booty Road was the only hospital which provided the correct information. A representative said, “We have all kinds of beds available, but all our equipment are for children and we can treat only paediatric patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hunt-for-covid-beds-continue-as-live-dashboard-fails-to-provide-real-time-data-on-availability/articleshow/82090732.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Technocrats, entrepreneurs, activists in Ranchi begin voluntary service to help patients get hospital beds||Ranchi: A group of technocrats, start-up professionals and activists in Ranchi have come together under the banner of Jharkhand Open Coffee Club (JOCC) to set up a digital interface in order to help Covid-19 patients get faster admission into hospitals. JOCC officials said that anyone can register their details on https://localsay.in/beds/view or on the link available on their social media handle, after which their volunteers will coordinate with hospitals and district authorities to provide admission to the patient concerned. Since the start of this voluntary service on Wednesday, the group has facilitated hospital admission for about half a dozen patients. Those participating in this endeavour on a voluntary basis hail from diverse backgrounds, with a few even engaged in government service. A JOCC member said, “JOCC was set up a couple of years ago to promote start-up activities in the state. However, we often try to contribute to social causes as well. Considering the chaos and hassles faced by scores of people in Ranchi while seeking admission to hospitals, we thought of extending help to people amid the raging pandemic.” Another member said, “We are circulating the link of digital forms through our social media platforms and WhatsApp groups. Simultaneously, one can also log in to https://localsay.in/beds/view to register basic details of the Covid-19 patient and check the kind of hospital beds that they are looking for. After every one hour, the data is sent to the deputy commissioner’s office. We are also coordinating with the hospitals through various channels and sources to try to expedite the admission process.” “One of the biggest problems at this moment in the state or in Ranchi is that there isn’t any synergy between the hospitals, administration and other stakeholders, which has led to a chaos. Proper monitoring, too, to ensure that government orders are being implemented at the ground is also missing. As a result, people are facing hassles and medical loot is happening across the state,” said a JOCC member, who works in different state government projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/technocrats-entrepreneurs-activists-in-ranchi-begin-voluntary-service-to-help-patients-get-hospital-beds/articleshow/82090596.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Contractual staff demand Rs 15k to ferry dead Cov patient in ambulance||Ranchi: Sanjay Nagduar, a resident of Siramtoli in Ranchi, who lost his brother to Covid-19 on Thursday morning, had to face an ordeal while ferrying the dead body from Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences to the GEL Church graveyard. In a blatant disregard of the laid out norms, Nagduar was demanded a sum of Rs 15,000 by two outsourced staff at the hospital for the burial. According to the state government protocols, dead body disposal of Covid-19 patients have to be done under the supervision of the district administration. The guidelines state that family members of the deceased have to contact the superintendent of the healthcare facility who will arrange a hearse to transport the dead body. Speaking to TOI, Nagduar said, “My brother died on the wee hours of Thursday. When we reached the hospital, I approached the administration but was told that no hearse is available. While I was waiting for a hearse, two staff who had packed my brother’s body approached us and said they will help us ferry the body in an ambulance and bury it too and demanded Rs 15,000.” He further said, “I am aware that family members are not allowed to ferry dead Covid patients on their own but I could not arrange Rs 15,000 for the burial, so I arranged a pickup van and took my brother’s body to the graveyard.” Nagduar confirmed all facilities were in place at the graveyard, including an earthmover, two sanitation workers of the Ranchi Municipal Corporation and others who helped in the burial. When contacted, Rims PRO Dr D K Sinha confirmed deceased Covid patients should only be ferried on hearses and said, “I will take up the issue with the hospital authorities and suitable action will be taken against the guilty.” It seems Sanjay is not the lone victim to be fleeced by outsourced staff at Rims who are hand-in-glove with private ambulance operators. Several complaints of operators and outsourced staff at Rims charging patients more than the capped price have surfaced in the recent times. An alleged audio clip of a private ambulance driver went viral on social media platforms a few days back in which the operator was heard demanding Rs 4,000 to shift a patient to a hospital within the city limits. According to the directives issued by the state health department, ambulances can charge Rs 500 and Rs 600 for oxygen-supported and ventilator-supported ambulances, respectively. Operators have been allowed to levy Rs 200 for sanitization and post 10km’s travel, they can charge at the rate of Rs 12 and Rs 14 per kilometre for normal and ventilator-supported ambulances, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/contractual-staff-demand-rs-15k-to-ferry-dead-cov-patient-in-ambulance/articleshow/82090622.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Simdega Chamber of Commerce (SCC), on the other hand, has decided to shut their shops and establishments voluntarily for two days a week. Simdega SDO Mahendra Kumar said, "Since the number of Covid cases is rising, the administration has decided to halt weekly bazaars which are scheduled on Thursdays and Mondays in the town when a huge number of buyers and sellers from across the district assembled." SSC secretary Amarnath Bamalia said, "We held a meeting on Wednesday with the district authorities and apprised them of our decision to close our establishments on Saturdays and Sundays. Our move is aimed at breaking the chain of infection." He added, "The number of active cases has almost doubled in the last two days and is likely to increase further if we don't take the precautions. So, we decided to take an initiative by observing a 'lockdown' twice a week." The district nodal officer for Covid-19, S Perwej said the administration has reinforced the safety protocols to contain the spread of the virus in the district. As of Thursday, the district has 230 active cases and 11 deaths. The cumulative caseload of the district since the start of the pandemic last year is 2,381 of which 2,140 have recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/weekly-bazaar-stopped-trade-body-to-shut-shops-twice-a-week-in-simdega/articleshow/82090607.cms||K A Gupta
---||Kolkata||Ban ends, Sinha rakes up Sitalkuchi firing||Habra/Kolkata: Bengal BJP senior and Habra candidate Rahul Sinha courted controversy again after the Election Commission had barred him from campaigning for 48 hours. On Thursday, when the ban on him ended, Sinha said security forces “should open fire if they come under attack, no matter who dies or survives”. Only three days back, the poll panel had indicted Sinha for “inciting forces”. Campaigning at Batar Gali near Habra Bazar, Sinha said: “EC special observer Vivek Dube has said what I had said earlier. If there is any attack on central forces, the forces would open fire. I’m telling again that central forces should open fire if somebody attacks security forces in an attempt to prevent people from casting their votes. There is no point seeing who dies.” Trinamool Congress leader Jyotipriya Mullick said Sinha’s comment was a violation of the model code of conduct. “I will make a complaint to the Election Commission urging it to ban Sinha for the rest of the campaign till Habra goes to polls on April 22,” he said. The political battle over the Sitalkuchi firing continued on social media on Thursday after BJP’s IT cell national in-charge Amit Malviya released on his Twitter handle video footage of the incident in Cooch Behar to assert that some villagers with bamboo sticks hit the closed door of the polling booth — locked from inside — in an attempt to break it open. The video grab was released a day after Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien shared a video clip on his Twitter handle to claim that the Sitalkuchi firing was “a cold blooded massacre of innocent citizens”. The incident had occurred during fourth-phase polling on April 10. Malviya concluded that “CISF and booth were attacked by murderous mob” though the attack on CISF was not seen in the footage. The latest unverified clip shows some angry villagers kicking the closed door of the polling booth and hitting it with bamboo sticks. The third polling officer, in a separate interview to audio-visual channels, had given a detailed account of the attack by rowdies after they broke open the booth door. Malviya pointed out that the Sitalkuchi incident happened two days after chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s speech of April 8, and held her “responsible for the violence”. The BJP IT cell in-charge also referred to statements of poll officers on duty and that of the Cooch Behar SP, who corroborated the violence. Malviya also alleged that Ananda Barman, a Rajbanshi, was killed by the mob. He complained that Banerjee was “communalising election”, days after the Bengal CM dubbed the firing “genocide”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ban-ends-sinha-rakes-up-sitalkuchi-firing/articleshow/82092089.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||West Bengal elections 2021: Election Commission slaps 24-hour campaign ban on Dilip Ghosh for Sitalkuchi comments||KOLKATA: The Election Commission on Thursday banned state BJP president Dilip Ghosh from campaigning for 24 hours for his statements on the Sitalkuchi deaths. The EC action follows its 24-hour ban on CM Mamata Banerjee and 48-hour ban on BJP Habra candidate Rahul Sinha for statements made during campaigning that it said violated the model poll code of conduct. The campaign ban on Ghosh would be effective from 7 pm on Thursday to 7 pm on Friday, the EC said. The poll panel served a show-cause notice on BJP’s Sayatan Basu as well for “inflammatory statements” during a public rally in Baranagar. Basu, too, was speaking on the Sitalkuchi firing. Four villagers died in a CISF firing near a polling booth in Cooch Behar’s Sitalkuchi last Saturday. “You have seen what happened in Sitalkuchi. There will be Sitalkuchi in several places. So be careful,” Ghosh said during a poll rally a day later. The EC also referred to his “dushtu chele (naughty boy)” barb at the dead and the injured in the CISF firing. “Those naughty boys were shot in Sitalkuchi. These naughty boys will not be there in Bengal. This is just the beginning,” Ghosh was quoted as saying. The state BJP president, in his response to the notice, said it was his duty to stand by BJP workers and encourage people to vote without fear; his statement was directed only at miscreants who tried to “negatively impact law-and-order” and it was not his intention to contravene the model poll code of conduct or sections of the Representation of the People Act and the Indian Penal Code. The EC, however, found him guilty of making “highly provocative and inciteful remarks that could adversely impact law and order, adversely affecting the election process”. The EC on Thursday served a show-cause notice on BJP leader Sayatan Basu as well for “inflammatory statements” during a public rally in Baranagar, which could be construed as “a threat to the people of Bengal”. “We will play the game of Sitalkuchi. They killed 18-year-old Ananda Barman. We did not have to wait for long. Four of them were shown the way to heaven. There was a dialogue in the film ‘Sholay’... if you kill one we will kill four of you. Shitalkuchi witnessed it. If you kill one we will kill four of you,” the EC quoted Basu as saying. Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and the Trinamool have called the Sitalkuchi killings a “genocide”. But BJP leaders, including union home minister Amit Shah, have accused Banerjee of “instigating villagers” against central forces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-slaps-24-hr-campaign-ban-on-dilip-for-sitalkuchi-comments/articleshow/82092747.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Teacher linked to Bengal terror case held in J&K||KOLKATA: A schoolteacher, who was acting as a recruiter for Pakistan-based terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba, was arrested at his residence in north Kashmir on Thursday, National Investigation Agency said. Altaf Ahmad Rather had been recruiting people from Bengal online as LeT operatives, reports Dwaipayan Ghosh. This arrest is linked to that of Tania Parveen (21), who was held by Bengal STF in March last year in Basirhat, North 24 Parganas, on charges of working for LeT. Rather, a resident of Jammu & Kashmir’s Bandipora district, was wanted in the same case, an NIA spokesperson said. “Investigation has revealed that Rather is a schoolteacher in Bandipora and was a sympathiser of the LeT. Parveen had come in contact with him over social media platforms and he was instrumental in introducing her to LeT members based in Pakistan, in pursuance of a conspiracy to radicalise, motivate and recruit youths for violent ‘jihad’ in India,” he said. The Hafiz Saeed-led organization, responsible for the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, is one of the deadliest anti-India terror groups. The STF had initially slapped various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Information Technology Act in this case. The NIA had re-registered the case on April 5, 2020, and taken over the investigation from the state’s police. The agency has already filed a charge-sheet against her, the NIA spokesman said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/teacher-linked-to-bengal-terror-case-held-in-jk/articleshow/82092361.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||TMC goes to Election Commission against Dilip Ghosh remark, Babul Supriyo's tweet||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress on Thursday complained to the Election Commission against both Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh and Union minister Babul Supriyo. The complaint against Ghosh was for mocking chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s leg injury and calling her “physically disabled” and against Supriyo for “deliberately omitting” the words “socialist, secular and integrity of nation” while posting an image of the Preamble to the Constitution to commemorate Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14. Claiming Supriyo’s post was also a penal offence, TMC took the complaint against the minister to the Kolkata police commissioner too. In its complaint against Ghosh, Trinamool posted a video of the Bengal BJP chief where he is heard saying: “Some games are played on wheelchairs too. Those are not for common people. We do not want a quota chief minister. Do we?” Alluding to a person standing next to him on the dais who is healthier and stronger, Ghosh is further heard saying: “We do not want someone who has a fractured hand, fractured leg, sees less and hears less. And there is less in the head too.” Urging the Election Commission to “act now”, Trinamool in a statement on Twitter said: “Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh mocks Mamata Banerjee’s injury and calls her physically disabled, mentally deranged, deaf and dumb. This is what BJP thinks about women and the differently abled!” In Trinamool’s formal complaint against Supriyo, Derek complained to Bengal chief electoral officer Ariz Aftab and police commissioner Soumen Mitra that the minister’s April 14 tweet also posted an image of the Preamble that left out the words “socialist, secular and integrity of nation”, inserted into the original Preamble by the 42nd amendment.  Derek argued that this was a penal offence under Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. It was also an insult to Bharat Ratna Babasaheb Ambedkar on his 130th birth anniversary, TMC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-goes-to-ec-against-dilip-remark-babul-tweet/articleshow/82092190.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Club remaining poll phases, CM Mamata Banerjee urges Election Commission over Covid fears||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday urged the Election Commission to consider holding the remaining election phases in one go in view of the huge surge in Covid cases, saying it would protect people from further exposure to the virus, and adding that she had initially “firmly opposed” the EC’s decision to conduct the polls in eight phases. Her plea came on a day Rezaul Haque alias Mantu Biswas, 46, the Congress candidate from Shamsherganj, Murshidabad, succumbed to the disease at a Kolkata hospital, and at a time when several other politicians — from a number of parties — have been infected. Bengal itself has continued to record huge spikes in daily cases since late-March, coinciding with the commencement of the eight-phase polls. Earlier in the day, before Banerjee made this plea from her official Twitter handle, she told a private TV channel that to “keep people safe”, as a “political party and as a human being”, she would agree to any decision by the EC to club the last three phases of the polls in one day, but parties should be allowed seven to eight days’ campaign time. “The next phase of polls are on Saturday. But the scheduled polls on April 22, 26 and 29 can be held on one day. I have no problem,” she said in response to a question. Immediately after the CM’s appeal, the Trinamool Congress urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to clear their stand on the issue. Party MP Derek O’Brien tweeted: “Come on, Modi-Shah BJP. We have made our stand clear. What’s yours? More #COVID19India deaths in 4 phases.” In the interview, Banerjee said: “At the onset, let me be very clear that we did not find any justification for an eight-phase poll. We had opposed that. Bihar elections were held during a pandemic, even then it was held in three phases. There was no need (for an eight phase poll in Bengal).... As a political party, as a human, we have no problem if the last three phases are held in one day. But we should be allowed a seven-eight-day window to campaign for all the remaining phases. It can be held around April 26 in one go.... Places where cases are higher will go to polls last.” As many as 114 assembly segments are scheduled to go to the polls in the last three phases of the elections. This includes Kolkata, which will vote in the last two phases. Banerjee also questioned the Centre’s management of the pandemic. “The (Covid) cases were showing a gradual decline since last November. They (the Centre) had five months to arrange for vaccines. It is common knowledge that a pandemic remains for at least two years,” she said, adding, “I have written to the Centre to help us with the vaccines. We wanted to purchase vaccines and vaccinate all people. I am not saying this would have made the disease go away, but the cases would have been much lower. What happened to the PM-Cares fund?” Senior Trinamool Congress MPs Derek O’Brien and Mahua Moitra had taken to Twitter earlier in the day to strongly question the eight-phase polls. The MPs did not explicitly speak on clubbing the final phases, which the CM did later. O’Brien, tweeted: “The TWO will say, let people die. But don’t do anything to thwart our blind ambition of ‘winning Bengal’.” In another post, he said: “We did NOT want an 8 Phase election in the first place.” Moitra said: “It is certainly criminal negligence bordering on manslaughter on part of the Election Commission to mandate 8 phase election in West Bengal in the middle of a worst pandemic. Unbelievable that we are being put through this. Infections, deaths rising everyday.” The CM, during her interview, repeated her allegations that BJP was bringing in several thousand people from other states for the Bengal polls, which was causing the spike in cases. Banerjee’s statements came a day before Bengal chief electoral officer Ariz Aftab is scheduled to meet all political parties after the Calcutta High Court directed the CEO and DMs to strictly adhere to Covid norms during electioneering. The Left Front has already said it would avoid large public meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/club-remaining-poll-phases-cm-urges-ec-over-covid-fears/articleshow/82092800.cms||---

Chatterjee, a former state bar council chairman, had earlier filed a PIL on February 22 apprehending violence during elections, but the bench of Chief Justice TB Radhakrishnan had turned down the plea mentioning faith in the poll panel. In his fresh appeal, Chatterjee pleaded that he was constrained to approach Calcutta high court because in the past few weeks, the EC and various law enforcing agencies of the state and Centre had “miserably failed to ensure free and fair polls in the state, to preserve law and order and to safeguard the life of the citizens”. Chatterjee said he apprehended that the law and order situation would likely become more critical. “Innocent people are the victims in this situation; so the judiciary must help as there has been loss of lives during the first four phases,” the PIL said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/former-ag-moves-hc-again-over-poll-violence/articleshow/82092348.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Vote for MSP, Rakesh Tikait urges Bengal farmers||BURDWAN: Leaders of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha on Thursday held a mahapanchayat in Bengal’s rice bowl to present a counter-narrative to the BJP’s “pro-farmer” stance amid the assembly polls. “This is the moment when BJP seniors will arrive on your doorstep and ask for a handful of rice. Ask for MSP (minimum support price) for your paddy when you give them the rice. You need to work out a plan and ask them these questions because they will come to you again at the end of 2023, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections,” said Morcha spokesperson Rakesh Tikait at Asansol Municipal Park Maidan in Burdwan. Tikait and several others, including activist Medha Patkar, have been touring the districts and urging farmers to give BJP a sharp rebuff in the Bengal polls. “Farmers are under threat. They are not being able to protect their own produce. The BJP-led government at the Centre is also bringing an amendment to the Electricity Act that makes it mandatory for people rearing more than one cow to apply for commercial connection,” he said. The Morcha leader said the Centre would soon pave the way for companies, such as Walmart, which will end business for local kirana shops. “The BJP is desperately banking on Bengal because it lost three assembly elections. A defeat in Bengal can break its arrogance,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vote-for-msp-tikait-urges-bengal-farmers/articleshow/82092321.cms||Mohammad Asif

In some cases, those seeking vaccination had to return home after hospitals said they were finding it difficult to get the stock from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). For instance, at least 16 persons waiting at Apollo Specialty Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road, on Thursday afternoon were told vaccines were in short supply. After talking to the BBMP, the hospital was allotted just two vials of Covishield for the day. As on Thursday morning, BBMP had a stock of 55,074 doses. Special commissioner (health) Rajendra Cholan confirmed they have enough stock and were waiting for more supplies from the state government. However, BBMP medical officers admitted that the shortage is evident. Belagavi hosp, Mys taluks report shortageWe know some hospitals have the capacity to do 100-200 vaccinations a day. We are providing them just 10-15 vials as there is not much stock. We have to run the show with the existing stock till the next consignment comes from the government,” a BBMP officer said. On Thursday, 16 persons in Apollo Specialty Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road, were told vaccines were in short supply. “We cannot plan sessions if there is not enough supply. Earlier, BBMP was providing doses sufficient for three days. Now hospitals have to procure doses for a particular day. Today, we had about 170 persons seeking vaccination with just15 vials (10 doses each). We had to request BBMP for more doses,” said Dr Yatheesh Govindaiah, Jayanagar unit head of the hospital, which later got two more vials. The hospital is now left with no doses. “We have been informed that BBMP will hand it to us once it receives vials from the state,” said Dr Yatheesh. At St Philomena’s hospital, two women were on Thursday told to come the next day as there was no vaccine stock. But the hospital explained it does not open a vial without at least 10 beneficiaries at hand. “We have doses. We do not open it for just two people. The rest goes waste,” said Dr Shankar Prasad, medical director. Dr HM Prasanna, president of Private Hospitals’ and Nursing Homes’ Association, said smaller hospitals doing about 50 vaccinations a day are not facing shortage, but it is evident in larger hospitals. The shortage was acute in Vijayapura, which stopped the drive for three days. Belagavi district hospital reported shortage on Thursday and most people were not administered the first dose. Several taluks in Mysuru district saw shortage as the district had 20,000 doses against the daily target of 30,000. Later, it was allotted 40,000 doses, enough till Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vaccine-shortage-in-bengaluru-hospitals-enough-stock-bbmp/articleshow/82094085.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The EC said Ghosh, who had threatened “Sitalkuchi in several places” in the event of “anybody crossing his limit” during a speech on April 11, “had made highly provocative and inciteful remarks which could adversely impact law and order, thereby adversely affecting the poll process”. Finding him guilty of having violated the model code of conduct, the commission imposed a 24-hour campaigning ban on him from 7pm on Thursday to 7pm on Friday. The ban came despite Ghosh expressing regret for any remarks construed as in violation of the model code and promising to abide by EC directives. While the EC notice had termed his statement in violation of Section 123(3A) of the RP Act (intimidation of voters) and Section 153A of IPC (creating hatred between communities), it did not refer to these two laws in the final order on Thursday. The EC issued a notice to Basu for his remark: “We will play the Sitalkuchi game. They killed Ananda Barman. We didn’t have to wait for long...

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: 10% of people get first dose, 1% fully covered||BENGALURU: Karnataka has covered nearly 10% of its population with the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine 90 days on since the drive began, while around 1% have been fully inoculated with both doses. The state has been administering an average of two lakh doses in April so far, and while it may find it difficult to maintain the pace given erratic supply of doses across the country – many districts in the state reported an acute shortage of vials on Thursday – the health department is confident of administering at least two lakh doses each day going forward. Dr KV Trilok Chandra, health commissioner, told TOI: “We received another five lakh doses today and we expect to receive another round of supplies by April 20. I think we will be able to maintain the same pace.” So far, the state has received 81.6 lakh doses of vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin together — and used up 65.5 lakh doses. At the current rate, the number of doses in storage (16.1 lakh) will be exhausted in the next eight days. As of 7am on Thursday, data from the Union ministry of health shows that the state has administered more than 65.5 lakh vaccine doses, covering more than 59.3 lakh people (9% of the estimated 6.6 crore total population). Of these, 6.1 lakh people (0.9% of the population) have got both doses. Comparatively, the total cases in Karnataka was around 10.9 lakh by the end of Wednesday and is expected to breach the 11-lakh mark soon. The pace of vaccination has picked up significantly in the state with more than 28.2 lakh doses administered in the first 14 days of April. As of Thursday morning, the state had held more than 1.4 lakh sessions and administered 65.5 lakh doses, compared to 85,503 sessions and 37.2 lakh doses as of March 31. In the past fortnight, Karnataka has administered an average of 46 jabs per session. Comparatively, the cumulative average is around 44 jabs per session, while it was around 43 up to the first week of April. Further analysis of data shows that in the first 43 days, the state had held only about 25,764 sessions and administered around 8.4 lakh doses. In the next 47 days, the state has administered around 57 lakh doses at the rate of around 1.2 lakh doses per day. Health minister K Sudhakar had told TOI on April 6 that the state is looking to enhance the daily target to 2.5 lakh doses. “But that will depend on how many more doses we receive and how quickly,” one official said. Notwithstanding the good pace at which people are being inoculated, experts TOI spoke with advised caution, given the massive surge in cases over the past fortnight. And, as reported by TOI earlier, the effect of vaccination — it does not prevent infection completely but blunts severity of the disease — is expected to show only during the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-10-of-people-get-first-dose-1-fully-covered/articleshow/82094082.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Reforms in MSME sector to reduce regulatory burden||CHANDIGARH: To make Punjab stand out for ‘ease of doing business for MSME’, chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday announced reforms to further reduce the regulatory burden through rationalisation, digitalisation and decriminalisation of the regulatory landscape. He said the reforms would bring about future changes, including rationalising trade licenses with shops and Establishments Act and removing imprisonment terms from 100 low risk provisions in non-labour related rules. The CM also announced cut in number of labour registers, requiring an entrepreneur to maintain from 60 to less than 14, and flexibility enhanced hiring of women employees. Discretionary powers of inspectors are being removed with regard to deductions related to absence or leave, which will be deduced from labour registers going forward. These changes will be incorporated in new state rules. The reforms, launched in partnership with Game (Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship) and Omidyar Network India, prioritise ease of doing business (EoDB) for MSMEs in the state, based on data-informed regulatory changes. These were suggested by the Game EoDB Task Force’s report ‘Transforming EoDB for MSMEs in Punjab’. The task force was set up on the recommendation of the Montek Ahluwalia committee, set up by the state government to revive business in the post-Covid environment. To ensure timely delivery of key licenses and permits, as prescribed under the Transparency Act 2018, a monthly data driven assessment mechanism under the chief secretary has been launched to ensure not a single license or permit is delayed beyond the stipulated period. It is also proposed to reduce the number of pre-commissioning licenses and NOCs to start a business by at least 20%, so the government, without due cause, never does not inhibit an entrepreneur to start a new shop or factory, with the possibility of doing this entirely online being explored. In addition, changes will be made in land use for starting new business and mechanisms will be developed for timely and hassle-free water, electricity and sewage connections. “We hope to make Punjab a lighthouse state for MSME growth support,” he said.adding, “We have listened to entrepreneurs on the ground and we will continue to reduce the compliance burden to start, operate, and grow a business.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/reforms-in-msme-sector-to-reduce-regulatory-burden/articleshow/82091789.cms||---

Suguna (49), a resident of Nakshatra Layout, Hennur Main Road, was a homemaker struggling to make ends meet after her husband passed away last month due to a heart-attack. That left their two young sons and his septuagenarian mother in Suguna’s care. Sadly, Suguna developed Covid symptoms last week and was admitted to Akash Institute of Medical Sciences in Devanahalli on April 9. The following day, her mother-in-law Regina (75) too was rushed to the hospital with breathlessness and other Covid complications. “Regina died soon after she was admitted to the hospital and within hours her daughter-in-law Suguna also breathed her last. The two children including a teenager Sam were orphaned in one sad stroke,” said a relative. Belonging to a lower middle-class family, the children received some help from the local church and the bodies of their mother and grandmother were brought to the Indian Christian Cemetery for the last rites on Sunday. “It was the most heartbreaking case I have been involved with as the boys remained inconsolable. They lost all their loved ones within just a month,” said Tanveer Ahamed, a frontline worker who helps transports Covid-19 bodies and assists with final rites. Besides the two boys, some frontline workers were also present during the burial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-woman-mom-in-law-succumb-to-covid-buried-next-to-each-other/articleshow/82094100.cms||Petlee Peter
---||India||SC asks CBI to probe role of cops in Isro spy case||NEW DELHI: Nearly 27 years after they arrested top Isro scientists in a cooked up spy case, the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the CBI to probe the role of three Kerala police officers — Siby Mathews, K K Joshua and S Vijayan — after the SC-appointed Justice D K Jain committee submitted a sealed cover report on the issue. A bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Krishna Murari sent a copy of the Justice Jain Committee report to the acting director of CBI and ordered him to supervise the probe. The bench asked the agency not to make the report public unless it decided to register an FIR. However, it said the committee report could serve as preliminary enquiry for the CBI to proceed further. This order was passed on a petition by former Isro scientist Nambi Narayanan, who was arrested by a Kerala police SIT headed by Mathews on November 30, 1994, two weeks after the police picked up two Maldivian women on charges of spying. The police team also arrested four others, including Isro scientists, on charges of selling rocket technology. After the case kicked up a row, the Kerala government consented to a CBI probe. The agency filed a closure report before the chief judicial magistrate, Ernakulam, in May 1996 saying the scientists were arrested in a case where there was no evidence to back the charges. The CBI report had said, “It was unprofessional on Mathews’s part to have ordered indiscriminate arrest of top Isro scientists who played a key role in successful launching of satellites.” After the CBI’s closure report, the Kerala government in June 1996 withdrew its consent for CBI probe and ordered re-investigation by the Kerala police. The SC quashed this and freed all the accused. Nearly 24 years after his arrest, the SC had created history on September 14, 2018, when it directed the Kerala government to pay Rs 50 lakh compensation to Narayanan for “blatant violation” of his right to life, within eight weeks. The amount was paid to Narayanan a few days ago. The apex court had even permitted Narayanan to proceed with his civil suit seeking more damages from the state. The SC had also set up an inquiry committee headed by ex-SC judge D K Jain to probe the role of policemen Mathews, Joshua and Vijayan in framing Narayanan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-asks-cbi-to-probe-role-of-cops-in-isro-spy-case/articleshow/82094107.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Though what happened in the flat is unclear, preliminary investigation by the police found that the eldest son, Deepak, had killed the other family members before ending his life. Police have identified the deceased as Sunkari Bangaru Naidu (55), his wife Sunkari Nirmala (50) and sons Sunkari Deepak (21) and Sunkari Kashyap (19). Police commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha, who inspected the scene of offence, said they are investigating the case from different angles. It could be a case of accident, mass suicide or homicide. Police, however, are giving thrust to the murder angle as there were injuries on the bodies of Naidu, Nirmala and Kashyap. Forensic teams have collected evidence from the flat. Naidu, who was working in Bahrain, returned to Vizag a few years ago. His wife was a homoeopath. Police said neighbours heard sounds at around 2 am on Thursday and two hours later, they noticed smoke emanating from the flat. Fire tenders were called. The fire team broke open the front door and entered the flat to find the bodies lying in the hall and bedroom. Police said there were stab and lacerated wounds on the bodies of Naidu, Nirmala and Kashyap. The body of Deepak was found in the bathroom.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/four-members-of-nri-family-found-dead-in-their-vizag-flat/articleshow/82094121.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Chennai||No all-pass, arrear students must write exams: Tamil Nadu in HC||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday went back on its decision to cancel arrear exams for college students in the state due to the pandemic, and told the Madras high court that no student would be declared passed without writing an online exam. Recording the submission, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed the state to conduct online exams, preferably within eight weeks, and told the state to take immediate steps to issue final certificates to those who have already cleared the online exams. The decision comes days after the bench dubbed the allpass GO issued by the state as nothing but an “uninformed political decision.” On Thursday, advocate-general Vijay Narayan told the bench: “We have decided to abide by the guidelines of the UGC. It will be mandatory for all students who have arrears to attend online exams.” Earlier, Vijay Narayan also said that already 2.66 lakh students have appeared for the exams and 1.93 lakh students are waiting to take the exams. Based on the outcome of the exams, degrees would be awarded to them, he said. Unqualified cannot be certified: HCThe issue pertains to two PILs by advocate Ramkumar Aditiyan and former vice-chancellor of Anna University EBalaguruswamy challenging the government’s all-pass order, cancelling arrear exams. When the plea came up for hearing, the state informed the court that it had decided to conduct online exams since the court had made it clear that it was not happy with the GO cancelling exams. The bench then directed the state and the UGC to suggest any ameliorative measures that could be taken by way of an examination or someother method. “It is inconceivable that a whole mass of students will be certificated to have qualified in a system without having basic knowledge in respect of key aspects thereof,” the court said. “There is no doubt that lakhs of students who had thought that they had cleared the particular course after writing their final semester may have to be held back because they did not clear previous papers – at the same time, unqualified persons cannot be certified to have qualified to pursue professional courses or even higher studies,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-all-pass-arrear-students-must-write-exams-tamil-nadu-in-hc/articleshow/82094133.cms||Suresh Kumar

The multiple murders took place at Juttada under Pendurthi police station limits in Visakhapatnam city on Thursday. The victims included a six-month-old baby. Police said that one of the men of the victim’s family was accused of raping the assailant’s daughter in 2018 and is believed to be the main target of the attack. However, the rape accused and his eldest son were not in the house when the attack took place and are now the only survivors of the family. The assailant, who had allegedly been waiting for an opportunity to kill the rape accused, entered the house in the early hours of Thursday after he found out that the family had returned to the locality after two years to attend a wedding. He hacked the victims one after another with a sickle. Bodies were found strewn at different places in the house with blood all around. Officials added that the assailant did not run away after committing the crime. He was arrested from the spot with the bloody sickle in his hand. The dead included the rape accused’s father (57), wife (30), son (2), daughter (6 months), and mother-in-law (53). A distant relative, who was present in the house, was also killed. The family had been living in Vijayawada after the rape case was registered. Police officials said the rape accused, though married, had become close to the assailant’s daughter. In 2018, he had allegedly called the girl to his house and offered her a soft drink laced with a sedative. When she fell unconscious, he allegedly raped her several times. The man was arrested in the rape case and was out on bail. Police claimed that his wife was also accused of blackmailing the rape survivor by showing her semi-nude photos and demanding money from her. His other relatives also resorted to blackmailing the girl. The police had registered a rape case after the girl’s brother noticed threatening Whatsapp messages on her phone and lodged a complaint. When the girl’s family questioned the man and his family, the latter allegedly threatened them with dire consequences. The killer hacked the victims one after another with a sickle.

---||India||Delay in picking judges: Government holds mirror to Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Put under intense scrutiny for delaying appointment of high court judges cleared by the Supreme Court collegium, the Centre on Thursday held the mirror to the SC and said of the 416 vacant HC judge posts, no recommendation had been made by HC collegiums for 220 posts. Attorney general K K Venugopal submitted a chart of the vacancies in the 25 HCs and said of the 196 names for which recommendations were sent by the HC collegiums, 94 were pending with the SC collegium, 33 with the Centre and 10 with state governments. Of these, 48 have been approved by the SC collegium and sent to the government while 11 were sent back to HC collegiums. Explaining the timeframe for appointment of HC judges provided in the memorandum of procedure (MoP) to a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices S K Kaul and Surya Kant, Venugopal said the HC collegium is required to send names six months before a vacancy arises. However, not a single HC has followed this. The AG’s note suggested that the bigger the high court, bigger was the magnitude of breach of the MoP clause. Of the 220 HC judges posts for which no recommendation has been made, Punjab and Haryana HC accounted for the highest at 32, followed by Allahabad HC with 28, Delhi 23, Gujarat 21, Patna 17, Calcutta 14, Andhra Pradesh 13, Madhya Pradesh 11 and Bombay 10. Jharkhand HC has not recommended any name for an HC judge post which fell vacant almost seven years ago. Delhi HC is not far behind, as the oldest vacancy against which no names have been sent is 4 years and 8 months old. Many HCs have not recommended names against five-year-old vacancies, the AG’s note said. The AG said after the HC collegium sends the Centre a name recommending appointment as HC judge, the Centre sends it to the CM/governor of the state for their views which are to be given in six weeks. However, there is no timeframe for the government, which carries out discreet inquiries, including that by the Intelligence Bureau, for forwarding the recommendations to the SC collegium, the final selection authority for HC and SC judges. The SC collegium should complete scrutiny in four weeks and return it to the law ministry, which would place the names before the PMO. The MoP is silent on the timeframe for the PMO to send it to the President, who is the appointing authority for judges. The SC asked the AG what should be a reasonable period for the Centre to send the names to the SC collegium. The AG said it could be three months. The bench asked why the Centre was sitting on 10 names for appointment to Calcutta HC and J&K HC for over seven months. The AG said it would be processed in three months. All major HCs have massive vacancies. Allahabad HC has a vacancy of 58 against the sanctioned strength of 160, Bombay has 32 (sanctioned strength 92), Calcutta 40 (72), Delhi 29 (60), Punjab & Haryana 39 (85), MP 29 (53), Rajasthan 27 (50), Gujarat 22 (52), Patna 22 (53) and Andhra Pradesh 18 (37).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delay-in-picking-judges-government-holds-mirror-to-supreme-court/articleshow/82094140.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

For the moment, no further money should be expended on the betterment of the building since the building may be directed to be brought down if it is discovered that it has been constructed on land which was originally part of a water body,” said the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy. “It is imperative that a newly constructed building is brought down, if only for the state to take it as a notice that the further desecration of water bodies will not be condoned or tolerated on any ground whatsoever,” the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said on Thursday. The court passed the interim order on a plea moved by NGO Arappor Iyakkam alleging that the police station was constructed on a water body in violation of an order passed by the court. The bench also directed the IIT-Madras to nominate experts to ascertain the nature of the land on which the police station was built and suggest remedial measures to be taken. The court also noted that it is equally possible that the petitioner’s apprehension may be unfounded, and the building has been constructed on such part of the land which did not form any part of any water body. It is necessary that some expert opinion be sought so that that it may be assessed whether the land was once part of water body. For such purpose the director of the IIT (Madras) is requested to nominate two appropriate teachers to conduct a study and to report to this court as to the status of the land where the police station has come up. And suggest remedial measures if such building appears to have come up om a land that was part of a water body,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/new-police-station-building-will-be-razed-if-found-built-on-lake-madras-hc-warns-tamil-nadu/articleshow/82094153.cms||Suresh Kumar

But, by Thursday, coronavirus reached the judges’ residences and caused abrupt disruption of hearing before a bench. After a single day’s testing of around 100 employees in the SC returned Covid positive results for 45% of them, the SC judges had decided to operate from their residences. However, in the last one week, the virus infected a majority of SC staff, who operate from the residences of judges. On Thursday a bench had to abruptly end hearing midway in the morning. TOI spoke to the judge and found he had got his residential staff tested the day before. “While I was hearing the case, I was told that the test reports of eight of my staff... had come positive for Covid-19,” he said. The bench resumed hearing in the afternoon. The second wave has infected one SC judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-infections-disrupt-apex-courts-virtual-hearing-too/articleshow/82094155.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Surat||Pandemic doubles diamond certification period||Surat: With restrictions on travel due to the pandemic, the demand for certification of diamonds has shot up. The diamond companies are forced to wait for at least two months, as compared to the standard one-month period, to get the certificate. The delay in getting the certificate sets off a domino effect. It increases the number of days of payment cycle which results in small manufacturers bearing the burden of interest as they have to pay to raw diamond suppliers on time and then wait for almost two months before putting the finished product for sale. “Since the buyers cannot travel and see the diamonds personally, all are insisting on having certificates. Certain diamonds which are of more than 2 cents or fancy coloured ones are sent to USA and it takes up to three months to get their certification,” said Dinesh Navadiya, regional president of Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC). He added that now not only the manufacturer of natural ones, but manufacturers of synthetic and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamonds also get their diamonds certified. “The foreign laboratories have their testing facilities in Mumbai but due to the pandemic the facilities are working with limited resources in adherence with the Covid-19 guidelines,” Navadiya said. “Demand for certification has increased as everyone wants to quickly sell their products because there is uncertainty about the lockdown. So, there must be burden on the certification companies too,” said Babu Kathiriya, president of Surat Diamond Association. Earlier companies could sell polished and certified diamonds within 120 days of buying raw diamonds. But that period has gone up to 180 days due to the delay in certification. “Without certificate the product cannot be put for sale online. Since, there is a delay in certification the companies are not able to sell them as quickly as they used to do earlier,” Kathiriya said. “Earlier, the companies at the time of purchasing raw diamonds could hope of making the payment in 120 days as polishing would take a month and then the certification process would take another month and in the next two months the stock could be sold off. But now due to the delay in certification, smaller companies bear the burden of interest as the payments to raw diamond suppliers have to be done in time,” Navadiya added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/pandemic-doubles-diamond-certification-period/articleshow/82089754.cms||Jay Pachchigar

The state reported 14 fatalities, taking the toll to 7,353. The 5,086 new infections emerged from 35,741 samples tested. Of the 14 fatalities, Chittoor district reported five deaths to reach a total of 904 deaths since the start of the pandemic last year. Anantapur, Kurnool and Visakhapatnam reported two deaths each, while one death each was reported in Guntur, Kadapa and Krishna districts.

---||India||Covid hits justice delivery: Backlog of cases rises 19% in a year, crosses 4.4 crore||NEW DELHI: The Covid-19 induced disruptions have made a bigger dent on the administration of justice in India with the pendency of cases having crossed 4.4 crore across all courts as on Thursday. At an all-time record, the backlog across Supreme Court, high courts and about 19,000 district and subordinate courts have gone up by at least 19% since March last year. Despite resuming urgent hearings on the digital platform once the lockdown imposed in March last year was lifted, more than 70 lakh cases have been added to the pendency list. Total cases pending as of March 25, 2020 were 3.68 crore. The alarming increase in pendency of cases is not surprising given the reluctance of the Indian legal system to quickly adapt to new challenges and migrate to the digital format. After over a decadelong modernisation drive, almost the entire three-tier justice delivery system has been computerised and equipped with modern technology. However, opposition from a section of the lawyers’ fraternity has resulted in a slow-paced migration to the digital format. The other reason that has compounded the current situation is rising vacancies across all three-tiers of the judiciary. While there have been over 400 judges’ posts vacant in 25 high courts, the lower judiciary has vacancies for 5,000 judges. The SC too has four vacancies. Niti Aayog, in a 2018 strategy paper, had noted that at the current rate of disposal of cases in our courts, it will take over 324 years to clear the backlog. At the time the pendency was 2.9 crore cases. The pandemic has only made it worse with the backlog of 30-yr-old cases alone rising by 61% over the last two years — from 65,695 in December 2018 to 1,05,560 till January 2021. The SC must look at urgently implementing the next phase of the proposed eCourts project which envisages complete transformation of Indian courts — with ePay, eSummons, eHearings and eJudgment. It proposes a 24/7 digital window for litigants to file cases from anywhere, anytime with provision for scheduling digital hearings and ensuring compliance of timelines by judges and lawyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-hits-justice-delivery-backlog-of-cases-rises-19-in-a-year-crosses-4-4-crore/articleshow/82094172.cms||Pradeep Thakur

A total of 7,987 new cases and 29 deaths were recorded on Thursday, the highest in 2021.  While cases began to dip after TN touched the peak in June 2020, officials say epidemiological parameters such as falling doubling time, increasing positivity rate and daily case count indicate that TN may hit a new peak in the second surge. “The aim is to ensure hospital beds are used for patients who deserve it. Those with mild disease can be in home isolation or in Covid Care Centres,” said health secretary JRadhakrishnan. On Thursday, at least 20 of the 38 TN districts reported three-digit spike in cases. With 2,558 fresh cases, Chennai’s active case count touched 21,391, while Chengalpet reported 685 new cases and 5,415 active cases.

---||Vijayawada||Fix price for treatment in private hospitals: Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy asked the administration to popularise the toll- free number 104 for people to report Covid-19 issues. He said the call to 104 should be attended immediately and service provided without delay. He wanted health officials to reach the caller in less than 15 minutes. Speaking at a review meeting of health department with focus on Covid-19 and vaccination drive in the state at his Tadepalli camp office on Thursday, the chief minister asked the health officials to monitor the 104 toll-free number closely from the time a call is made. He said people calling 104 requesting Covid-19 test should be directed to respective PHC or sub-center or village clinic. He wanted the officials to lay focus on hospital care, sanitation and food quality in hospitals for patients during these critical days. He added that quality of medication and providing medicine at time are also important. He said primary contacts of Covid-19 patients should be traced and tested and arrangements should be made to conduct tests in all PHCs. He congratulated the health department for administrating 6.28 lakh doses of vaccine the previous day, achieving the stipulated target and said to continue the same in the coming days. The chief minister, amid the shortage of Covid-19 vaccines, directed the health officials to write a letter to the central government seeking Covid-19 vaccines and said he would write the letter seeking the same, if necessary. He also directed the officials to fix price for treatment in private hospitals and ensure that they don’t charge more money. He said there should be no scarcity of beds for Covid-19 patients and directed the officials to maintain record on availability of beds in Arogyasri empanelled hospitals and private hospitals. The officials told the chief minister that test positivity rate is around 6% and 108 hospitals are under health department for Covid-19 treatment. They said 15,669 beds are available of which 4,889 are occupied and 1,987 ventilators are available and added that 22,637 patients are in home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fix-price-for-treatment-in-private-hospitals-andhra-pradesh-cm-ys-jagan-mohan-reddy/articleshow/82094191.cms||Gopi Dara

ICG director general Krishnaswamy Natarajan said fast interceptor craft, along with ATS personnel, had been continuously deployed since an “input” was received on Tuesday about suspected narcotics being trafficked by a Pakistani fishing boat “NUH” off the Gujarat coast. During the “concerted surveillance operation”, the boat was finally detected inside Indian waters on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. “We nabbed the Pakistani fishing boat, with eight persons, off Jakhau. On boarding and rummaging, the boat was found to be carrying 30 packets of heroin, each weighing a kg, which in the international market is valued at Rs 300 crores,” said Natarajan. The boat, with its eightmember crew, is being escorted to Jakhau for investigations. “In the last 19 months, the ICG has apprehended over 1.6 tonne of narcotics worth around Rs 5,200 crore,” he added. “The contraband was loaded from Karachi in Pakistan and was to be delivered to Punjab via Gujarat,” said an ATS officer, adding that the agency is close on the trail of those who were to receive the drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/boat-with-8-pakistan-nationals-30kg-of-heroin-seized-off-gujarat-coast/articleshow/82094202.cms||---

The group of monuments at Mamallapuram and Fort Museum in Chennai will be closed till May 15 in line with the ASI’s decision in view of the Covid surge. Tamil Nadu has 411 monuments maintained by ASI circles headquartered at Chennai and Trichy, of which nearly 80 are living monuments. This includes St Mary's Church at Fort St. George in Chennai. At temples maintained by the ASI, devotees will not be allowed in but poojas will continue, said an official. Another official said clarification is being sought regarding the closure of Kailasanathar Temple at Kancheepuram that comes under the jurisdiction of Chennai Circle. “As per the order, all monuments will remain closed for public. We are awaiting further clarification,” the official said. Sources further added that all ticketed and non-ticketed monuments would be closed from Friday based on the order. Footfalls at the ticketed monuments at Mamallapuram dropped substantially over the past fortnight. The world heritage site near Chennai received hardly 1,100 and 1,800 visitors on the closed holidays on Tuesday and Wednesday. The number of visitors on holidays used to be 6,000 to 8,000 during pre-Covid times. ASI-run monuments were first closed due to Covid-19 in March last year. While 80 monuments including the Brihadeeswarar temples in Thanjavur and Gangaikonda Cholapuram and the Kailasanathar Temple in Kancheepuram were reopened from September 1. Other monuments, including Mamallapuram, were reopened on December 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-19-big-temple-among-monuments-shut-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/82094212.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss
---||Amaravati||Tirupati Lok Sabha bypoll campaign concludes, voting tomorrow||AMARAVATI: The curtains came down on the high-voltage campaign for Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election on Thursday. While YSRC is confident of retaining the seat, the TDP and BJP-Jana Sena candidates are hoping to create an upset. The polling will be held on Saturday. The bypoll was necessitated after YSRC’s sitting MP Balli Durgaprasada Rao passed away last year. With chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy cancelling his lone public meeting in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases in Chittoor and Nellore districts, YSRC left the campaign burden on the shoulders of panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy and TTD chairman YV Subba Reddy. Several ministers, MPs and MLAs also toured the constituency to campaign for party candidate Dr Gurumurthy. YSRC has won both elections it contested from Tirupati since its inception a decade ago. The ruling party’s majority increased six-fold from 40,000 in 2014 to 2.25 lakh in 2019. The BJP-Jana Sena alliance has fielded former IAS officer Ratna Prabha, while opposition TDP has nominated former Union minister Panabaka Lakshmi. TDP conducted a vigorous campaign with party president N Chandrababu Naidu, party’s national general secretary Nara Lokesh, state president Atchannaidu, besides several of its legislators and former ministers involved in the campaign. The Congress, meanwhile, is struggling to find its feet in a constituency which was once its stronghold. Party candidate Chinta Mohan is working to revive the fortunes of the party notwithstanding his defeat in the last two elections. A six-time MP from Tirupati, Chinta Mohan got only 2.75 per cent votes in 2014 and 1.83 per cent in 2019, which was less than NOTA which got 1.96 per cent votes in the last election. Meanwhile, the Election Commission of India (EC) has provided postal ballot facility for octogenarian electors in Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election. Special officers appointed by the EC have already visited the residences of electors aged 80 years and above to help them exercise their franchise through postal ballot. A special mobile booth was set up at the residence of such electors to enable them to exercise their voting right. Chief electoral officer K Vijayanand said this is the first time such an initiative has been taken up. “There are 22,743 octogenarian voters in Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency. Those who expressed the wish to utilise the facility were allowed to use postal ballot facility at their residence,” he said. Vijayanand further said that elaborate arrangements have been made keeping Covid-19 protocols in mind for the peaceful conduct of the bypoll on Saturday. “Polling booths have been set up for every 1,000 voters, as against 1,500 voters in the past, to avoid overcrowding. About 2,470 polling stations have been set up, spread over seven assembly segments in Tirupati constituency. All polling personnel have been administered Covid-19 vaccine. The EC has appointed three special observers to monitor the election process,” he added. Ravi Shankar Ayyannar, additional DG (law & order), said they have deployed additional forces to ensure a free and fair election. “About 23 companies of central forces have already reached their destinations in the constituency. We have set up 52 check-posts to prevent the movement of cash and liquor. Nearly 4.73 crore in cash and thousands of bottles of liquor have been seized during vehicle checks so far,” he informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/tirupati-lok-sabha-bypoll-campaign-concludes-voting-tomorrow/articleshow/82094221.cms||Samdani MN

Petrol price was reduced by 16 paise per litre and diesel by 14 paise. This is the fourth marginal reduction in three weeks, before which the retailers continuously raised prices for six months. As a result, prices had hit record highs and petrol crossed Rs 100 a litre in several cities. Pump prices were reduced for the first time in six months on March 24. This was done after crude prices tumbled from their highs of $70/ barrel as a resurgence in Covid-19 infections in major economies dashed hopes of an early return of oil demand. In the three reductions, petrol price has come down by 61 paise per litre and diesel by 60 paise. After Thursday’s price cut, the total reduction comes to 67 paise in case of petrol and 74 paise on diesel. Despite long spells of a freeze on revisions, pump prices had gone up by a record Rs 21.58 per litre on petrol since the government raised excise duty in March last year. Diesel prices increased by Rs 19.18 a litre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/4th-reduction-in-3-weeks-petrol-price-cut-by-16-paise-diesels-by-14-paise/articleshow/82094225.cms||---

At present, the state is having a limited stock and it might get exhausted in another three days. The state had received 60 lakh vaccines and at present the state has a stock of 7,25,300 vaccines. On an average the state is having two lakh vaccinations per day. With the existing stock, now the state will have only vaccines for three days. As a result in many of the districts, the massive vaccination camps planned had to be stopped due to the shortage. The existing stock was used only in the hospitals. However, after the high-level meeting, it has been decided to use all the existing stock by doing maximum vaccination. “We have asked the Centre to provide the vaccines at the earliest. We expect that the next consignment will reach here by Saturday,” said chief secretary V P Joy. As per the estimate, the state has a population of 1.15 crore people who are above 45 years of age. “So far, we received 60 lakh vaccines and 50 lakh vaccines have been given as the first dose. Now, we need 50 lakh more to meet the present demand. Hence, we have requested the Centre to provide this,” said the chief secretary. The state had received 56,84,360 vaccines till April 12. The next day the state got two lakh more Covaxin doses. The state had demanded 25 lakh Covishield and 25 lakh Covaxin. On Thursday, the state received two lakh doses of Covishield. Of the total 60 lakh vaccines received, only four lakh have been Covaxin. The state has been heavily depending on Covishield vaccine. The Centre had informed the state that it will send the next consignment of vaccines on April 20. However, the state has sought the next load by April 17 to tide over the crisis. The vaccine camps in many districts like Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Alappuzha were hit due to the shortage. In Thiruvananthapuram, all the ward-level camps have been suspended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-stares-at-vaccine-shortage/articleshow/82094188.cms||---

---||Nashik||Covid after vaccination milder, can be treated at home: Nashik data||NASHIK: A number of senior citizens, healthcare workers and people over 45 with underlying conditions have contracted Covid after at least one dose of the Covid vaccine. But the infection in those who've received their jabs is mild and most of them recover at home, one analysis of such cases in Nashik has found. The data from Nashik, of 150 people who developed infection after at least one shot, found only 25 went on to need hospitalisation, five of them with serious symptoms. But all of them recovered within 14 to15 days. And importantly, no family members were infected. Jitendra Dhaneshwar, divisional medical officer from the Nashik Road division, said most of the 150 people in the study were citizens (70% over 60; 25% in the 45-plus age group). The rest of the 5% were healthcare workers. “None of these 150 patients turned critical and almost all of them recovered after home-isolation and medication,” said Dhaneshwar. A Covid-19 infection after full vaccination (both doses) is called a “breakthrough case”. Many countries have reported such events. In most cases, observations have found that infections have been mild or without symptoms, with the vaccines kicking in to provide protection from severe disease and death.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); In Nashik, Bapusaheb Nagargoje, medical superintendent of the city's municipal corporation, was among those infected despite a vaccine jab. “I was mildly symptomatic with no lung involvement. I recovered within 12 days,” he said. In Aurangabad, nearly 10 health workers and frontline staffers fell ill even after two doses of the vaccine. Kananbala Yelikar, dean of the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH); Neeta Padalkar, health officer with the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation; and AMC administrator Astik Kumar Pandey were among the 10. Padalkar said that she had a runny nose and mild fever. "I recovered at home after a few days. The vaccination had minimised the impact of infection." Anita Saibannavar, a pulmonologist with the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Civil Hospital — now a dedicated Covid hospital — said eight patients who had received one dose of the vaccine fell ill. One of them, an 85-year-old woman, succumbed but it's possible she had the infection before vaccination. “The rest of the vaccinated patients were sickened within a few days of the jab. Most had mild Covid and were treated using medicines prescribed for non-vaccinated patients with mild symptoms. They were discharged in 10 days," Saibannavar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-after-vaccination-milder-can-be-treated-at-home-nashik-data/articleshow/82094254.cms||Tushar Pawar

In districts which are reporting 100 cases or more a day or where the active cases are over 500, the night curfew will be in place from 9 pm to 6 am. As of Thursday evening, there were 10 districts in the state where active cases were more than 2,000. These include Lucknow, which had the highest number of active cases with 35,865, followed by Prayagraj with 13,237 cases, Varanasi with 11,562 cases and Kanpur with 7,476 cases. These four extremely sensitive districts account for 52.47% of the state’s total active cases. The remaining six, include Gorakhpur with 4,062 cases, Jhansi with 2,848, Meerut with 2,756, Noida with 2,334, Ballia with 2,153 and Bareilly with 2,013 cases. Together, these 10 districts account for 64.92% of the state’s 1,29,848 active cases. Simultaneously, there are 27 districts which have between 500 and 2,000 active cases. These include places like Moradabad, Agra, Saharanpur, Chitrakoot, Balrampur, Bhadohi etc. The government had on April 7 authorised district magistrates of districts which are eitherreporting more than 100 cases a day or where active cases are more than 500, to decide on restricting movement as long as it does not impact essential services.  The move came after the high court asked the UP Government to consider implementing a night curfew. Several districts, including Lucknow, announced night restrictions within the next couple of days. “The number of districts imposing the extended curfew will change, depending on the number of cases being reported ther," a government official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/night-curfew-extended-by-two-hours-in-up-districts-with-2k-plus-covid-cases/articleshow/82094277.cms||---
---||India||At Kumbh, Muslim saint who holds forth on Gita||HARIDWAR: With a U-shaped sandalwood paste tilak on his forehead, the traditional mark of a Vaishnavite seer, ochre-coloured shirt and sitting in front of a dhuni, Sri M seems like many of the other seers who have set up camp at the Bairagi Camp area of the Maha Kumbh. As he holds a discourse on the teachings of the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, it comes as a revelation to know that Sri M was born Mumtaz Ali Khan in a Muslim family of Kerala. At the Kumbh, he has set up his own akhada, Yoga Dham, where there are daily discourses from scriptures, sadhu seva (service to seers) and chanting of bhajans. “God is known by different names — Allah, Christ, Krishna and so many others. Despite different names, God is one and the same. Once we have this knowledge, we see that everyone is seeking the same thing,” he says, eyes crinkling into a smile. Awarded the Padma Bhushan last year for his philanthropic and spiritual work — his organisation Satsang Foundation runs schools and clinics for the underpriviliged at Madanapalle in Andhra Pradesh— the seer’s story is interesting. Born into a prosperous Muslim family in Thiruvananthapuram, he says he was drawn to the yogic way of life since childhood. At the age of 19, he ran off from home to go to the Himalayas in search of a guru, walking all the way from Rishikesh to Badrinath, a distance of around 300 km, dressed as a wandering sadhu. Eventually after a number of adventures which he has detailed in his book ‘Apprenticed to a Himalayan Master’, he met his guru, a Himalayan yogi, in a cave beyond Badrinath and was initiated into the ancient Nath sampradaya (to which UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath also belongs). He travelled in the Himalayas with his guru for over three years during which he says his guru initiated him into the ancient scriptural teachings. He now gives talks on yoga sutras, Upanishads and other Vedanta texts combining textual knowledge with the experiences of his wanderings with his guru. At the Kumbh, despite the Covid scare, a sizeable number of people had gathered to hear his discourses. Many of the seer’s followers are devout Hindus — a large sprinkling of them from west and south India--and for them, the fact that he was born a Muslim has never been a point of concern. “Even Kabir was born a Muslim but had disciples cutting across religions,” said Mahender Borana, a follower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-kumbh-muslim-saint-who-holds-forth-on-gita/articleshow/82094274.cms||Atul Sethi

But within weeks Patel and her husband had another scare as her periods were delayed by more than 10 days. The couple felt a little better when her pregnancy test turned out to be negative, but the delayed periods were still a worry. After consulting her doctor, she learnt that her menstrual cycle had been temporarily disturbed due to Covid. So far, it has been reported that the lungs, kidneys, liver and heart are the major organs that get affected due to the virus. But several women, who have tested negative even after having mild symptoms, have complained that their menstrual cycle got disturbed temporarily. “The first cycle after testing negative had been delayed and for the next couple of months it had become irregular and I used to get a fever,” said Patel, who lives in Vesu area of Surat. “Getting infected affects the psyche of the women and menstrual cycles are connected with psychology and it also affects the endocrine system. Due to this, there are hormonal disturbance and irregularity in menstrual cycles,” said Dr Pragna Pathak, a gynaecologist. “My cycles were due when I was down with Covid-19, but it got delayed by two weeks. I started practicing ‘pranayam’ due to which there is some improvement,” said Aarati Thakkar (name changed), a resident of Citylight. “The irregularity in the menstrual cycle can happen because of any infection,” said another gynaecologist Dr Kokila Desai. She added that she had received several complaints from patients regarding this condition. “Many people who keep experiencing Covid-19 symptoms months after the disease should have subsided, have been pointing out that it has also affected their menstrual cycles. A few of my patients, who were having regular menstrual cycles with normal flow, are also experiencing menstrual irregularities,” said gynaecologist Dr Rupal Shah.

---||Chandigarh||Dug-up road to be ready in 2 months: Mohali mayor||MOHALI: The new mayor, Amarjit Singh 'Jeeti' Sidhu, said his foremost task was to complete the sewer line project, road-recarpeting tenders for which will be out within this week and the work finished in two months. He said that within a day of assuming office, he had directed the officers concerned to float the tender for road recarpeting work. He said: "We will take up this sewer-line-laying project on priority and make the road motorable again within two months." The work began in August 2019 after inauguration by his brother, Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu. It halted many times due to either monsoon, contractor's issues, or the Covid-19 lockdown. Residents berated the civic body for 'lack of vision' for failing to gauge the onset of monsoons in the project timeline. Initiated under Amrut scheme, the project will lay sewerage in Phases I, II, 3B1, 3B2, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, and XI, whereas the earlier 40-to-45-year-old pipeline was based on the brick dart system. Now, nobody will have to enter the pipeline for cleaning and repair, since it will be done with hi-end machines. The pipeline will be 9.9 kilometres long and 24-48 inches thick. Its cost will be Rs 21.90 crore and its stretch from Baba Banda Singh Bahadur New Terminal to the roundabout of Sectors 64, 65, 66, and 67. The MC commissioner said the central government, state, and urban local bodies (ULB) will share the cost burden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dug-up-road-to-be-ready-in-2-months-mohali-mayor/articleshow/82094289.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

All those farmers will be given 15 days to deposit the cost of power line. Connections will be issued on first come first serve basis. He further said the officers of the corporation have been directed to complete the formalities and issue tubewell connections to the farmers as crops have been harvested and the fields are vacant, hence the corporation can do the work of laying power lines faster. In this direction, the corporation has empanelled firms to supply energy efficient motor pumpsets, which will provide motors to farmers at reasonable prices.
