---||Kolkata||Anxious about fresh COVID guidelines, families postpone April-May weddings||The summer wedding season is upon us, but the second wave of COVID-19 has cast a shadow over celebrations yet again. With many forced to postpone their weddings last year, venues were booked months in advance this year as people looked forward to hosting their big day celebrations without restrictions. However, the resurgence of COVID-19 infections, coupled with uncertainty over new government directives expected after the election results on May 2, has compelled many couples to postpone their weddings scheduled for April and May. The wedding industry, which was hopeful of a turnaround after the dismal business last year, is once again hit by last-minute changes in plans as a result of fear, panic and an overall sense of uncertainty looming large. Better safe than sorry: Would-be brides & groomsAlpesh Agarwal, whose marriage was scheduled for May 7, has called off his wedding for this season. “With elections going on in the state, there are no fresh guidelines from the government on social gatherings despite COVID cases increasing so much. I am sure like other states, West Bengal too will issue new directives to curb the second wave right after the election results are out. I see no point in getting married with so many uncertainties around. We had planned an elaborate wedding, so limiting guests is not feasible. A new wedding date will be decided upon post October,” he said. For Shagufta Rahaman, who was supposed to get married on May 19, health takes priority over everything else now. The second wave has prompted the would-be bride to postpone her wedding. “Seeing the restrictions on wedding guest list ease towards the end of last year and the fall in COVID cases in January and February, we thought of having our wedding in May this year. But now, with cases rising again and the overall uncertainty about the government directives likely to be announced after the election results on May 2, we’ve decided to postpone our wedding. We are anticipating either a lockdown or a night curfew. Hosting wedding functions in a situation like this is out of question as things are getting more serious with every passing day. We will take a final call on our marriage date after May,” she said. Akash Goenka was supposed to get married in December 2020, but postponed it to April this year due to the pandemic. Now, the second wave has led him to postpone it further. “I don’t wish to get married in such a grim situation. We have COVID cases in my family as well as my fiancée’s. How can we think of celebrating our big day with all these challenges? It’s surprising that despite so many cases, there are no new guidelines yet. What’s even more surprising is that many families are still going ahead with marriage functions knowing the cases are going up far more than last year. I don’t think it’s worth the risk. Better be safe than sorry by risking your own life and others’. Moreover, guests are also avoiding any kind of travelling at this time,” said Akash. Wedding venue bookings face cancellations In January-February, many couples who planned to get married in the upcoming wedding season in April-May, struggled to find venues as most places were already sold out by then. But now, several banquets are getting cancellation requests because weddings and related functions are being postponed due to the raging COVID surge. Manasi Lakhotia, a banquet owner, said lots of marriages planned for May are being cancelled now. “Some people are still going ahead with April bookings. Families are scared and in panic. No one has any clarity on the government directives that are yet to be announced in the wake of the second wave,” she said. Anil Bhutoria from a city hotel told us, “Cancellation of banquets booked for marriages and receptions is happening rampantly because of the fear of an imposition of a sudden and complete lockdown after the announcement of election results amid the worsening COVID situation.” Families anxious, don’t want limited guestsManoj Kheria, a city-based wedding planner, said the resurgence of COVID-19 infections has led to the cancellation of at least eight to nine of his wedding assignments scheduled till May 15. “Events planned for dates after May 15 are currently on hold as we can’t predict what the situation then would be like. The government might announce a lockdown or a night curfew after May 2, so it’s all very uncertain. Till now, one was allowed to have a guest list with 50% of the banquet capacity, but now with cases rising again, the authorities might reduce the limit further. Most families are anxious and they are either cancelling or postponing weddings as they don’t wish to host functions with limited guests.” According to wedding planner Bhavna Hemani, families are either postponing or cancelling weddings as they can’t seem to plan anything without getting a proper sense of what the revised guidelines would entail. “Weddings are all about making merry and celebrating with family and friends. But with the cases rising rapidly, people are tense and don’t want to go ahead with their wedding plans at least till May end. After cases started dropping, a lot of couples who couldn’t get married last year planned a big fat wedding with all the functions in April-May this year. But things are back to being uncertain and scary,” she said, adding that most destination weddings stand cancelled as people are not comfortable travelling in these circumstances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/anxious-about-fresh-covid-guidelines-families-postpone-april-may-weddings/articleshow/82119800.cms||Ruman Ganguly

After a recent visit to J&K, a CCG team, comprising former bureaucrat Wajahat Habibullah, retired Vice Air Marshal Kapil Kak, senior journalist and a lawyer Bharat Bhushan and prominent citizen Sushobha Barve, in its report, termed the claims of the central government about normalcy in Kashmir as a “distortion” of facts. Yashwant remained in touch with the four members throughout their visit virtually from New Delhi. In the report, Kak said: “Although Kashmir is comparatively normal, chaos, fear, anger and alienation are on the rise against the central government’s August 5, 2019 move (of scrapping the special status of the erstwhile state of J&K).” He said though the team visited Kulgam and was not stopped anywhere by security forces, the claims about empowerment of recently elected DDC representatives were contradicted by both the people on the ground as well as DDC representatives themselves. Among the ten suggestions the CCG report made, it wanted the Centre to address the sense of defeat and anger amongst the Kashmiris by opening up the democratic space for the people to express themselves. The report even suggested that security forces avoid blowing up homes of villagers where militants are taking shelter by force. It further suggested that there be “no imposition of artificial political processes on the Kashmiris, which outwardly seem okay but are bereft of any democratic muscle”. In another suggestion, the report wanted shifting of the delimitation office to J&K instead of it operating from New Delhi. Besides, the CCG wants that national opposition political parties be allowed to visit Kashmir, move around freely and meet local politicians and civil society actors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/yashwants-citizens-group-makes-10-suggestions-to-centre-on-kashmir-issue/articleshow/82122132.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||Woman injured after security forces fire on vehicle in Jammu and Kashmir||SRINAGAR: A woman sustained bullet injury on Saturday after the vehicle she was travelling in did not stop at two checkpoints in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir, police said. The woman — Jaisi Parvaiz Sheikh, a resident of Muran in Pulwama — was shifted by the cops to a hospital in Awantipora from where she was referred to the Bones and Joints Hospital in Srinagar for further treatment, a police spokesman said. Her condition is stated to be stable, he added. The vehicle driver, identified as Junaid Tariq Dar, a resident of Handwara in north Kashmir’s Kupwara district, has been arrested and the vehicle seized. Officials said that a Wagon-R was signaled to stop by a police party at the Awantipora Chowk at about 3:15pm but the driver hit a policeman and sped away. “The vehicle was again signaled to stop at the Padgampora Bridge, but this time too it did not stop. The CRPF personnel deployed at checkpoint fired warning aerial shots but the driver remained defiant,” they added. “The suspicious act of driver prompted the CRPF party to fire at the vehicle, causing a tyre burst, and in the ensuing incident, Jaisi Parvaiz Sheikh, a resident of Muran in Pulwama, who was travelling in the vehicle, sustained bullet injuries in her right arm,” officials said. An FIR mentioning charges under relevant sections of the law has been registered, the officials said, adding that the matter is being probed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/woman-injured-after-security-forces-fire-on-vehicle-in-jammu-and-kashmir/articleshow/82122149.cms||M Saleem Pandit

They are: Gurpartap Singh, Sham Lal, Ajeet Kumar, Bishan Das, Jasraj Singh, Subhash Chander and Gurbaksh Singh. Barring Gurpartap, who is a resident of Tarn Taran in Punjab, all others are from Jammu in J&K. They have been charge-sheeted under relevant sections of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, Indian Penal Code and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. “The case arose out of PS Arnia case no. 65/2020, wherein during a search operation in the wee hours of September 20, 2020 at the International Border near RS Pura in Jammu, heroin weighing 61kg, 1.2kg opium, two pistols, three magazines and 100 live rounds were recovered from the seven accused. NIA had re-registered the case on November 26, 2020 and taken up the investigation,” the statement said. It said investigation in the case revealed that the seven charge-sheeted accused were part of a narco-militancy module of BKI. “The prime objective of this module was to raise funds for BKI through proceeds of narcotics.

---||Goa||GFA allowed Covid-19 positive players in Goa Pro League without mandatory 14-day quarantine: Manora||Panaji: Youth Club of Manora and Panjim Footballers have claimed that Sesa Football Academy fielded ineligible players – those who had tested positive for Covid-19 -- against them in the ongoing Goa Professional League at Duler Football Stadium in Mapusa. On April 7, Sesa had written to the Goa Football Association and asked for rescheduling of their game against Salgaocar FC, scheduled for two days later. “As you are aware, five of our players from Sesa Football Academy had been tested positive for Covid1-9. The tests were done on 27th March, 2021 and got the results on 28th March. We did the tests again on 5th April and received the reports on 6th April. “Unfortunately, another 2 players have been tested positive for Covid-19 taking the tally to 7 players. The health officials have told these players to be self-isolated at home for 14 days. Another player who has not been detected but have got very bad cold and coughing, making it to 8 players from our starting 11 who are out,” Sesa FA team manager Joyner Antao wrote in his letter. However, Sesa were then ready to play against Manora on Monday and secured a 3-2 win. Manora then lodged their protest on Wednesday. Panjim Footballers suffered a solitary goal defeat against Sesa on Thursday and have now submitted their protest too. Both clubs have asked the GFA to award them three points. “We have received both the protest and will look into it,” GFA general secretary Jovito Lopes told TOI. As per GFA guidelines to the 12 participating teams before the league started, players who test positive have to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine period and produce a Covid-19 negative report before appearing for the next game. Manora have said Sesa fielded six players who did not go through the stipulated 14-day quarantine period. Debutants Manora had entered the league after Corps of Signals had pulled out of the tournament and First Division champions Santa Cruz Club of Cavelossim could not take part. Relegation-battling Manora have their final and crucial game against Churchill Brothers FC on Tuesday. “Due to interacting with Sesa FA players during the match, our players are unwell with body pain, fever and symptoms of Covid-19,” Manora wrote to GFA. Manora are now likely to conduct tests for their players on Monday before deciding on their next course of action. The club said Sesa player Omkar Shetgaonkar, who was among the Covid-19 positive cases, submitted a negative report on April 10, which only mentions his first name. “How do we know that it’s the same player,” asked one club official. The club has also accused the GFA of accepting Antigen test results for Covid-19 positive players when they return, rather than the more reliable RT-PCR. “The GFA has jeopardized the health of our players by allowing players from Sesa to play without undergoing the necessary 14-day quarantine. The GFA is not serious about the coronavirus. They are not abiding by the government guideline and SOP’s,” said Manora president Srikant Sawant. Meanwhile, Panjim, after playing their final game of the season, have also objected to the inclusion of Omkar by Sesa against them. “It was the duty of the team management to ensure that they follow all rules especially maintain the SOP followed by GFA and government of Goa as per the circular. Therefore, in the above case, the management of Sesa FA have faulted and not adhered to the rules as mandated and have knowingly named an ineligible player in their squad for the match against Panjim Footballers,” Panjim Footballers general secretary Angelo Albuquerque said in the protest letter. Manora, Panjim and Sesa are all locked in a fierce relegation battle with little separating the three teams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfa-allowed-covid-19-positive-players-in-goa-pro-league-without-mandatory-14-day-quarantine-manora/articleshow/82122282.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

Nikhil, an IT professional, works night shifts and his office is in Noida. With the night curfew in Noida now extending from 8pm to 7am, it became very tough for Nikhil to reach his office for his 9.30pm shift. “Earlier, the night curfew started at 10pm, so I could start from my place at 9pm and reach office. But now, I would be stopped at the border because UP has night curfew from 8pm. The only alternative for me is to reach the office before 8pm and spend extra time there.” Nikhil isn’t alone. After UP’s announcement, many working professionals working night shifts and commuting between Delhi-Noida or Delhi-Ghaziabad are caught in the varying timelines and rules of night curfews in the two states. ‘Spending too many hours in office’The night curfew in Delhi is from 10pm-5am. Till April 15, Noida and Ghaziabad – the two UP districts bordering Delhi had the same timings for their night curfew. However, now, the night curfew in those two cities has been extended from 8pm-7am. Due to this, the most common complaint of the nightly commuters between Delhi and these two cities is the extra hours they are having to spend at work. Charu Kumari, a Shahdara resident who works in Noida, says, “My shift ends at 4am. So, a curfew till 5am was still ok because I just had to wait for an hour to go home. But now, it will be three hours. That’s too much time in office after work.” ‘Carpooling with a journalist friend to travel in curfew hours’There are curfew passes or movement passes that one can apply online on Delhi Police’s website, which work across NCR. The catch is that only people “engaged in delivery of emergency/essential services within and outside Delhi during the movement period” are eligible for it. To bypass that, some have come up with novel solutions. For instance, in order to not face issues while travelling back home to Delhi around 3am, IT professional Aditi Mehta has taken the help of a friend in the media. She elaborates, “Media persons carrying valid ID proof are exempt. Fortunately, my friend, who is a journalist, also works nights in Noida these days. So, she and I carpool and we can both pass the police checkpoints. But she will have another shift timing soon. Then I’ll have to find another way.” Weekend curfew in Delhi an issue for those working in GurgaonAcross Delhi’s other border in Gurgaon, the situation is somewhat saner because the night curfew timings are not different from Delhi. The state government initially announced a 9pm-5am night curfew in Gurgaon but later revised the timings to 10pm-5am, the same as Delhi. However, some people working in Gurgaon do have one issue – Delhi’s weekend curfew. It has added to the woes of those officegoers from Delhi, who have working Saturdays. Asad Malik, an analyst from Dwarka, says, “My office is in Gurgaon where there is no weekend curfew so far. But I stay in Delhi and I have a working Saturday. That means, I won’t be able to get out of my house on Saturday. I will most probably stay at my brother’s place in Gurgaon for the whole weekend. I don’t think my company will allow work from home. Everyone is stretched anyway these days.” ‘Talking to admin for curfew passes’Several companies have decided to rework their shifts and rosters temporarily to fit the curfew timings. Vikas Jha, an HR manager of an IT firm in Gurgaon, says, “For April, we have redesignated our shifts in a way that the late-night shift begins at 9pm and the morning shift begins at 7.30am. This way, people don’t have to navigate the night curfew while commuting to work.” These timings, however, are not the solution for those in Noida, where the night curfew itself is 11 hours long. An HR manager from a Noida-based MNC, who did wish to be named, says, “The 11-hour window is too much. This means we cannot devise a shift where people can reach before the curfew and leave after. That way, they will end up spending 12 hours in office. We are trying to talk to the administration about allowing our employees to move with curfew passes now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/coronaeffect-varying-curfew-timelines-across-ncr-poses-commuting-problems-for-corporates/articleshow/82120151.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur

---||India||Use entire national capacity to step up Covid vaccine production, PM tells officials||NEW DELHI: Amid a record spike in Covid-19 cases, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday directed officials to make all efforts to utilise the entire national capacity, in public as well as private sector, to ramp up vaccine production. The PM’s directive came at a review meeting on the Covid situation on Saturday a day after he had overseen an assessment of oxygen supplies and production and distribution and the government announced stepped up support to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and also financial grants to specific facilties in private and public sector to increase vaccine production. India has so far administered a total of 12.25 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines till Saturday 8pm. Of this, 1.61 crore are second doses. In a separate meeting with high burden states, the health ministry noted India is clocking the fastest case growth of 7.6% in new cases, 1.3 times higher than case growth rate of 5.5% reported in June 2020. The growth rate of cases is leading to a sharp rise in daily number of active cases, currently at 16.7 lakh as also a growth of 10.2% in deaths. As daily cases rose to 2,34,692 and 1,341 deaths were recorded on Friday, the PM called a meeting with top officials to review the status of preparedness to handle the pandemic as well assess aspects relating to medicines, oxygen, ventilators and vaccination. Modi asked officials to work in close coordination with states, where already more than 50 central teams are deployed in districts with high cases, to manage the pandemic. He said all necessary measures must be taken to ramp up availability of hospital beds for Covid patients and directed additional supply of beds through temporary hospitals and isolation centres be ensured. On a day when Centre’s discussions with pharma majors led to a lowering of Remdesivir rates, the PM reviewed the availability of the life-saving drug used in treatment of hospitalised Covid-19 patients. He emphasised on the need to utilise the full potential of the local pharmaceutical industry to ensure adequate availability of medicines. The production capacity of Remdesivir has been increased to deliver around 74 lakh vials per month in May, against the normal capacity of around 27-29 lakh vials a month. “Supplies have also increased from 67,900 vials on April 11,2021 going up to over 2,06,000 vials on April 15, 2021 which are being particularly focused on states with high caseload and high demand,” the government said. Modi asked officials to ensure issues relating to real-time supply chain management to states be resolved urgently and misuse and black marketing of pharma products strictly curbed. He also asked officials to speed up installation of approved medical oxygen plants to cater to the rising demand. Besides, supply of oxygen required for production of medicines and equipment necessary to handle the pandemic should also be ensured, he added. The Centre is working to expedite completion of 162 oxygen manufacturing plants at hospitals that have been sanctioned under PM-Cares. The officers informed that 1 lakh cylinders are being procured and will be supplied to states soon. The officers briefed the PM that they are in constant touch with 12 high burden states in assessing the current and future requirement of medical oxygen. A supply mapping plan for 12 high burden states till April 30 has also been undertaken. The PM also reviewed the status of availability and supply of ventilators. The PM noted that a real time monitoring system has been created and directed that concerned state governments should be sensitised to use the system proactively. Emphasising on the strategy of testing, tracking and treatment, PM said early testing and proper tracking remains key to reduce mortality. He also said that local administrations need to be proactive and sensitive to people’s concerns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/use-entire-national-capacity-to-step-up-covid-vaccine-production-pm-tells-officials/articleshow/82122787.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Coronavirus: At 2.6 lakh, cases jump 11.5%, first two-digit spike in 4 days||NEW DELHI: Covid-19 cases continued to explode across India, with new infections recorded on Saturday crossing the 2.5-lakh mark just three days after hitting 2 lakh. The daily death toll rose to nearly 1,500, with 1,493 fatalities reported in the country. India recorded 2,60,810 cases on Saturday, a sharp rise of 11.5% over the previous day’s tally of 2.34 lakh. This was the first double-digit growth in daily cases in four days, an indication that the Covid surge wasn’t slowing down yet. Daily deaths from the virus rose sharply as well, with fatalities climbing to nearly 1,500 just four days after hitting the 1,000 mark for the first time after October 2. On Friday, the toll had crossed 1,300 for the first time ever. In a bit of cheerful news amid the gloom, the death rate continues to be much lower than what was witnessed during the peak of the first wave in September, with the overall case fatality rate dropping to 1.2%. However, with active cases surging to over 18 lakh — having risen by a record 1.21 lakh on Saturday alone — fatalities are likely to rise in the coming days. The seven-day rolling average of daily cases crossed 2 lakh on Saturday. The index has risen uninterruptedly for 65 days now, multiplying 17.5 times from a low of 11,364 on February 11 to 2,03,949 on April 17. This is the sharpest rise in cases over a period of two months or more seen in any country across the globe. As many as 19 states and Union territories recorded their highest-ever single-day rise in cases on Saturday — the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic. These were led by Maharashtra, which reported 67,123 cases, followed by Delhi, where the tally surged sharply from 19,486 on Friday to 24,375. Other states/UTs that registered a record surge were Karnataka (17,489 cases), Chhattisgarh (16,083), Kerala (13,835), MP (11,269), Gujarat (9,541), TN (9,344), Rajasthan (9,046), Bihar (7,870), Haryana (7,717), Bengal (7,713), Punjab (4,498), Telangana (4,446), Uttarakhand (2,757), Himachal (1,392), Puducherry (715), Ladakh (245) and Dadra & Nagar Haveli, including Daman & Diu), (158). Maharashtra recorded 419 deaths in the last 24 hours, the highest since October 2 (424). Delhi reported as many as 167 deaths while in Chhattisgarh 158 deaths were officially recorded. UP had 120 fatalities in the last 24 hours.

Juna is the third akhada, after Niranjani and Anand, to withdraw from the event, scheduled to continue till April 30, citing concerns about Covid-19, and its decision was quickly followed by pullout calls by two other fellow Shaivite akhadas — Avahan and Agni. The decision to conclude the Kumbh by the akhadas concerned came in the backdrop of fear about spread of coronavirus among devotees. The death of Mahanirvani Akhada’s head, Mahamandaleshwar Kapil dev Das, earlier this week had intensified concern about the event turning into a super spreader. Although some of the akhadas, especially the Vaishhnavaite ones, are averse to the idea of calling off the celebrations prematurely, the step taken by Juna akhada is likely to be a goad for them to pare down festivities. “All three Bairagi akhadas appreciate PM Modi’s advice but it is not possible to take a bath symbolically on the last shahi snan. We are asking our followers to not arrive in large numbers. Only seers will take a dip on the last shahi snan,” Nirmohi akhada chief mahant Rajendra Das said. Faith is important, but life more so, says seerAvadheshanand Giri said that consensus was emerging among other akhadas and seers to conclude the celebrations shortly or, failing that, prune its scope. At any rate, the decision of akhadas is likely to also ensure that devotees drop the idea of taking the holy dip at Haridwar, thus relieving the authorities of the worry of thousands getting infected and turning into carriers of the virus. “All members and seers of the Juna akhada met at 3pm today (Saturday). After deliberations, keeping in mind the pandemic and people’s well-being, we have decided to immerse the deities we invoked and conclude the Kumbh Mela Haridwar 2021,” a statement issued jointly by Juna akhada acharya mahamandaleshwar Avdheshanand Giri and secretary Hari Giri on Saturday evening said. “About 400 of our seers have left the camp on Saturday,” Hari Giri, who is also general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, told TOI. The Maha Kumbh is scheduled to continue till April 30 but the presence of large groups of seers and devotees at shahi snans without masks and social distancing had caused widespread concern. Earlier in the day, Modi had tweeted about a phone conversation with Avdheshanand Giri: “I appealed, now that the two shahi snans have taken place, the remaining Kumbh be observed symbolically as it will help in the fight against the pandemic.” After the conversation, Giri told TOI, “On behalf of the sadhus, I assured the PM that the Kumbh rituals will be done symbolically. Sadhus at the Kumbh have welcomed the PM’s appeal.” Later in Haridwar, he said, “From this point on, things will be largely symbolic … Faith is important, but life is more so.” Meanwhile, after Juna akhada’s decision to conclude the Kumbh, other sanyasi akhadas followed suit. “We support Juna akhada’s call and are withdrawing from the Mela,” Mahant Satya Giri, general secretary of Ahavan akhada, told TOI. So did Agni akhada. “Saving human lives is the biggest concern for us,” Brahmachari Sadhnanand, mela head of the akhada, told TOI. The Mahanirvani akhada, meanwhile, has decided to leave after the next snan. “After attending all three shahi snans, the akhada has decided that most of us would be leaving after April 19,” said general secretary of the akhada, Jamuna Puri. Kinnar akhada, which is part of Juna akhada, also closed its camp gates on Saturday. “A few members tested positive and were quarantined. We have decided not to allow any visitor into our camp,” said Mahamandaleshwar Pavitra Maharaj. Whether seers should stay on or leave has been a contentious matter. Those from the Shaivite sect have already completed the three shahi snans that are important to them. For the Vaishnavite, or Bairagi sect, of Nirmohi, Nirvani and Digambar, the most important shahi snan is the last one, on April 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/largest-akhada-exits-kumbh-after-pm-calls-for-symbolic-observance/articleshow/82123068.cms||MS Nawaz

Most of these samples are from Vidarbha and no sample submitted from the city has so far shown the B.1.617 variant, said scientists involved with INSACOG, a grouping of 10 national laboratories carrying out whole genomic sequencing of samples. Read AlsoMaharashtra records another high with 67,123 new infectionsMUMBAI: The state reported 67,123 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, the highest-ever for a day since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year. The state also reported a surge in fatalities, with 419 deaths, the highest in nearly 200 days since October 2, when 424 deaths were recorded. It wasThe Union health ministry has so far not given specific details about the whole genome sequencing project. A communication on Friday said that as of Thursday, 13,614 whole genome sequencing samples had been processed at the 10 INSACOG labs.   “Of these, 1,189 samples have tested positive for variants of concern for SARS COV-2 in India. These include 1,109 samples with UK variants; 79 samples with South African variant and one sample with the Brazil variant,” the ministry release said.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); Some information on the results of the samples sent from the state was given to state health minister Rajesh Tope at a virtual meeting with Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Saturday. Tope said that of the 1,100 samples sent so far, 500 samples had been examined. “We have sought a detailed report from the central government but have been told that it will be available only at the end of the research,” he said.   The main concern in the state — and the rest of the world, too, because the Indian variant has already been isolated in multiple samples in the UK and the US — is the high transmissibility of the variant. “As the new variant is said to be highly infectious, we sought a report and revised guidelines, if any, from the Centre,” Tope said, adding that the Centre said a detailed report would be made available only at the end of the research. State director of health services Dr Archana Patil said she did know from where the samples in question had been collected. “In some samples, changes are seen, but there is no comment about whether they explain this surge in Maharashtra,” Patil said. The B.1.617 was first identified by scientists from the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in Delhi as part of the INSACOG project. They noted two mutations, L452R and E484K, that are known to have the ability to escape antibodies. Articles written by experts across the world have noted that the Indian variant could be “at least in part” driving the current wave sweeping across the country. IGIB director Dr Anurag Agrawal said almost 15,000 Covid-19-positive samples had been studied since December. “Our team of scientists identified the variant which has since been named B.1.617. Overall, it is present in a small percentage of samples, but its presence has been growing in recent weeks,” Dr Agrawal said. Scientists from other countries had more details. “The new strain has been detected in at least five Indian states, including Maharashtra, Delhi and Punjab, which have all contributed to the surge of cases in the country, in addition to the B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa), and P.1 (Brazil) variants which are also circulating (in) India,” William A. Haseltine, former Harvard Medical School professor, said in an article in Forbes. He wrote that while the extent to which the strain had spread was unknown, of the 2,844 sequences submitted to the GISAID database from India since March 1, 162 sequences had been classified as B.1.617, or about 6%. “This percentage is likely to grow,” he said.

---||---||PM Narendra Modi says Mamata Banerjee ‘doing politics with the dead’, she alleges phone tap||NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday accused Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee of “doing politics with the dead”, terming it “an old habit” of hers. Mamata responded by charging Modi with “intercepting” her phone calls and said he would be within the ambit of a CID probe she had ordered. “Don’t you have any shame that you intercept a CM’s phone? You should resign as PM,” she said. Their war of words came a day after BJP released an audio tape of a purported conversation between Mamata and Trinamool’s Sitalkuchi candidate Partha Pratim Ray in the aftermath of the April 10 CISF firing that killed four people. “The tape reveals how Didi is asking a TMC leader to keep the bodies. She is heard saying the party will take out a rally with the bodies,” Modi said at a rally in Asansol. “The tapes show how Didi is trying to benefit from the unfortunate deaths. How far will you go for vote bank?” Modi said. At Katwa in East Burdwan, Mamata said the CID had been asked to track down the person/s responsible for intercepting her phone conversations, adding that even PM was within the ambit of the inquiry. Modi’s remarks at the Asansol rally were a direct “admission” of some CMs being under telephone surveillance, Mamata said. “The probe will not exclude you. You must respond (to this surveillance allegation) or resign... We may be politically opposed to you but we at least value the chair you occupy,” she said, reminding the PM that the Supreme Court had upheld the right to privacy. “BJP's people don't have anything to speak about so they are tapping my conversation.” “I never said anything wrong (in the tape). They killed those children. They were barely 20-25. I had said keep the bodies... (and that) I would go the next day. How could I have gone that day? Could I have gone there on election day? I am not a Cooch Behar voter. So I said, keep the bodies. I had also told the media that I would go to Sitalkuchi the next day. But then, the Election Commission said I could not go there for 72 hours. What does it (the tape) prove? Does it prove anything at all?” she asked. In Asansol, the PM had said that Mamata’s strategy wouldn’t work as the people of Bengal had already “formed a morcha” against her. “Trinamool has been broken into pieces after four phases of polls. Didi and bhatija (Mamata’s nephew and MP Abhishek Banerjee) will be vanquished after eight phases. She is perturbed because her team is not being able to cast chhappa votes,” he said. “People have not been able to forget how their rights were taken away during the 2018 panchayat poll. Trinamool packed 20,000 panchayats with extortionists. And candidates who won even after all this had to take shelter outside the state. But that will not happen this time. That is why Didi is afraid. Chitto jetha bhoye akranto (Where the mind lives in fear),” Modi said, inverting Tagore’s “Chitto jetha bhoy sunyo (Where the mind is without fear)”. The PM listed date-wise in South Dinajpur’s Gangarampur how Mamata had been abusing him. “Tum sala khuni ka raja, the CM told me on March 26. This is an insult to the rich tradition, culture and language of Bengal. Do you approve of this kind of language against the PM?” he asked. “Didi is arrogant. She looks down on others. She bunks the PM’s meetings with CMs on corona. She does not attend Niti Ayog meetings. She is above the Constitution. She does not cooperate when central teams come here to help the state government. She slams central forces, puts pressure on the Election Commission and makes false charges against the armed forces.” Modi then accused the Trinamool government of “standing as a wall” between Bengal’s poor and a Union government that wanted to transfer benefits to them. “But now confrontation will end, cooperation will start,” he said. The PM also pointed out how a Trinamool functionary had allegedly insulted the Matuas and Namasudras — disciples of Guruchand Thakur and Harichand Takur and followers of Yogendra Nath Mandal — and called them “beggars”. “Didi did not say a word to that Trinamool colleague,” he said. Modi told the gathering how a BJP government in Bengal would start granting citizenship to refugees after May 2. “Why is Didi opposing citizenship to refugees? But do not worry, the BJP government in Bengal will grant you citizenship after May 2. People have formed a morcha against Didi. They will give you the ‘former CM certificate’,” he said. Home minister Amit Shah, too, held election rallies in North Dinajpur’s Chopra and North 24-Parganas’ Amdanga. CM Mamata took a dig at Modi for his allegedly “misplaced priorities”, including campaigning in Bengal instead of leading the fight against a resurgent pandemic. “The country is witnessing an emergency because of rising Covid cases. And he is electioneering in Bengal,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/west-bengal/pm-narendra-modi-says-mamata-banerjee-doing-politics-with-the-dead-she-alleges-phone-tap/articleshow/82123703.cms||Mohammad Asif

Archaeological Survey of India had earlier given a complaint in this regard based on which the police had registered a case against Sidhu and others. The arrest was made on Saturday soon after a court granted Sidhu bail in a case related to the Red Fort violence. Sidhu was earlier arrested on February 9 in connection with the violence at Red Fort on Republic Day during a farmers’ tractor parade against the Centre’s three new agriculture laws. Questioning Sidhu’s arrest, his lawyer Abhishek Gupta said: “He was granted a regular bail vide order dated April 16 (Friday), which was communicated to us on Saturday. However, around 1.30 pm, before he could be released from jail, he was again arrested in another register at the same police station with respect to the same incident at Red Fort. The need and timing of arrest are extremely questionable and it is a grave affront to personal liberty of an individual and runs foul of rights guaranteed under Article 21.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/deep-sidhu-gets-bail-in-red-fort-violence-case-arrested-again/articleshow/82123915.cms||---

In Sukma, the bodies of assistant constables Dhaniram Kashyap and Punem Hadma were found on a dusty road on Thursday evening, just 500m from Bhejji police station where they were posted. They had been dragged off their motorcycle, and their throats slit.

Goyal said Maharashtra is suffering at the hands of an inept and corrupt government and the Centre is doing its best. “Saddened to see Uddhav Thackeray’s gimmicks on oxygen. The government of India, with all stakeholders, is ensuring maximum oxygen production,” Goyal said in a series of tweets. The minister said Maharashtra has so far received the highest quantity of oxygen. “Centre is in daily touch with the state governments to assess their needs and help them in the best possible manner,” he added. Goyal said, “Just yesterday, PM in his review told that Centre and states should work with synergy in this crisis... He (Thackeray) needs to stop his daily dose of shameless politics and take responsibility,” the minister said. The BJP member responded after Thackeray’s office claimed that the CM tried to reach PM Modi over the shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir, but was told he was on a visit to poll-bound Bengal. Later, Maharashtra minority affairs minister Nawab Malik accused Modi of being busy in elections while “people are dying”. Union minister Mansukh Mandaviya said Malik’s claims were full of half-truths and lies. Malik had claimed Remdesivir units are seeking permission to sell medicines meant for export but the Centre is denying this. “I request you (Mallik) to share the list of these 16 companies, availability of stock and WHO-GMP with them. Our government is committed to do everything to help our people,” Mandaviya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/patients-fight-for-breath-maharashtra-and-centre-spar-over-o2-supply/articleshow/82124412.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Due to Covid, father’s plea to take boy home rejected||Mumbai: Citing the raging pandemic, a sessions court rejected a father’s plea to take his seven-year-old son for few hours every week so that he could spend time with him at his house or any other place. The child has been in the custody of his mother and the father has not seen him for 15 months, since January 2020. The court has, however, allowed the man to meet his son at his estranged wife’s place for two hours on weekends. “The petitioner (father) wants to take away his child to his home or any neutral place so that he can freely meet him, and both can enjoy some quality time. However, due to the present situation (the spread of coronavirus in society), it is not advisable to carry a small child of seven years to the house of petitioner or any other neutral place from the house of respondent (mother),” the court reasoned. The court also reasoned that for more than a year the child has not been residing with his father. “The petitioner lastly met him when he was six years old. Since last more than one year he has not met his father, so due to tender age he may feel uncomfortable to meet him at the petitioner’s house or at any other neutral place. Thus, it is suitable to allow the petitioner to meet his son on the premises of the respondent,” the court said. Granting the father visitation rights, the court observed that a child should not be deprived of the love and care of either parent. “When custody of child is with one parent, well-being of the child and the right to enhanced quality life during crucial years of personal development will be severely affected. As the son of petitioner and respondent is residing with the respondent, and since last more than one year petitioner has not seen or met him, it is necessary to grant visitation rights to him,” the court said. The father will meet the child on Saturday and Sunday for two hours each in the evening. The court directed the mother to facilitate the meeting so that the father “can easily meet him and spend some time with him”. “The petitioner is hereby directed that during enjoying visitation right he shall not do any such act which is detrimental to the physical and psychological growth of master... (identity concealed),” the court said. The couple married in 2012 but separated few years later. The man has now filed for divorce on grounds of desertion under the Special Marriage Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-due-to-covid-fathers-plea-to-take-boy-home-rejected/articleshow/82122954.cms||Rebecca Samervel

While all sections of people, young and old, men and women are falling prey, doctors red-flagged more and more pregnant women getting adversely affected in the current surge. “Not only are more pregnant women testing positive, more women are ending up in ICUs during the current spike. This is in sharp contrast to earlier two spikes where pregnant women got away with milder symptoms and rarely developed complications”, said Dr Monila Patel, professor of medicine at SVP Hospital. “In fact, we used to feel that Covid-19 is kinder on expectant moms but not any more,” added Dr Patel. The SVP Hospital handled delivery of some 700-odd Covid-positive pregnant women but lost just one case. In the current wave, more lives have been lost. This included the death of government officer Shweta Mehta Sahu, who was nine months pregnant. Doctors had delivered her daughter in a bid to save the 35-year-old but both daughter and mother died within a day of each other. “Currently, we have three pregnant women fighting corona complications hooked on to the ventilators. This includes a woman who is pregnant with twins,” said head of gynaecology department Dr Sushma Shah. Doctors said that they are forced to induce labour to deliver the child or even trigger a medical termination of pregnancy in a bid to save the mother’s life. “Expectant mothers and their families need to be very careful and may even resort to putting them in home quarantine to avoid getting infected in the current surge. Prevention is the best cure,” said Dr Shah. In Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, two pregnant women lost their battle against Covid-19 this week after developing lung complications. In Surat, doctors said young pregnant women aged 20-30 years are getting severely affected by this surge. “Last year, infected pregnant women would get cured without any complications but this time, pregnant women are getting admitted with 30% to 40% lung damage needing oxygen support and invasive therapy like ventilatory support and intensive management,” said Dr Deepti Patel. In Rajkot, pulmonologist Dr Niraj Mehta said he has attended to ten pregnant women. “There is a deviation in strain and more pregnant women and pediatric patients are getting adversely affected,” said Dr Mehta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/pregnant-women-under-covid-19-attack-in-this-wave/articleshow/82124717.cms||---

Doctors said that they are forced to induce labour to deliver the child or even trigger a medical termination of pregnancy in a bid to save the mother’s life. “Expectant mothers and their families need to be very careful and may even resort to putting them in home quarantine to avoid getting infected in the current surge. Prevention is the best cure,” said Dr Shah. In Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, two pregnant women lost their battle against Covid-19 this week after developing lung complications. In Surat, doctors said young pregnant women aged 20-30 years are getting severely affected by this surge. “Last year, infected pregnant women would get cured without any complications but this time, pregnant women are getting admitted with 30% to 40% lung damage needing oxygen support and invasive therapy like ventilatory support and intensive management,” said Dr Deepti Patel. In Rajkot, pulmonologist Dr Niraj Mehta said he has attended to ten pregnant women. “There is a deviation in strain and more pregnant women and pediatric patients are getting adversely affected,” said Dr Mehta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/pregnant-women-under-covid-19-attack-in-this-wave/articleshow/82124716.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Pregnant women under Covid-19 attack in this wave||AHMEDABAD/SURAT/RAJKOT: Coronavirus continued to tighten its grip on death and suffering in Gujarat as the state reported a record 9,541 positive cases and record-high 97 deaths in a day on Saturday. While all sections of people, young and old, men and women are falling prey, doctors red-flagged more and more pregnant women getting adversely affected in the current surge. “Not only are more pregnant women testing positive, more women are ending up in ICUs during the current spike. This is in sharp contrast to earlier two spikes where pregnant women got away with milder symptoms and rarely developed complications”, said Dr Monila Patel, professor of medicine at SVP Hospital. “In fact, we used to feel that Covid-19 is kinder on expectant moms but not any more,” added Dr Patel. The SVP Hospital handled delivery of some 700-odd Covid-positive pregnant women but lost just one case. In the current wave, more lives have been lost. This included the death of government officer Shweta Mehta Sahu, who was nine months pregnant. Doctors had delivered her daughter in a bid to save the 35-year-old but both daughter and mother died within a day of each other. “Currently, we have three pregnant women fighting corona complications hooked on to the ventilators.

---||Ahmedabad||Gandhinagar uses 26% more water per capita than Ahmedabad!||AHMEDABAD: The babus’ city guzzles 26.5% more water at 83 litres per day per household compared to 105 litres for Ahmedabad, revealed a direct measurement in a study carried out by IIT-Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn) researchers along with other agencies. The study revealed that Amdavadis use more water for bathing than their Gandhinagar counterparts, whereas Gandhinagar residents used more water for dishwashing and floor washing. The cities used almost the same water per household for laundry. The paper ‘Indoor water end-use pattern and its prospective determinants in the twin cities of Gujarat, India: Enabling targeted urban water management strategies’ by Prof Manish Kumar and Ayushi Sharma from IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn), Naresh Tabhani from GPCB and Yurina Otaki from Hitotsubashi University in Japan got published in an Elsevier journal ‘Journal of Environmental Management.’ The study was funded by WIN Foundation. Prof Kumar said that the study employed both direct and indirect (survey) measurements for the water consumption. “It was to understand the end-user pattern of water usage and variation in the pattern even at the distance of 30-40 km,” he said. “The study also provided insight into household behaviour – for example, only 12% respondents said that they operate fully-loaded washing machines, and only 29% had sensors installed to reduce water wastage from overhead tanks.” The primary purpose of the study was to also find the scope for greywater usage. The researchers said that compared to other cities across the globe having done similar study, the cities’ per capita water consumption is much less. For example, 52 litres and 50 litres used for bathing in Melbourne, Australia and Auckland, New Zealand, the cities on the higher side used half at 25 litres per capita per day. “But we must keep in mind that the freshwater is a precious commodity. We can recycle the majority of the household water for purposes such as toilet flushing, car wash or gardening. For that, we must understand the consumption pattern and make infrastructural changes. We must not waste two buckets of freshwater – fetched from hundreds of kilometers away through countless pumps – on daily car wash,” said Prof Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gnagar-uses-26-more-water-per-capita-than-abad/articleshow/82122200.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Patna||Bihar doctors await test results to identify new strains||PATNA: Amid reports of new strains or variants of the Covid-19 virus leading to a sudden spike in the cases of infected persons as well as fatalities, authorities and experts in Bihar are keenly waiting for results of samples collected in the state to identify the mutated or foreign strains of the virus. The principal secretary of the health department, Pratyaya Amrit, said on Saturday that the report of samples collected from AIIMS-Patna and sent to a government laboratory in Bhubaneshwar for testing would be declared soon. "We are keen to know the reason behind the virulence and the sudden increase in death rate in younger adults, especially after the neighbouring states have confirmed the presence of some new strains," Amrit said. He added, "Not every state can have such highly specialised laboratories for genome sequencing, especially for critical infections such as Covid with numerous mutants and strains. The entire country has only a few labs equipped for such testing." Experts claimed that an increase in the number of younger patients with newer symptoms indicates the presence of the mutant virus strains. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, head of cardiology and nodal officer of Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna, said, "New symptoms such as diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, high-grade fever and rapid deterioration of oxygen levels suggest that the virus has mutated." State IMA senior vice-president Dr Ajay Kumar said clinical indications strongly suggest the prevalence of mutant virus strains, but there is no laboratory confirmation to prove the same. "Bihar has so many passengers coming from various parts of the country and chances of them being infected with the mutant strain is higher," he said. Experts claimed that Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Karnataka are among the states where double mutant strains (B.1.617) have been detected. The UK variant (B.1.1.7), the Brazilian variant P1, and the South African variant B.1.351 have also been reported in other parts of the country. Dr Satyajit Singh, managing director of Ruben Hospital said, "Patients in Patna are showing the same symptoms and prognosis as those in states like Maharashtra where the variants have been confirmed." He added, "Even with negative RT-PCR and antigen testing, the CT scans are showing lung infections identical to Covid positive patients, which was not the case during the first wave of the pandemic." According to Dr Arun Shah, a senior paediatrician and former president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics-Bihar, the mutant virus strains are extremely contagious and can bypass immunity established by the normal infection or vaccination. "Identification is extremely important as a variant strain case can vary from those encountered in the first wave, the newer strains contribute to greater vulnerability among the younger population including children and make it more likely for disease to progress," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/doctors-await-test-results-to-identify-new-strains/articleshow/82122112.cms||---

During the meeting, YSRC corporators alleged irregularities in the urban housing scheme, citing that many people were forced to pay more than what was prescribed. TDP corporators denied allegations and asked the mayor to order the inquiry so the YSRC’s claims could be proven wrong. YSRC members claimed that their TDP counterparts took money from several beneficiaries under the pretext of allocating a house. The council chairperson and mayor Rayana Bhagya Lakshmi asked VMC commissioner V Prasanna Venkatesh to recommend a vigilance inquiry into the allegations. The VMC commissioner explained to the council that the previous regime collected Rs 39 crore from 11,917 beneficiaries for the housing scheme and construction of 6,574 houses is underway. The remaining beneficiaries received plots under the YSRC government’s housing for all scheme and the amount collected would be returned in the next few months. Meanwhile, the meeting was cut short to two hours after some persons present, including two corporators, tested positive for Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/at-1st-vmc-council-session-allegations-over-irregularities-in-housing-scheme/articleshow/82121142.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

In some cases, subsequent RT-PCR tests are also failing to yield the presence of novel coronavirus particles. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR), which is considered a gold standard diagnostic testing for Covid-19 disease, uses a person’s respiratory specimens to detect the presence of the virus. Even though some false negatives were reported during the first wave last year, the increasing RT-PCR test errors have doctors stumped as it complicates matters. First, a patient needs a formal diagnosis to get the disease treated and inform close contacts. In some cases, relatives may be reluctant to have the patient admitted to a hospital in the absence of a formal diagnosis. Some doctors also suspect that virus mutations may have made it difficult to find the virus in PCR tests. But according to the Union health ministry, the RT-PCR tests that are used in the country do not miss such mutations as they target more than two genes. Speaking to STOI, AP Covid-19 nodal officer Dr K Rambabu said that the health department recently identified some false negatives in Covid-19 cases. “In these cases, the novel coronavirus seems to be bypassing the respiratory or lung phase and directly entering the bloodstream. In the initial days, the patient looks asymptomatic. But he/she would subsequently land up in hospital with the disease,” said Dr Rambabu. Dr Rambabu said the health department earlier issued an instant order, asking officials to treat even the CT scan positive cases as Covid-19 patients. “This would make the patients eligible to receive free treatment under Aarogyasri scheme. Even the patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases would be first isolated as suspected cases. Various radiographic, serologic and other tests would be conducted on them to diagnose their condition,” said Dr Rambabu. Consultant pulmonologist at Seven Hills Hospital, Dr Vamsi Krishna, said that RT-PCR tests have a sensitivity of around 70% to detect the novel coronavirus. “The individual would be treated as a Covid-19 patient if the CT scan presents typical manifestations of the disease. The growing number of daily cases might be due to the virus becoming more infectious and transmittable,” said Dr Vamsi Krishna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/increasing-false-negatives-in-rt-pcr-tests-baffle-docs/articleshow/82121159.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Illegal bldg owners handed Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Authority notice||VIJAYAWADA: Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Authority (AMRDA) and Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) have begun a special drive to identify illegal constructions. The deadline for the Building Penalisation Scheme (BPS) ended on 31 December 2020. Amaravati region, especially Vijayawada, became a hub for real estate after the city became a part of the capital region in 2015. Many builders started group houses that resemble apartments. Most of these constructions had deviations and were constructed by acquiring panchayat plans in 2016. Several middle class families had invested in these flats considering their affordable price. The then TDP government started BPS scheme in August 2018 and it was extended till December 2020 for various reasons. But many builders and flat owners ignored to complete the penalisation process by submitting necessary documents and penalty charges. Most of the illegal constructions are half finished group houses and the plan validity of many of these apartments has lapsed. The AMRDA and VMC started issuing notices to illegal constructions asking them to demolish voluntarily. Authorities have given them two months to demolish the structures. “Owners of illegal constructions missed the last chance to pay penalties for their houses. Most of these apartments acquired plans from panchayats before inception of Amaravati Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA). These plans are now inactive and there is no chance of renewal. There is no alternative remedy,” said a senior official at city planning wing of AMRDA. Meanwhile, plot owners who invested huge money in these buildings are now in limbo with the notices issued by AMRDA. “We have paid Rs 10,000 as token amount for BPS and are waiting for our builder to complete the process. We just came to know after APCRDA stocked notices to the building. Government should give us another chance,” said Rokkam Surya Rao, a buyer from Nidamanuru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/illegal-bldg-owners-handed-amrda-notice/articleshow/82121192.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Varanasi||Shortage of machines hampers tests at BHU, SPG Hosp||Varanasi: Shortage of RNA extraction machines and data entry operators as well as slow network connectivity cited by the officials of Banaras Hindu University and SPG divisional hospital laboratories is not only delaying Covid-19 test reports by five days to over a week, but also complicating the response to the second wave of the pandemic in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency. When officials at BHU labs were contacted on Saturday, they claimed that after receiving the samples through the office of the chief medical officer, they took about 48 hours in preparing the report. The viral research and diagnostic laboratory (VRDL) of Institute of Medical Science BHU in-charge Prof Gopal Nath said, ”We are conducting around 6,000 tests per day at two abs of the varsity. But, for the feeding of the results of these samples, only one person is available at each lab despite requirement of six to work in three shifts and feed all test reports per day. Thus, the backlog of data feeding gets piled up.” “When the reason for delay in data entry was sought from SPG lab, the officials concerned cited a slow network connectivity,” said additional CMO (administration) Dr NP Singh, who held the charge of CMO till Friday night. These excuses and claims of lab authorities have delayed releasing reports of patients from five days to over a week. Doctors admitted that the precious time lost in the wait for lab test reports is affecting the health of persons with poor immunity but the chain of positive cases is also increasing manifold. Apart from the data entry staff, the BHU lab is also seeking two RNA extraction machines to accelerate the pace of sample testing. Prof Nath said that apart from Varanasi, samples from six other districts are coming to BHU labs which are working with only two RNA extraction machines while demand for two others has been made. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “District administration has started the process to purchase one new RNA machine for BHU lab. But, it is surprising that an institution like BHU is seeking persons for data entry from the administration despite having a large number of competent staff in its departments.” According to ACMO, 7,000 samples are being sent to both the labs while 6,000 samples are going to SPG lab. Also, private labs are testing 730 samples. On how the BHU labs tackled the first wave of Covid-19 in September and October, Prof Nath said: “ISM had given three data entry operators while one was given by the district administration in 2020, and they all were withdrawn by January 31. This hit the data entry process when the second wave hit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/shortage-of-machines-hampers-tests-at-bhu-spg-hosp/articleshow/82121988.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Allahabad||PMC undertakes massive sanitisation drive amid surge in Covid-19 cases||Prayagraj: Given the sudden increase in the number of Covid-19 cases being witnessed in the city for the past one week, which has broken all previous records, the Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to sanitise all the 100 wards of the city on a war footing. For this purpose, it has been decided that the vehicles being used by PMC, presently being used for improving the quality of air in the city, like anti-smog gun, water vehicle and sprinkler and the vehicles used by Jal Sansthan including Jetting machines will be used for the sanitisation work. The sanitisation work will be carried out on Saturdays and Sundays. Altogether 17 vehicles have been pressed into service and the entire 100 wards of the city have been distributed among Eight zones. These zones have been given two vehicles each for sanitisation work barring zone one which consists of areas around Khuldabad. This had been the area where the maximum number of patients were reported in the recent spike in the cases. These localities include the Himmatganj, Chuck Niratul, Beniganj, Kareli, Sultanpur Bhava, Karelabagh etc. According to the public relation officer (PRO) of PMC PK Mishra, the sanitisation work was carried out on Saturday as well in all eight zones of the city. The PRO further informed that Zone two consists of the locality around Muttiganj, Zone three have areas of Civil Lines and Katra, Zone four has Allahapur and Georgetown and adjoining areas, Zone five would be of areas and localities around Naini, Zone six would be of the areas of Transport Nagar and adjoining localities including Preetam Nagar etc., Zone seven is of Phaphamau and adjoining localities and Zone eight is of Junshi area. Mishra further informed that apart from sanitisation work, the Municipal Commissioner Prayagraj, inspected the special sanitisation drive in the city to break the Covid-19 chain. The inspection was conducted at Zero Road bus stand, Katra, Phaphamau zone, Naini zone, Allapur, Rasulabad Ghat crematorium. “Special sanitisation drive is being conducted in all the eight zones of the city in two shifts as per an elaborative plan wherein responsibility has been given to each official and they can be contacted in case of need”, said the PRO. Besides, Nigrani Samiti members were trained and motivated for tracking persons coming from outside for testing and vaccination of persons above 45 years of age. As a part of the sanitization drive, all the Railway stations, bus stands, major roads, public places, religious places, narrow lanes will be sanitized with 1% Sodium Hypochlorite solution, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/pmc-undertakes-massive-sanitisation-drive-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases/articleshow/82122544.cms||---
---||Kolkata||An officer and a true gentleman||Kolkata: Archishman Ghatak, who served as director-general of police in two states, West Bengal and Sikkim, passed away in Kolkata on Friday. He was 85. Old colleagues remember him as a “respected and impartial officer” who had a “blemishless career”. A PG Wodehouse fan, he had a quiet sense of humour that came with the hint of a smile and a twinkle in the eye, say friends and family. Above all, was known for his gentle and soft-spoken ways, unlike the stereotype of a police officer. Ghatak joined the Indian Police Service in 1959 and, after serving as deputy commissioner (headquarters) of Calcutta Police, joined the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) on deputation where he played a key role in streamlining its operations in Bengal. He moved to Sikkim as an inspector-general in the mid-1980s before becoming DGP. Ghatak returned to Bengal in 1991 as DGP after a stint in the Railway Protection Force. Born in September 1935, Ghatak did his schooling in Lucknow. He moved to Kolkata for higher studies and graduated from City College. He joined Jadavpur University for his Master’s but left midway after cracking the civil services. Ghatak was a keen cricketer and footballer during his student days and loved playing tennis later in life. “Baba was also an excellent marksman and loved hunting but gave it up and developed a passion for wildlife,” said his older daughter Anchita.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/an-officer-and-a-true-gentleman/articleshow/82121891.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna hospitals reporting most Covid deaths within 48 hours||PATNA: The contribution of Covid-19 deaths within a couple of days of admission to the overall mortality rate is unacceptably high, say, experts. Several hospitals, including government ones, treating Covid patients in Patna are witnessing patients succumbing to the virus within 48 hours of hospitalisation. Health experts attributed this to the delay in hospitalisation and severity of the virus in the second wave as the main reasons behind the rise in mortality rate within few days. Some experts believe that Covid patients referred late by private and other district hospitals in a severe condition also resulted in the death of patients. Of the 41 Covid deaths at NMCH, Patna, since April 1, around 79% or 33 died within 48 hours of their admission. About 55% of them died on the day of hospitalisation. Dr Ajay Kumar Sinha, an NMCH nodal officer, said patients who are arriving here with severely affected lungs and oxygen saturation levels between 40 and 50 are dying within a few hours of their admission. "Several patients in the last couple of weeks were brought to the hospital in advanced stages of pneumonia and lung infection as referred from other private hospitals and government facilities. Optimal care is needed for such patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is highly effective in treating pneumonia patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome," Dr Sinha said. He advised Covid patients in home isolation to check their oxygen saturation level every two hours. As per records, 48% of Covid deaths at AIIMS-Patna took place within 48 hours of admission of patients. Altogether 12 out of 28 patients succumbed to the virus within 48 hours of hospitalisation since April 1. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid at AIIMS-P told this newspaper that there are two reasons behind the sudden death of Covid patients, first the delay in seeking medical aid, due to which their lungs got badly affected. "By the time such patients come, they already develop hypoxia (absence of enough oxygen in the tissues to sustain bodily functions) and the saturation level dropped to 40-60," he said He added, "Secondly, the virus strain of the later phase of the second wave is different from the first one. In this phase, the health of Covid patients even the healthy ones deteriorate very fast within a few hours of their hospitalisation and they succumb." At PMCH, on an average 4 to 5 patients succumbed to the disease daily, of which 1-2 patients died within a few hours of hospitalisation. Superintendent Dr IS Thakur said, "Sometimes, family and relatives of Covid patients brought them to the hospital when they are in a critical situation. It has become impossible to save patients when their oxygen levels are critically low and their lungs are badly affected." Aditya Shekhar, administrative officer of Netaji Subhas Medical College and Hospital, Bihta, said of the 17 patients admitted on Friday, three of them died in less than 24 hours. "Only critical patients whose oxygen level dropped below 40 are coming for medical aid. We have started the Covid-19 ward on April 16 and most of the patients are in a severe category," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hospitals-reporting-most-covid-deaths-within-48-hours/articleshow/82122061.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Visakhapatnam||Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation to upgrade sewerage network, sewage treatment plants in ABD area||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) has started upgrading two sewage treatment plants (STP), one located near Appu Ghar and the other at Lakshmi Talkies with about Rs 56 crore. The project also involves comprehensive sewage network transformation in the ABD area (ward numbers 17, 18, 19 and 20) of the city. These two STPs currently remain under-utilised as the current inflow of sewage into both STPs is about 38 MLD, against their combined capacity of 63 MLD. Due to the absence of underground drainage system in some parts of the ABD area, the waste water from the storm water drains directly enters the sea without treatment. The STPs would also be technologically upgraded to make sure the discharges meet the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) standards of biochemical oxygen demand not exceeding 10 mg/L instead of the existing 30 mg/L. An earlier study carried out by the GVMC in the ABD area identified around 8.8 km of missing links of sewerage network, apart from 7.1 km network in Jalaripeta. Only about 70% of households in the area are connected to the underground drainage network system. The remaining 30% of households are attached to the existing storm water network, which further discharges into the sea. All these gaps will be addressed through the project. A 7.1 km new sewerage network will be laid in Jalaripeta, which is the key missing link. Once the project is completed, a total of 3,100 households of the area, which have so far remained out of the UGD network, will be linked to the sewer network. The project will also give a facelift to four pumping stations, including those at Pandurangapuram and Shanti Ashramam. A GVMC official said that the project cost also involved 10 year maintenance. “A new sump would be constructed in Jalaripeta, which has no UGD network and the waste water would be diverted to the STP through pumping,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-to-upgrade-sewerage-network-stps-in-abd-area/articleshow/82121175.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Villagers had chased and surrounded Saurav, Devanand and their associate Aman Kumar at Karanja under Naubatpur police station area. Aman was lynched while Devanand was badly thrashed by the villagers. All the accused were around 21-22 years old. Naubatpur police station SHO Samrat Deepak Kumar said one Sulender Kumar (25) was returning home at Ainkhan village under Dulhin Bazaar police station area on a bike when the trio looted him at gunpoint. “Saurav, Devanand and Aman fled on their bike. However, Sundar kept raising alarm. Several villagers started chasing the criminals and intercepted the trio at Karanja, around 3km from Mukeempur. “Aman fired on the villagers, but he lost balance on his bike and the they fell down. Aman and Devanand fled in the fields while Saurav picked up the bike again and fled,” he said. Kumar said the villagers killed Aman and handed over Devanand to Naubatpur police after thrashing. “The looted jewellery and a countrymade pistol were recovered from the spot,” he said. The SHO said Aman beloned to Piplawan, Devanand to Jalpura and Saurav is from Saharrampur, all under Naubatpur police station area. He said the three were accused in three extortion cases. “Aman had come out of jail hardly ten days back,” he said. The SHO said an FIR has been registered against unknown villagers for killing Aman. “None has been arrested yet,” he said. Paliganj SDPO Tanvir Ahmed said an FIR against unknown criminals has been registered with Dulhin Bazaar police station in connection with the loot. “Devanand would be remanded in the case,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/one-criminal-lynched-another-held-after-jewellery-loot/articleshow/82122044.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Movement restrictions, lockdown dent fuel sale in 2020||Ahmedabad: Thanks to restrictions in movements due to a 55-day lockdown last year coupled with other curbs such as night curfews, the sales of petrol and diesel in Gujarat declined 11.7% and 11.8% respectively in 2020. Oil companies supplied 52.92 lakh kilo litre (KL) diesel for retail use across the state as compared to 60.02 lakh KL in 2019. Similarly, petrol supply for retail usage too declined from 29.52 lakh KL to 26.04 lakh KL, shows data compiled by the Federation of Gujarat State Petroleum Dealers’ Association (FGSPDA). “There was a lot of movement restriction throughout the year. During the lockdown, the fuel sale took a major hit. Even as the lockdown eased, commercial activity remained subdued due to several restrictions and movement of people at large was also limited. All these factors had a direct impact on the sale of motor spirits,” explained Arvind Thakkar, president, FGSPDA. According to FGSPDA the average monthly sale of petrol in Gujarat is estimated at 2.3 lakh KL and that of diesel at 5.5 lakh KL. As the lockdown eased, sales began recovering and were buoyant till February, according to estimates by petroleum dealers. However, from mid-March onwards, there was a slight decline in demand due to increased movement restrictions. Padmajay Rathod, an Ahmedabad-based petroleum dealer, said, “In the first fortnight of this April, fuel sale at stations within the city have plunged by around 15%. With a steep rise in cases, people have stopped moving out, and most are working from home. Moreover, travelling to locations outside Gujarat has also reduced significantly due to the new rule making RTPCR negative report compulsory in neighbouring states. As a result, consumption has dropped.” “My average daily sale is 20,000 litre petrol and 8,000 litre diesel. The same has come down to 16,000 litre petrol and 7,000 litre diesel in the first fortnight of April clearly suggesting a drop in petrol consumption by 20% and that for diesel by 13.5%,” Rathod added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/movement-restrictions-lockdown-dent-fuel-sale-in-2020/articleshow/82122214.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Kolkata||City hosts interfaith meet on Sikh guru’s birth anniv||Kolkata: On the day of the fifth phase polling in Bengal, as political parties contest each other aiming to keep polarization and religious divide at bay, the IHA Foundation, along with the United Interfaith Foundation- India organised a seminar — Parliament of Religion — to promote humanity, brotherhood and human rights. On the 400th birth anniversary of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji Dharam di Chaddar, several senior religious leaders and community heads of all faiths and religion across the country attended the event. Swami Atmapriyanada, pro-vice-chancellor of the Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute, stressed on ways people can come together and how religion can unite rather than emerge as a divisive force. “The programme that promotes peace, humanity and love was unique in all ways possible, and I pray that the people of our country stay united during these extraordinary times,” said Md Shafique Qasmi, Imam of Nakhoda Masjid. The life and teachings of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji Dharam di Chaddar were widely discussed at the seminar, which aimed at building trust between communities and religion. “To keep a fabric of Bengal in the same way as we have stayed together, it is essential that we have such interfaith dialogues. The programme was dedicated to the birth anniversary of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji Dharam di Chaddar because he had stood against oppression. It is essential for us to remember his teachings and only then can we implement them in the present context. Moreover, respecting religions is promoted by the interfaith dialogues and it is the very essence of co-existence,” said Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, chairman of IHA Foundation and the general secretary of Behala Gurdwara and United Interfaith Foundation – India. He pointed out that it is important for the new generation of the nation to know and understand the teachings of the Guru. “Today is an occasion to celebrate the unity of humanity and to be inspired to protect and serve one another, even at the cost of one’s life,” said Thomas D’Souza, Archbishop of Kolkata and the president of United Interfaith Foundation - India. Echoing his thoughts, Singh Sahib Giani Harpreet Singh, Jathedar, Sri Akaal Takht Sahib, Sri Amritsar, said, “The contribution of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur towards humanity, mankind and brotherhood is beyond comparison, we believe that during these trying times we should all come together, as the sacrifice of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur was against tyranny and oppression and not against any religion.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-hosts-interfaith-meet-on-sikh-gurus-birth-anniv/articleshow/82121885.cms||---

Entry of devotees at Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi has already become almost nil after the strict implementation of the decision to allow entry only to those with negative RT-PCR reports. Vindhyachal Panda Samaj (VPS) president, Pankaj Dwivedi, said, “As per the decision taken by VPS members after discussions with the officials of district administration, the temple will remain closed till April 21. The decision of reopening the temple doors for devotees will be taken as per the guidelines of the state government after April 21. Vindhyachal temple had witnessed huge congregation of devotees on the first and second days of Chaitra Navratri after which the local and temple administration made a provision to give entry only to those devotees who produced negative RT-PCR reports, said Dwivedi. He added that despite such restrictions, the gathering of devotees did not stop and risk of further spread of Covid-19 cases increased. “These ground realities were sufficient to make it clear that huge crowds would again arrive on the day of Ashtami and Ram Navami. To avoid such a situation, the decision to shut the doors of the temple for devotees was taken,” said Dwivedi. This is for the second consecutive year when the pandemic led to the closing of one of the Shaktipeeths of Goddess Durga—Vindhyachal temple and other temples in its triangle which include Kalikhoh and Ashtabhuja. The temple had been closed on March 20, 2020, owing to the lockdown. After the unlock process began,the temple was reopened after 100 days on May 29. “In Varanasi, the footfall of devotees at Kashi Vishwanath temple became almost nil on Saturday. Number of devotees at KVT had already reduced massively when the provision of producing negative RT-PCR reports was made a must for devotees to get entry,” said divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal. “Relaxations on the entry will be given only after the menace of the second Covid wave reduces. Keeping people safe is the top priority of the administration,” said Agrawal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/vindhyachal-temple-shut-as-rt-pcr-reportrule-fails-to-reduce-footfall-of-devotees/articleshow/82121962.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Even if the inauguration takes place, it may be a low-key affair. After chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s recent visit, Yadadri Temple Development Authority (YTDA) has put pending works on the fast-track to meet the May deadline. “The main rituals at the ‘swayambhu’ (self-manifested) idol in the sanctum sanctorum will be performed 10 days ahead of the inauguration. The temple’s sanctum sanctorum has been closed for the past four years, but temple priests have been offering ‘naivedyam’ to the deity every day as per Agamashastra,” a senior priest of the Yadagirigutta temple said. As Covid cases were spiralling out of control, the state government might find it difficult to perform all rituals at the temple complex. Moreover, some 50 temple staff and priests tested Covid positive and were undergoing treatment, another priest said. “Except a few minor civil works, the entire temple complex has been completed. By May, the temple will be ready for inauguration,” YTDA sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-shadow-looms-over-yadadri-temple-inauguration/articleshow/82122346.cms||Sunil Mungara

Two such cases were reported on Saturday, one from Gondal in Rajkot where a man slit his throat and another from Ahmedabad where the infected patient jumped to death from 5th floor of the hospital building. Jayanti Chotangiya (60) from Gondal, who was infected with coronavirus for around a week, killed himself at a dargah on Saturday. A resident of Vora Kotda road in Gondal, Chotangiya was ill for around a week and his sons had even brought an oxygen cylinder after he tested positive for Covid-19. But as his condition was not improving, the family was planning to admit him to Rajkot Civil Hospital on Saturday. But Chotangiya left home around 11.30am without telling anyone. When he was not found at home, his younger son called him to know where he was. Chotangiya told him that he was at the dargah where he often used to worship and will be back home shortly. After talking with the caretaker of the dargah for a while, Chotangiya went inside for offering prayers. When he did not come out, the caretaker went inside and found Chotangiya lying in a pool of blood. The caretaker informed Chotangiya’s sons and the police. His sons told cops that Chotangiya was upset after testing Covid-19 positive and did not want to get hospitalized. Meanwhile, Rasik Thakore (65), who was hospitalized in Shardaben Hospital in Ahmedabad after testing positive for coronavirus, jumped to death from the fifth floor of the hospital. Thakor was hospitalized on April 11. Sources said that Thakor was mentally perturbed by death and disease around him in the Covid-19 ward and jumped to his death early on Saturday morning around 6 am. On April 15, Sunil Bhalsod (44), who was admitted to Sanjeevani Gurukul Hospital in Rajkot, ended his life by hanging himself from a windowpane using his oxygen tube.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy writes to Odisha CM on Neradi barrage||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Saturday wrote to his Odisha counterpart Naveen Patnaik, requesting him to cooperate with AP in the construction of Neradi barrage on Vamsadhara river. Jagan also sought a meeting with the Odisha CM to resolve the pending issues between the two states. The Vamsadhara water disputes tribunal (VWDT) gave permission to AP to construct the barrage across the river, Jagan said, adding the tribunal also asked the state to construct the left head sluice to the barrage to serve the water requirements of Odisha. Stating that the construction of the barrage is imperative, he asserted that it would serve the interests of both states. The barrage would cater to the drinking water needs and irrigation requirements of Srikakulam district of AP and Gajapati district of Odisha, Jagan wrote. He further said that 80 tmcft of water from Vamsadhara river was going waste every year, as the farmers of the two states wait for the project to be completed. He also referred to Odisha government’s complaint on supervisory powers on the barrage and said these issues can be amicably resolved before the commencement of works. The tribunal authorised AP government to construct the barrage through its decision on September 13, 2017, Jagan noted, adding that Neradi project would be constructed by strictly following section 6 (1) of Inter State River Water Disputes Act of 1956. He expressed confidence that his Odisha counterpart would respond positively to his request and resolve issues concerning the two states in general and farmers of Srikakulam and Gajapati districts in particular.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-writes-to-odisha-cm-on-neradi-barrage/articleshow/82121123.cms||Gopi Dara

Sources said that the department has completed the process and it has found that there was around Rs 300 crore loss to the state. “Most of the recovery orders will be issued on Wednesday,” sources said, adding that investigations will continue to check if there is any further loss to the state exchequer. In the recent concluded assembly session, Goa Forward Party MLA Vijai Sardesai grilled chief minister Pramod Sawant on the floor of the House over the government’s failure for the past nine years to recover losses to the state exchequer due to illegal mining. In October 2020, the department had started the final hearing, based on the audit report, to recover money lost to illegal mining. Earlier, the department had evaluated the replies filed by holders of 118 mining leases to the audit report submitted by the team of chartered accountants. In 2015, the state government had appointed 15 chartered accountants to undertake a comprehensive audit of lease holders and traders of mineral ore in Goa during the past five years, when exports touched peak figures. The accountants had submitted an audit report of 118 mining leases to the mines department. Subsequently, the department analysed the report to ascertain the exact loss to the state owing to illegal mining. The high court of Bombay at Goa had directed the mines department to decide on the showcause notices issued to mining companies for recovery of over Rs 3,000 crore. Goa Foundation had approached the court through a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking directions to the state government to recover Rs 3,431 crore from mining companies within a time-bound period. It had filed the PIL when it became apparent that the government was not pursuing the recovery with zeal. Director of Goa Foundation, Claude Alvares had said that the demand notices worth Rs 1,580 crore were issued in 2016 on the basis of a report by a team of chartered accountants. Notices pursuant to the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) report were issued in 2017 and were worth Rs 1,922 crore. These notices were produced by the state to prove its bonafides during the hearing of the writ petition filed by Goa Foundation challenging the grant of 88 mining leases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/illegal-mining-govt-to-issue-orders-for-recovery-of-rs-300cr/articleshow/82122358.cms||Murari Shetye
---||India||Pick samples for genome sequencing randomly: Government||NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked states to ensure positive samples of Covid-19 sent for genome sequencing are picked up randomly and are sent with their clinical profile as failure to do so is preventing a correct assessment of whether a spread in infection is linked to a mutation. The Centre's concern came after various districts, particularly in Maharashtra, were found sending samples picked up serially and not randomly, often resulting in the same profile from a particular cluster, officials said underlining that this is posing hurdles in analysing whether there is a spread due to any significant mutation. Covid 19 virus has been mutating and various mutations have been found in many countries as well as in India and these include UK (17 mutations), Brazil (17 mutations), and South Africa (12 mutations). Till Thursday, 13,614 whole genome sequencing samples have been processed at the 10 designated labs. Of these, 1,189 samples have tested positive for variants of concern for SARS COV-2 in India. This includes 1,109 samples with UK variants; 79 samples with South African variant and one sample with the Brazil variant. These variants have higher transmissibility. Besides, the double mutation (two mutations) is another variant and has been found in several countries like Australia, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Namibia, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom and USA. However, higher transmissibility of this variant is not established as yet. So far, higher transmissibility has been established in the UK, South African and Brazilian variant. While many states have raised concerns that the spike in cases is due to mutations, the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) - a network of 10 laboratories set up for continuous monitoring of the genomic changes of the virus in India – is yet to arrive at a conclusion. “Genome sequencing is not so easy and it requires time to study a trend. To do so we first need to remove the anomalies and also study the clinical profiles. Some mutations are normal but a variant is formed with multiple mutations,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pick-samples-for-genome-sequencing-randomly-government/articleshow/82124452.cms||---

Six hours later, Dr Shilpa Patel, an associate professor with anatomy department at state-run SSG Hospital, was back in the saddle trying to save other lives. After carrying out the last rites of her 77-year-old mother, Kanta Ambalal Patel, Dr Patel diligently donned her PPE suit once again — staying true to her mother’s words — duty before everything else! Dr Rahul Parmar too lost his motherDr Rahul Parmar too lost his mother, Kanta Parmar, 67, who passed away from age-related issues in Gandhinagar on Thursday. But Parmar, who as nodal officer for Covid management and part of dead body disposal team at Central Gujarat’s biggest hospital, finished the cremation rituals and rushed back to join duty on Friday. “It was a natural death. I finished the cremation rituals with my family and returned to Vadodara,” said Parmar, who is with Preventive and Social Medicine Department at SSG. Officer on special duty for Covid-19 in Vadodara, Dr Vinod Rao said the Covid warriors displayed great personal commitment and devotion to duty even amid their mourning. But for warriors like Dr Patel or Dr Parmar, service to humanity is literally their only form of worship at the moment. Dr Parmar had to fight a personal battle with coronavirus last year when he got infected in December while on duty. “I was admitted for five days here (in SSG) itself. I was administered remdesivir and after 14 days’ quarantine period, I had rejoined duty,” said the doctor who has been handling the tough task of coordinating and handing over bodies of Covid-19 victims to their immediate families for more than a year now. Dr Shilpa too has been on Covid-19 duties on rotation every month since the beginning of the pandemic. “We had shifted my mother from Mehsana to Vadodara after the private practitioner there told us that we will have to arrange for remdesivir ourselves. Since she was admitted at the SSG only, I could at least keep visiting her,” said Dr Shilpa, adding that her mother was admitted on April 7 and she died on April 15. She, along with her brother, carried their mother’s body wrapped as per Covid protocol in an ambulance and cremated her at Akota crematorium. Recalling how her parents always taught her to work with dedication, Dr Patel said that she had insisted that Dr Patel should stop worrying about her and concentrate on her duty just a couple of hours before she passed away. Dr Patel said, “Based on rotation, my Covid duty was supposed to begin at 9 am on Thursday, but mom departed before that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/no-tragedy-can-keep-corona-warriors-away-from-frontline/articleshow/82121188.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Agra||UP: People wait for over hours to get RT-PCR test done at district hospital||AGRA: With the surge in Covid-19 cases, a chaotic crush of people was seen trying to get the RT-PCR test done at the district hospital here on Saturday. People were standing in the scorching heat for over two hours to give a sample of their throat swab for testing. Others were making the rounds to collect their reports. Some said they had been coming for the past seven days to collect their reports. When TOI visited the hospital on Saturday, chaos was evident everywhere with desperate people jostling for space to get the test done. Social distancing was not possible as people crowded around the two counters of the largest sample collection centre in the district. Unlike the district hospital, none of the private labs in the district is providing walk-in facility for Covid-19 testing. According to doctors at the district hospital , around 800 samples are being collected at these counters everyday for the past one week. The counters operate from 8 am to 8 pm every day. The two counters have been set up at the employment exchange office adjacent to the district hospital premises. The collection counters are operating from a tent. Despite the crowd, no arrangements have been made for providing sanitizers to the people let alone enforcing social distancing. Lohamandi locality resident Nidhi Khurana, who had come with his 64-year-old father for Covid-19 testing, said, “My father has been keeping unwell since the past two days. He has a fever and is feeling weak. Our family doctor suggested a Covid-19 test. I have been waiting here for over two hours to get my father tested. His condition is getting worse. Authorities must ensure that people do not face so much inconvenience in getting tested.” 65-year-old veteran journalist Rajeev Saxena said, “I have been waiting for Covid-19 report since the past seven days. I am symptomatic and have quarantined myself at home. In case my health deteriorates further, I will not be able to get proper treatment”. Mismanagement is evident not only in delay in issuing test reports, but in several cases the report neither mentions the person is tested positive or negative for Covid-19. “I had given my sample for Covid-19 testing at the district hospital on April 14. I received my report on Saturday. The lab report status is equivocal. It means, I am neither Covid-19 positive nor negative. This is highly unreasonable”. Chief medical officer of Agra district, Dr RC Pandey, said, “The number of people coming for Covid-19 testing has significantly increased over the past few days. We have two testing labs which are operating at their full capacity. We will look into arrangements for RT-PCR sampling at the district hospital.” The health department here claims that Covid-19 sampling is being conducted at 28 centres in the district. People coming from the rural areas at the district hospital alleged there is no arrangement for Covid-19 testing at the community and primary health centres. People reaching for Covid-19 testing facility at the SN Medical College were turned away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/people-wait-for-over-hrs-to-get-rt-pcr-test-done-at-dist-hosp/articleshow/82121181.cms||Deepak Lavania

The district administration has once again started random sampling of people at the state borders. On Saturday, a TOI team visited Asharodi check post where vehicles coming from other states are being checked to enquire from travellers the issues they were facing. Sushil Singh, travelling on the Uttar Pradesh state transport bus to Dehradun, told the team, “Our bus was stopped for an antigen test of passengers. We all had to stand in the same queue which made it difficult to maintain social distancing.” The health workers deployed at the railway station said that earlier, travellers who were tested positive couldn’t be taken to health facilities as the ambulance couldn’t reach on time. However, the situation has improved since Saturday, they added. Meanwhile, the district magistrate asked the teams at state borders to record the travel history of the arriving visitors. Since the city will be observing weekly closure on Sunday, massive sanitisation exercises will take place at all the public places, district officials alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-6000-challaned-in-last-three-weeks-for-flouting-covid-protocol/articleshow/82121178.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Cops confronted around 100 residents of villages and different sectors gathered at Matka Chowk, demanding they return to their homes in view of the weekend lockdown. Heated arguments broke out between the two parties. Protesters argued they have been coming to the place for the last several months and registering their disapproval of the Narendra Modi government by following social distancing. Raj Gill, a resident of Sector 23, said she had been participating in the protest at Matka chowk since December 2020. “We have been maintaining social distancing. What is the problem? Private vehicles are plying, some shops and private offices are also open, but police are not stopping them,” Gill said. Cops replied Section 144 of CrPC, which disallows the assembly of five or more people at a place, was imposed in the city and they could be arrested, if they do not leave the roundabout. However, no arrests was made. Finally, the residents ended the protest, but vowed to return to the site again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/police-break-up-agri-laws-protest-without-arrests/articleshow/82121888.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Khar teen murder accused’s mom says son was assaulted||MUMBAI: Over three months after his arrest in the Jhanvi Kukreja murder case at Khar, the mother of prime accused Shree Jogdhankar has written to the police commissioner alleging that the severity of injuries suffered by him suggest he was assaulted by some other individual. Bharti Jogdhankar, Shree’s mother, has demanded that her statement be recorded by police as there is a “possibility more people were involved in the incident”. Khar police filed a chargesheet against Jogdhankar and co-accused Diya Padalkar (18) before a magistrate court earlier this month. Dismissing Bharti’s allegations, a senior police official said they had enough evidence to point out Jogdhankar’s involvement in the murder. According to his medical reports, Jodhankar had suffered three rib fractures besides lacerations on the back of his head, multiple abrasions on his back, swelling on his right wrist and abrasions on right elbow and right leg. “Bharti’s contention is that neither Kukreja nor Padalkar could have caused such grave injuries and it’s impossible for Shree to have self-inflicted deep gashes on his back or behind his head. This indicates someone else was involved in the assault,” said Jogdhankar’s lawyer, Mahesh Vaswani. Bharti’s letter mentions that liquor was flowing freely at the New Year’s Eve bash at Bhagwati Heights society despite police having announced night curfew. “Shree was sloshed that night, as confirmed by his medical examination, and was unable to recall things clearly. A photograph shot by his friend after the incident shows a rectangular tear on the back of his shirt and multiple injuries. Police should investigate if a liquor bottle was smashed on his back by someone,” Vaswani added. Bharti’s letter mentioned that police had not provided her son with all relevant photographs along with the chargesheet copy in prison. “If someone had assaulted Shree, he would have been captured by the society’s surveillance cameras either entering or exiting the premises,” said a senior police officer. “Shree has been lying all along. He had told a hospital doctor that the injuries were sustained in an accident at Mahim. His mother now claims Shree never spoke to the doctor but his friend did. But we have evidence of him speaking to the doctor,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-khar-teen-murder-accuseds-mom-says-son-was-assaulted/articleshow/82122377.cms||Nitasha Natu

The SSG Hospital itself had sent around 85 samples to both these institutes. According to sources, the reports of a few samples have arrived but the double variant was not seen in any of them. The reports of other samples are still awaited, they said. The samples are being sent ever since travellers from United Kingdom (UK) started arriving in the state. The arrival of travellers started after the second wave with the Kent strain had gripped the UK. Sources said that while the double mutant is still a variation under investigation, it would be of great help if it is studied properly. It is believed that the double mutations have ensured that the virus spreads faster and has also made it capable of evading body’s immune responses.Infectious diseases expert Dr Hiten Kareliya said that knowing a strain that is prevalent in an area can be helpful in treating individual patients as well as dealing with the larger issue of public health. “The treatment can be tweaked to suit a particular patient. If detected before it spreads to other areas, a place where new strain is spotted can be contained and closely monitored,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/covid-strain-in-vadodara-still-a-mystery/articleshow/82121205.cms||---

When beauty parlours and salons were forced to shut due to coronavirus, none of them imagined that their business would even struggle to survive even after a year. Around 50% beauty parlours have been closed completely in the state capital after accumulating huge losses. Owners of the beauty parlours said that they are left to on themselves as nothing is being done for them to fight the situation. “From rents, mammoth electricity bills (I am paying Rs 3500 for just 100 units), employees’ salaries, taxes, the municipal people coming every now and then on pretext of one or other taxes is what we have been facing ever since pandemic has surfaced,” said an owner of a beauty parlour and salon set-up, Bindiya Kharb. Sharing her woes, she added, “There is no relief, no moratorium, no govt schemes to save our business by the authorities. Last year we sold jewelry to continue my work but how long it is possible to run like this. Should we also demand mass euthanasia?” she reacted. She has her business outlet in New Market. Problems added when banks have asked them to either pay the dues or they will initiate legal action. “I am not able to pay the EMI for the past 6 months. Banks have started sending legal notices. There are over 50% such owners having the same problem. I have shut my parlour and am planning to sell my home to repay the loan,” said Arti Sisodiya, owner of parlour in Kolar. Asked as why they could not revive their business when they were allowed to open after unlocking began, Vinita Singh, a parlour owner in Arera Colony, said, “The footfall has reduced by 50%. Now, what to do with the huge set-up we have developed to run our business.” Parlour owners have demanded immediate assistance like relief in taxes, electricity bills and such others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/struggling-to-make-up-for-lost-biz-salons-hit-by-lockdown-2-0/articleshow/82121903.cms||Ramendra Singh

Kanpur commissioner of police, Asim Arun, had approached higher-ups in Delhi in this regard, and they pursued the matter with the Indian embassy in Muscat. He also wrote to the Indian embassy in Muscat and the police were in constant touch with the Oman officials. To recall, the commissionerate police had on Tuesday arrested two members of a human trafficking gang, identified as Atiqur and Muzammil, from the city following a complaint filed by a Unnao resident at the Colonelganj police station here on April 9 accusing the duo of cheating. The duo had sent his 40-year-old wife to Oman with a promise of a well-paid job. However, his wife instead landed at the house of a ‘kafeel’ (guarantor), who forced her to do household work for a menial salary. Since then, she had been calling her husband to get her back to their India. The arrested miscreants had also confessed during interrogation that they were part of a well-organised international human trafficking racket and used to send people, especially women, to foreign countries against a hefty commission. Also, till date they had sent 20 women through agents operating from Karnataka, Mumbai and Delhi against a commission of Rs 25,000-30,000 per head. The complainant told police that as per his wife, along with her many other women including one from Unnao, besides from countries like Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and African continent, were held hostage in a six-storey building in Oman and were forced into slavery. The woman’s husband then approached local agents Atiqur and Muzammil and paid them Rs 22,000 for her air fare. When the accused demanded him Rs 1 lakh more, he approached the police. Subsequently, the police arrested the duo. Later, Arun and DCP (Crime) Salman Taj Patil approached the foreign ministry and embassies of the concerned countries. Patil said, “The Oman police had rescued the women after the Indian embassy contacted them. The two women are currently at the Indian embassy and all the legal formalities to bring them back have been completed. The two rescued women will reach Chennai from Muscat and then to Kanpur most likely on Sunday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/rescued-in-oman-2-unnaowomen-to-land-in-city-today/articleshow/82122008.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

He allegedly committed the crime in connivance with his two friends. According to sources, the incident took place on April 2 but was not reported to police as the accused Sachin told everyone that his grandmother Munni Devi had died due to heart attack. The elderly woman’s last rites was performed the next day. However, the boy’s uncle found his mother’s death suspicious and lodged a police complaint. Inquiry revealed that two of Sachin’s friends — Jackie and Honey — were involved in the crime too. During interrogation, they told police that Sachin wanted to buy an Android phone for which his grandmother was not ready to give him money. He then called them to convince her and when they tried to do this, his grandmother got angry. They added that Sachin strangled her to death after a heated argument. Atrauli station house officer Sanjay Jaiswal said that all the accused have been arrested and remanded to judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/class-x-student-kills-grandma-for-refusing-to-buy-him-android-phone/articleshow/82121208.cms||---
---||Kochi||Controversies likely to hit LDF’s poll prospects: CPM||Kochi: The state secretariat of CPM which met on Friday evaluated that the allegations against the government in EMCC deal, strike by PSC rank holders, incompetent candidates in certain constituencies, etc, have affected the prospects of the LDF candidates. Though LDF is expected to win more than 85 seats, these factors may be a deterrent for the front retaining power if the intensity of impact of these allegations is high. The state secretariat observed that LDF will retain power with 85-95 seats. “The margin in 80 seats will be more than 5,000. Besides the 85 seats which the party expects to win, there are around ten or more seats where the LDF candidates may win by thin margins,” sources within the party said. “At the same time, the state secretariat expressed apprehensions regarding the adverse impact of the allegations in EMCC deep-sea fishing deal, strike by PSC rank-holders, etc. If these controversies had a big impact, the chances of LDF retaining power is bleak. Otherwise, the front will gain power with a thumping majority. In some of the constituencies, the party had to field candidates who are less competent. It is as per the strong advice from the district leaderships that such candidates were fielded. There are doubts on the winnability of those candidates,” sources said. There is a consolidation of Ezhava and SC/ST communities in favour of LDF while the front’s voteshare among Muslim has gone up significantly, it has been observed. An additional 10% women voters have cast their franchise in favour of LDF in this election compared to 2016 elections, the state secretariat observed. “The issues like Sabarimala didn’t have much impact. Sabarimala issue and row with the NSS may impact a section of Nair voters. The LDF’s stake among Nair voters is normally 40% of the voters in that community. Even if it is decreased by another 10% due to the Sabarimala issue, the front’s winning chances will not be affected,” sources said. It is also observed that the low voter turnout compared to the previous election is due to the freezing of votes of the opposition parties. Some of the voters who switched over to BJP from the LDF in the past few years refrained from voting this time. Some of the votes of the UDF also were frozen, the state secretariat observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/controversies-likely-to-hit-ldfs-poll-prospects-cpm/articleshow/82121219.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: No puncturewalas or even plumbers, coping with day-to-day probs gets tough amid ‘Corona Curfew’||BHOPAL: Gopal Nath, a private firm employee, is not able to use his washroom for past a week. Reason: Due to ongoing ‘Corona Curfew’ it has become a tought to get a plumber around colonies. Though the district administration has exempted professionals like plumbers, carpenters and such others, they are not available reach the work spots. Nath was not the only citizen facing such a problem. Absence of such routine work professionals in the colonies have become common across the state capital. The problem is more acute in Covid hotspots Kolar and Shahpura areas where restrictions are more compared to other parts of the state capital. “I have contacted several plumbers in the past couple of days, but none of them turned up. Either they are demanding money 2-3 times higher or they have categorically stated no citing Covid-19. This is a very odd situation when there are several plumbing issues at home,” said Nath. Even several puncture shops are shut which is creating even bigger problems for the legitimate individuals who are allowed to go on their work. “Two days ago, a tyre of my bike went flat near PCC. It was around 12.30 in the day. Think about a situation when your bike is punctured and there was not a single shop to repair the tyre. I had to wait for almost 3 hours as it was not possible for me to leave the bike over there. Later, my friend came up with a worker to repair the tyre,” said Alok Mistri, a private bank employee. Even carpenters are not available to repair doors and other works. “Few days ago, my home door was broken as it was old. In the past three days, no one has turned to repair it and we have slept with a broken main door. It is risky also in the night but we are helpless as no one wants to repair it. I think the district administration should arrange such professionals as we can’t go out due to curfew,” said retired government employee Radheyshyam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/no-puncturewalas-or-even-plumbers-coping-with-day-to-day-probs-gets-tough-amid-corona-curfew/articleshow/82121907.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Allahabad||Staff crunch hits RTPCR testing inmed college; 5,000 samples pending||Prayagraj: In its second wave, the novel coronavirus is taking many more people in its grip, and is hitting key services crucial to combating the Covid-19 menace. In a worrying news amid the rapidly growing infection, the Microbiology department of Motilal Nehru Medical College, the central location where all RTPCR tests are being done, is facing acute shortage of staff due to Covid as 14 out of 30 trained employees of the department have tested positive. Due to this staff crunch, there is a backlog of over 5,000 samples even as the remaining employees are doing their best. Moreover, because of the backlog, people who had given samples three-four days back are still awaiting their reports and the treatment of those who may be positive is getting delayed. If any more lab workers get infected, the RTPCR tests in the district would be severely impacted and may come to a standstill. “The district administration has to take steps to ensure the backlog is cleared and RTPCR tests are not delayed,” said an employee of the department. RTPCR tests started in the microbiology department of medical college on April 10 last year. Allahabad University and Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT), both have a department of microbiology where research work is going on. The researchers there can be roped in to clear the backlog and increase tests, he added. Sources said the King George’s Medical University in Lucknow has set an example in this regard and has trained a large number of its staff to conduct RTPCR tests. “The big pool of employees has ensured there is no staff crunch and testing is not impacted. Our officials should also consider implementing the KGMU formula,” they added. The head of microbiology department Dr Monica said, “We are somehow managing things with depleted staff strength. We are willing to train more hands to increase our team but the problem is there are no volunteers because of the increasing numbers of cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/staff-crunch-hits-rtpcr-testing-inmed-college-5000-samples-pending/articleshow/82122549.cms||---
---||Kanpur||DM appeals to people tofollow Covid protocols||Kanpur: District magistrate Alok Tiwari on Saturday made an appeal to citizens to follow all Covid protocols and help the administration in controlling the pandemic. “The number of Covid-19 cases is increasing in the district. Patients are being admitted to Covid hospitals and are being provided quality treatment,” he added. Since the cases are increasing, the administration has added 16 more hospitals for Covid treatment. These hospitals would start admitting patients within two or three days, he added. However, despite all appeals and strictness, many people were seen flouting Covid norms. Most people were not wearing masks properly and were not following social distancing. Since the district administration has announced curfew for 35 hours, people rushed to buy groceries, vegetables and fruits. Fruit vendors hiked the prices to earn extra profit and mango which was selling for Rs 60 per kg was being sold at Rs 100. The price of bananas was raised from Rs 30 to 40 per dozen to Rs 50. Nayaganj, General Ganj and other wholesale markets witnessed high footfalls. “Nobody knows what would happen on Monday, therefore, it is better to buy necessary groceries and other essentials for a fortnight at least,” said a customer at a shop. There was rush at milk shops as administration has declared that all shops including milk vending shops and counters would be closed on Sunday and supply on Monday might be late. Big brands in milk trade like Amul and Namaste India had supplied adequate quantities of milk to retail outlets so that there is no shortage of supplies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/dm-appeals-to-people-tofollow-covid-protocols/articleshow/82121998.cms||---

---||Delhi||Anxiety and agony adding to Covid woes in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Amit Sengupta, a marketing professional, made a list of people two weeks ago. His friends and uncle had just tested positive for Covid-19, and he thought he would regularly call the listed infected people to keep their morale high. “The list has become longer in the last few days with many other loved ones testing positive, including my own brother and his wife,” said Sengupta. “It is taking a toll on my mental health.” The anxiety, depression, fear and grief of living in these burdensome times is affecting almost everyone — with varying degrees. As Dr Nand Kumar, professor of psychology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, pointed out, while the world might recover from the loss of lives caused by the pandemic, the mental trauma and grief caused by it may linger for long. Sheetal Jain is one among many who is suffering such anxiety. The 22-year-old law student’s grandparents, both in the late 70s and with multiple co-morbidities, tested positive last week. Jain said that every relative her father reached out for help in admitting them to hospital were either infected or were coping with a Covid in the family. “Eight people straight!” she exclaimed. “We somehow managed to get a hospital bed for my grandparents, but now I am frightened to think about my parents or myself testing positive. There are no beds in hospitals and medicines and oxygen cylinders are in short supply.” Tushar Verma, a software engineer, lost his job last year and hasn’t found another yet. If the stress of managing his household without a regular income was not enough, he is now wracked by angst over someone in the family contracting Covid. “I cannot sleep for more than three hours. I am taking anti-anxiety pills,” the 38-year-old confessed. “I have tried everything, from meditation to switching off from social media and TV news, but the fear hasn’t diminished. In fact, it is growing every day with information pouring in about hundreds dying of Covid.” Dr Rajesh Sagar of the Central Mental Health Authority, said the prevailing circumstances make deaths more traumatic. “The fact that due to physical distancing norms, even relatives and friends cannot be there to offer solace robs the individual of the coping mechanism,” he explained. Medical workers themselves are having a hard time. “As doctors, we have more suffering than ever during the pandemic,” said Dr Y K Misra, clinical services chief, Manipal Hospitals, Dwarka. There is a lot going on around us — from physical to mental health, seeing the trauma of people losing their loved ones and ourselves being anxiety-ridden about getting infected. And my wife (who is also a doctor) and I also have to take care of our aged father.” Dr Gaurav Thukral, COO, Healthcare at Home, an organisation that runs a Covid helpline, says they are getting close to 10,000 calls every day now. “So many people are suffering from panic attacks. The incidence of psychological distress, anxiety, and depression has also risen,” Thukral reported. Guilt over kin dying in isolation, away from family, is another cause for depression. Most Covid deaths happen in the ICU, states an article in Frontiers of Psychiatry. “In many cases, patients entered the emergency room, were taken to the ICU and never came back. Meanwhile, in order to keep them isolated, no one could see them, nor could any loved one be there at the time of the death,” the article says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/anxiety-and-agony-adding-to-covid-woes/articleshow/82122374.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Goa||No grounds for relief if no proof of structure in CRZ before 1991: National Green Tribunal||PANAJI: After the district-level committee for North Goa found a hotel structure to have been constructed illegally in Ashvem, Mandrem, the owners appealed before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) stating that the order to stop commercial activities at the structure was pronounced before they could present arguments. The NGT, however, said that even if time was allotted the owners had no arguments to make to show that the structure was legal. “In absence of any material to show that the constructions in question are pre-1991 and the appellant has due permissions for the commercial activities, we are unable to grant any relief,” the NGT said. The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) issued an order on February 18 to stop commercial activities at the property. The GCZMA, on receiving a complaint of illegal construction of the hotel, sought comments from the district level committee (DLC). The DLC found that the structures were illegal. The GCZMA found that the owner of the structure failed to give any reply in respect of the violations and, in fact, admitted that commercial activities were going on. The authority therefore ordered that all commercial activities in the violating structure be stopped. The owner of the offending structures then filed an appeal before the NGT. The property owner told the NGT that he received the order extending time to file reply before the GCZMA on February 22, but the GCZMA passed its order on February 18, thus depriving him an opportunity to present his objections. On these grounds, the hotel owner got the GCZMA order suspended by high court, pending consideration of the appeal by the NGT. “Even if the appellant had time to file reply till February 22, and the order was passed on February 18, the appellant could certainly approach the GCZMA on that ground, but the appellant did not do so. Accordingly, proceedings are deferred, but in the circumstances, in view of prima facie material against the appellant, we don’t find any ground to continue the interim order,” the NGT said. The NGT said that the appeal may now be listed only after the appellant files the necessary documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-grounds-for-relief-if-no-proof-of-structure-in-crz-before-1991-ngt/articleshow/82122382.cms||---

Subsequently, accused Jinedra Jain and Rahila Furniturewala submitted bail pleas, which are pending. Australian architect Paul Bartels, who is out on bail, submitted a discharge plea. The matter was adjourned to Tuesday. The prosecution will then submit draft charges. The accused can submit discharge pleas. Arguments will be presented on charges by prosecution and defence. The court will then decided which charges are to be framed against the accused and if any are to be dropped. Once charges are framed, the trial can commence, but if an accused is discharged, proceedings against them end before the NDPS court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-summons-in-three-categories-issued-for-ssr-case-accused/articleshow/82122985.cms||---

The video shows patients struggling to breathe oxygen through the nasal pipes owing to extreme low pressure. The hospital administration, however, soon clarified that the video originates from a non-Covid ward and the pressure problem will be resolved immediately. The video that also went viral shows patients suffering from sudden lack of oxygen supply as it gets disrupted or fluctuates and the attendant trying to tap the pipe for better flow. A kin recorded the video of his patient’s condition without oxygen and also made a hospital staffer say that such low supply has been recurring often. According to civil hospital administration, daily use of oxygen in last peak of Covid was 22,000 kilo litre (KL), this time around daily use of oxygen has doubled and reached up to 40,000 KL. Meanwhile, the hospital also added 300 more beds for Covid patients taking the bed count now to 900 in the hospital. Medical superintendent of Rajkot civil hospital, Radheshyam Trivedi said, “The fluctuations in oxygen line happens sometimes because of an imbalance in demand and supply. We are drawing far more oxygen from the same line, but we are helpless. We have no option as the number of patients have increased drastically. We are installing a wide pipeline and one additional tank for oxygen in the next three days.” According to hospital sources the problem was resolved within five to ten minutes. An operator for oxygen and a bio medical engineer have been deputed round-the-clock in the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/patients-gasp-on-low-pressure-oxygen-line-video-goes-viral/articleshow/82121272.cms||---

He was reviewing the situation and arrangements of Corona in the state from his residence on Saturday through video conferencing. Chief minister said that the supply of oxygen in the state is constantly increasing and oxygen is being received as per consumption. It should be ensured that the oxygen received is made available to all the districts on time. Four thousand oxygen concentrators are being arranged in different districts of the state. Orders have been issued in this connection. Two thousand concentrators have already been given and 150 more have come.

The 59-year-old actor was admited to the hospital on Friday after suffering a massive cardiac arrest. Scores of fans bid him a tearful farewell as his body was cremated with state police’s 24-gun salute. The Tamil Nadu government said the ‘police honour’ was in recognition of his contribution to the film world and his social service. The actor is survived by his wife and two daughters. Vivekh’s teenage son had died years ago. The Padma Shri awardee has acted in more than 200 movies along with most of the leading Kollywood stars, including Rajinikanth. He has won state awards as best comedian for movies such as “Run,”, “Anniyan” and “Sivaji”. The actor has been a life-long campaigner for planting trees through ‘green Kalam movement’ and has been the state’s ambassador for popularizing public health messages, including prevention of dengue. PM and scores of other dignitaries condoled his demise. On Friday, he was taken to the emergency room in an unconscious state around 11am by his wife and daughter after he complained of discomfort. He underwent an angioplasty and stenting procedure and was put on ECMO support in the intensive care unit. “He passed away at 4.35am on Saturday,” said hospital vice-president Dr Raju Sivasamy. The actor had taken Covaxin at Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital on Thursday. He told reporters that he had come to a government hospital with his team in order to encourage people to take the vaccine. The same day, for the first time the number of doses administered by the state crossed the 2-lakh mark. While a committee for Adverse event following immunization (AEFI) comprising doctors and scientists will hold detailed investigation into the cause of death and its possible links with the vaccine, the hospital said preliminary reports show the attack was not related to the vaccination, but acute coronary syndrome with a cardiogenic shock. This was the first time that the actor had come to hospital with an attack like this, Dr Sivasamy said. Vivek had a “mild elevated blood pressure.” Hundreds of fans, actors, directors and political leaders visited his house to pay their respects. His comedy tracks were running in loop across television channels and were shared widely in social media along with condolences. He is survived by his wife and two daughters. His son, Prasanna kumar, 13 died in June 2016 following complications of dengue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/vivekh-59-popular-actor-and-green-ambassador-dies-in-city/articleshow/82122381.cms||---
---||Agra||UP: RT-PCR tests fail to detect Covid-19 as Agra records highest active case count||AGRA: Over the last three days, at least 15 patients with Covid-19 symptoms have got negative RT-PCR test results in Agra. It is only after CT scans that doctors are discovering severe lung damage. “About 2-3% of patients are testing negative for Covid-19 but CT scans are showing up lung damage. This may be happening because of the spread of new strains of the virus, limitations of the sampling procedure and the RT-PCR test itself, which has an 85% sensitivity. We are making arrangements to address this,” Agra chief medical officer Dr RC Pandey said. Over the past 10 days, similar cases have been reported in Jaipur, Hyderabad and Mumbai. What adds to the problem is that the focus on Covid-19 means many of these patients can’t get access to the care they need until it is too late. On Saturday, an entrepreneur from Kasganj, 62, died at a private hospital in Agra. His Covid-19 test report had come back negative but his CT scan showed 70% damage to his lungs. His blood oxygen level continued to dip and he passed away within 48 hours of hospitalisation. In a similar case, a 64-year-old woman from Shahganj reported high fever and difficulty in breathing. Her RT-PCR test report came back negative. But her CT scan showed her lungs had suffered 60% damage. After three days of treatment at the SN Medical College in Agra, the woman died earlier this week. She had received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. President of the Agra unit of the Indian Medical Association, Dr Rajeev Upadhyaya, said, “Symptomatic patients getting negative RT-PCR tests is a new challenge before us … We are coordinating with the district administration to ensure these patients get time-bound treatment as per the Covid-19 protocol.” Agra reported 398 fresh Covid-19 cases on Saturday, taking the number of active cases to 1,906 — its highest ever. Three Covid-19 patients died. Health officials said all three had comorbidities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/rt-pcr-tests-fail-to-detect-covid-19-as-agra-records-highest-active-case-count/articleshow/82121213.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Delhi||CPCB, DPCC told to take remedial action against WTE plants||New Delhi: National Green Tribunal has directed Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to take remedial action against the three waste-to-energy plants in Ghazipur, Okhla and Narela-Bawana. CPCB had audited the WTE plants and found violations at three units, before giving its recommendations to NGT. NGT said CPCB may utilise the experience of functioning of waste-to-energy plants in Delhi for similar steps elsewhere, particularly metro cities. For the Okhla plant, CPCB recommended it implement measures to improve ambient air quality, including PM2.5 concentration, in and around it. “Plant is to properly control production process and pollution-control equipment to ensure that all parameters, including dioxin, furans and HCI, are within the stipulated norms,” the board said, adding that 100% fly ash should be repurposed, like manufacturing bricks. The Okhla plant has to give an action plan and specify the timeframe within which an online continuous ambient station will be installed to monitor air quality. For the plant in Bawana, CPCB recommended processing the waste as per the consented capacity and optimising the production process. “Plant has to properly control production process and apply pollution-control measures to ensure that all parameters are within the stipulated norms. It should implement necessary measures to improve ambient air quality, including PM2.5 & PM1O concentration, in and around it,” the board said. CPCB recommended time-bound action plan to be submitted for implementation of fly ash and inert-material utilisation measures for plants in Bawana and Ghazipur. “The Ghazipur unit has to upgrade its production process and emission control measures to ensure that the emission levels of all parameters — including PM, HCL, NOx, dioxin and furans — are within the stipulated limits,” said the board. The Ghazipur unit has been asked to provide a facility for treatment of wet waste. “The plant should upgrade its leachate treatment procedure to improve its quality before spreading it over land. The segregation process of the plant’s municipal solid waste has to be made operational to improve its efficiency,” said CPCB, adding that the plant has to obtain valid consent to operate from DPCC as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cpcb-dpcc-told-to-take-remedial-action-against-wte-plants/articleshow/82123040.cms||---

In a two-page official communique issued on Saturday, Vijayaraghavan targeted Muraleedharan personally claiming that he has become a disgrace to people of Kerala as he has no qualms in misusing his official position. “By now, it has been proven that Muraleedharan misuses his official position for his personal interest,” he said, adding that the public would not approve of the character assassination attempts against Pinarayi Vijayan who has been leading Kerala in its fight against Covid-19. Vijayaraghavan said Muraleedharan did nothing to resolve the vaccine shortage crisis in the state. “He did not even care to draw the Union health ministry’s attention to our needs,” he said. While addressing a news conference at AKG Centre on Friday, Vijayaraghavan had said people would give a befitting reply to those who single out the chief minister and criticize him unnecessarily. The public’s answer to such baseless allegations will become clear when the election results come out on May 2, he had said. Meanwhile, BJP state president K Surendran said CPM has been trying to divert public attention from the abysmal handling of the pandemic by attacking Muraleedharan over his comments against CM’s Covid protocol violation. “Test positivity rate in Kerala has broken all records. The government wants to divert public attention from it. The celebrated Kerala model has proved to be a PR gimmick. BPJ won’t let CPM to hunt Muraleedharan for questioning the chief minister’s irresponsible behaviour,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/rein-in-muraleedharan-vijayaraghavan-tells-bjp/articleshow/82121289.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Tourism at Khajuraho comes to a standstill||BHOPAL: Over a year of coronavirus crisis has broken the backbone of the tourism industry in Khajuraho, the international tourist destination and UNESCO heritage site located in Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh. With little or no footfall of tourists, especially those from abroad, there has been hardly any business for hotels and restaurants, tourist guides and small time traders – all of whom are dependent on tourism. Over a year or so, only domestic tourists have been visiting Khajuraho; majority of them would during the day and leave the destination in the evening. But the worst affected are people like 48-year-old Sushila who belong to the unorganized part of the tourism sector. Sushila lives with her husband Sushil and four children in a small shanty in the town. Hailing from Uttar Pradesh’s Mahoba, Sushila and her husband would start their day at 5 in the morning before coronavirus struck. She would sell bangles while her husband worked as a labourer in one of the many hotels, now facing shutdown. The last business opportunity came for them during the Khajuraho dance festival in February. “We plan to go back to our village in Mahoba as soon as the lockdown is over,” said Sushil. This is the story of a large number of people who are not recognized by the industry. The guides and restaurant owners may have been surviving on the savings but its question of survival for people like Sushila and Sushil. President of the guides association of Khajuraho, Balbeer Gautam, said, “The last group of tourists with whom I had visited the temples was on March last year.” Gautam said he is currently working on his small farm preparing for the next crop. There are about 120 to 130 guides in Khajuraho and all of them are dependent on the tourism industry. “All of us are sitting at home waiting for the crisis to be over,” he said. Ashok Gautam, president of Khajuraho’s hotel association, said that almost all types of hotels are seeing zero. “It’s easy to maintain a small or medium size hotel with very few workers but very difficult for the star hotels to survive,” he said. There are over 70 hotels, including the five-star hotels, and all of them have seen a large number of retrenchments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/tourism-at-khajuraho-comes-to-a-standstill/articleshow/82121941.cms||---

Even in convoys, every two vehicles should be split leaving a gap of 10 metres. For roadshows, a minimum half an hour gap should be maintained on the same routes. Public meetings will also be allowed adhering to Covid-19 guidelines. The returning officers have been asked to ensure sanitisation of polling station a day before the polling staff arrival and separate shaded waiting areas for both male and females by arranging chairs.

Finishing puja at one home, he rushes to another to perform yagna, but not this year. He hasn’t got a single call to conduct any rituals or yagna this festival. In fact, he hasn’t stepped out of his house for the past few days.“It’s very unusual. I have been spending all day at home without any work. People have stopped performing any kind of ritual amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Even in the holy month of Chaitra, very few are performing puja at home or at workplace,” Maharaj told TOI.“I perform several ‘Nav Chandi’ yagna during this time of the year but I have not got any call this time. We had barely started earning after the first wave of Covid but over last three weeks, the situation has worsened,” he said. Like him, the Covid has affected many priests who perform rituals and puja. People have stopped inviting them due to the fear of coronavirus that has claimed hundreds of lives in the state. Gujaratis are even skipping the rituals performed after the death of any family member. “Most of them are performing post death rituals by Narmada River bank at Chandod in Dabhoi. They are not inviting Brahmins to conduct any puja at home amid the Covid crisis. The affected families only call up to seek help for conducting the rituals. I have not performed any yagna or religious ceremony over last couple of weeks,” said Atul Maharaj, a resident of the old city. “We don’t have much work on our hands even during the Chaitra month when a lot of religious rites are performed. If the situation doesn’t improve, most pundits performing religious and other rituals will face financial crisis. Their lives depend on the yagna, puja and other customs followed by people,” said Sharad Maharaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/covid-throws-rituals-and-pundits-out-of-reckoning/articleshow/82121295.cms||Tushar Tere

---||Chandigarh||Cases outpace testing in Punjab, 50k target unmet||Chandigarh: Even as Covid-19 is spreading at an alarming rate in Punjab, testing – crucial for early detection and isolation of infected people – is not keeping pace. Analysis of health department data indicates that the government has a lot of catching up to do. The state has not been able to meet the daily target of 50,000 tests set by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. The number of positive cases increased by 44.60% whereas testing count grew by 20.10% between March 16 and April 16. In the period, a total of 10,90,889 tests were conducted while 89,671 fresh cases surfaced. An average of 34,090 people per day were tested, the highest number since the start of the pandemic. However, experts have termed the number insufficient and called for ramping up of testing. The state crossed the mark of 40,000 tests on six occasions in the past one month, while the figure of testing remained below 35,000 on 13 days. During this period, the highest testing figure of 46,472 was recorded on April 8 and the lowest of 20,164 on March 16. Barring Maharashtra, all the top five worst affected states have higher tests per million population than Punjab. For every 10 lakh people in Punjab, 2,18,292 samples have been tested. The figure stands at 8,09,688 in Delhi, 4,00,901 in Kerala, 3,54,186 in Karnataka, 2,98,848 in Andhra Pradesh and 2,77,121 in Tamil Nadu. The neighbouring state of Haryana is also faring much better with 2,35,966 tests per million population. Highlighting the importance of timely testing to contain the virus, Dr Ram Kumar, president of the Society for Promotion of Ethical and Affordable Healthcare maintained that testing is one of the most important aspects which needs the utmost attention of authorities. “More they test, higher the chances of suppressing the spread of the virus,” said Dr Kumar. The Lancet Covid-19 Commission India Task Force, in its latest report, recommended that all states ramp up facilities to conduct RT-PCR tests, including both naso-oropharyngeal saliva and nasopharyngeal (nasal swab) tests. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said testing has improved considerably and efforts are on to push daily testing count to over 50,000. To achieve the same, Dr Bhaskar said instructions have been issued to district heads and they are also being provided with required resources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cases-outpace-testing-in-punjab-50k-target-unmet/articleshow/82123035.cms||Vinod Kumar

In its petition to University Grants Commission (UGC) and Kerala University chancellor and state governor Arif Mohammed Khan, the committee claimed that a review by PubPeer, a California-registered public-benefit corporation that looks into scientific research papers has detected several discrepancies of serious nature in the research papers published by the assistant professor who is the wife of a former MP. The faculty member, claimed the committee, got first rank in the selection process mainly on the basis of her research publications. The scientific analysis, however, has identified “fabricated and duplicated images”, in her works. “Internationally, it is considered as a serious misconduct that leads to the removal of such individuals from academic jobs to protect the sanctity of the profession,” the complaint said. The petition has been submitted with a detailed analysis of the four publications of the faculty member. “The individual has high political influence in the ruling party of the state. Under the circumstances, it is requested to appoint an expert level committee of researches from national institutes such as IISER, IIT or NIIST and take appropriate model remedial measures so that such blatant fraud will not happen in our universities,” the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ku-faculty-in-research-fraud-row/articleshow/82121291.cms||---

Additional chief secretary (home) Rajesh Rajora instructed all the collectors to ensure that pilgrims returning from Kumbh inform the administration on a dedicated phone number upon reaching their home town / village. People who know of such pilgrims have bene urged to inform officials. The administration can then ensure the pilgrims are quarantined and tested. But it’s going to be a very difficult task. Sources said the administration doesn’t have any record of how many pilgrims from Madhya Pradesh have gone to the Kumbh. There never was a system to document this, and there isn’t one even in Covid times. “We do not compile such information,” a health official said. In Jabalpur, officials have identified two dozen people and three disciples who had come in contact with the sadhu who died on Friday. The three disciples have tested positive for Covid-19.

Though, officially 78 such events have been documented till date, this is considered as too low for a vaccination programme. Sources said there have been three cases of thrombosis (blood clot), which has not been recorded, while a death occurred at GMCH-32 a day after the first dose of the vaccination. “It is not known that the death or the clotting occurred due to the vaccine. But the same could have been investigated instead of just ignoring these cases,” said a doctor at a public hospital. However, the UT health department is not aware of these events. “We could have been told about these cases. But since we did not get anything from these hospitals, we cannot record them,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, UT. Recently, there have been some reports on AstraZeneca vaccine resulting in thrombosis. However, the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis mentioned that there is no direct link between the vaccination and the clotting. The society concluded that the benefits of the vaccination strongly outweigh any potential complications even for patients with a history of blood clots. “As doctors and scientists, we are not saying not to take vaccine. But there has to be documentation of any side effect or adverse event for monitoring. This is a normal process which is followed in routine pediatric immunisation,” said a health expert at the PGI. Adverse event as per the WHO is a ‘medical occurrence temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, but not necessarily causally related’. In vaccination against Covid-19, the mild adverse events are fatigue, fever, body ache, rash on the site of the injection etc. The government of India has directed to monitor such cases, but in the absence of self-reporting, most of these events are getting unnoticed. “We do not get many calls at the helpline after vaccination. People take paracetamol and do not report back,” said an official in the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-data-of-vax-adverse-events/articleshow/82121299.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Earlier, Murtuza used to deal in production and sales of rodent-killer. To make quick money he started working as an agent to bring girls from Bangladesh. “He travelled to villages in Bangladesh and brought the girls here for Rs 15,000.

The minister told the media on Saturday that the woman withdrew the complaint, but she had denied it. The woman had filed a complaint with Ambalappuzha police station that the minister made anti-women remarks while referring to their marriage. “Ours was an intercaste marriage held on January 8, 2021. My husband had resigned as the personal staff member of the minister following a row regarding our marriage. At a press conference on April 11, the minister said that I have been detaining my husband. It is derogatory for me as a woman. So, I lodged a complaint with Ambalapuzha police station. But, they didn’t act on it until April 17,” the complainant said. The family of the woman were against their marriage and alleged that the minister’s staff abducted their daughter. On Saturday, G Sudhakaran told the media that the woman has withdrawn the complaint. But, the complainant said she hadn’t done so. Following the minister’s statement, she filed a complaint with district police superintendent, Alappuzha, and went to Alappuzha Town South station to provide evidence of the minister making the statement. Meanwhile, Sudhakaran has alleged that a criminal gang in some political party is trying to malign him. He said that they are engaged in attacks on his family members too through social media. Political observers view this as a reflection of differences of opinion among the CPM leadership in Alappuzha district. Speaking to the media, CPM Alappuzha district secretary R Nasar also subscribed to the views of the PWD minister. He said that the party will examine the issues. Besides, there are allegations that Sudhakaran, who was denied a party ticket for the assembly elections, had not been active during campaigning. But, Sudhakaran denied it. There are apprehensions in the party leadership whether the current controversy is an indicator of the LDF candidate’s bleak chances in Ambalapuzha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/minister-sudhakaran-in-a-spot-for-anti-women-remarks/articleshow/82121361.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Allow Maharashtra state pharma companies to produce Remdesivir, says Tope||Mumbai: Public health minister Rajesh Tope has sought permission for the state’s pharmaceutical companies to manufacture Remdesivir, an anti-viral drug that is in high demand. Maharashtra has already sought a compulsory licence (CL) for Remdesivir which allows the Centre to revoke a patent and gives other manufacturers permission to produce a drug during emergencies.  Tope has demanded permission to transport oxygen by rail from other states. Tope said the state wants to ramp up its vaccination and has set a target of eight lakh vaccines per day, for which the doses should be supplied proportionately. The Centre said it was developing 132 oxygen plants in the country and Tope said considering the situation in Maharashtra, he hoped the state will get its fair share. Tope told the media in Jalna that the ‘Break the Chain’ restrictions may be extended beyond May 1, depending on the situation. “A decision will be finalised only after reviewing the outcome of these in the next few days.”tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/allow-maharashtra-state-pharma-companies-to-produce-remdesivir-says-tope/articleshow/82122411.cms||---

When officials arrived at the central store of the hospital, a Covid centre, on Saturday morning, they were shocked to see the grille of a window broken. They began checking the stocks and quickly realized that 14 boxes of Remdesivir were missing. They informed senior officials, who called the police. DIG Irshad Wali led the crime scene investigation. Police were dismayed to know that there are no CCTV cameras in the store room, neither any in the vicinity, say sources. CSP Nagendra Pateria said a private agency handles security at the hospital. “Despite the deployment of so many security guards, the theft of only Remdesivir injections points towards the involvement of a hospital staff,” he said. The hospital informed police about the theft around 1pm, Pateria said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/860-remdesivir-injections-stolen-from-hamidia/articleshow/82121958.cms||---
---||Delhi||Man held for passing on sensitive defence info to Pak handler||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Special Cell has arrested a 35-year-old man on charges of allegedly passing on sensitive defence-related information to his Pakistan-based handler. The accused has been identified as Harpal Singh who has been charged under the Official Secrets Act. Police said that Singh has criminal antecedents and has been booked in Punjab earlier for attempt to murder. The cops have also identified his ISI handler who Singh met up with in Oman. Sensitivity documents have been recovered from him. According to DCP Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, the suspect is learnt to have conveyed details of Indian Army personnel, army movements, location of the Army and BSF posts and bunkers on outposts of Indo-Pak borders. The payments to him for the espionage operation were routed by the ISI through hawala channel, DCP Yadav added. While working with a Pune-based military intelligence unit, the south-western range of cell received a tip-off about a suspect from Taran Tarn in Punjab having links with intelligence officers of foreign countries. An FIR was registered and surveillance mounted. “Surveillance revealed that the suspect was doing fencing work at Indo-Pak border and there he created a way to transfer secret documents across the border. Lately, he had been harvesting wheat as a cover,” DCP Yadav said. On April 12, the cell arrested him from north Delhi on a tip-off. During interrogation, Singh has disclosed his handler’s identity as one Jaspal, an ISI agent based in Lahore. “In the past also, he had sent several videos and information to his handler and received a handsome remuneration for it. Singh was born and brought up in villages adjoining the Indo-Pak borders and thus was very well versed with details and locations of the Indian troops posted there. He was contacted by Jaspal through an messenger app,” DCP Yadav said. Jaspal was able to radicalise Singh by citing various atrocities committed upon their community and persuaded him to work for him, police said. “One mobile phone with two SIM cards through which he was in contact with his handler has been recovered, along with confidential documents of Indian Army and two bus tickets for the journey,” the DCP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-held-for-passing-on-sensitive-defence-info-to-pak-handler/articleshow/82123060.cms||---
---||Goa||Coastal zone management plan hearing: Petitioners agree to approach National Green Tribunal||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa disposed of cases questioning public hearing conducted by the North Goa collector for finalising the coastal zone management plan (CZMP) after the petitioners agreed to file appropriate proceedings before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) at New Delhi. In March, the high court had restrained the government respondents from proceeding further on the basis of the minutes of the hearing on March 7, 2021, for a period of three weeks or until further orders, whichever is earlier. The high court had passed the interim order and observed that the PIL ought to have been filed before the NGT. But they were hearing the petitioners as western zone bench of the tribunal at Pune has not been functional. The high court, in its recent order, observed, “Considering the chequered history of the matter, we request the NGT to take up the petitioners’ applications for interim relief, in the said proceedings as expeditiously as possible and preferably within a period of four weeks from the date of the institution of the proceedings.” “Until the applications for interim relief are disposed of by the NGT, the interim orders made by us in this petition will operate,” the court added. The public hearings of March 7, 2021, for the CZMP was shunned by people, terming it as a farce, as the state government restricted the number of registrations citing Covid protocols and each speaker was allotted just 5 minutes. Amid angry protests inside and outside the venues, with a huge posse of police personnel guarding it, the state government claimed to have successfully concluded the hearings. There was utter chaos as hundreds of people came out against the CZMP demanding wider consultation, even as the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority carried out the exercise at Panaji and Margao through the district collectors Even those who had registered, refused to speak and called for hearing to be postponed for accommodating all those who wanted to give their suggestions, while some wanted it to be prepared in consultation with the panchayats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/czmp-hearing-petitioners-agree-to-approach-ngt/articleshow/82122420.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||At 1.2%, Kolhapur vax wastage figure better than state average||Kolhapur: The vaccine wastage percentage in Kolhapur district, at 1.2%, is lower than the state average of 1.4%, revealed the data released by the state health department. A month ago, Kolhapur district's vaccine wastage percentage was a little above 2%. However, due to high turnout and, most importantly, due to the training and skills imparted to the nursing staff, wastage has reduced. Health officials claim they will be able to reduce wastage further. The Centre has asked the states to ensure the wastage is brought down below 1% due to the acute shortage of the vaccines across the country. So far, the Kolhapur district has received around 8.4 lakh doses of both Covishield and Covaxin. Of them, around 8.34 lakh doses have been administered to eligible beneficiaries. Farukh Desai, the district vaccine coordinator, said: “One vial has 10 doses. We use an auto-disposable 0.5ml syringe, which helps avoid wastage. We have trained the nurses to ensure there are no bubbles, the syringes are completely filled and the vaccine properly administered. Earlier, we had lower turnout of the beneficiaries, which often meant that the last-opened vial was not fully used. Such vials had to be thrown away. Now, due to lower stocks and larger turnouts, all vaccine vials are fully utilised.” Earlier, prior registration was mandatory for the beneficiaries. This was to help the authorities plan for vaccine usage. Only 100 beneficiaries were allowed at one centre, a requirement which has since been done away with. There is lower turnout of beneficiaries at the private hospitals. Therefore, to avoid wastage, the private hospitals have made it mandatory for the beneficiaries to register first. “Despite of all this, we have significant wastage in public and private hospitals. We are opening up many centres and the turnout is getting thin at some places, which is causing wastage,” said Desai. In Maharashtra, around 1.76 lakh doses have been wasted so far and Nashik district tops the chart. Nashik has wasted 48,654 vaccine doses, which account for 8.2% of all doses supplied to the district. Nanded too has a wastage of 8.2% — around 23,326 doses have been wasted here. In the south Maharashtra region, Solapur tops with 6.7% wastage — 18,702 doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/at-1-2-kolhapur-vax-wastage-figure-better-than-state-average/articleshow/82234339.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: 7 pharma companies slash Remdesivir price||NEW DELHI: In a relief to Covid-19 patients, pharmaceutical companies manufacturing Remdesivir in India have significantly lowered prices of the drug being given to patients with severe infection in hospitals following government’s intervention last week. The price of Remdesivir has dropped to the range of Rs 899-3,490 per 100ml vial from Rs 2,800-5,400 earlier depending on brands. The seven manufacturers have voluntarily reduced the prices in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The development assumes significance as Covid-19 cases are rising significantly across the country with large number of severe cases in hospitals needing oxygen and ventilator support. Following concerns about shortage and high price of Remdesivir in the wake of a surge in Covid-19 cases, the Centre initially stopped export of the drug to cater to local demand. Besides, in a meeting with manufacturers last week, the Centre also decided to facilitate fast track approval to companies to ramp up production capacities to make around 78 lakh vials per month, double the currently installed capacity of 38.80 lakh vials. The government also negotiated with the manufacturers on pricing as they agreed to voluntarily reduce the price to ensure the medicine is adequately available and accessible to people during the pandemic. However, some public health advocates raised concerns about a wide gap in MRP of different brands and urged the government to cap the prices using provisions for emergency situation. Cadila Healthcare, Cipla, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Hetero Labs, Jubilant Pharma, Mylan and Syngene International are the local manufacturers of the medicine. Cadila Healthcare’s Remdac is the cheapest drug at Rs 899 per vial. Used for treating Ebola, the anti-viral drug Remdesivir is an ‘investigation drug’ that has shown efficacy in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. However, the government has stressed that it is an ‘investigational drug’ and should be used only in hospital setting for Covid-19 patients on oxygen support. Health officials have strongly prohibited the use of the drug by patients at home.

Supplyco authorities here on Saturday said that the allegation about distribution of Vishu kits was untrue. “There is no scarcity of kits. Supplyco has taken all steps to complete the kit distribution in two weeks. The baseless allegation about the kit distribution amounted to belittlement of the herculean task being carried out by Supplyco employees,” stated a government release here on Saturday. “The additional kits required to meet the target of March have already been prepared. As many as 16 lakh kits have already been distributed through ration shops in April. Twelve lakh kits needed to meet the target of this month are also getting ready,” the statement said. Preparation of the kits for March started on March 8 and distribution of the same began on March 12. Packing of kits for April too started on March 24 and distribution of the same started on March 30. As many as 75 lakh families have already received the kit for March and 16 lakh card holders have received their kit for April. Considering the staff shortage and other poll-related practical difficulties, whatever progress Supplyco was able to make in the kit distribution was a commendable one, claimed the statement. Chennithala on Friday said that ration shops had run out of Vishu kits as the government has lost interest in people after the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/distribution-of-vishu-kits-on-track-supplyco/articleshow/82128001.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Thackeray has sought help in the production and supply of oxygen, strengthening medical infrastructure, setting up of testing centres and speeding up of vaccinations. Thackeray has appealed to the corporate community to set up oxygen production plants using modern technology in their premises and to assist the state with its supply. Principal secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas said as Covid cases are on the rise in the state and the doubling rate has fallen to merely 40 days, and thus the requirement for oxygen too is expected to go up. “We are in dire need of oxygen as cases have surged. I tried contacting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on this issue yesterday but wasn’t able to speak to him as he is busy with the elections in West Bengal. But Maharashtra is getting assistance from the Centre,” said Thackeray.  The CM has also said businesses should use their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to take up public welfare schemes such as providing free meals to the workers in their premises and even to the needy in their vicinity. Thackeray further said a task force for better coordination, comprising industrialists, will be set up on the lines of the Covid task force. He said preparation to deal with the third wave of the infection should be undertaken by the industries so that if it hits, it will not harm the industry and the economy. “We don’t know how many waves this infection will have but we must prepare for the third wave by setting up all Covid-appropriate facilities,” said Thackeray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-reaches-out-to-industrialists-for-more-o2-medical-infra-tests-vax/articleshow/82122416.cms||---

On Saturday, while Dr Nagendra Mishra’s elder son, Dr Vinay Mishra, conducted the final rites, his widow was shifted from a Vasai-based private hospital to Dombivli’s R R Hospital. She is on oxygen support as her levels were below 90. A close relative of the Mishras told TOI, “Both father and son fell ill 10 days ago and got admitted to a private hospital in Titwala. However, it took four days for their corona test report to arrive and both turned serious by then,’’ he said. As they could not get an oxygen bed in the Kalyan-Dombivli region, Nagendra Mishra was admitted to Vedant hospital in Thane while his wife and Suraj were admitted to a private hospital in Vasai . “As Suraj’s condition worsened, he was shifted to a hospital in Goregaon. He was put on the ventilator but died on Thursday night. A few hours later, on Friday, his father died,” said the relative. The deaths shocked the Khadavali residents where Dr Nagendra Mishra was known as ‘gareebon ka doctor’ (doctor of the needy people). “Dr Nagendra was running a clinic here for over 20 years,”said Rajesh Tiwari, a local resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-father-son-doc-duo-from-kalyan-had-taken-1st-jab/articleshow/82122432.cms||Pradeep Gupta

The local body authorities, who deployed 222 workers for carrying out mosquito control and larvicide in the city, are preparing an action plan on the basis of the feedback from the residents. The workers are distributing pamphlets for creating awareness among the residents regarding the importance of reduction of larvae at the source. “We have also given a questionnaire to the workers so as to distribute it among the residents. They should collect back the filled in questionnaire. There are questions regarding the presence of various factors which act as breeding ground of mosquitoes. Once we get back the filled in questionnaire, we will be able to chalk out an action plan based on the requirements in each area,” an official with the corporation said. “We will seek experts’ advice while designing the action plan,” the official said. The corporation workers have started various mosquito control measures like spraying of larvicides and desilting of drains. “Unlike in the past, we could complete the desilting of drains in many divisions. We started such work much earlier compared to the previous years. We have deployed 222 workers for carrying out the mosquito control measures. It is for the first time such a large number of workers were deployed for the purpose. This has helped reduce the mosquito density in the city to a great extent,” mayor M Anilkumar said. “In the wake of the surge in Covid-19 cases, we are giving priority to prevent the spread of other communicable diseases as well. We conduct review meetings in this regard at regular intervals,” the mayor said. The corporation workers will soon start covering the vent pipes of toilets in the corporation limits using proper nets. “They will start covering the vent pipes of toilets using nets. This will help reduce the mosquito density,” said corporation health standing chairman T K Asharaf. “The measures we took have already started to yield results. Many of the residents have given their feedback that the mosquito density in their areas has come down significantly,” Asharaf said. The corporation workers have completed at least two rounds of spraying larvicide in each area. “In some divisions, our workers completed the spraying twice while they completed the work in certain areas four times,” an official with the health department of the corporation said. “The workers conduct spraying at the same locations twice within a gap of seven days. This will ensure the reduction of larvae in an effective manner,” the official said. The corporation authorities said that they would be increasing the measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 as well. More centres for vaccination will be rolled out for ensuring that one lakh people in the city are vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kochi-corp-to-prepare-action-plan-for-mosquito-control/articleshow/82121382.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

---||Delhi||After Haryana, raw water supply disruption from UP||NEW DELHI: At a time when the city is facing a surge in Covid cases and increased levels of ammonia and industrial pollution in Yamuna, water supply from Uttar Pradesh has also been affected. Delhi Jal Board reported that the level of water in Gangnahar or Upper Ganga Canal went down from 2.3 metres to 1.7 metres on Saturday morning, thereby affecting operations at Bhagirathi and Sonia Vihar water treatment plant (WTP) that provides the supply to parts of south and east Delhi. By Saturday afternoon, the operational capacity of both these plants was reported to be down and residents were advised to store and use water judicially. A senior DJB official said that the levels in the Upper Ganga Canal are fluctuating. The CEO of the board has contacted the irrigation and water resources department of Uttar Pradesh to restore the regular raw water supply to Delhi. DJB issued an advisory, stating that due to reduced availability of raw water from Upper Ganga Canal, the production and pumping from Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi WTPs has been affected by 25% to 30% and water supply in many areas is likely to be affected on Saturday evening. The supply may remain affected till the situation of raw water improves. However, a DJB official said that some improvement in water levels was observed by Saturday night. The areas likely to be impacted included east Delhi, northeast Delhi, parts of south Delhi and parts of New Delhi Municipal Council such as Gokulpuri, Sonia Vihar, Karawal Nagar, Babarpur, Tahirpur, Dilshad Garden, Nandnagari, Shahdara, Laxmi Nagar, Geeta Colony, Mayur Vihar, Kondli, Dallupura, Yamuna Vihar, Karawal Nagar, Jafrabad, Jhilmil, Mandawali, Laxmi Nagar, Shakarpur and Vivek Vihar. The list also includes places like Okhla, Badarpur, Sarita Vihar, Vasant Kunj, Mehrauli, Greater Kailash, South Extn., Lajpat Nagar, Lodhi Road, Kaka Nagar and adjoining areas. Meanwhile, the ongoing problems due to rise in ammonia levels in Yamuna continued with 3.00pm ammonia levels reported on Saturday, which is three times the maximum treatable limit. The Wazirabad pond level was reported to be 669.7 ft instead of normal levels of 674.5 ft. A senior DJB official said that as per the interstate agreements and MOUs, Uttar Pradesh is supposed to supply 470 cusecs of raw water supply, out of which 270 cusecs come from Tehri dam water sharing while 200 cusecs come due to bilateral purchase agreement with the neighbouring state. “25-30% of the normal supply is impacted, due to which around 50 MGD water supply can be impacted,” a senior DJB official explained. Delhi is a water-stressed state with most of its raw water supply soured through other neighbouring states. To supply 930-940 MGD water to city residents, DJB sources 612 MGD water from Haryana and 254 MGD from Uttar Pradesh, while rest comes from subsurface sources like tubewells and ranney wells.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-haryana-raw-water-supply-disruption-from-up/articleshow/82123081.cms||Paras Singh

Police personnel should help the people in need to reach hospitals or for emergency services, she said. While asking the police not to become a villain for the society, she said, “The current situation is an opportunity for the police to selflessly help the common people and change their perception about police.” She asked the police personnel at the grass-root level to abstain from using force against the citizens and instead try to under the person’s situation. At the same time, initiate legally permitted action including registration of offences against those violating Covid norms intentionally, she said. Police authorities said the director-general of police’s office earlier this week has issued orders asking the unit commanders across the state to ensure force is not used against citizens amid the restrictions. The ultimate intention of the state administration and the police is to enforce regulations aimed at breaking the Covid chain, said the SP  She told TOI, “The message, asking the police personnel to be public’s hero and not villain, was a part of a short briefing summing up what was expected from them across the hierarchy.” She said, “My force responded well in the past one year. My latest instructions are for ensuring to take it forward,” said Patil. Echoing her, other officials from Aurangabad rural said in these testing times, police showing their humanitarian side towards the citizens will not just earn their trust but also respect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/be-a-hero-not-villain-to-people-sp-tells-police/articleshow/82120872.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kochi||Kerala: Pooram flags up amid uncertainty||THRISSUR: Flags were hoisted for Thrissur Pooram with the usual fanfare on Saturday---a day the district reported 1,149 new Covid cases, the highest single-day count in the past couple of months. The test positivity rate has also shot up to 19.24% from 1.72% in the middle of March. Fresh uncertainties have clouded over this year’s Pooram scheduled on April 23 with the government making it clear that only those who have taken two vaccine doses can participate in the event. Those who have not taken the two vaccine doses have to produce Covid negative certificate, the order said. The order was issued by devaswom department principal secretary K R Jyothilal on Saturday and it said it was issued to clarify the decision taken at the online meeting convened by the chief secretary on April 13. The order has invited sharp reactions from the Pooram organisers who have figured that under such conditions it will be tough to conduct the Pooram. They said a decision will most likely be taken on Sunday. “Till this morning, the government officials said those who have got a single vaccine dose can take part in the event, and we made the arrangements accordingly. Now, they are coming up with a new condition. If they keep shifting their stance and impose non-implementable conditions, it would be difficult to conduct the Pooram,’’ said Satish Menon, president of Paramekkavu Devaswom. “Either they (the government officials) are fooling us or there is a systematic attempt to sabotage the Pooram. We will take a final decision after holding collective discussions,’’ he said. According to exhibition committee secretary V Ramkumar, who is from Thiruvambady Devaswom, the exhibition which is the main source of funds for Pooram, is likely to end up in losses if the government imposes strict regulation for the entry of people. District medical officer Dr K J Reena said she was against any mass gatherings that do not comply with Covid protocol. “The test positivity rate has shot up in the district drastically in the last couple of days. One new disturbing dimension of the outbreak this time is that more number of patients are being shifted to the hospitals under emergency, after they complain of breathlessness and other acute problems. The emergency shifting rate has gone up from 10% on April 1-2 to 33% on April 15-16,’’ Dr Reena said . The flag was hoisted at Thiruvambady temple at 11.45am, while at Paramekkavu temple, the ritual was held at 12.05pm. In another development, the forest officials have ordered that elephants will be allowed to be paraded only if the mahouts test negative for Covid 19. The district collector has imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 at Orumanayur, Venkitangu, Kuzhoor and Kadappuram panchayats as well as in the division 47 of Thrissur Corporation after these areas reported test positivity rate of over 40%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pooram-flags-up-amid-uncertainty/articleshow/82121387.cms||T Ramavarman

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Central BJP netas, MVA engage in war of words over oxygen, Remdesivir crunch||Mumbai: Shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir in the state led to a sharp exchange between the BJP’s Union leaders and the Maha Vikas Aghadi government on Saturday. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s office alleged the CM tried to reach Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir, but was told he was on a visit to poll-bound West Bengal. Later, minority affairs minister Nawab Malik accused Modi of being busy in elections while “people are dying”. This led to a quick response from the BJP. Asserting that the Centre is ensuring maximum oxygen production and currently producing 110% of capacity and diverting all available resources from industrial to medical use, railway and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal said it was saddening to see Thackeray’s “gimmicks” on oxygen. Goyal said Maharashtra is suffering at the hands of an inept and corrupt government and the Centre is doing its best. “People of Maharashtra are following ‘Majha Kutumb, Majhi Javabadari’ dutifully. It is time the CM (chief minister) also follows his duties in the spirit of ‘Majha Rajya, Majhi Javabadari’,” Goyal said. The minister said Maharashtra has so far received the highest quantity of oxygen. “The Centre is in daily touch with state governments to assess their needs and help them in the best possible manner.” Goyal said, “Just yesterday, PM in his review told that the Centre and the states should work with synergy in this crisis... He needs to stop his (Thackeray) daily dose of shameless politics and take responsibility.” Union minister Mansukh Mandaviya said Malik’s claims are full of half-truths and lies. “He is unaware of the ground situation. GoI has been in active contact with officers of GoM and is assisting with the supply of Remdesivir in every manner,” he said. Malik had alleged Remdesivir units are seeking permission to sell medicines meant for export but the central government is denying this. “I request you (Malik) to share the list of these 16 companies, availability of stock and WHO-GMP with them. Our government is committed to do everything to help our people,” Mandaviya said. Opposition leader in the legislative council Pravin Darekar said the Maharashtra government must stop playing politics and apologise for trying to mislead the people. BJP state president Chandrakant Patil said Malik has been making false allegations against the Centre as his son-in-law was arrested by Narcotics Control Bureau in a drugs case. Meanwhile, Patil appealed to state finance minister Ajit Pawar to allow Rs 1 crore of every MLA’s area development fund to set up an oxygen plant in every hospital. He asked Pawar to reserve Rs 2 crore of MLA funds for Covid prevention, preparedness and treatment. Patil said Pawar accepted his request.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-central-bjp-netas-mva-engage-in-war-of-words-over-oxygen-remdesivir-crunch/articleshow/82122485.cms||---

A few days ago, TOI had reported how Gadkari was making efforts to get a Remdesivir manufacturing licence for the plant owned by Mahendra Kshisagar. The Wardha MIDC-based company is expected to begin production within a week. “We’re also trying to get about 10,000 state-of-the-art equipment that produce 7.5-10 litres of oxygen per minute. Industrialist Sajjan Jindal has assured us that he would provide two tankers for storing 20 tonnes of oxygen. We can then bring 40 tonnes of the gas daily from the Bhilai plant. “Even Nitin Khara of Mumbai Dolby Plant would be providing 1,000 empty oxygen cylinders which could be filled up from the Bhilai plant and used in hospitals,” said Gadkari. “We would be requesting all hospitals to set up oxygen-producing plants to end the dependency. I’m happy to announce that many organisations are coming forward to provide donations to fight the pandemic. While Lloyd has assured to provide Rs 5 crore, transporter Pyare Khan and Ankur Seeds have given Rs 50 lakh each. Even my son Nikhil had handed over Rs 50 lakh on behalf of the Manas Group. I call on the citizens to help us by directly paying to the companies providing us the necessary equipment to fight the pandemic. They will get all the information from my office,” added Gadkari. During a virtual interaction with the media along with mayor Dayashankar Tiwari and MLC Pravin Datke, the minister said that US drug manufacturer Gilead, which has a patent for producing Remdesvir, has allowed seven firms, including Genetek Life Sciences, to manufacture it. The licence would be valid from April 17, 2021, to April 16, 2026. The minister also declared that he received 5,000 ventilators as donation which would be distributed to various government and private hospitals in all Vidarbha districts. Gadkari had convinced companies from Andhra Pradesh Med Tech Zone (AMTZ) to supply 2,000 oxygen concentrators under the corporate social responsibility (CSR) quota for the city. He also spoke with Spice Health owner Avani Singh, who assured to send 125 ventilators for the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadkari-wardha-co-to-make-40k-remdesvir-vials-per-day/articleshow/82121996.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kolkata||I am Madan Mitra: TMC leader sets out to ‘recapture’ Kamarhati||KAMARHATI/DAKSHINESWAR: I am Madan Mitra, thundered the Trinamool’s maverick politician at a booth in Ariadaha Ramanand Charity Vidyalaya. Seconds earlier, the CAPF personnel had stopped the Kamarhati Trinamool candidate, asking for his identity. The “captain, who was missing in action in 2016” and lost the seat in the last assembly election, set out early on Saturday to “recapture” Kamarhati again. Mitra’s portrayal of being a “devout Hindu”—he visited as many temples as polling booths—might have raised eyebrows but the seasoned politician earned brownie points as he drove around the constituency in his red SUV convertible in the scorching heat. As he drove into Saraswati Press government quarters, trailed by security vehicles and media cars, people could be heard discussing: “A leader should be like him.” But driving around in the sun for almost six hours took its toll: once he returned to his office at Rathtala, he fell ill. He was administered oxygen and advised rest. Family said he might be hospitalized if need be. For Mitra, the day had begun with a dip in the Hooghly and a prayer at Dakshineswar temple. After casting his vote at the Hiralal College booth, he headed for booths, concentrating on the Ariadaha-Belgharia belt, where Trinamool has been at a disadvantage. “Kamarhati is witnessing good polling, I do not need to go there,” he said. The first booth he visited was the Ariadaha school. “The CAPF not only stopped me but also checked my pocket. I showed them I had Durga-Kali photos in my pocket. This is not like BJP’s Jai Sri Ram, where a gas cylinder costs Rs 900. I am a devout Hindu. They tried to snatch the photos from me. That is when I said I am Madan Mitra, a candidate whom Kamarhati knows,” Mitra said. His next stop was Kalibari Debalaya at Jatindas Nagar in Belgharia. He spent 15 minutes there before returning to his poll routine. “Everyone was speaking about a violent poll at Kamarhati. BJP goons tried bombing at Ward 29 early in the morning. But voters have given a fitting reply,” he told TOI. At Nandanagar High School and Akshay Smriti Vidyalaya booths at Ariadaha, Mitra apparently lost his cool as reports of “slow and low polling” trickled in. “The EVMs areworking slowly. Central forces are not letting me enter the booths. Some voters said they were yet to vote despite waiting in the queue from 9.30am till 12.30pm. But the ball has started rolling. I will win,” said Mitra. In evening BJP candidate Anindya Banerjee, aka Raju, alleged Trinamool goons attacked his car on Belgharia Bridge. He alleged Mitra and his men planned the attack around 4.30pm, realizing he was losing the elections. “Two bikers threw two bricks at my car and smashed the windscreen. They are outsiders, brought by Mitra. They even used bombs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/i-am-madan-mitra-tmc-leader-sets-out-to-recapture-kamarhati/articleshow/82122010.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kochi||Kerala: Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals raises questions over returning ‘Kuvi’ to relatives||IDUKKI: A dog that was found wandering among the rubbles of the Pettimudy landslide site and later adopted by the Idukki police squad was returned to its family on Friday. The dog, named Kuvi, had grabbed headlines after it waited for days and helped rescuers recover the body of Dhanushka, a two-year-old girl, nearly four kilometres away from the disaster-hit area. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) have raised questions over the decision to handover the dog to its family as it was reported that it was inducted into the dog squad. Sources said Kuvi which has been undergoing training for the past eight months had successfully completed the first phase of “heel walk”. According to experts, though local dogs need more time to complete their training, they are more capable of learning to react to particular commands and cues. In fact, Uttarakhand and Tamil Nadu police have adopted several local dogs impressed by their efficiency in smelling and tracking explosive objects. Munnar deputy SP R Suresh said Kuvi was returned as Dhanushka’s family had submitted an application to get it back. “They submitted a plea before state DGP to get back their dog. On Friday, we handed it over to Dhanushka’s grandmother Palaniyamma,” he said. Vice president of Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), Idukki district, R Mohan said as per the rules the police should have informed SPCA before handing over Kuvi. “We don't know the real reasons behind the sudden decision,” he said. He said he will submit a report on Sunday. Kerala state animal welfare board member M N Jayachandran too indicated there was something “suspicious” about the dog squad’s decision. “The Pettmudy landslide occurred on August 7 last year. For nine months the family members did not inquire about the dog. If needed, we will move legally do our bit so that it will not end up as a stray,” he said. A top revenue official said before adopting or handing the dog to the family the police did not inform the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/spca-raises-questions-over-returning-kuvi-to-relatives/articleshow/82121407.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Speaking to mediapersons at Mapusa, Tanavade said the government would impose strict restrictions within the next 2 days to contain pandemic spread. “Lockdown is not the solution. The matter was discussed in a meeting with the CM on stricter norms. There should be a control on programmes being organized in the state and checking those coming from outside,” he said. When asked about many Maharashtra-registered vehicles lining up at the border to enter Goa and whether compulsory RT-PCR tests should be conducted at borders and airport, Tanavade said the decision has to be taken by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/make-covid-ve-cert-a-must-for-visitors-bjp/articleshow/82122447.cms||---

With this development, police were finally able to confirm that the man was alive. Senior officers of city police on Saturday said that he would be nabbed within days. “It was always our theory that he was alive. Now, we have conclusive evidence. He has been spotted in Mookambika and there is evidence that he stayed at a hotel there. We are sure that in the next couple of days he will be caught,” said Nagaraju Chakilam, city police commissioner. City police recovered CCTV footage of Mohan from the hotel where he stayed and from other areas in the temple town. According to sources, the missing person has been staying at the hotel for nearly a week. “The man was supposed to check-out from the hotel where he was staying on Friday. He had promised to pay via card but he managed to escape without paying,” said the source. The suspicious disappearance of their guest made the hotel staff suspicious, leading to the police getting alerted about the person. Officials said that they recovered the Aadhaar card copy given to the hotel authorities by Mohan. The mobile number which he presented at the hotel was found to be not in use. It was the same number which the police tried to track after his disappearance. Police have deployed teams in cities near Mookambika too. Police have contacted entry and exit points, including railway stations and airports, to prevent him from escaping. The mystery behind the girl’s death had deepend when police found CCTV visuals of Mohan crossing the Walayar checkpost in the early hours of March 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vaiga-death-sanu-mohan-spotted-in-mookambika/articleshow/82121422.cms||---

About five to seven tonnes of hazardous biomedical waste (as part of treatment given to Covid-19 patients and vaccination drive) is being generated at the Cantonment’s own dispensaries, Bolarum General Hospital and state government’s upper primary health centres. As its disposal was becoming a headache, the SCB passed a resolution at its board meeting on Saturday to send the waste to Ramky’s advanced collection and transportation station set-up, at Sanjeevaiah Park. This is the first board meeting after the SCB elected body varied in February. The Board meeting was chaired by president cantonment board, Brigadier, Abhijit Chandra. “At the board meeting, we discussed about the bio-waste and decided to transfer it to Ramky’s transfer station,” SCB chief executive officer B Ajith Reddy told TOI. The process of transfer of biomedical waste would start soon, the CEO added. “Also, various public works, sanction of building plans and sub-division of plots and tender proceedings, general land records (GLR) mutations were considered and approved,” the SCB CEO said in a statement.

The MRV has a staff of 23 people, including a doctor and paramedical staffers besides the technical workforce. It is a three-coach train, which is self-propelled and can move in both directions. Rajesh Shinde, the public relations officer of SCR’s Nanded division, said MRV is stationed at Purna junction, which is a centralised railway station for the division. “The MRV is like a mini-hospital and all medical facilities and infrastructure includes a small operating theatre. The Central Railway authorities carry out a routine inspection of MRV available with every zone. The outcome of such inspections formed the basis for MRV for Nanded division getting the best maintained facility award,” he said. The MRV for the Nanded division was pressed into action during a train mishap near Jalna that witnessed the death of migrant workers last year during Covid related lockdown. “The MRV is a part of the disaster management mechanism of the railway staff. It is always prepared to deal with any incident,” Shinde said, adding that the Nanded division jointly shared the best maintained MRV award with Vijaywada division.

---||Kochi||In 2020-21, kerala’s revenue fell short by over Rs 22,000 crore||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Covid attack during the financial year 2020-21, which had affected all the sectors, had its serious impact on the state finances as well. The state’s total revenue receipts, that was projected to become Rs 1,14,635.90 crore in the budget estimates for 2020-21, ended up at Rs 92,456.11 crore on March 31, which means that the state fell short by Rs 22,179.79 crore. However, a committee of financial experts led by former chief secretary K M Abraham, that studied the impact of Covid-19 on state finances, had projected a grimmer picture, and had estimated that the state’s revenue receipts would fall short by Rs 33,456 crore. When compared to this projection, the state managed to end the year on a better note. As per the budget estimates, the share of revenue from state’s own tax revenue (SOTR) was projected as Rs 67,420.01 crore, while the actual earnings were Rs 46,032.88 crore, registering a shortfall of Rs 21,387.13 crore. The state’s own tax revenue includes income from state GST, tax on agricultural income, land revenue, stamp and registration, other taxes on property other than agriculture, state excise, sales tax and VAT, taxes on vehicles, taxes on goods and passengers, taxes and duties on electricity and other taxes and duties. The revenue receipts, that was on an all-time low in the first two months of the previous financial year (Rs 374.98 crore in April 2020 and 1,358.88 crore in May), then picked up steadily, crossing Rs 5,000 crore each in December, January, February and March, taking the total revenue receipts to Rs 46,032.88 crore. Other than SOTR, the total revenue receipts also include the state’s own non-tax revenue, share of central taxes and grant-in-aid. The expert committee appointed by the government had given the projection on the basis of the studies of Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT) that the shortfall for 2020-21 would be much higher. The committee had estimated that the revenue receipts would be Rs 81,181 crore, marking a shortfall of Rs 33,456 crore. The committee had predicted a major shortfall in the state GST revenue. This revenue, estimated as Rs 32,388.11 crore in budget estimates, ended up at Rs 16,602.02 crore on March 31. This shortfall of 51.25% was due to the steep drop in movement of goods into the state due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, experts in the finance department said that the current trend of revenue growth, especially in the last four months, is a positive sign for the state’s economy. “The GST numbers are showing an increasing trend. It is not a grim picture that we can foresee for the ongoing year, unless the current financial year is not hit by another wave of pandemic worse than the previous year,” a senior finance department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/in-2020-21-states-revenue-fell-short-by-over-rs-22000cr/articleshow/82121451.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Chandigarh||People feel betrayed on issues of sacrilege, drugs: Navjot Sidhu||Patiala: Former Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday said the Congress government was voted to power in Punjab on the two issues of sacrilege and drugs, but these were yet to be fulfilled and people were now feeling betrayed. In a veiled attack on his own party’s government, Sidhu said, “In 2017, there was a change of government (in Punjab) on two key issues. One was justice for sacrilege incidents and the other was taking to task those selling drugs to state’s youth. People of Punjab are still waiting for justice in the sacrilege case.” “An STF was constituted by bringing an honest officer from outside and crores of money spent. The report, along with evidence and names of the accused, was submitted to the high court. When people questioned the delay, the courts asked the state government to act on the report. But the government said it didn’t read the report. Lakhs of families lost their sons. Doesn’t the issue hold that much importance that you read the report and act on it,” he said. Sidhu added, “Will anyone accept this that the report has not been read when the AG has forwarded it to the state government and the latter is still sitting on it. Why? I want to ask. That is why I say make it public, let the facts come out before people…Then, the officer was changed; did he get rewarded?” “If you don’t want to read the STF report, you should listen to what (Jagdish) Bhola had said. He named the bigwigs. If not that, go by the statement of Bittu Aulakh as to who was behind it. Why don’t you want to listen to the truth or see the report? That is why you are losing people’s faith,” he said. On the issue of sacrilege, Sidhu said, “The government set up an inquiry commission headed by Justice Ranjit Singh (retd). It gave prima facie evidence after the probe. It named the accused and made a case for cognisable offence for the loss of two lives. A special session of the legislative assembly was convened and the report tabled... everyone saw what the MLAs said, taking names of policemen. A resolution was passed to take action... It is a state subject and the Punjab government is the probing agency.” FIR AGAINST UNKNOWN PEOPLE “Can anyone explain why the FIR was registered against unknown people. Policemen involved in the firing, those who ordered it, even the kids of Punjab know this. In the legislative assembly, I exposed the chain of command – the conversation between the then DGP and the then CM. Was there any doubt left? But no politician has been named in the chargesheet? Why is the decision-taker’s name not there? When an FIR is against unidentified people, it shields the accused and they can evade arrest,” the former minister said. “What was the intent that proper foundation was not given to the case? The FIR is the foundation. My fight is with the system; there is nothing personal. It shows what is your intent. What will any lawyer do in such a scenario? The advocate general did not appear in the case. In 2015 too, the FIR was against unidentified people,” he said. SIT MEANS ‘SIT QUIETLY’ Sidhu added, “Why do I want reports of SIT and STF to be made public? That is because it brings out the intent. People have to decide. I will comment on SIT only when I get to see the report. I don’t judge a book by its cover. So many SITs have been formed in Punjab, what came of them? In Punjab, SIT means ‘SIT quietly’.” POLITICAL DECISION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT Asked if he will take up the matter with the chief minister, Navjot Singh Sidhu said it was only after the details of the probe report come out that the issue could be discussed. He said his decision had nothing to do with the issue of sacrilege and drugs. NO COMMENTS ON KUNWAR’S CLAIMS Reacting to a reported claim by Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who headed the SIT on sacrilege and police firing cases, that he had approached the Congress MLA in 2019, Navjot Singh Sidhu refused to comment. “He has the right to make any claims,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/people-feel-betrayed-on-issues-of-sacrilege-drugs-navjot-sidhu/articleshow/82117305.cms||Vibhor Mohan

Residents allege that lakhs of rupees spent on these public toilets have gone down the drain as a majority of them are constructed around open garbage bins and are damaged. In Amberpet, a public toilet opposite the GHMC ground, which was inaugurated six months ago, was kept locked. Shaik Salauddin, a resident of Amberpet, said: “They constructed this toilet here but it is of no use since it is always locked. When we asked the officials during one of their inspections, we were told that they would open it after laying a drainage line.” The GHMC built 3,000 public toilets so far and opened them amid much fanfare claiming that Hyderabad is the only city in the country having so many toilets under the Swachh Hyderabad project. However, when TOI visited these public toilets in various parts of the city, they were strewn with garbage and emitting a foul smell. In many areas, especially in Old City, sanitary equipment, including doors, were either stolen or broken. A few days ago, municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao lashed out at municipal officials for tarnishing the image of the city by leaving the public toilets to the mercy of miscreants. In Moghalpura area, a public toilet which was installed more than a year ago was found with broken doors and garbage strewn around it. “We have made several complaints to the authorities on ‘My GHMC’ app as well as on Twitter about the deplorable condition of public toilets. No action has been taken till now. Neither do they clear the garbage or fix the broken equipment. At least four other public toilets in the surrounding areas are in a similar condition,” said Mohammed Ahmed, a resident of Shalibanda. Senior officials, however, squarely blame miscreants for vandalising the equipment and also throwing and breaking beer bottles inside the toilets. “This has been happening despite our maintenance agencies cleaning and repairing the toilets several times. We have now decided to track these people through CCTVs and file cases. As far as garbage mounds around the public toilets is concerned, we are getting them cleaned,” said Samrat Ashok, GHMC zonal commissioner (south zone).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nothing-swachh-about-city-public-toilets-residents-cry-foul/articleshow/82122452.cms||Moulika.KV

Demand for immunity-boosting fruits such as sweet lime, oranges, lemon, grapes, and kiwifruit has pushed up retail prices by 50-100%. Vendors say that the quantity of fruits being bought, especially of the citrus family, is increasing with every bill. Jignesh Patel, a fruit and vegetable dealer in Vejalpur, said: “Over the past month or so, demand for all kinds of fruits has gone up significantly.” Patel added: “There has been a surge in sales of oranges, sweet lime, kiwi, grape, and banana.” He said citrus fruits are drawing long lines of buyers. “People who are health-conscious and are trying to build immunity often consume these fruits,” he said. The price of sweet lime has shot up from Rs 100 per kg to Rs 180 per kg over the past 25 days, from March 25 to April 17. The price of oranges has gone up from Rs 85 per kg to Rs 170 per kg. The price of a box of kiwis containing 12 fruits has grown 1.5x, from Rs 80 to Rs 120. Grape prices have remained stable in the Rs 120-140 per kg range. Sources in the APMC said that the demand for these fruits surged when the season was fading; so prices in the wholesale market have soared too. “Even after a spike in prices, people continue to buy fruits in huge quantities,” said a fruit shop owner in Vastrapur. “Usually after mangoes are available, the demand for other fruits reduces significantly. However, this time, besides mangoes people are picking up other fruits, especially citrus fruits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vitamin-c-hunt-strengthens-prices-of-citrus-fruits/articleshow/82122026.cms||---

The matter was brought to the notice of the project officer, Integrated Tribal Development Project, Dahanu, under whose jurisdiction the school falls.  The officer, Ashima Mittal, said that as government servants, both Dandekar and Sadhde should have been responsible and followed the restrictions.

The outside firms, however, have seized the already well-established dairy sector in the state,” he said.Kedar, who visited different dairy-related establishments in Aurangabad city and its outskirts, said all public representatives need to introspect and act together to free the dairy sector from clutches of outside firms. In his formal address, the minister tried to assure the milk producers that the state government was behind them during the crisis arising out of Covid-19. “The growth of farmers and those having allied professions is the focus area of the government. The government stood with them last year during the first wave of Covid-19 by promoting milk-collection through dairies operating on principles of cooperative sector. Such concerted measures would be taken this year too as per need,” Kedar said. The minister during his official tour visited the dairy and other production facilities of Aurangabad District Cooperative Milk Society at Gandheli and reached out to a few owners of poultry and animal husbandry firms besides reviewing progress of new sports stadium coming up at Golwadi area of the city in his capacity as sports minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/outside-firms-taking-over-dairy-market-in-maha-kedar/articleshow/82120897.cms||---
---||Chennai||Ignorance of law, lack of case info extend convicts’ jail stay||Chennai: After spending 12 years behind the bars without much legal aid, 49 year-old life convict Ram (name changed) took up the case on his own and approached the Supreme Court. Now, he was out on bail and trying to win back his freedom. As on April 15, there were 15,796 prisoners in Tamil Nadu. Of these, 4,311 and 8,683 were convicted and remanded prisoners. “Persons like me are rare. Many prisoners are illiterate and lack knowledge about their legal rights and the available facilities in the existing judicial and prison system,” said Ram, a native of Chennai, who was incarcerated from 2005 to 2018 Puzhal-I central prison in connection with a murder case. Several hundreds of prisoners are still in the dark about their case status as they lack awareness about their legal rights or assistance from the system. “Unaware that they have to undergo their sentence concurrently, many prisoners remain in prison for more number of years,” said a probation officer. They can do away with this by approaching court to get direction as per provision of 428 of CrPC (period of detention undergone by the accused to be set off against the sentence). But the ignorance on the part of the prisoners and lack of support from prison welfare officers leave several inmates in jails beyond stipulated imprisonment periods. The department has trained educated convicts as paralegal volunteers to help their fellow convicts, who themselves were illiterates. However, it is not of much use. “It is difficult to get the case kattu (case brief) from advocates, making it difficult for many prisoners to use the free legal service extended by the legal service authorities,” said an ex-convict, who preferred anonymity. He was one among the 1,600-odd prisoners who had benefited from Tamil Nadu government’s premature release scheme a few years ago. The daughter of a life convict said her father was imprisoned long beyond the stipulated period after being convicted in a murder case. Though he was eligible to be released under premature release scheme, charges under Arms Act denied him the freedom. He continues to languish in Vellore Central Prison for Men. Activists seek facilities such as Kiosks where case details and the current status of the cases could be accessed. All prisons mus have the facility to help the inmates to have up to date details of their cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ignorance-of-law-lack-of-case-info-extend-convicts-jail-stay/articleshow/82121463.cms||Shanmughasundaram J

The striking operators, however, said their agitation would continue, and called out the government for denying them permission but allowing political meetings across the state. Even after the denial, they spread around Azad Maidan. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat met the taxi operators to extend his support to the agitation. Kamat later led the delegation to the deputy collector and requested the official to grant permission for the strike by following all protocols. “I told the deputy collector to accept their request and allow 400 people to continue the strike at Azad Maidan by maintaining social distancing,” Kamat said. “I have told them not to take away their fundamental right to protest.” He said that if the government can allow gatherings near casinos, it must allow Goan taxi operators to protest. The former CM also requested the women and children participating in the strike not to, given the prevailing Covid condition. Kamat told the protesting taxi operators to return home for the safety of themselves and their families. He said Congress will resolve the issue on priority when it forms the government “within a few months”. Taxi leader Sunil Naik, too, said that they have decided that they would not bring children to Azad Maiden. “Only a few women will participate in the strike,” he said. Over the past ten days, the taxi operators have been demanding the scrapping of GoaMiles, the state-run app-based taxi service. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho had had invited them for talks on Tuesday, but declined their request for live streaming of the meeting. CM Pramod Sawant has also urged the striking operators to end the strike and talk to the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-denies-taximen-nod-to-protest-at-azad-maidan/articleshow/82122459.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Parno shakes off first-timer jitters & takes the fight to booths, TMC claims she broke law||Kolkata: Even forty minutes after polling started on Saturday, the process reportedly did not take off at the booth in Brahmananda Keshab Chandra College in Baranagar constituency. The anxiety of being a first-time contender notwithstanding, BJP’s Parno Mittra questioned polling officers at the booth why voting had not yet started there. “Voters have queued up but voting is yet to start,” she said. Six hours later, Mittra was seen touring her constituency, visiting almost 20 booths on Gopal Lal Tagore Road, Tobin Road and Dunlop, now looking more settled. The one-month-long campaign has taught Mittra—she has vowed to put up a tough fight against Trinamool minister and MLA Tapas Roy—to be vigilant on polling day. Around 1.30pm, as she headed for a booth at Alambazar, “go back” slogan from alleged Trinamool supporters rent the air. Almost immediately, she told the central force at the booth to ensure “trouble-makers were thrown out”. As the personnel called up QRT and police for a back-up, 25-30 men, shouting anti-BJP slogans, surrounded her. The CAPF and police resorted to lathicharge, following which, Trinamool claimed, at least four of their workers were injured. By evening, Mittra had shaken off her first-timer jitters. She chased away “fake voters”, reached out to a BJP worker, who was allegedly assaulted at a party booth, and even dispersed a crowd that had assembled in an alleged rigging bid. “I respect Tapasda but look at what his men are up to. They mocked me, tried to disrupt my meetings and attacked my convoy. They surrounded my car today and shouted slogans. They entered my worker’s home, attacked him and ransacked the place. If the minister is so sure of his hattrick, what was the need of all this?” said Mittra. Tapas Roy called most of Mittra’s allegations “frivolous and unsustainable”. “She was travelling with multiple cars and people. She created a ruckus at Alambazar and four of our workers were injured. Can she substantiate even one complaint? It was her party’s criminals, hired from outside, who wielded choppers and injured two of our party workers at Ward 4. Have I raised any complaint I can’t substantiate?” said Roy. Trinamool leaders alleged Mittra broke laws. “She moved around in over a dozen cars, made false accusations, leading to injuries, and clicked selfies with voters inside booths. But we are happy polling passed off peacefully,” said ex-vice-chairman of Baranagar Municipality Jayanta Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/parno-shakes-off-first-timer-jitters-takes-the-fight-to-booths-tmc-claims-she-broke-law/articleshow/82122021.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Police on Saturday registered a case of abduction and launched an investigation to locate the boy and his father. Police said Ali married Shahana Begum and the couple were blessed with the boy recently. On Thursday, Ali took his son out by informing Begum that he would return soon.

---||Goa||Goa: ‘Migrant staff will be stranded if lockdown is reimposed’||CALANGUTE: With the spike in Covid-19 infections across the country, and with many states like Maharashtra imposing limited lockdowns and other restrictions, seasonal beach shack owners and other tourism stakeholders in Goa who rely on migrant workers are in a fix. They are hoping that a total lockdown like the one imposed last year will not be repeated in Goa this year, which they say leads to a troublesome situation as their workers get stuck in difficult conditions. “Nobody wants to go through the trauma of last year’s sudden lockdown when workers were unable to return to their home states,” said John Lobo, general secretary of the Shack Owners’ Welfare Society (SOWS). “If the Covid situation becomes worse, we’re at least hoping there won’t be another lockdown because then it will become a problem for the workers to return home,” Lobo said. Seby D’Souza, a shack owner from Candolim, said he has already slashed his staff strength because he does not want to be in the same situation as last year. “My workers are from Karnataka. I’ve already told them to go home because tourist arrivals have already dropped by 80%. If the situation improves in May, I will tell them to return. Karnataka is not far away,” he said. Lobo added, “It’s almost the end of the season anyway and business is completely down.” “There’s practically no business. My workers, who are mostly from Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal and Nepal have already booked their railway tickets for next month end, which is their usual time to go back. Railway tickets have to be booked well in advance or else you don’t get them. So they’re going to be here till then. We’re hoping business picks up again next month because with the current turnover, it’s going to be hard to pay their salaries,” he said. Many seasonal workers from neighbouring states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat etc have already returned to their homes, according to Calangute panchayat member and guest-house owner Sudesh Mayenkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/migrant-staff-will-be-stranded-if-lockdown-is-reimposed/articleshow/82122455.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Child’s death still a mystery||KOCHI: Even as the cops are closing in on Sanu Mohan, the mystery behind the death of his daughter, Vaiga (13) as per police records, is far from over. Police have stumbled on two crucial facts that could prove vital in cracking the mystery. Police officers said that they suspect the child was in a semi-conscious state when she came in contact with the water, increasing the possibility of the death becoming a murder. Also, cops now believe that there was no third party involved in the whole incident, making Mohan’s disappearance all the more suspicious. “The girl died due to drowning. However, we think that when she was put in water, she was alive. Possibly, in a semi-conscious state. We suspect that ultimately it could turn out be a murder but we don’t want to speculate and conclude prematurely. We want to get him in hand before confirming our theory,” said a well-placed source. Police sources, however, refused to divulge their theory on the motive for murder. “We have a doubt on one thing related to why she was in a semi-conscious state as well. It would be right to reveal that only after confirming it,” said the source. The officer added that the forensic examination is yet to be done. “We are awaiting the forensic results. Our teams are in Mookambika and once he is in our net then the whole mystery would be over,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/childs-death-still-a-mystery/articleshow/82121481.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Cong leaders discuss urgency for damage control on sacrilege issue||Chandigarh: The Punjab Congress is now feeling the political heat over the sacrilege issue and a group of ministers discussed the urgency for prompt steps at damage control to tide over the negative public perception ahead of the next elections. In addition, a detailed strategy will be worked out after the detailed court order on quashing of the probe report on the Kotkapura case is available. This was reportedly conveyed to the chief minister Amarinder Singh when he met with some cabinet ministers, apart from Congress state president Sunil Jakhar, to discuss the matter. The focus remained on the political implications of the ‘emotive’ issue that had earlier put the Akalis in the spot. Concern was also expressed at how the issue has led to voices of dissent in the Congress too as party leaders believe that more decisive steps should have been taken, given the tall promises the party had made, said sources. “There is an urgent need for damage control. The party has been on the front foot so far on this issue and suddenly the opposition seems to be turning the heat against us. This is a widespread sentiment among the party rank and file,” said a party leader. Apart from former cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu too has underlined how the issue could harm the party’s electoral prospects in 2022. Meanwhile, a section of the Congress leaders like Partap Singh Bajwa, have also questioned the role of the office of the advocate general in taking the sacrilege issue to its logical conclusion. Jakhar also suggested that the probe report should be made public “if there was no legal hurdle” in doing that. A section of party leaders also want that efforts should continue to prevail upon SIT officer IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh to continue in service as his exit could affect the morale of the party workers. In the past as well, a section of ministers has been flagging the issue of action in sacrilege cases as one that will play out in the next assembly elections. Next legal step after detailed order In terms of the next legal step following the quashing of the probe report in the Kotkapura firing case, it was pointed out that the next step will be discussed only after the detailed order was available. “The need to wriggle out of the crisis has been highlighted but the exact roadmap will be worked out only after the detailed order is available. As if now, there is little clarity on why the probe report was quashed,” said a party leader. It has already been announced by the chief minister that the state will move the Supreme Court against the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-leaders-discuss-urgency-for-damage-control-on-sacrilege-issue/articleshow/82117347.cms||---

It is among the top three districts in terms of active cases. According to the state health department bulletin, there were 3,590 active cases in the district. Even Gaya DM Abhishek Singh has tested positive for the virus and isolated himself at his official residence. At least 11 police personnel posted at the Civil Lines police station here have also tested positive for Covid. In view of rapid increase in coronavirus cases, a control room has been set up at Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital (ANMMCH). Magistrates have been deputed there in three shifts to monitor the treatment being given to the Covid patients at the hospitals. The campus of Gaya museum has been made isolation or Covid care centre. Among the other south Bihar districts, Munger reported 255 new cases, followed by Aurangabad (215), Jehanabad (186), Bhojpur (138), Nawada (115), Nalanda (109), Jamui (103), Arwal (94) and Kaimur (25). Meanwhile, Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited (BSPHCL)’s chief managing director (CMD) Sanjeev Hans has issued an order to ensure uninterrupted power supply to all the hospitals and vaccine storage centres in south Bihar districts, including Gaya, Jehanabad, Aurangabad, Nawada, Arwal, Nalanda, Buxar, Rohtas, Kaimur, Jamui and others. BSPHCL senior protocol officer Khwaja Jamal said as per the order issued by the CMD, no routine maintenance work has to be carried out in the areas that would affect power supply in hospitals and the isolation centres. Only need based emergency maintenance work to ensure uninterrupted power supply would be done until the situation improves, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/is-gaya-emerging-as-covid-hotspot/articleshow/82122030.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Shortage hits vax drive in rural areas of Aurangabad district||Aurangabad: The daily vaccination against Covid-19 has reduced drastically in rural areas of Aurangabad district with shortage of doses being cited as a reason behind lean phase of immunization drive. The dearth of doses is being felt amid grim background of Aurangabad district witnessing more number of fresh Covid cases in rural areas than municipal limits.Aurangabad Zilla Parishad CEO Dr Mangesh Gondawale on Saturday said the daily vaccination in rural areas which was taking place in the range of 10,000 to 12,000 has reduced to around 1,500 to 1,700 doses for last a few days. “The vaccine shortage has affected the immunization drive against Covid-19. As urban areas were emerging as Covid hotspots as per earlier trends, these pockets are getting more supply of vaccine doses as compared to rural areas,” he said.Stating that over 7,200 vaccine doses are still available to continue the immunization drive with reduced intensity, the CEO said that fresh stock of vaccine was expected shortly.As per official data, over 1.57 lakh beneficiaries from nine talukas of Aurangabad district have received the first dose of vaccine, whereas another 9,921 have taken the second dose. The rural areas, which have around 8.5 lakh target beneficiaries, have achieved around 21% vaccination so far. As regards to municipal limits of Aurangabad, over 1.64 lakh beneficiaries have been vaccinated, which is nearly 36% of the total vaccination target. On rural areas taking over municipal limits of Aurangabad, Gondawale said combined arrival of test reports for two days reflect in such trend. “No doubt, rural areas are also witnessing a surge in fresh cases of Covid-19. Besides technical issues in getting lab reports, increased testing is also responsible for more detection of Covid-19 cases,” he said. Aurangabad on Friday reported 1,388 fresh cases of Covid-19, which included 750 cases from rural areas while 638 cases from municipal limits. The district now has 15,876 active cases of Covid-19, show official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/shortage-hits-vax-drive-in-rural-areas-of-aurangabad-district/articleshow/82120907.cms||Prasad Joshi

Within moments, he was replaced by another officer. Mimi has been at her home at Panda Para, Jalpaiguri, for a week. On Saturday, as she entered the booth to vote, the polling official tried to click a selfie with her. She warded him off and cast her vote. But as she came out on the verandah, the officer clicked a few selfies with her. BJP lodged a complaint and he was replaced. “We removed him.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Minor kills mother’s lover to take revenge||HYDERABAD: In a murder case that took a team of Chikadpally police to Punjab, cops have nabbed a minor boy, along with two others, for allegedly killing his mother’s paramour — 30-year-old Satnaam Singh. The accused trio, arrested from Tarn Taran district (Punjab), have been brought to Hyderabad for further interrogation. Satnaam was found dead with his throat slit on March 31. Cops suspect that the 16-year-old committed the crime along with his two accomplices — father, Sarwan Singh, and Arshdeep Singh — to avenge a 10-year-old grudge that he held against his mother, Baljeet Kaur, for allegedly eloping with Satnaam. “Through their confession, we came to know that Baljeet had left the family and joined Satnaam to work at his hotel. Later they got into a relationship and became inaccessible to Sarwan’s family. The couple’s son was then six-years-old. Since then the boy has been humiliated by various people in his home in Punjab. As a result, he bore grudge against his missing mother and Satnaam,’’ said Chikadpally additional inspector, H Prabhakar. According to cops the juvenile, after making sustained efforts, came to know that his mother was in Hyderabad. He came to city and met her and even joined Satnaam’s hotel as a helper. Meanwhile, he also tipped off his father, who subsequently joined him. On March 31, when his mother went to a place of worship, the boy and two others killed Satnaam. Soon after the murder, the three went missing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/minor-kills-mothers-paramour-to-take-revenge/articleshow/82122462.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Web professionals thrive as brick & mortar biz go for digital reboot||Everything about this men’s wear manufacturing hub in Prabhadevi was designed to be experienced in person when Rajnikanth Morbia set up shop 27 years ago. Last April — a time when their 11,000 sq ft warehouse would be teeming with retailers — swooping down from Chennai to Jaipur just to touch, feel and investigate the warp and weft for wedding and festival shoppers in their town — it all went eerily silent. It was a similar story for freelance photographer Samir Todnkar, used to carrying around his portfolio in a folder or a pen-drive until the pandemic shuttered his studio. While it’s easy to blame the pandemic for these closures, the Covid-19 crisis has possibly been a catalyst for mom and pop enterprises like Todnkar and Morbia’s—with zero to comatose digital presence—to up their contactless game. As a new wave of Covid cases winds down and an increasing number of traditional retailers and independent professionals— dance instructors to legal advisors; art galleries to learning libraries; vegan pet food to window net sellers—untether themselves from a physical space and migrate to the cloud, one sector that has emerged as growth-friendly and pandemic-proof, has been web development. Given the pressing need for a digital reboot, local web professionals are navigating their way to success in a pandemic world. Staffing firm TeamLease says they’ve seen about “18,000 new web development jobs exist today which is an increase of 25% in the last year itself and almost a 70% jump since 2018.” Google data reveals that searches for “website builder” and “website hosting” increased by “1.5X times” during this period. “It’s like a genie that is out of the bottle and you can’t get it back in,” says Ritu Mehrishi, cofounder of an Andheri-based digital media agency. “The biggest shifts are around grocery, education, cosmetics, clothing, security and legal. It’s given us an opportunity to bridge the gap for companies that never had any online presence,” she says. While social media pages have been an easier, faster piece of the marketing puzzle to help smaller enterprises establish their digital presence, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as the only strategy is no longer enough. “Using social media is like displaying only the best you have on offer. Websites require an investment that could range from Rs 35,000 for basic browsing and go upto Rs 4 lakh depending on capacity, product pairing algorithms and user analytics. But having your own domain helps create a credible brand identity, have greater control and makes for easy referrals which many smaller businesses are understanding only now,” says Kandivli-based Priya Singhi,a web and graphic designer who has witnessed “a 30 percent surge in requests to revive old domains.” Ashish Thakkar, a Dadar-based web developer has witnessed demands, “from owners of dead websites in dire need to bounce back.” Although the basic structure of a website as an information hub hasn't changed — mobile responsiveness, exciting multimedia and features to fit the add-to-cart age — make web design a cocktail of creative skills and technical prowess today. “People’s needs range from 3D images, blogs and explainer videos to clones of Amazon with secure payment gateways, chatbots and intuitive analytics of buyers’ personas,” says Thakkar. Much like a brick and mortar business, websites need upkeep and occasional upgrades. “It’s not just about changing the look and feel but updating content and search engine optimisation. When websites are templatised, take too long to load, not mobile friendly or lack modern functions, they look cliched, outdated, and spammy. Some owners don’t upgrade for years and therefore face poor traffic and frequent security breach,” explained Nayan Khandor, founder of a web solutions company that had to hire interns to meet mounting content writing and graphic design needs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-web-professionals-thrive-as-brick-mortar-biz-go-for-digital-reboot/articleshow/82123130.cms||Mohua Das

Non-payment of bills will lead to imposition of late payment service charges, added the PWD order. “It has been observed that some bills relating to streetlight electricity and maintenance payable to Tata Power, BSES Rajdhani Power Limited and BSES Yamuna Power Limited remained unpaid as of March 31, 2021, due to reasons like paucity of funds, non-receipt of the LOC, etc,” read the order sent to all drawing and disbursing officers (DDOs), executive engineers (EEs) and chief engineers by the director (works) with approval from the PWD chief. The department has also issued instructions to the officials concerned for strict compliance and said the bills must be paid from the funds approved in Budget 2021-22. “While releasing the payment, it should be ensured that the arrears of electricity bill as shown in the bills should also be paid excluding the late payment fees charges,” read the circular issued on April 13. The PWD has further asked the DDOs to submit an action-taken report on the matter to the engineer-in-chief through email, under the intimation to their head of department or chief engineers to take up the issue with the agencies concerned for waiver of late payment service charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pwd-wants-all-streetlight-power-bills-to-be-cleared/articleshow/82123106.cms||---

Mohammed Kaish Shaikh, who works with Amena Khatun Hospital, told police that he had been abused and attacked by a person who identified himself as a social worker. In his complaint lodged on Saturday, Shaikh stated that he has been working as a nodal officer in the hospital since 2016. He said that, on April 16, Rabiya Gulam Vora was admitted to the hospital. He said, “Rabiya’s relatives had been informed that the hospital had 40 Covid beds which were all full. So, if Rabiya tested positive, she will have to be shifted to some other hospital.” Shaikh added, “Rabiya tested positive based on the HRCT report and she needed an ICU bed. However, since all beds were full, the hospital began treatment. In the meantime, it asked the relatives to look for other options. However, around 5 pm on Friday, Yunus Jambu came to the hospital and asked them why they were not admitting Covid patients. This led to heated arguments and Jambu threatened Shaikh and said that he would harass them by filing application under the Right to Information Act.” Shaikh then lodged a complaint with Vejalpur police against Jambu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-bed-hospital-staffer-beaten/articleshow/82122032.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Locals of Canacona’s forest areas fear bison, bear attacks||POINGUINIM: Residents living near forested areas in the interiors of Canacona taluka have in recent weeks reported to the forest department an increase in sightings of bison and bear. While the forest officials said that patrolling is being carried out, locals fear attacks by the wild animals. Motorists said they fear bisons passing by Passal, Gotcamolem and open areas of interior roads leading towards Sadolxem and Talpona in recent weeks. Locals said lately, even bears have been sighted in the vicinity of residential area. “This is the season of cashew fruiting and those farmers who rent plantations are often at the risk of attacks by these animals,” said Zorgo Gaonkar, who is tending to a cashew plantation he has rented in the forest area at Zhorint near Gotcamolem and Opem in Poinguinim panchayat jurisdiction. Niraj Kankonkar said he had recently seen a heard of bisons crossing the road. Bombo Velip, who too is tending to a plantation near Opem, said he had had a similar sighting 20 days back. Residents of Gotcamolem said that cries of bears are frequently heard by some women who collect firewood from around the forest areas. Canacona range forest officer Anant Velip said he had deputed his round forester Vinod Desai and forest guard Sajjan Naik to monitor the situation. Gaonkar said that the bison and other animals come downhill in the late evenings to quench their thirst. Velip said bears are nomadic and therefore are frequently seen moving from one place to another. Leopards, on the other hand, are now attracted to meat from dogs and domesticated pigs and may be therefore seen near residential areas. On Wednesday, a resident Govinda Raj was driving towards Passal when a herd of bisons were seen crossing the road and one of the animals dashed against his vehicle causing damage. Four months back, another local had reported his four-wheeler being hit by a bison.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/locals-of-canaconas-forest-areas-fear-bison-bear-attacks/articleshow/82122476.cms||---

Khaunte has suggested the standard XII examination be postponed, conducted via online mode or holding of a unified admission processing period, which will offer a fair opportunity to students from various boards. “Desperate times call for desperate measures,” he said, adding that the state government is not heeding to the pleas of the student community or their parents. “While the central boards have deferred the exams till June, the uncertainty is still a psychological torture since there’s no certainty about Covid’s subsidence,” Khaunte stated, adding that the curriculum hasn’t been covered due to online limitations. “Repeated appeals for stricter enforcement of Covid-19 protocols and border control measures are falling on deaf ears of the Pramod Sawant government,” the Porvorim MLA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/khaunte-writes-to-pm-wants-online-exams/articleshow/82122465.cms||---
---||Madurai||Son’s custody death: HC rejects man’s plea to withdraw case||Madurai: Madras high court on Saturday sought response from four people allegedly responsible for withdrawal of a case filed by a man in connection with the custodial death of his son at Avaniyapuram police station in Madurai in 2019. A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi said they do not agree with the submissions of petitioner Muthukaruppan’s counsel that the petition was filed by his client in his private capacity and he has every right to withdraw it. The judges said there is a public element involved in the petition because his client had come before the court stating there were police excesses and that his son’s death was not natural but on account of police torture. It would not be open for Muthukaruppan to withdraw the petition stating that it was a private issue since he had pursued the matter with seriousness by taking special permission from the registry to approach the court on a holiday. Hence, the contention of the counsel made in this regard stands rejected. The judges also impleaded the four people as respondents in the case and directed them as well as Muthukaruppan to file counter affidavits. The case relates to a writ petition filed by Muthukaruppan before HC Madurai bench in October 2019 seeking to register an FIR and transfer the investigation to CBI in a case wherein his son M Balamurugan, 22, died in judicial custody. However, two weeks later, Muthukaruppan changed his counsel and withdrew his petition. Subsequently, advocate Henri Tiphagne, in a letter to the court, indicated that the police officers were coercing the parents of the deceased not to depose against them. He also alleged that the petition was withdrawn by the father of the deceased because of threats from local police. He submitted several audio recordings in a sealed cover to the court. Since Muthukaruppan withdrew the petition, the court had initiated suo-motu proceedings in the case.At the previous hearing, the court had directed Madurai city police commissioner to secure and produce the four people — Athi Narayanan, Ramesh, Loganathan and Kathir — before the court. The four appeared before the court through video conferencing on Saturday. It may be recalled that Balamurugan was arrested by police as he was one of the accused in the abduction of R Parthiban, a resident of Villapuram housing board colony, for a ransom of Rs 20lakh. Balamurugan sustained injuries in police custody at Avaniyapuram police station and died at government Rajaji hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sons-custody-death-hc-rejects-mans-plea-to-withdraw-case/articleshow/82123105.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The group has reached membership limit of 256 within hours of its launch. Some non-target beneficiaries seem to have joined the platform out of curiosity. Professor with geriatrics department at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Dr Mangal Borkar, on Saturday said that the WhatsApp group was serving as an effective platform for patients to get their doubts addressed. “Right from quarantine period to diet intake and medication to post Covid care, home-isolated patients are asking different queries. We also received queries from expected and lactating mothers, who are home-isolated. The WhatsApp group, in short, is proving an effective platform for health education to public,” she said. Borkar, a former head of medicine department at GMCH, said the option of using Facebook and other social media is being explored to educate home-isolated patients considering WhatsApp group getting full. “We expect that patients completing their home-isolation period will leave the group to make way for others,” she added. For those unable to join WhatsApp group, the health authorities have also facilitated mobile numbers 09665986302, 09096540840, 09987528024, 09152126263, 08275303956 for counselling between 11 am and 1 pm.

While HMWS&SB officials attribute this to lack of uniformity in water supply schedules, water users complain that they are getting only 10 KL to 15 KL a day despite installing water meters as sought by the water board. Water pipeline connections range between 15 mm and 25 mm and 9.8 lakh consumers got them installed after the board made it mandatory to avail the free water scheme. A consumer in SR Nagar said they get only 15 KL of water. Currently, the water board is supplying potable water across the city, peripheral areas of Greater Hyderabad and areas along the ORR by following different schedules. “As per the water supply schedule, consumers are getting potable water, which is between 45 minutes and one hour only. That too, there is no uniformity in water supply schedules in the entire city. This could be a reason for not getting 20 KL water,” a HMWS&SB official told TOI. To ensure supply of 20 KL a day, the water board has to increase supply by at least another two hours, officials said. “There is a need to revise the water supply schedule which was fixed a few years ago,” they said. In Hyderabad and Secunderabad, consumers are getting water on alternate days, while some areas in Greater Hyderabad periphery are getting water three days in a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/plaints-mount-over-20kl-water-scheme-officials-say-have-to-tweak-schedule/articleshow/82122467.cms||---

SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said the Congress government had played with the sentiments of Punjabis by failing to nail what he described as the “real culprits”. “Four years have been wasted in indulging in a political vendetta against the SAD. Crores of public money has been wasted with Rs 5.5 crore being wasted in doling out handsome amounts to private lawyers by the advocate general,” he said. The SAD leader accused the state government of carrying out a malicious and biased investigation by former SIT head Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh to implicate senior SAD leaders in the case. “But despite misusing all resources at its command, the Congress government could not prove the involvement of a single SAD leader in any case,” he claimed. The SAD spokesperson said all this had proven that the Congress government was not interested in nabbing the culprits, but was all along indulging in conspiracies to defame the SAD and its religious institutions. He said earlier, during the SAD-led government, the Congress as well as self seeking organisations aligned with the demanded for a CBI inquiry into the case. The case was forwarded to the CBI, but when the Congress government came into power, it fought bitterly to get the case back from the CBI to fulfil its motives, said Cheema. “We cooperated with the SIT. However, the malicious campaign initiated by Kunwar against SAD leaders was exposed when its head disassociated with the former’s findings,” said the SAD leader. He added that other members of the SIT also disassociated with most of the findings of Kunwar and did not sign a majority of the papers prepared by him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-says-conspiracy-hatched-by-cong-to-defame-it-exposed/articleshow/82117372.cms||---

Most of them have been deployed at Danapur, Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar terminal and Patliputra Junction. Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar said on Saturday that some of the passengers coming by special trains from Maharashtra every day have Covid. Till now, 311 positive cases among passengers have been reported in the division during the past one week, including 43 in the past 24 hours at Patna Junction. The DRM said several senior railway officials, doctors and employees are literally battling for survival in hospitals. “At least two railway employees died of Covid-19,” he said, adding non-availability of beds in the ICU and oxygen in a few hospitals in Patna are a matter of concern. According to the DRM, at least 11 railways doctors from Danapur divisional railway hospital and railway superspecialty hospital at Karbigahiya have tested positive. “If such an alarming situation continues, it is a great challenge for railways to deal with the situation effectively with the limited resources,” he said, adding that doctors have a direct interface with passengers and patients during their health check-up either on platforms or at the outpatient department (OPD) in the hospitals. Besides, railways has reduced workforce at its offices. Railway employees of the division have been asked to work from home and keep in touch with their branch officials concerned. However, frontline staff, including operating, commercial and security personnel, will continue to work as usual with full precautionary measures, the DRM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/170-rly-officials-and-staff-found-infected/articleshow/82122034.cms||Kumod Verma

This time, BJP has fielded Samadhan Autade, who had contested the 2019 assembly election as an independent and had garnered more than 54,000 votes. BJP expects Paricharak and Autade’s votes will not be divided this year. NCP has fielded Bhagirath Bhalake, deceased MLA Bharat Bhalake’s son. There are 19 candidates in the fray, which has made the outcome unpredictable. Also, the campaigning by the main political parties was fierce.

The party, in a letter to the chief minister, demanded immediate measures be taken to avoid crowds gathering, pointing out that there are no restrictions on entertainment and gaming venues. Convenor Rahul Mhambre suggested that the CM take the tourism industry into confidence and work out appropriate restrictions on the entry of tourists in Goa or at least those entering from states which have higher number of cases. He also ridiculed the new BJP Utsav adopted by the government and said it was disgraceful that the vaccine drive funded by taxpayers money was being used for election campaigning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-hits-out-at-govt-over-covid-mgmt/articleshow/82122475.cms||---

He was admitted to Aureus Hospital on April 12 after testing positive. Tekade is survived by his wife Madhavi, a daughter (10) and a son (7). A highly-qualified management professional, Tekade was known for speaking on the relevance of Chhattrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s life in today’s scenario. He had a huge fan-following, mostly youngsters.

He completed his postgraduate studies in management from Bangaluru. Later, he worked in Wipro’s human resource division. He did his PhD in management and then joined SB Jain College as head of the department, management. However, Chhatrapti Shivaji Maharaj and his management skills always fascinated him. He quit his job to become a full-time motivational speaker. He intended to publish a book and a collection of articles soon.

Time is really ruthless and Corona is more ruthless than that,” tweeted Sandip Joshi. “I’m shocked, speechless and sad. Sumantji had delivered a fascinating lecture at our university. A few days ago, we had a discussion about his book. His untimely demise is a great loss to society,” said Dr Shrinivas Warkhedi, vice-chancellor of KKSU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-sniffs-life-out-of-noted-shivaji-storyteller-motivator-sumant-tekade/articleshow/82122670.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Nagpur||Shopkeepers, customers fail to crack Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s odd-even rule||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s decision to tweak the state’s ‘break the chain’ directives and bring in the odd-even formula for shops has resulted in confusion on Saturday when the rules began to be implemented. Last year during the first wave of the Covid pandemic too a similar problem had arisen. Though the idea is to control crowds at commercial areas in five of the 10 zones, both shopkeepers and customers equally clueless. The NMC’s order issued on Friday stated that shops facing North and East directions would function on even dates, while those facing South and West on odd dates. TOI found that shopkeepers had their own interpretation of the directions and establishments were open on both sides of the road almost in all places. Zone officials did not seem to be around to clear the confusion. “Being first day, there might be some confusion. But assistant commissioners of respective zones have been directed to initiate strict action against violators from Sunday. I request traders and citizens to cooperate with the NMC to contain the spread of coronavirus,” said additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi. In his notification, civic chief Radhakrishnan B had identified five commercial areas where Covid distancing was brazenly flouted. These were in Satranjipura (zone 7), Dhantoli (zone 4), Dharampeth (zone 2), Ashi Nagar (zone 9) and Mangalwari (zone 10). Consequently, the civic administration decided to implement the odd-even formula. “The NMC’s new directive has created confusion among the shopkeepers and public,” said Amar Agrawal, a shopkeeper from Itwari. A number of shopkeepers, whom TOI spoke with, unanimously felt that there should be a single uniform system in place for the entire city. Some markets opted for left hand-right hand side criteria to open shops causing confusion to the public and shops in the vicinity. The timing regulation also brought in from Saturday at Mahatma Phule wholesale vegetable market and Cotton Market too went for a toss. Vegetable wholesalers continued to function beyond the stipulated 8 am time limit, while the ‘potato-onion line’ too operated from early morning and not as stipulated between 9 am and noon. The NMC’s nuisance detection squad made few essential shops owners in many commercial areas down their shutters even though they could remain open. While some customers felt the initiative will contain rush at markets, others felt that it would create confusion and fail to check the crowding. There were a sizeable number of people at essential shops in Itwari's Anaj Mandi and also at vegetable vendors in many areas. Glaring violations were spotted on the Indora Chowk-Kamal Chowk and Golibar Chowk-Marwari Chowk stretches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/shopkeepers-customers-fail-to-crack-nmcs-odd-even-rule/articleshow/82121514.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The survey would go on till the end of April as some districts began the survey after the polls.Director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam said one of the objectives of the sero survey is to find if the community has developed herd immunity. Preliminary results could be expected a month after the survey ends. The sample population is also being asked to answer a questionnaire on occupation, exposure status, age, sex, travel history etc, which would give a more detailed account of the disease. Deputy director of health services, Madurai, Dr K V Arjun Kumar, said 1,140 samples from 38 clusters were being collected in the district in the second phase. At least 42 clusters have been identified in Coimbatore and teams comprising four members from every block have started collecting 20-odd blood samples from each cluster. In Trichy, the sero survey covers 30 houses each in 32 clusters. The samples are being tested at the regional laboratory at the government headquarters hospital at Manapparai.

Incidentally, his visit will coincide with the visit of Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who began a three-day visit to the UAE on Saturday. Announcing the visit, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi tweeted, “At the invitation of his counterpart, S Jaishankar will be visiting Abu Dhabi on April 18. His discussions will focus on economic cooperation and community welfare.” The UAE has one of the largest groups of Indian expatriates. Jaishankar is expected to meet his UAE counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan. He is expected to talk about Indian workers’ repatriation, which may be held up due to India’s Covid-19 surge. However, attention will be on the fact that the Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers will be in the same place at the same time. Qureshi held talks with Sheikh Abdullah on Saturday. There is no clarity whether Qureshi and Jaishankar may have a meeting. There was no meeting between the two at Dushanbe during the Heart of Asia conference. The UAE ambassador to the US Yousef Al Otaiba said at a seminar that the UAE had played a key role in bringing about a ceasefire on the Line of Control and the International Border between India and Pakistan with an aim to normalising relations. This was the first time an UAE official acknowledged what has been speculated. There have been reports of the UAE and Saudi Arabia conveying “messages” to Pakistan but the extent of the involvement is unclear. Al Otaiba suggested that the effort was to improve ties. Al Otaiba’s words carry weight because he is believed to be one of the architects behind the Abraham Accords that restored diplomatic relations between Israel and the UAE. Answering a question by former US NSA H R McMaster, Al Otaiba said, “They might not sort of become best friends but at least we want to get it to a level where it’s functional, it’s operational, where they are speaking to each other, where there are lines of communication and that’s our goal.” Jaishankar was in Abu Dhabi recently too, when it was speculated that he was responsible for taking the India-Pakistan thaw forward. Both countries reaffirmed a ceasefire on February 25 The UAE is a strategic ally, so India’s comfort level is higher, specially in areas such as India-Pakistan relations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/s-jaishankar-to-leave-for-uae-today-shah-mehmood-qureshi-already-there/articleshow/82124648.cms||---

While the work is nearing completion at the Mandoli and Rohini prisons, the Tihar authorities have also started installing the cameras. This will ensure 24x7 monitoring, while the jail staff will also be able keep an eye on criminals involved in fights inside the prisons. “The cameras will cover maximum areas, which will help monitor the activities of the inmates and enhance security of the prisons,” said Sandeep Goel, DG Prisons. Recently, the plan to free Kuldeep alias Fajja from police custody was hatched by his gang member Jitender Gogi lodged in Tihar. A senior official said the work was going on for a year and nearing completion soon. The installation work has been given to the public works department, which is likely to complete it by April 30. A total of 6,967 cameras are being installed in all the three prisons. Around 700-800 cameras installed earlier had become old and stopped working. The new ones are being installed in the common areas, jails where hardened criminals and terror accused are lodged, apart from those for undertrials. In March, the Tihar Jail officials conducted a massive search operation inside sub-jail number 8 and recovered a mobile handset and a SIM card on which a Telegram account in the name of ‘Jaishulhind’ was created. This account had claimed responsibility for the explosive-laden SUV found abandoned near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai and demanded money through cryptocurrency. According to prison sources, jail number 8 houses terrorists of Indian Mujahideen, like Tehsin Akhtar, apart from a few linked to al-Qaeda and the underworld. The mobile handset was recovered from Akhtar’s barracks. Recently, in several crimes that have occurred in Delhi, the planning was done by criminals using mobile phones from the jail premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cctvs-to-be-up-in-prison-complexes-by-april-end/articleshow/82123153.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Restrictions upon return from Kumbh on the cards||Mumbai: The state government held talks with the railways on Saturday to discuss curbs and protocols for those returning from the Kumbh Mela that is under way in Haridwar, in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in a state already reporting the highest cases in the country. Self-quarantining of those returning and possible rapid antigen tests are being considered and an SOP will be declared soon, said officials. “Given the large numbers that will be returning, it will be a very big challenge. Self-quarantine seems to be the best option. RTPCR testing of those returning is difficult to consider given the shortage of kits and the lag in results,” an official said. The SOP could be declared by Sunday since those visiting the Kumbh Mela in Uttarakhand are expected back in the state by next week. “The state government will have to strike a balance in the protocols between trying to control the spread of the pandemic and looking at what will be possible and acceptable to those returning,” relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Gupta said. Similar restrictions could be imposed on those coming in from states reporting a surge in cases, including Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala, said officials. Mayor Kishori Pednekar said those returning from the Kumbh Mela should be quarantined at their own expense. “There have been thousands who have tested positive at Kumbh already and when these persons go to their respected states there are chances of them further infecting people. In a situation as such, it will be important to quarantine them,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-restrictions-upon-return-from-kumbh-on-the-cards/articleshow/82122504.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

This was an all-time high as maximum number of cases reported in a single day were reported a day before when 11045 people had tested positive. Saturday was the 16th consecutive day in the state when each day came with a new high in terms of reporting highest number of fresh Covid-19 cases in a single day.

The positivity rate on Saturday was reported to be high at 21.4%. Positivity rate is the number of people found positive out of every 100 samples tested, thus out of every 100 who were tested in the state on Saturday more than 21.4 people were found positive.

The remaining six victims were residents of other districts who tested positive and died while undergoing treatment in hospitals situated in the district. Since the last three days, the district has been witnessing a record number of deaths. The number of deaths in a day were 73 on April 8 followed by 74 (April 15), 75 (April 16) and 79 (April 17). The total number of deaths surged to 1,090 in 17 days of April. The number is more than that registered in all the months of the pandemic excluding September last year (1,465). The number of deaths have increased to 6,188. The district registered 6,956 positive cases on Saturday which was the second-highest in a day after 7,210 recorded on April 11. The district recorded 89,961 cases in 17 days of April which is more than that registered in all the last 13 months. The district’s tally swelled to 3,15,999. The case fatality rate (CFR) in the second wave continued to be low compared to the first one. The CFR of April is 1.21% due to the high number of cases. The highest CFR was 3.8% in August last year due to a high number of deaths and less cases. While fatalities were 919, cases amounted to 24,163. On Saturday, 29,053 tests were conducted, the second-highest in a day after 29,122 on April 13. Active cases were 66,208 on Saturday which was highest-ever in a day. The previous highest was 64,335 a day ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-deaths-at-new-high-of-79-in-ngp-dist/articleshow/82121520.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

So far, nine containment streets have been removed in the city. Poor compliance to wearing facemasks and distancing have being pointed to as one of the reasons for the rise. Out of the 13 containment zones under rural limits, Madurai East and Valayankulam blocks have five each while Kottampatty, Sedapatti and Karumathur blocks have one each. On Saturday, 1,868 active cases were recorded in Madurai. “We are trying to collect around 2,000-2,500 samples each from both rural and corporation in a day. Screening is being done at 241 fever camps every day, including 126 in rural limits,” said Dr KV Arjun Kumar, deputy director of health services, Madurai. Both mobile fever camps and static fever camps are being mobilised in hotspot areas and door-to-door surveillance has also been intensified to identify Covid-19 cases early. “Cases are reported sporadically and there is no cluster in the city yet. A system is in place to monitor movement in containment areas. The movement of people is recorded in a notebook and people are allowed to leave only in unavoidable situations. Necessary help is being provided to procure essential items to the families, where positive case have been reported,” said a corporation health official. Wards which report highest of cases are being shortlisted and all the resources are channelized to such places. Last year too, the civic body followed the same method and proved to be effective, the official added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/50-containment-streets-in-madurai/articleshow/82123147.cms||---

Officials at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel airport said that the application for maintenance of the runway was moved to the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) last month. The timings and dates for the resurfacing and maintenance work have been finalized after due consultation with all stakeholders. The airline companies have been informed about the closure timings, which will be from 11am to 5pm from Tuesday. The runway maintenance is to be undertaken to enhance surface quality, ensure safety of operations and to prevent disruption during the coming monsoon. The touchdown zone along with the taxiway will be repaired during these days. The airport authorities said that all airlines have been informed about the proposed closure of the runway because domestic airlines usually operate their flights during these hours. The airlines have been requested to accommodate flight operations before 11am and after 7pm after April 20. They have also been requested to intimate the passengers about the rescheduling to avoid inconvenience. The international flight operations are not expected to be affected much, because most of the international flights are scheduled during night and the operations have also been curtailed due to the pandemic situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/airport-runway-to-be-closed-from-11am-to-5pm-for-11-days/articleshow/82122042.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Any mask is better than no mask, wear it properly: Doctors||NAGPUR: With second wave of Covid-19 gripping in, confusion about types of mask is once again taking center stage. With summer also set in, many have started wearing the traditional cotton scarves (gamcha) as masks. The others around them are always unsure if a scarf is enough or if one needs a proper multi-layered or N95 masks. Doctors say any mask is okay but one should wear it properly. “Be it the first or second wave, the scientific data remains same for mask. A cotton mask is enough for general public,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayade. “N-95 masks are for aerosol generating areas like ICUs and recommended for those who work in hospitals where Covid patients are admitted,” she said. “Covid distancing is more important. Because majority of people get the infection when their compliance to mask is poor and not due to poor quality of mask,” added Dr Tayade. According to doctors, people change the sides of cotton gamcha quite often and this could immediately end the very purpose of masking. Hence, it’s better to wear a disposable mask underneath the cotton gamcha this summer, said doctors. Nandan Niwal, who owns a medical store in Manewada, said that people ask for proper masks these days rather than the cotton masks available at roadside stalls. “This is because the proper three-layered masks and N95 masks have become cheap. Use-and-throw masks are available at Rs3, while N95 masks cost Rs12. So, common people now buy proper masks,” he added. There are many masks available in the market nowadays. Some are fancy ones which people match with their clothes. Doctors say triple-layered masks should be preferred. “Many people keep the mask on their chin. A mask should be fitted tightly so that no air can pass through the sides. If air goes through, then virus can as well,” said Dr Archana Kothari, immediate past president of Nagpur IMA. Physician Dr Anjali Waikar suggested that people should wear masks of different designs. “Wearing only one style of mask can create pressure on the ears. Thus, one should consider wearing masks that can be tied at the back of the head as well,” she said. Double masking has become a trend these days. Doctors said, wearing two or three masks does not offer additional protection at all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/any-mask-is-better-than-no-mask-wear-it-properly-doctors/articleshow/82121549.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Police identified the deceased as Soni Game (14), whose birthday was being celebrated, and Jyoti Game (16), both residents of Simhastha Nagar in Cidco; Naziya Maniyar (19) and Khushi Maniyar (10) of Pathardi Phata; Arti Bhalerao (24) and Himmat Chaudhary (17), both residents of Pathardi Phata. Police rushed to the spot soon after receiving information on Friday evening and, with the help of locals, fished out Arti’s body. The search operation had to be called off as it had got dark. “The search operation was resumed on Saturday morning and the bodies of the remaining five victims were found by 9 am,” said API Vishwajeet Jadhav of the Wadivarhe police station, where a case of accidental death has been registered. Jadhav said all the victims were from the families of workers employed with food catering firms. The victims were part of a group of nine, including six girls, two young women and three boys, who had gone to the dam around 4pm. “Around 6 pm, they were playing in the dam waters, when some of them failed to gauge the depth. When one of them started drowning, the others tried to rescue them, but five more drowned in the process,” Jadhav quoted the three survivors as saying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/6-drown-in-valdevi-damduring-bday-celebration/articleshow/82120934.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Delayed exams to not hit pvt & deemed university admissions||Mumbai: Private and deemed universities across the country have drawn up fresh admission plans after several school boards pushed Class XII exams. Many have already started their early application process and will look at predictive grades, past performance and self-declared scores. Whether it is deemed universities or private ones, the exam delay is unlikely to wreak havoc on the academic calendar. Little wonder then that universities have been quick to open their admission counters. Some are admitting candidates on a conditional basis and some others are looking at the other best possible markers: Entrance tests and Class X marks. At NIIT University, candidates will be admitted taking into account an aggregate of Class X scores and a personal interview. Rajendra Pawar, founder, NIIT University, said, “While the situation owing to the resurgence of the pandemic is unprecedented, the need of the hour is to address the duress that the students are faced with.” A spokesperson of FLAME University said it started admissions for the batch of 2021 in December 2020, in line with international best practices. “We might have to extend the admissions a bit further so that candidates who may be affected by the postponement of Class XII exams don’t miss the opportunity.” SVKM’s NMIMS deemed-to-be university in Mumbai has decided to admit students provisionally on the basis of their entrance test scores for 2021-22, said the university’s registrar Meena Chintamaneni. The eligibility criteria of 45-50% scores in Class XII board exams will not be imposed at the time of admissions, as the announcement of board results will be uncertain. The university plans to take an undertaking from students on their compliance with the eligibility criteria, whenever the board results are announced, said the registrar. If in case they do not meet the criteria, admissions can be cancelled at a later stage. “Students are anxious about securing admissions, and therefore, we have decided to not delay the process. We will start our admissions once our entrance test scores are announced in July,” said Chintamaneni. Admissions to only three of the 20-odd courses offered at the university are based directly on Class XII scores. The university plans to either conduct aptitude tests for these programmes or delay theeir process by a month. Symbiosis International University’s pro-chancellor Vidya Yeravdekar said admissions to all their professional courses are based only on entrance tests conducted by the university. “Class XII score of a minimum 50% is used only as an eligibility criteria for admissions. We will wait for the government’s decision in June and then decide whether we should consider relaxing this eligibility criteria and admit students provisionally based on their entrance test scores.”  Mahindra University Ecole Centrale School of Engineering also announced the early phase of admissions counselling for admissions to the BTech programme. Admissions will be on the JEE Mains percentile secured in February 2021 and March 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-delayed-exams-to-not-hit-pvt-deemed-university-admissions/articleshow/82122505.cms||Yogita Rao

In a release issued late in the evening, Dr G Srinivas Rao, director of public health, Telangana, stated: “It is to inform that tomorrow (April 18) there will not be any Covid vaccination in the Government Covid Vaccination Centres (GCVCs) across the state. However, vaccination will be continued from Monday as per the schedule.” Earlier in the day, while addressing a press conference, Dr Rao had admitted to a slowdown in the vaccination drive, in many places across Telangana. He said that the pace is likely to pick up once fresh supplies reach the state. “Currently we have adequate stock for one more day. By tomorrow (Sunday) another two lakh doses are expected to reach Telangana. Given our stocks, we have so far managed to complete 25% of the target — which is vaccinating one crore people,” said the director, stressing that virus mutations are weakened by vaccination. On the issue of some people putting up oxygen cylinders and ICU set-ups in their homes, Dr Rao said that it isn’t the right approach as it is leading to unnecessary hoarding of essential medical equipment, creating a shortage where the demand is more pressing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-vax-in-t-today-say-authorities/articleshow/82122502.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Sankhali councillor Rajesh Sawal told reporters that BJP tried to wrongfully have him disqualified over purchase of property. “People should know how wrongfully BJP is trying to come to power and damaging the state,” he said. “BJP functionaries are threatening people that they will deny benefits of the Laadli Laxmi and Griha Aadhar schemes if they do not assume office.” Congress state president Girish Chodankar condemned the locking of the SMC chairperson’s cabin and denying charge to the vice-chairperson. Sawal alleged that BJP, on behalf of the chief minister, had offered them crores of rupees. “We also got offers of bungalows and flats,” he and councillor Pravin Blagan said. Councillor Dharmesh Saglani further claimed that chief officers were working at the behest of the chief minister and trying to create hurdles for them. Chodankar said BJP had ruined the state as it didn’t have capable leaders to run the government, even as he assured to steer the system once Congress assumed office in “eight months”. “BJP’s situation in Goa is now such that even to win the local body elections, it is offering ‘plots’ to candidates supported by Congress to get them to withdraw,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-create-more-hurdles-in-sakhali-council-cong-to-cm/articleshow/82122518.cms||---

It triggered shock and panic among health officials and police in Uttarakhand. The district administration has filed an FIR against the patients and alerted the Rajasthan government. "We were told that they had been to the Kumbh before visiting Tehri," a health department official told TOI. "We are filing an FIR against all 19 patients and information about them has been shared with their native state as well," added the Tehri DM Iva Srivastava. This came even as 327 people tested positive for Covid in the Kumbh Mela area on Saturday. A senior health department official told TOI that 30 Covid patients had been admitted to the 200-bed Sridev Suman Government hospital in Narendra Nagar. The 19 who have gone missing were part of that group. "The matter came to light when the caterer went to the hospital to distribute food packets. While 30 packets were asked for, only 11 patients took the food. The hospital then informed police and local administration about it," a senior health department official said. "The question is how the hospital's security personnel failed to notice so many patients walking out."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/19-covid-patients-from-rajasthan-flee-ukhand-hospital/articleshow/82121550.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Hyderabad||Children spawning clusters in Covid 2nd wave: Experts||Hyderabad: Covid-19 second wave seems to be spreading fast among children below 15 years of age. Unlike the first wave, where the elderly and middle-aged were the most affected, children and youngsters are increasingly falling prey to the virus in the second wave. Most children, who tested positive, are asymptomatic and they may be responsible for emergence of family and apartment clusters of the novel coronavirus, according to experts. An analysis of RT-PCR test results of children in Hyderabad since August 2020 shows that while 38% of children below 15 years, who gave samples for the test, had tested positive, the number came down to 10% by December 2020. It further came down to 6% in January 2021 and 4% in February. But as the second wave picked up in March 2021, the positivity percentage began increasing. It was 21 % in March and 27% so far in April. Moreover, the data released by the Telangana government on Saturday (April 17) shows that 13% of cases were from children and teenagers, while 21% of the cases were of those below 30 years. Another 21% of the cases were of those between 31 and 40 years. “A significant feature of the second wave is the cluster of people seen with infection (family clusters, apartment clusters etc),” said Dr Saranya Narayan, chief microbiologist, Neuberg Diagnostics. The analysis revealed that there was a marginal spike in Covid-19 positive cases among children during May and June 2020. It came down to baseline towards November and December 2020. However, there has been a sudden spike in the number of positive cases in March and April of 2021. The pattern of infection shows that children were infected during the first wave in a gradual manner, but the infectivity is rapid now. Health experts attribute the rapid increase in the cases in children to reopening of schools and relaxation of lockdown norms. New variants too might be playing their role, but a thorough genome analysis would shed light if certain mutants were responsible. According to geneticist Dr M Khaja, most of the children, who tested positive, were asymptomatic and they were unaware that they were carrying the virus. Such asymptomatic cases could be responsible for the emergence of clusters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/children-spawning-clusters-in-covid-2nd-wave-experts/articleshow/82122517.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Nagpur||Active and fit protected from severe Covid: doctors||NAGPUR: Following a US-based study regarding physical activity and coronavirus hospitalizations, doctors in the city have found similar anecdotal references of patients who were at less risk of developing severe Covid. The double mutant strain has affected even the younger population this time and hospitals in the city have reported that many aged between 20 to 40 years are needing longer hospitalisation. Yet, many of those falling in asymptomatic to mild category are mostly the ones who stay fit or were physically more active. Orthopaedic Dr Shantanu Sengupta said the degree of Covid involvement is less severe and post Covid recovery is faster in people who regularly work out at least for an hour. “Immune response of runner or cyclist to vaccine is also greater. Antibody response is better if you exercise regularly. Workout helps boost lung capacity. We must invest 8 to 10 hours in a week for exercise so that if at all we get Covid infected, we face less problems,” he said. Dr Sengupta said he is part of a group of 500 health enthusiasts of which only 10 to 15 got infected. “All had milder form of Covid,” he said. Critical care expert Dr Imran Noor Mohammad too said none from a group of 30 to 40 ‘workout friends’ have fallen sick so far. “We have members aged 20 to 60. I am 42. We have been able to stay Covid free because of gymming. We all follow our Pune-based fitter guru Jitendra Choksey. People must have good diet and exercise regularly,” he said. Public health expert and endurance athlete Dr Amit Samarth said many from the 300 members enrolled in his sports and fitness training academy got infected. “Except one or two, nobody had to go to a hospital. After 15 days of infection, they started running as before. It is not just Covid , regular exercise keeps you protected from all diseases. Human body is made for physical exertion,” he said. One of Dr Samarth’s group member Vaibhav Andhare (48) said he was back in action on the 15th day post Covid. “I had been regularly cycling, running marathons, for the last five years. Still I thought somewhere I was careless and got infected on March 16. I needed four days’ hospital stay as lungs were infected. From April 2, I resumed cycling and walking. My doctor told me that my lungs developed strength because of years of exercise,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/active-and-fit-protected-from-severe-covid-docs/articleshow/82121551.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The deceased had gone to Kumbh on April 7 and returned on April 12, and was admitted at a private hospital in city on April 13, where he tested positive. Later, on April 14, he was shifted to another hospital where he died during treatment on April 16. Three of his disciples also tested positive for Covid-19. Sources said that as he was known religious figure, there are chances that lot of people have visited him and his disciples. When contacted over the issue officers kept passing the buck, on each other. The chief medical and health officer, Dr Ratnesh Kuraria asked TOI to talk to the concerning doctors. “Administration was helpful during treatment and helped in arranging medicines. But after death no team has visited us for contact tracing”. When contacted, nodal officer for contact tracing, Dr D Mohanty said, “The name of deceased is not in the list of positive people which we have on the portal. We also enquired from the concerned officer of the area they informed us that as the name was not in the list, no one had gone for contact tracing”. Anil Tiwari, spokesperson of the private hospital where the sadhu had died said, “He was tested positive in another hospital and brought here when his condition deteriorated and on April 16, he died during treatment. Body was handed over to the authorised persons as per the Covid-19 guidelines”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/day-after-sadhu-dies-no-contact-tracing-in-jabalpur/articleshow/82121553.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad Municipality resolved to preserve city gates in 1928||AHMEDABAD: One of the first conservation efforts to save the city’s cultural heritage, in this case the city gates, by the Ahmedabad Municipality was made on August 17, 1928, via a municipal resolution. The municipality was to sign an agreement with the British government to fund this effort. The classification of the city gates was brought down from 1(A) to 1(C) and the walls were put under the municipality. It is widely known how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel wanted Ahmedabad — which was affected by frequent influenza and plague epidemics since 1917 — to break the barriers of the old city walls and spread to the outskirts. The 1924 Ellisbridge town planning scheme was part of the effort. In 1927, when the municipal election campaign was gathering steam “breaking the city walls” became an election issue. Sardar Patel, who was elected municipality president in 1924, resigned on 13 April 1928, as the freedom movement gained momentum. Four months later, the resolution appeared at the municipal general board meeting — a mini parliament where policy matters are passed by vote — and the city walls preservation policy was passed. “Sardar had always felt that outbreaks of infectious diseases would be frequent as the walled city got congested. By breaking the wall he meant moving out to new settlement areas,” says city-based historian Rizwan Kadri. It is worth pointing out that Sardar was among the first, since 1917, to propose the idea of setting up planned residential societies and town planning schemes outside Ahmedabad’s walled city.  He had proposed to many trading guilds settling outside the Walled City — which was confined to 5.8 sq km. The area outside the walled city was sparsely inhabited, had forests and farms and small villages like Paldi, where Sardar Patel had proposed to develop new settlement areas. A few years later, Madalpur, Vadaj and Vastrapur, were the other areas taken up by the municipal corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/municipality-resolved-to-preserve-city-gates-in-1928/articleshow/82122046.cms||---

Patil was trapped at Martin Nagar with two vials of the anti-viral drug by special squad of zonal DCP Neelotpal following an information shared by city police chief Amitesh Kumar. It’s learnt, Patil offered the two vials for Rs46,000 to the cops posing as customers. Cash of Rs13,000 and Patil’s car too were seized. Police said Patil has admitted to selling another four Remdesivir vials in the past. Following the interrogation of Patil, two more persons, identified as Aman Shinde, a pharmacist from Sitabuldi, and another ward boy of a Dhantoli-based hospital, Ishwar Mondal alias Bittu, were arrested. Police recovered another couple of injections from Mondal. Police said Bittu would steal Remdesivir from his hospital before handing them over to Shinde from whom Patil collected it on many occasions. “We have come across facts that would lead to more actions,” said Neelotpal whose team comprised senior inspector Nitin Phatangare, asst PI Devkate of Jaripatka police station and their counterparts from Koradi police station and special squad. CP Kumar said the hospitals must be alert regarding the pilferage and constantly keep a check on their Remdesivir stock. Police said the three arrested persons were produced before the magistrate who remanded them to custody for two days. In another action, connected to the earlier raid in which Dr Lokesh Sahu was arrested, ward boy of a hospital in Wardha, Umesh Satpute, was nabbed from whom nine vials of Remdesivir were recovered. Satpute used to supply Remdesivir to his counterparts in the city who supplied it to Kunal Kohde and others. In the meanwhile, police have handed over the seized Remdesivir to sub-divisional magistrate at collector’s office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/scribe-among-3-arrested-for-selling-remdesivir-in-black/articleshow/82121555.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||41 labs don’t have correct details of over 2,000 Covid-19 patients||NAGPUR: Though the collection centres have been asked to record exact addresses with even the nearest landmark before swab collection, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has found that over 2,000 positive patients tested at 41 private and public labs in the last 10 days haven’t disclosed their correct details. The NMC issued the list and asked these labs to rectify the oversight. However, health officials and private lab owners feel this has been deliberately done in a bid to under report positive cases and prevent action by the civic administration. NMC, in its letter dated April 16, reiterated that lack of proper address makes it difficult to trace close contacts or take containment measures in areas reporting a large number of cases. TOI spoke to a couple of labs to find out the reasons behind patients mentioning incomplete addresses. Lab officials admitted that in some cases they were at fault but blamed the NMC’s containment staff for apathy. “Strangely, the NMC pointed out that a woman was untraceable in Manish Nagar but her husband had been traced and close contact ascertained,” said a lab director. Another lab director said the heavy rush makes it difficult to go through every form carefully. “We assume patients are giving complete details. But at the time of data entry it is noticed that they just mentioned ‘Nagpur Maharashtra’. This is done to avoid the NMC health team from reaching their doorstep,” the director said. As per the NMC list, one of the first private Covid labs of the city had most names with incomplete address. “Patients are approaching private labs with requests for not reporting their Covid positive status to the NMC. Since it’s a pandemic, it can’t be done. So they mention the wrong address to avoid their building or home being declared a mini or micro containment zone,” said a microbiologist Another lab director said people are still fearful of the stigma and NMC action. “They don’t want to stay indoors and neither do they want to curtail their movement outside. So they prefer to keep their Covid positive status confidential,” he said. The microbiologist said some labs were accepting more samples than their capacity which was also the reason of incomplete details. In some genuine errors, it was found that the lab staff relied on the Aadhaar card which had the old address whereas the patient shifted to another residence. In another case, a lab found that the patient was already admitted to a private hospital when the NMC team went for contact tracing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/41-labs-dont-have-correct-details-of-over-2000-covid-19-patients/articleshow/82121558.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

CT scan centres will charge Rs 2,000 (instead of Rs 2,500) for chest CT scans and the private diagnostics labs will charge Rs 700, instead of Rs 1,000, for the RT-PCR tests. Home collection of swab samples will cost Rs 800 instead of Rs 1,200. The minister held a meeting with the owners of the CT scan centres, private labs, blood banks and senior officials of the Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) on Friday afternoon. “The owners agreed to slash the prices after we made the request,” said Bhuse. Bhuse said instructions have been issued to CT scan centres that in case the CT chest severity score of a suspected Covid patient is over 5, then the local civic body must immediately be alerted. The civic body will follow up with the patient. “We also directed the CT scan centre owners to properly sanitise the equipment to prevent the spread of Covid. I have directed the local government agencies to start taking action if they find any CT scan centre operating without licence. There are nine authorised CT scan centres in Malegaon at present,” Bhuse added. Admitting that there is a shortage of blood in the local blood banks, the minister has asked the local authorities to encourage people to donate blood. Also, if possible, small blood donation camps can be organised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ct-scan-rt-pcr-charges-reduced-in-malegaon/articleshow/82120936.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

PWD records show that 249 works have been taken up so far by utilising Rs 2.6 crore of the funds to improve water distribution across the state under the central scheme. Goa’s declaration last year that it has achieved 100% piped water connectivity in rural parts of the state drew much criticism as many village wards came forward to state that they were still without regular water supply. Official records, however, show that works for improvement of the pipelines network under the scheme have been completed in the areas of Chimbel, Dabolim, Talsai and Kalay in Sanguem, Sanvordem, Netravali, Mollem, Aldona, Saligao and Tivim. New water connections were provided under ‘Har Ghar Jal’ in the Quepem and Canacona areas. Works are also in advance stages of completion at Usgao, Shiroda, Ponda, Taleigao, Curtorim, Nuvem, Cortalim, Barcem, Betul, Balli, among others, which are aimed at improving the existing network of pipelines. “To lay the distribution pipeline wherever required and to release the domestic water connections to each left out household, necessary provision is made for appurtenances and other allied works as per requirement and to release,” the records state of the new works taken up under ‘Har Ghar Jal’ in the interior areas of Quepem and Dharbandora. Excavation of borewells has also been taken up in the interiors of Dharbandora, places that cannot be reached by the state’s piped water supply network. While it has been over a year since the state government declared itself the country’s first state to have achieved providing tap connections to all rural households, the PWD records show that 4,222 persons have sought tap connections and that less than 50% of these applicants have been provided with the new connections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pwd-executes-249-works-to-improve-water-supply-network/articleshow/82122055.cms||---

It will also give dengue test results within one hour. “Dengue is a serious global health concern. Early diagnosis is the key to prevent deterioration of a patient’s health. However, conventional diagnostic tools, like nucleic acid detection using RT-PCR, are time taking and require expensive equipment and reagents,” a statement from IIT Delhi said, adding that its GLancing Angle Deposition (GLAD) research group has developed the device. The device has been successfully tested on clinical blood samples collected from hundreds of individuals in collaboration with ICMR-National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR), the statement added. The research, published in the journal Analytical Chemistry, was funded by the IMPRINT India programme of the Union education ministry with New Age Instruments and Materials Pvt Ltd as its industry partner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iit-d-develops-device-for-early-dengue-diagnosis/articleshow/82123186.cms||---

The Class XII exams of the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education are set to begin from April 24. The students expressed anger at the state government’s decision to go ahead with the public exams in the offline mode, as scheduled, even as Covid-19 cases are on a rise in recent weeks. Students from various schools from Mapusa and other areas of Bardez held placards demanding the exams be either cancelled or held in the online mode. The students said the government call a meeting of all the stakeholders and hold discussions with them to chalk out the further course of action. “The parents, teachers and students need to be taken into confidence before taking any decision in this regard,” said NSUI Goa state president Arhaz Mulla. “Our demand is that the government should take preventive steps and try and immediately postpone the exams as the cases are still rising putting the students’ lives at risk,” said another student Anita Govekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/scrap-or-postpone-boards-students/articleshow/82122545.cms||---

From layoffs and workers returning home to their native states to closures, the hospitality industry is experiencing that ominous April 2020 again, when the Narendra Modi-led government’s national lockdown had pushed it to a precipice. The industry had pulled back, but the second wave of Covid-19 has washed away those little gains, with many foot soldiers deciding to abandon the field. Raju is one of them. A cook at an eating outlet, he has returned to his native village in Uttarakhand. “My salary was reduced to 10,000 due to financial losses suffered by the owner. As it is difficult to survive in Chandigarh, I decided to go back. If the situation improves, I will come back,” he said. Going by how the top bosses are reacting, he may to have wait for a while to buy that return ticket. The owner of a prominent outlet shut operations recently. “There was no business. It had become difficult to pay salaries, rent, taxes and electricity charges. We shut the business. Now, more than our 50 employees are jobless,” he said. It is on weekends that clubs and pubs register high footfall. No wonder, they are desperate for some relief to stay afloat. “We request the administration to give some relaxations. It should also find ways to provide financial assistance in the form of waiver of taxes, licencing fee, power and water charges. The industry is in dire need of support,” said Ankit Gupta, president, Chandigarh Hospitality Association. Recently, the administration had turned down the demand of the industry for extension of the deadline for paying annual licence fee for the 2021-22 financial year by at least a month. The administration had fixed March 31 as the deadline. 2 prominent eateries shut Neeraj Kharab, who runs Ministry of Bar Exchange (MOBE) and Chandiland restaurants, said he has closed the Sector 26 outlet of MOBE and Sector 7 joint of Chandiland. He said it was difficult to run them with the restrictions. A total of 120 employees working in the two outlets are jobless. “The administration should consider increasing night timings to 12 midnight to revive the hospitality industry. The government should at least waive off our power and electricity bills,” he demanded||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/curbs-mince-eateries-as-layoffs-closures-bite-again/articleshow/82121568.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

At PMCH, all the 105 Covid beds, including 80 ICUs, were full of patients, said its superintendent Dr IS Thakur. The similar was the situation at AIIMS-Patna where all the 190 Covid beds were full, said its nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Sanjeev Kumar. NMCH deputy superintendent Dr Satish Kumar said there were 176 patients in the Covid ward against the capacity of 160 beds. He said about 90% of the patients admitted were on oxygen support. Regarding the announcement to make NMCH a dedicated Covid hospital, its principal Dr H L Mahto said though they did not receive any formal letter from the government till evening, preparations were afoot on that line. “We need 24 hours to get it ready as a dedicated Covid hospital as we would have to shift other patients undergoing treatment after surgeries to other hospitals,” he said. All the 59 beds, including 24 ICUs, in Paras HMRI hospital were full. Its regional director Dr Talat Halim said seven more ICUs would become functional by Sunday. Patna DM Dr Chandrasekhar Singh said 50 more beds at Medanta Jaiprabha Hospital and 75 at Rajendra Nagar Eye Hospital would be ready for Covid patients in two days. However, there was no report of oxygen crisis either at PMCH or NMCH or AIIMS-P on Saturday. Meanwhile, PMCH deputy superintendent Dr RK Rana tested positive on Saturday. So far 62 doctors and 50 nursing staff of PMCH have tested positive. PMCH principal Dr VP Choudhary had already been infected earlier. Dr Thakur said there was no crisis of oxygen and sufficient number of cylinders have been placed in every ward for emergency requirements. There was also no oxygen shortage at AIIMS-P, but the hospital had urgent need of Remdesivir injection. “The Covid ward requires 50 vials of Remdesivir every day, but we have none today. We have asked the supplier to rush it,” its nodal officer Dr Sanjeev said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-covid-bed-at-pmch-nmch-aiims-patna/articleshow/82122124.cms||VK Tripathi

City-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi said proper diet is key to keeping the virus at bay. “People should consume maximum amount of seasonal fruits and green vegetables. Consuming lemons, amla and turmeric is also helpful. One should also take dietary supplements like Vitamin-D and Vitamin-C to maintain proper concentration of zinc in blood. People should exercise on a daily basis as it helps in increasing immunity. Proper sleep of seven hours a day is also necessary,” Dr Tejashwi said. He added one should be very careful about oxygen saturation. “We should use pulse oximeter to measure oxygen saturation level. If the oxygen level is below 94, one should take oxygen supplements at home or hospital,” he said. Experts said ayurvedic treatment is also highly beneficial to fight Covid. K K Prashad, an ayurvedic practitioner, said plenty of warm fluids should be consumed in order to boost immunity. “The fluids should contain tulsi, giloy, black pepper, cinnamon and cumin seeds. These fluids should be consumed at least twice a day. Consumption of lemon and hot water should be increased. Any kind of cold liquid or food should be avoided. Steam inhalation for 2-5 minutes is also very beneficial,” he added. General physician Dr Ramesh Prashad Shrivastava said the best home remedy is consuming warm fluids or certain juices. “Consumption of Vitamin-C tablets and lemons are also highly beneficial. There are some supportive treatments that we can do to overcome the virus like taking Vitamin- D supplements in liquid forms, Vitamin C and multivitamin tablets. Water vapour should be taken regularly as the virus is killed at 70-degree temperature. Consumption of hot food and liquid is important,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/proper-diet-steam-inhalation-key-to-fighting-covid-experts/articleshow/82122050.cms||---
---||Goa||Important to keep players injury free when training resumes post lockdown: UKESG||Panaji: The UK Elite Sports Group has told India’s youth coaches that there is serious risk of injuries as football looks to make a return after a year of being locked down due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic brought football to a standstill across the world last March. While professional football did make an immediate return, youth football took a beating, particularly in India with the All India Football Federation (AIFF) cancelling all tournaments. India is now in the middle of a second wave, deadlier than the first, and should youngsters return to the field, it should be slow and steady, said UKESG, one of England’s most trusted providers of youth sports coaching and sports education. “Mobility maintenance is a very, very important factor to consider when you return to training because 90 per cent of the injuries are caused by inadequate mobility,” Matt Lewis, head of training and development, told coaches and players from the Reliance Foundation Youth Sports (RFYS) during a webinar. Since most youth players have not been able to train properly, they could be at risk of getting injured, if they push themselves too much, too soon. “We love football, can’t wait to get back to the field and do the thing that we love. But the most important aspect from a player and coach point of view is to keep everyone injury free,” said Lewis, who has over 15 years’ experience in delivering high quality school sports and PE within UK. Even when the players return to training, Lewis said plenty of precautions need to be taken. “Make sure you bring your own water bottles, something you may have been doing anyway. In times of the pandemic, it’s important that you bring your own (water bottles), keep them at a safe distance, away from others. “It’s always better to arrive in your training kit, rather than change (at the ground). During a session, try and avoid physical contact wherever possible, use feet to collect balls. Try and not pick the football by hands,” Lewis said during the webinar jointly organised by RFYS and UKESG. The webinar also provided insights into areas such as, why keeping active during lockdown is important, what does being active do to the mind and the impact on mental health. “The session helped us understand how to bring about awareness to parents and athletes and taught us how educating them around physical and mental health is vital,” said Thilasi Raman from the Chennai Premier Soccer School. Snarmon Lato from Shillong College said he now has clarity on how he should resume training sessions for his players. “Everyone will return to training soon, so it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement and try too many things. The workshop taught me that sticking to basics is the most effective way. “The athletes have been sitting at home for close to a year now, without playing any football. It is vital to communicate to them that they need to condition themselves all over again,” said Lato.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/important-to-keep-players-injury-free-when-training-resumes-post-lockdown-ukesg/articleshow/82133753.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Parents must keep teens engaged with constant and constructive engagement’||With board exams getting either cancelled or postponed, students are looking at either a period of academic uncertainty or months of basically doing nothing. Being at the age they are, between 15-16, the months ahead of being cooped up inside their homes and sharing space with one or more generations is bound to lead to some friction. Well-known adolescent counsellor, Dr Rajiv Mohta (psychologist and MD paediatrics), talks to TOI about how both teenagers and their parents must handle the next couple of months till the next academic session starts. Excerpts from an interview... Q. While many are happy that board exams have been cancelled, there are quite a few who are disappointed. A. Of course, there will always be two different opinions about every situation people face in life. But now these teenagers are in the process of becoming young adults and they must introspect their opinion, either in favour or against the decision. The most important part is — can they do anything about it? If the board or the government takes a decision then the issue is no more in control of students. So to fret, ponder and get mentally worked up over things which are beyond your control is meaningless. Instead, try to take every situation as a learning phase which will make you mentally stronger later in life. Q. For those students whose board exams have been cancelled, there is really nothing to do for three to four months. They can’t even step out. A. It’s definitely a testing time for them. At a time when their mind is constantly seeking some kind of visual or mental engagement, having months of free time and very less chance of outstation visits means a natural tilt towards increased screen time. Now these teenagers have to show self discipline and self care because they are at that threshold of their life when they crossover to a road where they have to travel alone. Teachers and parents will simply become facilitators, the hand holding stops. They have to show self reliance by sorting out their priorities. Q. Many teenagers will argue that this is their summer vacation, a time to chill out. A. The first step is to change the way teenagers define the word summer vacation. I think the world has moved on from the school-exam-vacation calendar and its stereotypical meaning. Now summer vacations mean a time when you can upgrade or upskill in the area which you like. It could be reading, craft or something academic. Indulge in your hobbies and try to move on to the next level. So if you like writing poems, not only write it but also join some online courses related to it. From now summer vacations must mean a time when your ‘liking’ and ‘learning’ converge. And this has to be a self-discovery kind of a process where teenagers learn to understand what they like, and vice-versa. Q. Many parents now foresee months of bad habit forming for their teenaged children, like sleeping, watching TV or mobile late into the night etc. A. Parents’ concerns are absolutely valid but to resolve these issues they have to rethink their approach. In fact, they need to completely change it. Parents unfortunately are guilty of communicating with teenagers with a prejudiced mind. For example while waking up the kid who has overslept, parents will shout “get up you lazy bum, is this the time to sleep, you will waste your life sleeping” etc. For girls who don’t show interest in cooking, unfortunately many parents spew off the stereotypical dialogues like “what will you do after marriage, how will you cook etc”. Times are changing and teenagers do not respond well to such type of comments. Instead ask the boy or girl, “how will you cook if tomorrow you have to shift abroad for higher education or a job”. Now that’s a paradigm shift the way you communicate, while the end goal remains the same. Q. The problem is that many teenagers will simply ask what to do after getting up early. They can’t step out of the house, exams are cancelled and online classes for next session won’t start till July or August. A. Here parents have to put in that extra effort. I repeat that teenagers are turning into young adults and it’s high time to give them responsibility. They must be given household chores, grocery budget tracking type of activities. Teenagers have too much energy and that’s why it is crucial to keep them engaged constantly but at the same time, make them feel proud of that activity. When parents give responsibility to teenagers, they are slowly eased into the young adult phase. Teenagers love being taken seriously and considered at par with adults. So parents have to start handing out small responsibilities, like paying bills online or ordering something online to teenagers. Q. Screen time is a major concern. Teenagers are hooked to phones. A. Smartphones and technology are realities that parents have to deal with. Zero screen time is impossible because classes happen online. For entertainment purpose, parents must speak to children about their concerns over cyber safety. Let the teenagers know that they must not share photos, numbers or any personal data online. Restrict their screen time, but after talking to them. It should not sound like a punishment, but rather an activity in self-restriction. If teenagers feel that parents are forcefully imposing something, they will rebel. So for example if the teenager is watching YouTube, ask him/her to share one interesting video in the family group. It could be an inspirational video, some travel documentary or a cooking show. But by doing so, parents become a part of their teenage kids’ online life as well. You may not be able to track each and every thing teenagers do online, but by collaborating with them this way parents will be more involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/parents-must-keep-teens-engaged-with-constant-and-constructive-engagement/articleshow/82121583.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Two such cases were reported on Saturday, one from Gondal in Rajkot where a man slit his throat and another from Ahmedabad where the infected patient jumped to death from 5th floor of the hospital building. Jayanti Chotangiya (60) from Gondal, who was infected with coronavirus for around a week, killed himself at a dargah on Saturday. A resident of Vora Kotda road in Gondal, Chotangiya was ill for around a week and his sons had even brought an oxygen cylinder after he tested positive for Covid-19. But as his condition was not improving, the family was planning to admit him to Rajkot Civil Hospital on Saturday. But Chotangiya left home around 11.30am without telling anyone. When he was not found at home, his younger son called him to know where he was. Chotangiya told him that he was at the dargah where he often used to worship and will be back home shortly. After talking with the caretaker of the dargah for a while, Chotangiya went inside for offering prayers. When he did not come out, the caretaker went inside and found Chotangiya lying in a pool of blood. The caretaker informed Chotangiya’s sons and the police. His sons told cops that Chotangiya was upset after testing Covid-19 positive and did not want to get hospitalized. Meanwhile, Rasik Thakore (65), who was hospitalized in Shardaben Hospital in Ahmedabad after testing positive for coronavirus, jumped to death from the fifth floor of the hospital. Thakor was hospitalized on April 11. Sources said that Thakor was mentally perturbed by death and disease around him in the Covid-19 ward and jumped to his death early on Saturday morning around 6 am. On April 15, Sunil Bhalsod (44), who was admitted to Sanjeevani Gurukul Hospital in Rajkot, ended his life by hanging himself from a windowpane using his oxygen tube. Bhalsod, a resident of Sant Kabir Road, had tested positive for coronavirus on April 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/corona-drives-2-patients-to-suicide-in-gondal-ahmedabad/articleshow/82121589.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Coming soon: More beds, testing centres, oxygen & ventilators||NAGPUR: With the city facing a severe bed crisis and also witnessing a consistent rise in active Covid-19 patients, public representatives, officials and private hospitals have separately facilitated the adding of 496 beds to the existing capacity. Another 1,846 are likely to be added in the coming days. Also in city’s arsenal on Sunday to tackle the pandemic will be 125 ventilators and a mobile testing laboratory in the next five days with a capacity to conduct 2,000 tests per day. There are 8,128 beds available for Covid patients as on Saturday in the district. This will go up to 10,470 beds if the plans materialize but will still be short to meet the rising requirements. As on Saturday, active cases were 66,208 in the district. As per state government’s guidelines, 20% need treatment in hospitals which means the requirement is likely to be of 13,242 beds. The active cases are likely to increase if the district continues to register cases at the current rate. Director of National Cancer Institute Shailesh Joglekar told TOI that 60 beds with oxygen supply are functional at its Jamtha facility. “We will start 25 more beds on Monday, 10 beds in ICU on Wednesday and another 25 beds with oxygen supply on Thursday. There are plans to further increase the beds,” he said. In a press release, the district administration on Saturday claimed that 436 beds with oxygen supply have been set up at at sub-district and rural hospitals in Nagpur Rural. “1,792 beds are in operation in Nagpur Rural as on Saturday. Earlier, there were 1,356 beds. 1,247 beds are with oxygen supply, 88 with ventilators and others are non-oxygen beds,” the release said. After visiting the ESIC hospital and Haj House, district guardian minister Nitin Raut instructed that a 200-bed Covid hospital and a 100-bed Covid Care Centre be set up. “They will start from Monday,”he said. Ayurvedic Hospital with 180 beds and Pakwasa with 136 beds are also being converted as Covid hospitals within the next two weeks. “The doctors and healthcare staff of Ayurvedic College are currently posted in other hospitals on Covid duties. So, it will take a couple of more days to arrange the staff. Pakwasa Hospital is run by a private institution and will take a longer time to complete the process,” said Raut. Raut also said a Jumbo Covid Hospital with 600 beds will be set up at the Divisional Sports Complex. “The agency which developed and is operating the Jumbo Hospital in Pune will submit a proposal on Sunday. We will try to increase beds to 800,” he said. The guardian minister also said there are additional 420 beds at GMCH (300) and IGGMCH (120) now. “GMCH has totally 900 beds out of which 300 are in ICU. IGGMCH has 580 — 136 in ICU and 122 with ventilators,” said Raut. In a first-of-its-kind initiative, Kingsway Hospital in association with Centre Point Hotel has planned a CCC with 150 beds at Centre Point Hotel, Ramdaspeth. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, “We approved CCCs with oxygen and non-oxygen beds at eight private hotels and all are in operation. More CCCs in private hotels will be approved soon.” Director of Kingsway Hospital Amit Somani said that a CCC with 150 beds will start in a phased manner from Sunday and increase to 200. “40 beds will be with oxygen. We are already operating 220 Covid beds at the hospital. We will shift patients who require oxygen and observation to the hotel. It will help free up beds for critical patients. “Mild and moderate symptomatic patients will also be admitted directly to the CCC. They will be referred to Kingsway Hospital or any other Covid hospital in case of further treatment. The rates are affordable,” said Somani. The NMC is also likely to start a Covid hospital at KT Nagar and Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital by Monday. “Two NGOs are supporting this,” said Radhakrishnan. The two hospitals will start with 50 beds and increase to 240 over a period of time. The KT Nagar hospital was facilitated by MLC Parinay Fuke. “Pravin Jain (activist), myself and others have planned this. The Ramesh Fuke Patil Charitable Trust will run it along with NMC. 3 MD physicians, 7 MBBS doctors, 4 BAMS doctors, 30 nurses and other staff will be made available,” said Fuke. Union minister Nitin Gadkari has facilitated 125 ventilators from a company. The NMC is likely to receive them on Sunday. They will be distributed to GMCH, IGGMCH and some private hospitals. Gadkari on Saturday also declared open a 200-bed CCC at Kusumtai Wankhede Hall in Dharampeth. It would be operated by Viveka Hospital. Its director Satish Lade said he has ordered the premises cleaned. “We would be starting the facility next week with a few beds and eventually reach 200 in phases. Only the mild symptomatic patients will be treated here. The minister has assured supply of oxygen cylinders, ventilators and essential drugs like Remdesivir,” he said. Radhakrishnan said the Mobile Testing Laboratory started its journey from New Delhi to Nagpur on Saturday and is expected to reach within five days. “The company claimed it will do 2,000 RT-PCR tests daily. Rates are likely to be Rs 300 per test. Results will be out within 4-5 hours,” he said. The district is currently doing 15,000 RT-PCR tests in a day and it takes up to 2 days for the results to be given to the patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coming-soon-more-beds-testing-centres-oxygen-ventilators/articleshow/82122546.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Pune||Caregivers, e-commerce delivery persons exempted from Covid test||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Saturday issued an order exempting household helps, e-commerce and food delivery persons, employees of restaurants, hotels, bars, private transport drivers and persons providing healthcare to senior citizens and those unwell and at home from the mandatory RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests. The order of the civic chief, Vikram Kumar, allowed opticians to keep their shops open from 7am to 6pm from Monday to Friday. It also gave permission to operate mess on all days from 7am to 8pm, but only for parcels. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal commissioner also issued an order on the same lines. Earlier in the first week of April, the state government had stated in its order that those involved in delivery of essentials through e-commerce, household helps, restaurant staffers and delivery persons would have to carry negative RT-PCR report valid for 15 days. The PMC had subsequently issued an order on the same lines, drawing flak from experts. They claimed that the decision lacked scientific basis and led to overburdening of the labs. In the fresh order issued on Saturday, the PMC announced the exemption from RT-PCR/rapid antigen tests as well as TruNAAT/CBNAAT. The order stated that these workers should get the vaccine doses at the earliest following the Union government guidelines. The civic chief’s order stated liquor shops could do home delivery from 7am to 6pm from Monday to Friday, according to the state excise department order. The Pune civic chief also told all the companies manufacturing oxygen to supply 100% of their product for medical use only. He said the firms should publish the list of oxygen users and suppliers. The PMC order told shops supplying raw material to companies involved in manufacturing products related to essential services to operate only for that purpose on point-to-point basis. These shops should not involve in retail sales, the order stated. The PMC also appealed to people to observe Ramzan at home and avoid processions, social gatherings or mass prayers in mosques or open spaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/caregivers-e-commerce-delivery-persons-exempted-from-covid-test/articleshow/82122069.cms||---

For wedding planners and vendors, who had suffered huge losses in the last three wedding seasons, the April-May season is likely to be another disappointment. “We are struggling for survival,” said Yuvraj Shambhu, owner of a marriage hall on Ashiana-Digha Road. Siddharth Singh, owner of a banquet hall on Bypass, said 10 pre-booked weddings got rescheduled in a span of one week. “To keep up with the latest trend, we have to update our interiors every year. However, financial crisis due to the pandemic has made it difficult for us to do business,” he added. Most couples have rescheduled their wedding dates to later half of the year. Those who have not are in a fix due to the limitations on number of guests. “Deciding who to invite and who to leave is a herculean task. The restrictions have curtailed our plans,” said Amit Kumar of Dighwara in Saran district. Puja Tiwari, whose brother was to get married in Patna, has now shifted the wedding venue to their native village. “We have invited only our close relatives due to the pandemic. The wedding venue has been changed as villages are still safer than urban locations,” she said. Adjusting to the situation, wedding planners have come up with creative ways to make Covid era weddings safer. “Now that budgets have shrunk, more intricate details can be added to the celebrations,” said Aayush Agarwal, a wedding planner. Kumar Vikram, who will tie the knot in May as per schedule, said, “We will be keeping our celebrations small without compromising on the excitement and fun.” The resurgence of Covid-19 has also affected jewellery sales during wedding season. Vipin Kumar, sales executive of a jewellery shop at Maurya Lok Complex, said, “As weddings are being rescheduled due to rise in cases, sales are not up to our expectations.” Flower vendors, band members, mehndi artists and owners of catering units and tent houses are the worst hit due to restrictions on number of attendees, which has also resulted in cancellation of other events, such as birthday parties and business conferences. Dr Sujai Ranjan Bose, who had planned to celebrate the ‘annaprashan’ of his newborn daughter, had to cancel the celebrations because of the pandemic, forfeiting huge loss in form of advances paid for different items and services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/wedding-planners-hit-hard-as-marriages-being-postponed/articleshow/82122080.cms||---

Government Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital dean Dr P Vasanthamani said from an average 250kg a month in pre-Covid times, the hospital disposed 3,500kg to 4,000kg waste every month between July and October 2020. Of the 450 Covid beds, 320 are now occupied. “From 905kg in February 2021, it rose to 1,617kg last month.  But we streamlined the collection and disposal during last year’s peak. We have built a shed to segregate and keep Covid waste separate,” she said. Initially, between May and July 2020, the hospital generated nearly 26,000kg waste as leftover food and packaging material from the bedside were also treated as biomedical waste. “Then, food waste was disposed as general waste after guidelines were revised.” Around 112 private hospitals in Chennai, of the 387 in the state, are treating Covid patients. More than 55 city hospitals have less than five beds vacant or are full. In August 2020, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board officials say 10 of the 12 common biomedical waste treatment facilities (CBMWTFs) incinerated an average 27 tonnes a day of Covid waste. Last month, the quantity dropped to five tonnes a day, but the daily average from April 1 to 12 was seven tonnes. The 12 CBMWTFs have the capacity to handle 55.167 tonnes a day An official from Tamil Nadu Waste Management Ltd, one of the two companies handling Covid waste from hospitals in Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur, said biomedical waste collected from around 1,000 hospitals rose from 3,000kg a day to 5,000kg a day during the first wave in 2020 and the firm struggled as drivers and pickers refused to work. “We are expecting the load to go up in the coming days. But unlike last year, we have manpower, all safety gear and sanitized vehicles,” he said. Harish Manian, CEO of MGM Healthcare, said they brought down the weight of the Covid waste by allowing staff in low risk zones like visitor screening areas to wear lightweight safety gear compared to high risk zones like ICUs. From an average 200kg of just Covid waste a day, the total waste now is around 300kg. TNPCB chairman A V Venkatachalam said the waste increased manifold last year. “But we diligently reviewed the situation and found installed capacity of our CBMWTFs is phenomenally high. That’s why we did not face any hardship in the management of biomedical waste.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/as-hospitalizations-go-up-so-does-covid-waste/articleshow/82122085.cms||U Tejonmayam

The official said the consent letters should have the employer’s name, mobile number, address and Aadhaar number. Details about the house helps — including their names, contact numbers, address and Aadhaar card numbers — should also be mentioned in the letter along with the places from where they would be travelling. “A passport-sized photo of the house help should be pasted or stapled to the letter. They need to show the letter to the bus conductor if they want to board a bus,” the official said. House helps said the regulation was confusing and a hassle. “The employers would not want their details in the consent forms in a majority of the cases. Secondly, I work in three households and travel from Salunke Vihar Road to Undri and then to Fatimanagar. In such a case, how many letters will I need?” asked Anita Ambad.Rajendra Jagtap, the chairman and managing director of the PMPML, said, “A majority of maids work in different households in one particular area. If they work in different areas, it is preferred that they should have different consent letters. If the employer wants them to come and work, they shouldn’t have a problem giving them the consent letters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/employers-letters-must-for-domestic-helps-to-avail-buses/articleshow/82122078.cms||Joy Sengupta

Usually, the delay in clearing drains would lead to flooding of streets and residential areas in the commercial town of the taluka, thereby causing inconvenience to citizens when pre-monsoon showers are experienced. The Canacona Municipal Council’s (CMC) engineer, who is entrusted with the execution of the work, said that he would depute workers in all wards as per their availability, and councillors would be free to utilise the services of the workers as per their requirements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pre-monsoon-works-begin-in-canacona/articleshow/82122557.cms||---

---||Pune||Travel plans from Maharashtra hit air pocket due to protocols||PUNE: The stringent restrictions for travellers from Maharashtra imposed by the Bihar government are turning out to be a big hurdle for Mumbai resident Pooja Singh, who desperately wants to fly to Patna to help her parents who have tested Covid-19 positive there. “The Bihar government’s regulations include a mandatory 10-day home quarantine even if one has an RT-PCR negative report. How am I supposed to help my parents if I am locked up at home for 10 days? My brother, who is in Pune, is trying to find if there’s any exemption in case of emergency travel,” Sinha told TOI. Stringent and constantly changing travel regulations imposed by several states (see graphic) on passengers from Maharashtra have forced many flyers from Pune to either cancel their trips or opt for other ways to reach their homes. Nishikant Singh, a resident of Hajipur (near Patna) and currently staying in Wakad, said, “Why should I be in home quarantine when I have an RT-PCR negative report? I had a family function to attend later this month but had to cancel the trip due to this.” A WhatsApp message sent to Patna airport director BCH Negi about possible exemptions from home quarantine in case of emergency travel remained unanswered till the time of going to the press. The West Bengal government has told airlines to disallow boarding of any passenger from Maharashtra not having an RT-PCR negative report. Samudra Majumdar, a working professional living in Baner, said, “Getting an RT-PCR negative report in time has become a major struggle in Pune. So I took a flight to Delhi, got my report within 24 hours and then travelled to Kolkata. It cost me an additional Rs5,000. But I avoided hassles.” Pune resident Amol Gole told TOI, “I travelled to Kolkata on Sunday with a Covid negative report. I was not asked for the report till the time of boarding. I returned two days later, with the flight stopping over in Bhubaneswar. Nobody asked for the negative report till I departed, landed in Pune and checked out of the gate.” . Animesh Poddar, who was to travel to Delhi on April 18 and has spent Rs13,000 on the tickets, said, “I tried to get reports for my family and myself in Pune. But all labs said the waiting time for the report is at least six days. We don’t want to be in institutional quarantine and decided to cancel the trip.” No report check at railway stationManoj Jhawar, public relations officer of the Pune rail division, said the passengers were not checked for the RT-PCR negative reports. “We are not stopping anyone from travelling if they have a confirmed ticket. The respective states will check the reports,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/travel-plans-from-state-hit-air-pocket-due-to-protocols/articleshow/82122066.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Class X students with poor scores through year hit?||Mumbai: As most boards have called off class X exams and explore a school-based assessment, teachers and parents feel not only could grades differ from one school and board to another, it could be a raw deal for students who did not perform well through the year. Earlier this week, CBSE and CISCE announced that class X exams were cancelled and that they would issue criterion on how students must be marked. The boards said students could appear for offline exams whenever they are conducted. International boards — IB and Cambridge — have proposed a school-assessed grades process. Maharashtra school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said the state board would consult experts to consider the option. SSC exams have currently been postponed. But with marking expected to be decentralized, teachers are worried about the students’ performance. “Prelims are not mandated by the board, and this year many schools did not take exams due to logistics. Many of our students were out of the city and had limited connectivity. These students have not even studied well throughout the year. Every school has done what was in the best interest of students during the tiring times of pandemic,” said Jagdish Indalkar, principal, KVK Public School, Ghatkopar. Another teacher from a state board school pointed out that their children could be at a loss. “International and national boards follow a regular assessment pattern through assignments and tests throughout the year. In state board schools, a lot depends on the final exam. We usually see students score lower in prelims than boards as they have an extra month to study and can rectify what they did wrong in practice tests,” she said. Experts said there was an urgent need for uniformed guidelines to avoid inflation of marks. “I would have preferred an assessment framework developed by the central government for ‘internal assessments’, which every education board and state could follow, to ensure a common level playing field and equity among learners. Its absence could lead to huge inflation of marks and disparity,” said Francis Joseph of School Leaders’ Network Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-class-x-students-with-poor-scores-through-year-hit/articleshow/82122565.cms||Vinamrata Borwankar
---||Pune||Truck movement to & from Maha dives to half||Pune: Transportation of fruits, vegetables and even raw material for various industries has taken a hit following a 50% drop in truck movement in and out of Maharashtra since the imposition of the stringent Covid-19 restrictions and weekend lockdown earlier this month. “The main reason is stringent restrictions and fear of the virus, which is preventing trucks from other states like Punjab, Karnataka and Rajasthan from entering Maharashtra despite transport of goods, essentials and raw materials being out of the ambit of the current restrictions. There is also dearth of drivers after many fled Maharashtra fearing lockdown,” Bal Malkit Singh, chairman - core committee, All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), told TOI on Saturday. He said the impact has been stark, with rough estimates indicating that daily truck movement to and from Maharashtra has dropped from 70,000 to 80,000 trucks (industrial and essential goods) earlier to 25,000-35,000 now. Singh said movement of trucks from other states like Madhya Pradesh, which bring food grains and pulses, or those transporting mangoes from Ratnagiri or onions from Nashik to other parts of the country, has been affected. “This is causing supply chain issues, which are likely to increase in the coming days, especially in fast-moving consumer goods,” he said. Pramod Bhavsar, co-chairman, AIMTC and Association of Transporters, Pune, told TOI, “Transport of outstation goods from states like MP, Gujarat, Harayana, Rajasthan have been affected, especially due to stringent curbs in Maharashtra,besides fear of Covid-19.” Bhavsar said supply chain had already been affected as vehicles coming from the other states had dropped by over 50%. “Pune normally has an inflow of around 10,000 outstation trucks per day, which has now dropped to about 1500-2000 since the stringent curbs and rise in Covid cases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/truck-movement-to-from-maha-dives-to-half/articleshow/82122086.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Chandigarh||Direct payment for wheat: In Punjab, arthiyas fear loss of control, farmers await resulting freedom||Bathinda: Direct benefit transfer (DBT) for the purchase of wheat has started in Punjab, but issue is not yet settled. While commission agents (arhtiyas) are calling it a cumbersome system, farmers say they are still learning how it works. Though the system was meant to make direct payment to farmers for their produce, arhtiyas are involved at every step. It is only after the arhtiya presses the ‘pay now’ button that the money gets transferred into the farmer’ account and both simultaneously get intimation of it. Arhtiyas have termed the system as “extra burden” on them without any additional monetary benefits. Once arhtiyas transfer the money to the farmers, they then make demand for repayment of the loan given to the farmer or interest instalment due. Federation of Arhtiya Association Punjab president Vijay Kalra claimed: “The system is very cumbersome and not in the benefit of arhtiyas and farmers. If this is continued, some of the arhtiyas could soon exit the business as it increases their workload without any extra monetary benefit.” Punjab Arhtiyas Association president Ravinder Singh Cheema alleged that the system was “tailor-made against arhtiyas” and was also not in favour of farmers. “This will not last long as we will oppose this system. The farmers will have to wait longer for getting payment under this system,” he alleged. On the condition of anonymity, an arhtiya said, “Earlier, farmers used to visit us to get payment after selling their produce. Now, we will have to keep on visiting farmers to get repayment of loan given to them of its interest instalment. We will be virtually on the mercy of the farmers.” In Amritsar too, there were skeptical reactions. “Though there is no income tax on farm income yet many farmers have received the income tax notices. This is one of the reasons against DBT,” claimed local farmer leader Rattan Singh Randhawa. He said after months of hard toil in fields, farmers were impatient to sell their produce and receive the payment in cash. A farmer Gurmukh Singh said he was sitting in the grain market for two days but there were no gunny bags. Besides, he said, the stringent specifications of FCI were not condusive for them. “The previous system of getting payment from commission agents was better,” he added. Sanyukt Kisan Morcha’s Harmeet Singh Kadian also claimed the system was not well-suited for farmers, leave alone the arhtiyas. Most farmers, however, said they were learning about the system. “It may take time in getting fully functional and start giving good results,” they opined. How does it work? As per the new system, the arhtiya gets a farmer registered on ‘anajkharid.in’ portal by uploading Aadhaar number, mobile number and copy of cancelled cheque (for bank account details). The arhtiya will upload details of quantity of purchases made in the day from any number of farmers (say 4-5 in a day) who have sold the foodgrain to government procurement agencies through him. Upon uploading the details, the I-Form will be generated and representative of the relevant procurement agency will provide hard copy of I Form to the arhtiya who will upload it on portal with all relevant details and then an virtual button of ‘pay now’ will be shown on the portal. The arhtiya will have to press the ‘pay now’ button within 48 hours to make payment to the farmers. Otherwise the entire purchase of the day will get cancelled and the whole process will have to be done afresh. Upon pressing of the ‘pay now’ buttom, produce payment will be transferred in the bank account of the farmers. Both farmer and arhtiya will simultaneously get intimation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/direct-payment-for-wheat-in-punjab-arthiyas-fear-loss-of-control-farmers-await-resulting-freedom/articleshow/82122568.cms||Neel Kamal

On Saturday, flight I5-741 took off from Bengaluru at 11.30 am. When it was close to Delhi, captain Kiran Sangwan found a note in the lavatory, which read: “There is a bomb on board, I will blast it as soon as it reaches Delhi.” The captain informed Delhi ATC, seeking priority landing around 1.53pm. The airport, in turn, alerted CISF that swung into action and formed a threat assessment panel as per the protocol for such situations. “At 2.07 pm, the flight landed and was parked at an isolation bay. All 159 passengers — 155 adults and four infants — were deplaned at the isolation bay along with their hand bags. The aircraft, all baggage and passengers were checked thoroughly by CISF personnel. The threat turned out to be a hoax. The aircraft was released for flights in a few hours by security agencies,” said a source. On the basis of handwriting test and profiling, police zeroed in on 12 passengers and took them to IGI police station for further investigation, the source added. The other passengers were allowed to leave. An AirAsia India spokesperson said: “Flight I5 741 from Bengaluru to New Delhi on Saturday was subject to a bomb threat while en route. The crew took all necessary precautions and landed at Delhi uneventfully. The aircraft was taken to an isolation bay till clearance by authorities, and all guests and crew were deplaned safely. .” The spokesperson added that security procedures were initiated as per laid down norms and an investigation is currently ongoing. “AirAsia regrets the disruption in travel plans of our guests on account of circumstances beyond our control. We are reaching out and providing all possible assistance to all our affected guests,” they said. Incidentally the first person to be put on no fly list in India was a Mumbai jeweller who had left a hoax hijack note on a Jet Airways’ Mumbai-Delhi flight. On October 30, 2017, Mumbai-based jeweller Birju Kishore Salla had allegedly left a note in the business class lavatory of a Jet Airway flight to Delhi which read: “9W 339 is covered by hijackers and a/c (aircraft) should not land and (be) flown straight to POK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir)….. Cargo area contains explosive bombs and will blast if you land in DEL (Delhi).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-bomb-threat-on-flight-12-flyers-under-lens/articleshow/82123285.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Anand Kishor, chairman of the board of directors of the PSCL and principal secretary of the urban development and housing department (UDHD), gave his nod for the beautification of the outer periphery of Gandhi Maidan, including the construction of four new entrances as well as illumination around the Maidan. The beautification work around the historic Maidan will utilise funds to the tune of Rs10.78crore. It was also decided to chalk up a plan to develop an automated puzzle parking system across the city, including at the Maurya Lok complex, at the Tumtum stand near the railway station, at Pant Bhawan and Vidyut Bhawan, and Pili Kothi near Boring Canal Road. The automated parking will also come up at the old milk market near the railway station and in front of the Vikas Bhawan. The PSCL chairman asked officials to prepare the plans for the proposed parking systems and get necessary no-objection certificates so that approval for the projects can be taken up in the next board meeting. In another important decision, the PSCL board gave its nod for the construction of a wider road between Beer Chand Patel Marg and Vidyut Bhawan, providing smooth connectivity of vehicles to Bailey Road and easing the vehicular congestion at the Income Tax roundabout.

In a letter addressed to the DMs, the SEC secretary Yogendra Ram said the process of providing M2 EVMs for the election to the three-tier Panchayati raj system is underway. Notably, this is for the first time when panchayat elections are to be held by using EVMs. The decision to use M2 EVMs was taken at a meeting with the Election Commission of India in New Delhi on Thursday. The EC has written to the electoral officers of all states and respective election commissions, the SEC secretary revealed. The senior officers of the two companies—ECIL and BEL—which manufacture M2 EVMs have been requested for physical verification. Earlier, ballot papers were used for the Panchayat election. “The purpose behind introducing EVMs in the panchayat polls is to make the entire process transparent. Earlier fingers were raised over the election as ballot papers were used,” a senior official of the SEC said.

Nasa says occultation is a phenomena when one object passes in front of another that is smaller. Space Geeks Mumbai, which focuses on space and astronomy, captured the drama by attaching a mobile camera to an eight-inch telescope and streamed it live in its YouTube channel. Chintamani Pai, co-founder of Space Geeks, said in Mumbai, Mars went behind the moon at 5.31pm and reappeared as a red dot in the night sky at 7.19pm. He explained that occultation takes place “due to periodic motion of moon around Earth, and also Earth and Mars around sun.’’ It generally takes place twice a year. The occultation was mainly over some Asian countries covering a large part of India. While most star-struck people observed the event on YouTube at home, few tried to watch it directly. The moon covered Mars completely for around 90 minutes. Pai said that sometimes occultation can have an impact on communications, with those spacecraft orbiting Mars or which have landed on Red Planet. The event comes as the moon and Mars are attracting public attention because of two major space mission; Nasa’s Artermis programme aims to land the first woman and man on the south pole region of the moon by 2024, and Nasa’s Perseverance rover with the Ingenuity helicopter which touched down on the Red Planet on February 18/19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-awe-as-moon-covers-mars-for-90-minutes/articleshow/82123279.cms||Srinivas Laxman

Tragedy struck when the couple - both in their late 50s - tested positive for Covid-19 on April 7 and after a week, first the wife and then the husband passed away during treatment at a Bareilly hospital. The shocked family has suspended the wedding and all its members have been placed under isolation. Sadly, the husband had tested negative for Covid, and was kept under 72-hour observation for a second test and getting ready to be discharged. The elderly couple was admitted to the Bareilly hospital after they complained of breathing difficulties and low oxygen level. The husband was tested negative on April 15, but he died a day later at the hospital, possibly due to comorbidities, Dr Ranjan Gautam, the district surveillance officer said. His wife died on April 13. They are survived by four children. Two of them work in banks, one is a chartered accountant and the fourth one is preparing for civil services examination after completing LLB. "The elderly man's death is not included in the total Covid toll count. So far, seven individuals have died during treatment at Covid facilities in Bareilly. The number of positive cases have risen post the first phase of panchayat polls,” Dr Gautam added. Meanwhile, more than 1,800 people have tested positive in Bareilly in the past four days. Several officials, including Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan, were reportedly infected after the panchayat polls. Night curfew has been already imposed in the district. “We appeal to everyone to maintain social distancing and strictly follow all the Covid guidelines. We have seven Covid facilities with vacant beds and no oxygen scarcity so far," Dr Gautam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/associate-prof-wife-fall-to-covid-days-before-daughters-wedding/articleshow/82121626.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The illegal immigrant, identified as Shahadat Hussain alias Payal Kumari, used to impersonate as transgender and dance in bars, nightclubs and shady hotels in New Delhi and other places. He is also accused of procuring Indian Aadhaar card through an agent in New Delhi and a cellphone number for carrying out illegal activities. “Additional district judge (ADJ)-11 of Bhagalpur district court Atulvir Singh found Shahadat guilty under Section 14 of The Foreigners Act of 1946, Section 414 of Indian Penal Code and Section 21(a) of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act of 1985 and awarded three-year jail term to him,” special public prosecutor of the court Shridhar Kumar Singh said. According to sources, Shahadat, a resident of Sonia-Ekra village under the Jamunabari police station area in Dhaka (Bangladesh), had entered India through porous international border of Bangladesh and Kaliachak in Malda district of West Bengal. He later migrated to Delhi along with others and started living there on fake identity under the garb of a transgender. Shahadat had also procured Indian Aadhaar card and indulged in smuggling of drugs. He also used to supply psychotropic drugs, including smack, to the conduits in Delhi. The Bhagalpur GRP personnel had arrested Shahadat on November 24, 2018 while he was on way to Malda by Brahmaputra Mail. Sources said Shahadat had first tried to convince the GRP personnel that he is a transgender and a valid citizen of India by showing them his Aadhaar card. However, he was taken into custody on suspicion and sent for medical examination, following which he was declared male. Subsequently, Shahadat spilled the beans after thorough cross-examination by the teams of GRP, local police and intelligence personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/court-awards-3-yr-jail-term-to-illegal-immigrant-from-bangladesh/articleshow/82122022.cms||Kumar Rajesh

They also burned tyres on the road and raised slogans against the local administration and civic body for not listening to their demands. After the beginning of summer season, various localities in Biharsharif and elsewhere in Nalanda district face acute scarcity of tap water every year. Asha Devi, one of the protesters, said residents of ward number 25 are not getting tap water for the last 15 days. “Women and children of the locality have to fetch water from different areas. The water pipeline in the locality should be connected with a functioning pump which was recently laid under ‘Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal’ scheme,” she said. Another protester, Munni Devi, said, “There is a wedding in my family. Howeer, lack of drinking water is a big problem.

Lalu, currently undergoing treatment at AIIMS in New Delhi under custody, is likely to be released next week after the formal processes are complete. During the hearing on Saturday, former Union minister and senior advocate Kapil Sibal argued on behalf of Lalu, saying that the RJD president had completed more than half of the maximum sentence of seven years’ rigorous imprisonment in the Dumka treasury case and was entitled to be released. Lalu’s family and party supporters were elated. While Lalu’s wife, former CM Rabri Devi, and their eldest daughter, Rajya Sabha member Misa Bharti, arrived at AIIMS Delhi, his sons and other daughters expressed happiness on social media. Lalu’s younger son, leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, thanked the high court. “But we are more concerned about his health now,” he said. Tejashwi said a decision on Lalu’s coming to Patna would depend on the advice of doctors attending to him at AIIMS Delhi. “He is suffering from different ailments, including of the kidney and heart. We don’t want to take any chances,” he said. Lalu’s elder son, Tej Pratap Yadav, tweeted, “The messiah of the poor and downtrodden is now back. Tell those who have been doing injustice to them that our leader is coming back.” One of Lalu’s daughters, Rohini Acharya, said she had got his ‘Eidi’ for which she has been observing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lalu-prasads-sentence-suspended-by-jharkhand-hc-set-to-walk-free/articleshow/82124650.cms||Chandrajit Banerjee
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Unique rapid antigen test drive nets 18 superspreaders||NAGPUR: The joint initiative of police and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to enforce the Covid ‘break the chain’restrictions, put in place by state up to April 30, by conducting rapid antigen tests of violators on Saturday led to the netting of around 18 ‘super spreaders’. All have been sent to institutional quarantine centres for 14 days after testing positive in a first-of-its-kind experimental action in the region. As per experts’ view, each super spreader could have infected around 200 persons in the city had they not been quarantined. Civic chief Radhakrishnan said people testing negative in this drive will not be asked to do RT-PCR test as is the norm.“This drive is not meant for testing of symptomatic and contacts of positive patients. Therefore, there is no need to make RT-PCR mandatory for such people,” he said. The cops have also taken action against 347 people for not wearing masks, 780 for violating Covid distancing and detained 491 vehicles. After a delayed start, the joint team managed to conduct 225 antigen tests at various locations like Old Katol Naka, Automotive Chowk, Manewada and Mayo Hospital Chowk. People who could not give a valid reason for stepping out of their houses were made to undergo RAT at the spot itself. The NMC on Saturday provided five teams for conducting RAT. The number of teams will be increased from Sunday. As per rules, citizens can move about only for emergency reasons and to avail of essential services. The unique enforcement drive was conceptualized by city police chief Amitesh Kumar and Radhakrishnan. Kumar said those who gave samples for the antigen test “were on the road for frivolous reasons”. “This drive would continue in the coming days too. Citizens should be prepared to be sent to institutional quarantine centres if found positive,” he added. The CP was present at the Old Katol Naka to question loiterers. “I got many tested after they gave silly excuses like going to ATM or office at 12.30 pm,” said Kumar who was accompanied by Zonal DCP Vinita S and DCP special branch Basavraj Teli. NMC chief Radhakrishnan B told TOI that the drive will help in containing spread of the disease. “It’s shocking that many people tested positive during the RAT drive on Saturday. Testing positive in RAT means the person is carrying high infection. Yet, they were moving about in public places,” he said. The civic body has been asking people to get tested if anyone shows symptoms. “We continue to seek people’s cooperation. High or low risk contacts of positive patients should remain at home to control the situation,” added Radhakrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unique-rat-drive-nets-18-superspreaders/articleshow/82122553.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

You could not fault the city for waking up with that April 2020-like feeling on Saturday — a la 1993 Hollywood movie “Groundhog Day” in which Bill Murray relives the same day endless times. But here, there was some escape. While all markets were shut, food delivery boys were found huddled outside numerous eating outlets across the city. Kundan was one of them. Standing outside an eating joint in Sector 35, he said they were happy that the UT administration has not stopped them for delivering food this time. “Last year, we faced a lot of inconvenience. Luckily, we are allowed to work and can earn our livelihood,” he said. Demand for home delivery of food items perked up. But remaining punctual was tough. Roshan, who works in an eating joint in Sector 34, said workers faced problems in reaching the shop in the morning owing to fewer buses and autos on the roads. “Although this lockdown is affecting our business as a customer cannot come to the shop, we are relieved that the administration has allowed home delivery,” he said, echoing Kundan’s sentiments. Roads were not devoid of vehicular movement, but cops were inconspicuous by their absence at many stretches. Suresh Singh, a resident of Sector 39 employed in the medical field, said he was surprised not to find any police check point on his route to Sector 22. “Nobody stopped me in the morning and in the evening too,” he said. Cops were, however, more than active in Manimajra. Police did not allow people to roam outside to buy milk and other dairy products, breaking up gatherings and telling vendors to supply milk and other products door-to-door. 10 held for violating norms Chandigarh Police arrested 10 people for violating weekend lockdown norms on Saturday. A total of 12 people were challaned for roaming on the roads without wearing masks, 52 for not maintaining social distancing and 22 for spitting at public places in past 24 hours. Police collected Rs 55,500 from the violators on Saturday. Police arrested two people for opening their factories at Industrial Area, Phase I, on Saturday. NO WORK FROM HOME FOR PVT OFFICES People complained many private offices forced employees to report for work in-person. In many sectors like 22, 31, and 34, many private offices were open SOUTH STEPS OUT Although situation was better in sectors, people were found roaming around freely in colonies and villages. Similar situation was witnessed in societies in the southern sectors TRAVELLERS MOVE ON Unaware of the lockdown, travellers coming from other states were not challaned by the police. Cops guided them at the entry points after checking their documents Rush at Sector 26 mandi There was a huge rush of vendors at the Sector 26 fruit and vegetable market.

She state also reported a surge in fatalities, with 419 deaths, the highest in nearly 200 days since October 2, when 424 deaths were recorded. It was the first time in months that the deaths crossed the 400 mark. The total caseload in the state reached 37.7 lakh and deaths touched 59,970. In Mumbai, cases continued to be under 9,000 for the third consecutive day with 8811 detections on Saturday. Deaths in the city were high at 51, taking the toll since March 2020 to 12,301. The tally has so far reached 5.7 lakh. “Although many presume that Mumbai has reached the peak, we want to look at the daily caseload for another week before agreeing,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said. Dr Ishwar Gilada, public health expert and secretary general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild (OMAG), said that the state was nearing its peak or was already at the peak. As per the data compiled by him, the state has reported a 4.7-fold jump in daily detections in the last 30 days, as against states like UP and Bihar, which reported 226- and 142-fold jump, respectively. The new cases in Maharashtra on March 10 were 13,659, which had gone up to 63,729 on Friday, April 16. Although social media has many messages seeking beds, oxygen and the antiviral remdesivir for patients, Kakani said the city had adequate facilities. The city has over 20,456 beds, with almost 20% of these vacant. “The fact that Mumbai has enough beds is borne out by the fact that we could between Friday evening and Saturday night transfer 168 patients, 40 of whom were critical, from six BMC hospitals to our bigger centres,” Kakani said. The transfers were necessitated by oxygen shortage. The second wave has affected the affluent classes in contrast to the first wave that swept across slums in the city. “As most patients coming in now are affluent, they prefer private beds,” a BMC official said. Private hospital beds have risen from 4,800 during the first wave to 6,610 now. While the recovery rate in the city has fallen from 96% in January to 82%, the doubling rate has improved from 33 days a week back to 44 days on Saturday. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region reported 17,975 cases and 85 deaths on Saturday.

The Indira Gandhi Science Complex Planetarium, popularly known as Taramandal, is planning to shut its gate for visitors as the footfall has sharply declined in the past two weeks, and maintenance cost has increased because of regular sanitisation and other safety protocols. Planetarium director Anant Kumar said they are waiting for the state government’s order for the closure. “We are expecting that the government will take some decision on Sunday regarding the closure given rising cases of Covid. We barely see 100 people throughout the day for the four scheduled shows. Due to a decline in the number of visitors, we reduced the screening to two,” he said. He added, “It will be better if the Planetarium remains closed till the situation gets normal as we have to sanitise the entire campus after each show.” Amitabh, the project coordinator of SKSC, said the ministry of culture has directed the museums, science centres and ASI monuments to remain shut till May 15 in the wake of the Covid-19 situation. The order was issued on Friday. “On weekdays, around 600-700 people visit the Centre while above 1,000 on weekends. Since the schools are closed, the footfall has sharply declined to 87-125 weekdays and 200 on weekends. Although, we sanitised the premises twice a day while once in a week by the Patna Municipal Corporation,” he said. Patna zoo also witnessed low footfall, which impacted its overall revenue. The zoo director Satyajeet Kumar told this newspaper on Saturday that since April 8, the footfall has declined by almost one-sixth. “As many as 1,380 people visited the zoo on Friday, against the daily average of 7,000 to 8,000 while on weekends 15,000 people used to visit but now it has declined. We are now screening one show in the interpretation centre per day against the four scheduled movies due to low turnout. On Friday only eight persons turned up for the movie,” Satyajeet said. The art, culture and youth affairs department on Saturday withdrew its order for the closure of gyms, sports complexes, sports grounds, indoor and outdoor stadiums and swimming pools. Ravi Parmar, principal secretary of the department told this newspaper on Saturday the previous order was issued inadvertently, so the order was withdrawn as the crisis management group will decide on the closure of gyms and other sporting grounds and centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/science-centre-closed-planetarium-zoo-to-follow-suit/articleshow/82122116.cms||Faryal Rumi

They were ill for the past one week and were on self-medication while carrying on with their work.

The state also reported 12 deaths — the highest recorded over a period of 24 hours during the second wave of the pandemic so far. On April 15 and 16, Telangana’s load of new cases stood at 3,307 and 3,840 respectively. In the steepest ever increase, the number of active cases in the state also jumped to 33,514, on Saturday, from 5,511 on April 1. With this, the total count of cases in Telangana has now touched 3,46,331 while the total number of recovered patients has hit 3,11,008. The death toll so far in the state is 1,809. About 50% the districts in the state, on Saturday, recorded over 100 cases of which five districts saw their numbers range between 200 and 600 cases. Hyderabad city and its outskirts, meanwhile, recorded a chunk of these cases with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) registering 598 new cases, Medchal Malkajgiri 435 cases, Ranga Reddy 326 cases and Sangareddy 235 cases. These four together accounted for 1,594 cases. Other districts that witnessed a surge in Covid-19 numbers were Nizamabad with 314 cases, Kamareddy (184), Nirmal (160) and Siddipet (111). State health authorities warned that of a further surge over the next few weeks. “The second wave is far more severe and is spreading fast. Since the virus has many mutations, people need to be extremely cautious and take all necessary Covid precautions,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, Telangana. The case fatality rate in the state is currently at 0.52% while the recovery rate has dropped to 89.8% from the 97.7% recorded in the beginning of the month. On Saturday, 1,26,235 samples were tested for the virus, taking the total count of tests so far in the state to 1.16 crore.

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra records another high with 67,123 new infections||MUMBAI: The state reported 67,123 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, the highest-ever for a day since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year. She state also reported a surge in fatalities, with 419 deaths, the highest in nearly 200 days since October 2, when 424 deaths were recorded. It was the first time in months that the deaths crossed the 400 mark. The total caseload in the state reached 37.7 lakh and deaths touched 59,970. In Mumbai, cases continued to be under 9,000 for the third consecutive day with 8811 detections on Saturday. Deaths in the city were high at 51, taking the toll since March 2020 to 12,301. The tally has so far reached 5.7 lakh. “Although many presume that Mumbai has reached the peak, we want to look at the daily caseload for another week before agreeing,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said. Dr Ishwar Gilada, public health expert and secretary general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild (OMAG), said that the state was nearing its peak or was already at the peak. As per the data compiled by him, the state has reported a 4.7-fold jump in daily detections in the last 30 days, as against states like UP and Bihar, which reported 226- and 142-fold jump, respectively. The new cases in Maharashtra on March 10 were 13,659, which had gone up to 63,729 on Friday, April 16. Although social media has many messages seeking beds, oxygen and the antiviral remdesivir for patients, Kakani said the city had adequate facilities. The city has over 20,456 beds, with almost 20% of these vacant. “The fact that Mumbai has enough beds is borne out by the fact that we could between Friday evening and Saturday night transfer 168 patients, 40 of whom were critical, from six BMC hospitals to our bigger centres,” Kakani said. The transfers were necessitated by oxygen shortage. The second wave has affected the affluent classes in contrast to the first wave that swept across slums in the city. “As most patients coming in now are affluent, they prefer private beds,” a BMC official said. Private hospital beds have risen from 4,800 during the first wave to 6,610 now. While the recovery rate in the city has fallen from 96% in January to 82%, the doubling rate has improved from 33 days a week back to 44 days on Saturday. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region reported 17,975 cases and 85 deaths on Saturday. Nashik division reported 108 deaths, the most in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-records-another-high-with-67123-new-infections/articleshow/82122590.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Chennai||Vivekh: Man who hung a thought at the end of laughter||CHENNAI: When it came to his comedy sketches in films, Vivekh worked with a two-track mind — first, he baited his audience with his slapstick slice of life vignettes, and then when he had them right where he wanted, delivered a punchline that silenced them into introspection. And for that he will always be remembered – the comedian with a message in his medium. The actor died at a hospital in Chennai on Saturday following a cardiac arrest. He was 59, and is survived by his wife and two daughters. "Vivekh was a jovial person with no ego," recalls N Mohan, manager to late director K Balachande who launched Vivekh’s career in 1987 with ‘Manadhil Urudhi Vendum’. The director’s next ‘Puthu Puthu Arthangal’ (1989) made Vivekh popular and there was no looking back. Vivekh acted in more than 200 movies, sharing screen space with generations of heroes from Rajinikanth to Dhanush. Over the years his fan following grew so much that his face began appearing on posters. Apart from comedies, he also began playing the protagonist and other character roles. In ‘Vellai Pookal’ (2019), for instance, he played the lead role of a retired police officer who goes to Seattle to reunite with his estranged son, while in ‘Dharala Prabhu’ (2020), he endeared himself to the audience as fertility expert Dr Kannadasan. Mohan says Vivekh’s sense of humour permeated his real life. Whenever Vivekh came to meet Balachander, he recalls, he used to bring a rose. After a few visits, the director chided him for it. So, the next time he brought him an apple. "When Balachander sir chided him again, he started offering him a pen," says Mohan. Before his tryst with celluloid, Vivekh had donned many roles — from a harmonium player at a temple in Madurai to a telephone operator with Madurai Telephones to junior assistant in the state Secretariat in the 1980s. That was when he became a member of the Madras Humour Club, where his acting skills were noticed by film producer Kalakendra Govindharaj, who introduced him to Balachander. "My first shot before the camera was with Vivekh for a scene in ‘Parthale Paravasam’ (2001)," says actor-director Samuthirakani, who was assisting Balachander then. "Sir said to me, if you want to learn to be an actor, act in this scene with Vivekh." Comedian Vadivelu, who has also acted with Vivekh, called his style acting "unique and simple". "His dialogue delivery reached the masses as it always carried a social message," he says. Over the years, his comedy began to take a social turn. On screen, he began using his roles to voice concerns about a range of raging issues such as population growth, idol worship, denial of rights for better education for the less privileged and female infanticide. A voracious reader, Vivekh would sometimes scour newspapers and magazines in between shots to incorporate current civic and social issues into his dialogues. Yoga partner and friend Vairamuthu says he was amazed by Vivekh’s knowledge on various subjects and that the two of them shared a strong bond over books and Tamil language. The industry gave Vivekh the moniker ‘Chinna Kalaivanar’, after yesteryear comedian N S Krishnan, who voiced similar concerns in the 1940s and 1950s was known as ‘Kalaivanar’. "He helped scores of people throughout his life. He practised what he preached on screen," says Samuthirakani. In 2010, the actor turned to activism and launched the ‘Green Kalam’ initiative, planting more than 30 lakh saplings. In 2018, he was part of TN government’s no-plastic drive urging people to go green. The following year, when Chennai was reeling under a water crisis, he campaigned for rainwater harvesting. Two days before his cardiac arrest, Vivekh urged people to stay safe and get vaccinated. "Death has no comic sense, that is the reason it took him away from us," says Vairamuthu. "Now the trees he planted will shed tears for him."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-who-hung-a-thought-at-the-end-of-laughter/articleshow/82122119.cms||D Govardan

Police said several persons had complained that they were duped by fraudsters claiming they were from a well-known finance firm. The callers would make the victims transfer money to a bank account under the pretext of loan disbursement processing fees and GST. Police, along with the representatives of the finance company whose name was being misused, raided the call centres last week and confirmed that they were fake. Two managers of the centres have been arrested. They have been identified as Imtiyaz Qureshi (29), a Thane resident and Shabana Charniya (25), a resident of Vashi. They led the cops to key accused — Kallan Mallik (53), Faizan Mallik (24) and Mohammad Usmani (20) — who were arrested from Delhi on Friday.

The minister, who spoke to MAUD principal secretary Arvind Kumar and GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar, said: “Utilise all available vehicles for spraying of sodium hypochlorite. If needed, hire additional vehicles for spraying. Utilise the Pattana Pragathi programme funds for taking up the special sanitisation.” He also urged officials to take up intensive spraying of sodium hypochlorite in public places. He said entomologists from municipal administration department should be on high alert and leaves of employees cancelled until further notice. Further, he asked MAUD authorities to coordinate with health department and take measures. “Conduct awareness campaigns about safety precautions to combat Covid. Ensure citizens wear masks all the time in public spaces,” the minister said. He asked officials to ensure all the remaining frontline workers from MAUD are administered the vaccine immediately. MAUD principal secretary Arvind Kumar asked authorities to ensure proper facilities at graveyards. “Ensure proper facilities like water, lighting, etc so that there is no issue in disposal of the dead,” an advisory read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spray-sodium-hypochlorite-in-all-public-places-says-ktr/articleshow/82122587.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||Chaiti Chhath ‘kharna’ remains a family affair||PATNA: Devotees on Saturday prepared ‘kharna’ prasada and shared it with immediate family members and neighbours on the second day of Chaiti Chhath festival, which began with the nahay-khay on Friday. Most people stayed indoors owing to the rapid surge in Covid-19 cases in the city. Sushma Kumari, who used to cook the ‘kharna’ prasada for over 200 people, prepared it this time for her family members only. “Since very few people celebrate Chaiti Chhath, we used to distribute the ‘kharna’ prasads in the entire neighbourhood. But the pandemic this time prevented us from doing so,” she said. ‘Kharna’ is observed on the eve of the first or evening ‘arghya’. Devotees cook rice and jaggery with milk as kheer with chappatis and also offer seasonal fruits and dry fruits to the deity. Aryan Shubha, a resident of Gola Road, said the pandemic has made the Chhath celebrations a low-key affair this time. “My friends with me used to visit at least five houses to seek blessings and eat prasada on kharna, but this year people are either not celebrating it or keeping it to their families,” he rued. Reflecting on the importance of Chaiti Chhath, Acharya Chandra Mohan Pandey said, “Chhath is one of the most auspicious festivals of Hindus. Devotees observe 36-hour-long fast, which is specifically difficult in summer. The devotees pray to the Sun God for the well-being and prosperity of their family members, particularly children.” Soumya Mishra, a resident of Kankarbagh, said Chhath requires determination and perseverance. “Lots of work and preparations are needed for the festival. After ‘kharna’, we start making ‘thekua’ as prasada to offer it to the Sun God during the evening and the following morning arghya,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chaiti-chhath-kharna-remains-a-family-affair/articleshow/82122122.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Private labs overcharging for Covid test||Lucknow: Ajay Kumar (62) and his wife Alpana (60) were charged Rs 1,600 for Covid-19 test by a private pathology lab in Aliganj. Later, they were informed by a friend that the government has fixed Rs 700 for test through the RT-PCR method and Rs 900 through the TrueNat method. When Kumar approached the lab to enquire about the additional charge, lab staff told him that the tests were done using both the methods and he has been given separate reports. “I had specifically asked for RT-PCR tests, but without taking my consent, the lab performed the two tests on its own and charged a hefty amount,” said Kumar. “Also, the report of my wife is positive, but mine came negative though both of us have symptoms,” he added. Many people like Kumar want to get a test done through the RT-PCR method because it is more reliable. However, a few private pathologies are conducting `combo tests’ without informing clients. Many labs also do not display the list of tests along with rate. People who are not aware that the government has fixed the rates are ending up paying more. A Lucknow University professor and his wife not only ended up paying more for `combo pack’, but reports said that the teacher was positive and wife negative, although both had symptoms. People are opting for private labs because the health department is taking three-four days in sample collection and another 2-3 days to give results. However, many private labs are not only refusing home collections, but also returning people on grounds that they have run out of capacity. RD Sharma, a senior citizen, called several private labs on Saturday, but all said they were not conducting tests anymore. Finally, he said, a lab agreed but said there will be no home collection. “Both my wife and I have Covid symptoms. Will it be feasible for us to go out and spread infection?” he questioned. Private lab owners said that they had to refuse home collection or take samples for tests beyond a point because they are facing acute shortage of hands. Amit Rastogi, president of the Pathologist Association, Lucknow said, “We don’t have any information about any private lab charging more than the government fixed rates for Covid testing. Those who want and if people agree can take service charge for home collection, but the rate of the test should be the same as fixed by the government. “ On the question that some labs are conducting TrueNat and RT-PCR tests together without informing customers, he said that these labs should take patient’s consent before sampling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/private-labs-overcharging-for-covid-test/articleshow/82122596.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

AAP state president and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann on Saturday visited and reviewed mandis in Sangrur district and listened to the problems of farmers. During the visit, AAP claimed, farmers told Mann that their wheat was not being purchased due to lack of gunny bags (bardana) in mandis, due to which they were facing a lot of problems. Describing the problem of an elderly farmer, Mann said for 20 days, these elderly farmers had been making rounds of mandi, but due to lack of gunnybags, their wheat was not being purchased, due to which their grain was getting spoiled. “If the crop was purchased on time, it would have reached safely in the warehouses by now, but wheat is getting spoiled lying in mandis,” he added. Mann said farmers were sufffering twofold as they had been protesting against farm laws on Delhi borders for five months and now the government was not buying their crop on time. He accused Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh of colluding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said BJP government at the Centre and the Congress government were “harassing the farmers”. Mann said this was the first time when farmers of Punjab were opposing both central and state governments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-mp-bhagwant-mann-hits-out-at-cong-govt-over-grain-mkt-shortages/articleshow/82122598.cms||---

Earlier, two members of the gang were arrested from Rajasthan. The gang duped people on the pretext of updating their bank account KYC. They used SIM cards belonging to West Bengal and operated from different states, including Bihar. The arrests have been made after Dehradun-resident Gopal Krishna Sharma approached the police with a complaint that he was duped of Rs 18 lakh by a cybercrime gang. He said that he received a call for a KYC update of his mobile SIM card. While probing the matter, the STF team found links of the gang in various states, including Delhi, Rajasthan, Bihar and West Bengal. On April 8 this year, the police team nabbed two members of the gang from Rajasthan. Based on the inputs provided by the arrested persons, the STF collected information about the gang members based in Delhi. The three accused held on Saturday have been identified as Deepak Mehta, Amit Kumar and Mukesh Kumar — all residents of New Delhi “The gang members told their targets that if they did not update their KYC, their SIM cards would be blocked. After collecting important information related to their bank account, the gang members would ask them to download Remote Access Apps through which they gained access to mobile phones and the net banking details,” said SP STF Ajay Singh. The amount so collected by the gang was transferred into various bank accounts in different cities, added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-police-arrests-three-cyber-criminals-from-delhi/articleshow/82121670.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Hyderabad||Second wave severe but curfew won’t help: Telangana govt||HYDERABAD: While sounding a word of caution about the second wave being more severe, with the Covid-19 virus undergoing several mutations, health authorities on Saturday maintained that imposing a weekend or night curfew wasn’t being thought of at the moment. They said that a lockdown, if implemented, would result in more loss of life due to starvation than due to the coronavirus. However, stressing that lakhs of people have already lost livelihood, people were asked to lockdown themselves. Speaking at a press conference, Telangana’s director of public health, Dr G Srinivasa Rao, however, urged people to take all precautions for the next four to six weeks while advising them to postpone weddings and restrict the celebration of festivals to their homes. Elaborating on the rapid spread this time around Dr Rao, shared the example of a district along the Maharashtra border where a gathering of 30 led to the place becoming a Covid hotspot. “On the March 26, 20 people from Maharashtra came to the border district for a festival. Along with them, 30 people from the district celebrated together. On the April 4 all five of them were tested for suspected corona infection. Then, 34 people contracted the virus through them. By April 6, 433 people had been infected with the virus. In a matter of 12 days the biggest cluster in the state was formed covering four villages,” said the official adding that the situation in the state is critical. Stating that corona surveillance has been intensified in places where elections were conducted or will be held, like the Nagarjunasagar assembly constituency, he stressed the need to avoid gatherings. “It is no longer appropriate, be it for celebrations, festivals or elections. People need to take utmost care up to June as the second wave will be peaking during this time. For the first time in the country, more than two lakh cases have been reported. The number of cases in Telangana is close to 5,000. There is a risk of further increase in cases in the days to come,” said Dr Rao. Officials also advised against the indiscriminate use of Remdesivir. “The antiviral drug Remdesivir should be given in the first week to patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 symptoms and not all patients,” said Dr M Raja Rao, superintendent, Gandhi Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/second-wave-severe-but-curfew-wont-help-govt/articleshow/82122595.cms||Amrita Didyala

The CP has also appealed to citizens or any institutions, other than the Covid hospitals and such facilities, to refrain from hoarding cylinders at homes, even for patients, as it may attract penal action. Apart from black-marketeers of Remdesivir, the top cop has issued warning against malpractices in getting oxygen cylinders which too are in short supply due to high demand across the city. Sources said Kumar had to intervene after learning about individuals thronging the oxygen production and refilling plants from where filled cylinders were being sold for Rs290. “We had to deploy security at six oxygen production and re-filling plants to ensure smooth distribution and stop malpractices,” said Kumar and added, “The collector’s order clearly stated that the oxygen plants and their distributors are supposed to supply to Covid hospitals directly as per their allotted quota from the office of the district administration.” In the meanwhile, it’s learnt Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari has initiated an effort to ensure 2,000 oxygen concentrators are provided under corporate social responsibility (CSR) from Vishakhapatnam. Gadkari’s initiative also includes arranging two tankers of 20-tonne capacity each for ferrying around 40 tonne of liquid oxygen from Bhilai steel plant. The minister also arranged around 1,000 empty cylinders by taking up the issue with another industrialist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dont-hoard-oxygen-cylinders-at-home-cp-to-citizens/articleshow/82122593.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Pune||Covishield shortage, curbs cause vax coverage to dip to four-day low||Pune: A shortage of Covishield doses, coupled with the weekend curfew and vaccination holidays at some sites caused the district’s daily coverage to drop to a four-day low on Saturday. Only 34,516 people could get their jabs, much less than the region’s daily average of 50,000 beneficiaries. It was also a vaccination holiday for over 100 (out of nearly 500) session sites on Saturday. The break and the Covishield shortage caused the numbers to fall, district officials said. A fresh supply of Covishield doses (about one lakh doses) only arrived by Saturday evening. "From these, the Pune rural administration has been given 50,000 doses, the PMC has received 30,000 and 20,000 doses have been set aside for the PCMC. The district also received 15,140 more doses of Covaxin," an official said, adding that coverage will improve from Sunday. "Over the last week, the district has received nearly 3.7 lakh doses of Covishield, which is not bad," the official added. Pune zilla parishad CEO Ayush Prasad, said, “Pune district, till Saturday evening, was seriously short on vaccines. Many centres in the region were running out of shots. But we finally got fresh supply. The shortage, strict curbs on movement and ongoing health surveys in 234 villages caused vaccination numbers to drop." A PMC official said, "Some session sites were given a vaccination holiday on Saturday. Others did not have enough Covishield. But second-dose coverage of Covaxin continued as there was availability. Till Saturday noon, there were no doses of Covishield at the PMC's Narayan Peth vaccine store. Just under 10,000 people were given Covishield on Saturday in PMC limits, compared to the nearly 16,000 daily jabs over the past few days. Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director of Bharati hospital, said, “On Saturday, we only held a Covaxin second-dose session. Our Covishield session will start on Sunday. Many people had come for their Covaxin second doses on Saturday. We expect another 400 beneficiaries for Covishield shots on Sunday.” Dr Pradeep DCosta, chairman of the vaccine committee at KEM Hospital Research Centre said, “Saturday’s session at our hospital was only Covaxin. We will be administering Covishield on Monday. We have 10-20 vials of Covishield which should be enough for a couple of days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covishield-shortage-curbs-cause-vax-coverage-to-dip-to-four-day-low/articleshow/82122125.cms||Neha Madaan

Officials said that the blaze has been brought under control to an extent due to sporadic rains and snowfall in the upper reaches on Saturday. According to forest department data, over 37.7 hectares have been gutted in 29 wildfires in the past 24 hours, the financial loss of which is estimated to be over Rs 71,000. More than 11,000 forest workers are at the forefront of firefighting in the Himalayan state. Forest minister Harak Singh Rawat said, “The winds are wreaking havoc this season. Extinguishing fires in hilly terrain is a tough and treacherous task. The entire forest force is working day and night to save the state’s green cover.” Data reveals that 3,287 hectares of forest cover has been gutted in 2,339 wildfires since October 2020 and estimated more than 50,000 trees have been charred. This has also caused the loss of eight human lives apart from a monetary cost of over Rs 90 lakh to the state exchequer. Meanwhile, TOI has learnt that the forest department is regularly relaying messages in the local dialects of Uttarakhand via various media platforms to spread awareness and prevent people from accidentally starting wildfires.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-2k-ha-of-forests-lost-to-wildfires-this-month-light-rains-bring-respite/articleshow/82121667.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Pune||Tope calls for flying squads to monitor remdesivir usage||Pune: State health minister Rajesh Tope has now asked all district collectors to monitor remdesivir use across private hospitals in their jurisdictions.Tope said reports have come in of some hospitals breaching protocols by giving the injection to asymptomatic or mildly ill patients. “Each district should deploy flying squads to check such indiscriminate use,” he said.State government officials said they had floated a tender recently for six lakh remdesivir vials, but had not received a response from suppliers. The application process for suppliers has now been extended by two more days. The officials added that a fresh batch of vials is expected within the next two to three days.  Scores of hospitals in the state have reported shortages of remdesivir. In Pune this week, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao sought 20,000 vials from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. BMC commissioner, Iqbal Chahal, said supply will be sent to Pune as soon as the BMC gets new stock.Pune officials said they had received around 4,000 vials on Friday, but added that distribution has to be streamlined. A hospital in the Ambegaon area, near Katraj, was given only four vials despite having 24 patients on oxygen support. A representative from the hospital said they were given much less than what they had asked for. “The district collector’s orders state hospitals should place requests for a three-day stock of the drug. But we don’t have enough even for daily use,” the hospital official said. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said doctors should not prescribe remdesivir indiscriminately. He also urged families not to pressure doctors. “People should not think of this as a life-saving drug. Doctors know the protocol and they have to prescribe it for five days within the first nine days of illness — in moderate to severe patients who need oxygen support. All available data shows remdesivir does not impact mortality. It cuts hospital stay by one to three days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-calls-for-flying-squads-to-monitor-remdesivir-usage/articleshow/82122129.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Hyderabad||In Covid-19 year, Indian pharma exports grew 18% to cross $24bn||Hyderabad: Amid all the Covid-19 gloom and doom, India’s pharma exports have clocked an impressive growth of over 18% for financial year ended March 31, 2021. Exports have crossed the $24 billion mark for the first time to touch $24.44 billion. What makes the record-busting exports more significant is that this growth came at a time when the global pharma market was reeling from negative growth of around 1-2 % in 2020, said Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil). In financial year 2019-20, pharma exports stood at $20.6 billion, a growth of nearly 8% over the previous fiscal. This is the second highest growth to be recorded in pharma exports after 2012-13 when exports rose nearly 25% to $12.6 billion as compared to $10 billion in 2011-12. According to apex pharma exports promotion body, the bumper exports come on the back of a big leap in exports in March 2021, which stood at an estimated $2.3 billion as compared to $1.54 billion in March 2020, a growth of nearly 40%. In fact, the March 2021 exports figures were the highest for any month in FY21. Pharmexcil director general Uday Bhaskar said that the growth can be attributed to the big surge in demand for `Made in India’ generics that are known for their quality and affordability. “Due to Covid-19 pandemic, most countries wanted to beef up their inventory of drugs for different purposes, not just Covid drugs. Also, most economies globally are struggling due to the pandemic, resulting in high demand for generics,” he said.  Uday Bhaskar said Pharmexcil expects Indian pharma exports to maintain their growth trajectory thanks to the increased demand for Indian-made generics and vaccines. “We are expecting big growth in our vaccine exports in the coming years and the PLI scheme will also help Indian pharma grow by reducing import dependence and developing export potential in the days to come as most of the countries are looking at India for APIs,” he said. According to Pharmexcil, pharma exports to all parts of the world have done well with some of the highest growth rates in FY21. North America accounted for nearly 34% of the total Indian pharma exports during the fiscal, with exports to markets like USA, Canada and Mexico growing 12.6%, 30% and 21.4%. Exports to Africa also went up 13.4%, while that to Europe, which is the third largest exporting region for Indian pharma, recorded around 11% growth, Pharmexcil said. “There is also a growing demand for our products in non-traditional markets like LAC (Latin America & Caribbean with 14.5% growth, CIS with 23.5% growth and Middle East with 17.5% rise,” Pharmexcil said adding that growth was also observed in exports to unexplored countries like Australia (21%) UAE (43%), Uzbekistan (125%) and Ukraine (40.6%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-covid-19-year-indian-pharma-exports-grew-18-to-cross-24bn/articleshow/82122616.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Yalmar said, “Raut is a commerce graduate. He is currently pursuing further education and simultaneously looking for a job. He came in contact with Bhoir and his accomplice through an acquaintance. The suspects wooed Raut by saying that they were in contact with senior government officials in Mantralaya and that they would help him secure a job of a clerk.” Raut in his FIR said he trusted the suspects because they were local residents and transferred Rs4.75 lakh via net banking to the account of the main suspect but he failed to get a job. The sub-inspector said, “The main suspect had initially given a forged joining letter with a fake seal to Raut and asked him to report for duty at the general administration department. The suspect later asked Raut to not report for duty because his appointment had been stayed as per a court order. Raut grew suspicious about the duo and asked them to repay his money but they refused.” He added, “Raut had initially filed a complaint application with the Hinjewadi police. We conducted a preliminary inquiry and registered an FIR related to cheating and forgery under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-held-for-duping-youth-of-rs-4-75l-with-mantralaya-job-bait-prime-suspect-on-the-run/articleshow/82122134.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||‘Could take 2 months for oxygen to arrive’||HYDERABAD: Not just Hyderabad, all major cities across India are staring at a severe shortage of oxygen cylinders, with some warning that it could take up to two months for fresh stocks to hit the market. This, even as dealers and social organisations say they are being regularly barraged with SOS calls from various parts of the country – Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and even the two Telugu states. “The situation is bad. So much so, that we are not able to supply to any other state other than Maharashtra at the moment. While we are in the process of importing more stocks (they are manufactured overseas as per the Indian requirements), it can take anywhere between 30 to 60 days to arrive,” said Kunal Zatakia, director of Mumbai-based Swastik Synergy Engineering Pvt Ltd. The manufacturer has already shipped out over 30,000 cylinders for medical use so far. Up north, the NCR region too is struggling to keep up with the soaring demand. With supplies in Delhi drying up, foundations are reaching out to manufacturers on the outskirts, Manesar for instance, to source the equipment. Even if that means paying double the usual cost – Rs 8,000 (or more) for a jumbo cylinder otherwise available for Rs 4,000. “Within an hour on Friday night, we received about 96 calls from across India, asking for cylinders,” said Harteerath Singh, here from Hemkunt Foundation that’s been offering this service either for free or a token deposit. “While last year, we were giving out 100 cylinders a month, this time there is requirement for 100 a day. Unfortunately, there is not enough stock to meet this demand,” he added. The foundation has received the most number of calls from Delhi, Gurgaon, Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad. Other suppliers that TOI reached out to in Ghaziabad, Lucknow and Ahmedabad, on Saturday, also admitted their stands are empty. “We can let you know only by evening what the situation is. If we get stocks, we’ll supply else we do not know how long it’ll take,” said a staff at Navyug Market, Ghaziabad. Mohammed Shujatullah of Humanity First Foundation, Hyderabad said: “I called every manufacturer I could in India.

The DIC would give 25% subsidy under the state government scheme and another 15% subsidy under the central government scheme. In the 2018-2019 fiscal, the source said, DIC officials had given 25% subsidy to 42 entrepreneurs, who had taken crores of rupees as loans from various banks. “The officials allegedly demanded more than 10% of the subsidy amount as commission from the entrepreneurs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/graft-dic-officials-under-dvac-lens/articleshow/82122133.cms||---

The parents of the victim, Vikky Singh, alleged that their son was in the custody of police for the past five days before he was found hanging. Vikky — along with a minor girl — had gone missing on March 18, said police, adding that the duo was traced to Haryana’s Mahendragarh and then Vikky was booked for abduction on April 5. According to Vikky’s family, he was in the custody of the police at Pandrawal outpost since April 11. The family alleged that SI Raj Kumar Mishra was hand in glove with the girl’s family, who "killed their son". “My son and the girl were rescued from Mahendragarh in Haryana by a team led by the SI. On April 15, I got a call from Mishra that my son had escaped from their custody. The next day, I got an alert on the phone that my son was found hanging from a tree,” said Vikky’s father Geetam Singh. Meanwhile, on Friday, angry locals and the youth’s family members had staged a protest, demanding action against the accused. Senior police officers assured them of a fair probe. Police said SI Raj Kumar Mishra and seven of the girl’s family members were booked for murder and criminal conspiracy.

---||Goa||As Covid-19 wreaks havoc, state scrambles to set up health infra||Panaji/Margao: As the second wave of Covid-19 sweeps through Goa with one in every three tests coming positive, the state government is struggling to put not just the infrastructure in place but even the manpower needed to treat the patients. “Just like the government was unprepared for the first wave, they are equally unprepared for the second wave. No additional staff or medical officers have been appointed. Goa Medical College and its doctors are stressed. There is no manpower for patient management,” a senior health official said. Ten days ago, as the pace of infections intensified with the daily average rising above 300 cases, 10 patients in GMC Covid wards had to be put on trolleys as beds were filled to capacity. The same day , health minister Vishwajit Rane declared that South Goa district hospital—a designated Covid hospital—will have 300 more beds in addition to its 200 beds. It would be done within a week, he had said. But as of Saturday, the hospital had only 318 beds. “We have 400 beds in South Goa district hospital. It is ready and it is only a matter of time before they are commissioned,” GMC dean and in-charge of Covid hospitals Dr S M Bandekar said. “They called for appointing medical officers in the first week of April after cases skyrocketed. It’s worse than the first wave and we are not prepared,” the health official said. “Its (South Goa district hospital) intensive treatment unit (ITU) was ready for around 10 days but was awaiting ventilator trained staff for it to be commissioned for serious patients,” a doctor said. The hospital’s nine-bed ICU has been full for more than 20 days and the nine-bed ITU, set up on Wednesday to decongest the ICU, has also been fully occupied. But Rane said everything is in order. “We have systems in place. Yes, the load is increasing compared to last year and we are putting appropriate staff in place. I don’t think there should be a big problem to worry about,” he told TOI. What is “troubling”, he said, is “other things” like the requirement of Remdesivir and oxygen that has gone up. “We have to ensure that priority is given first to the health sector and then to industry and then to sending it outside Goa,” he said. The trend he said is a little different from last year. “We have to see how to mop up all resources to save the lives of Goan patients. I will have an expert committee meeting on Monday,” Rane said. Even as Rane exuded confidence, the government was yet to notify ESI hospital as a Covid hospital, which was denotified late last year after the Covid curve flattened. Currently, it functions as a Covid care centre. “We never denotified ESI as a Covid hospital,” Rane said, before adding that it would be notified soon. “We did not prepare ourselves for the disaster. So just like last year, wards are overflowing. Duties are tougher now because all other departments have been removed from Covid since the first wave ended. It’s mostly the medicine department with few pulmonary medicine and anaesthesia residents looking after everything,” said another health official. The government has scaled up the South Goa district hospital only after cases began to spiral out of control and each time, they scaled it up, beds have begun to get filled. “If no injectables are required and no oxygen is necessary, patients can take up home isolation or be accommodated in a Covid care centre as there are doctors monitoring them there. They can go back to the hospital if they’re breathless or have a fever. Beds are being kept for breathless patients and those who require intervention,” a health official said. Another ward of 75 beds could be added to South Goa district hospital by Monday. But with caseloads rising every day, healthcare workers are struggling to meet their work hours. “It is surprising that the government has not taken over some of the private hospitals that have two facilities and converted one of them into a Covid hospital. They have the facilities and the manpower to treat these patients,” a top doctor with a corporate hospital said. “It is no more a wave. It is a tsunami,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-covid-19-wreaks-havoc-state-scrambles-to-set-up-health-infra/articleshow/82122620.cms||Bindiya Chari

The meters are being fixed for household and commercial connections. The administration said no charges would be levied for the installation of these meters and laying pipelines, a work to be carried out by contractors. “Citizens should understand that the administration is not starting with meterized water billing at this juncture. This phase will come after the entire infrastructure is in place. As of now, the meters are being installed in the housing societies. By installing the meters, the administration plans to check water wastage,” a civic official said. The PMC plans to install over 3 lakh meters by the end of next year. The decision about installing water meters in individual flat owners will be taken in the due course. The project was opposed in some localities owing to the confusion over how they would be billed. This prompted the PMC officials and the local corporators to conduct meeting with the citizens. The administration has clarified that no charges were being levied as per the new meters and the details pertaining to it would be announced later. Another civic official said, “Installation of water meters is among the various steps planned under the 24x7 water supply project. The plan is to construct 82 overhead water tanks, of which 62 tanks are ready. The use of meters will begin once the infrastructure is in place.” Currently, the water charges are included in the property tax bills. After the project gets fully functional, the charges will be imposed based on the water usage. The 24x7 water supply project aims at equitable distribution of water in the city and minimize the losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-seeks-citizens-cooperation-for-installing-water-meters/articleshow/82122141.cms||---

The soft rollout was also concentrated on Pune and Bengaluru earlier, with the company planning to take the vehicle to more cities in India over 2021-22.However, due to several orders received, and taking into account production difficulties that may derail future deliveries of current and outstanding bookings, the auto manufacturer stopped all new bookings on April 15, adding that future booking slots will be determined later.“We thank our customers in Pune and Bengaluru for their patience and now this overwhelming response. We are conscious that customers would like to receive early deliveries of Chetak and start enjoying it as soon as possible, hence we have had to take the difficult decision of closing the bookings in view of continuing supply chain uncertainties,” said Rakesh Sharma, executive director of Bajaj Auto. “However, it is our endeavor to resolve the supply chain issues at the earliest, re-open bookings as well as roll into more cities within the next quarter,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bajaj-forced-to-shut-fresh-chetak-bookings-over-supply-issues/articleshow/82122140.cms||---

In his compliant, NTK candidate G P Balendhiran, who contested from Coimbatore South, said many people were afraid to get vaccinated and no hospital was willing to inoculate the people aged below 45 years. “I met DRO Ramdurai Murugan, since the district collector was not available on Saturday. Through an RTI query we found the Election Commission hadn’t made any such rules. The government also says the vaccination won’t prevent the infection and refuses to pay compensation or take responsibility for any adverse effect.”Other party members said when they approached the ESI Hospital for the vaccine and certificate, they were turned away by stating people aged below 45 years couldn’t be inoculated. “When we said it was required for polling agents, the hospital dean demanded a government order stating the same. When we checked, there was no such order,” said another member.Balendhiran said it was a ploy to keep the party agents away from the counting area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ntk-slams-vaccine-certificate-norm/articleshow/82122139.cms||---
---||Nagpur||The irrelevance of Standard X||NAGPUR: Be it CBSE or the Maharashtra state education board, the “importance” of Std X now remains simply a hallowed concept. In fact, many academics feel that it has become irrelevant. “If you look at it objectively then of what use are your Std X marks? To get admission in a junior college or diploma course,” said a senior school principal. “In Nagpur alone 20,000 junior college seats were vacant last year. So basically a student just needs to score 35% and admission is guaranteed,” she said. The recent decision by the CBSE to cancel board exams of Std X, but not XII, has given more credence to what academics have always been quietly talking about for years — that Std X board exams have become meaningless. Zafar Khan, president of School Headmasters’ Charitable Association, said, “There was a time in the 80s and early 90s when state government would officially declare a merit list. Photos of these toppers were published and it was like a hall of fame kind of feeling for students and their respective schools. But everything has changed now and there isn’t as much perceived premium attached to high Std X scores as before.” So what caused Std X’s decline from the hallowed hall of fame of the mid-90s to today’s scenario where high scores are just a decorative medal of honour. Principal of a state-board affiliated school said the over-supply of junior college seats further hastened the downfall. “If the purpose of scoring high marks in Std X was to secure admission in junior colleges then that’s been defeated due to excess seat availability. On an average 18,000 junior college seats in Nagpur city alone remain vacant, which gives you a clear idea of the choice students have. So all you need is to pass Std X with the bare minimum marks and a seat is guaranteed,” said the principal. Another principal said that now, a state board student does not even have to pass in Std X. “We have the ATKT system. So, a student who fails in one subject, can still get admission in junior college. Now think from a student’s point of view, for him the exam is now a mere formality because it’s almost as if the system is guaranteeing his passage to the next academic level,” the principal said. Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh), said that now it has become very difficult to fail in the Std X board exam. “For every subject of 100 marks, 20 marks are given by the school for the internal project. The theory exam is for 80 marks and students only need to score 15 to take their combined tally to the passing level of 35. So it’s very easy to clear the Std X board exams.” Another school principal said that coaching classes have hastened the downfall of Std X. “Our junior colleges are entering into partnerships with coaching institutes. Colleges get mass admissions and in return ignore year-long absenteeism of students who spend time at coaching institutes,” she said. “What this partnership has done is make the college irrelevant as students don’t vie for admission to a particular college. They simply apply to whichever place their coaching institute directs them to,” said the principal. Tiwari said in the coming years with the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP), Std X exams will be finished. “Once the policy is fully implemented, students can choose vocational subjects right from Std VIII, rather than XI. And my understanding is that X board exams will be slowly done away with,” said Tiwari. Sameer Phale, the owner of a coaching institute, said it’s indeed sad that board exams are not being viewed as necessary. “This year they scrapped the exam because of the pandemic, and one can understand that. But the larger picture of board exams becoming irrelevant is not good. Knowledge building happens through exams and that’s the only way we can assess these students at this crucial juncture,” said Phale. Khan said board exams were like a clarion call to ensure students did not digress from academics. “According to the existing law, till Std VIII, students can’t be failed. Std IX is an internal exam and the chances of students getting promoted or pushed through is quite high. In Std X they faced their first challenge and would study with a lot of fervour. Even parents would say, ‘Board exams are there, don’t mess around’. So if that aura goes away then it will indeed have a negative impact on students,” said Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/the-irrelevance-of-std-x/articleshow/82122615.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had earlier given a complaint in this regard based on which the police had registered a case against Sidhu and others. The arrest was made on Saturday soon after a court granted Sidhu bail in a case related to the Red Fort violence. Sidhu was earlier arrested on February 9 in connection with the violence at Red Fort on Republic Day during a farmers’ tractor parade against the Centre’s three new agriculture laws. Questioning Sidhu’s arrest, his lawyer Abhishek Gupta said: “He was granted a regular bail vide order dated April 16 (Friday), which was communicated to us on Saturday. However, around 1.30 pm, before he could be released from jail, he was again arrested in another register at the same police station with respect to the same incident at Red Fort. The need and timing of arrest are extremely questionable and it is a grave affront to personal liberty of an individual and runs foul of rights guaranteed under Article 21.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-arrest-deep-sidhu-again-in-connection-with-fir-by-asi/articleshow/82123339.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The association has also threatened that its members will hold ‘satyagrah’ if the crisis of oxygen cylinders continues. National president-elect of IMA Dr Sahjanand Prasad Singh met state health minister Mangal Pandey on Saturday and urged him to relax the provisions of registration under the Clinical Registration Act in this hour of the pandemic and allow all having medical infrastructure to treat Covid patients. Dr Sahjanand said there are over 10,000 such clinics, including about 200 in Patna district. “If these clinics get the government support and regular oxygen supply, they will be able to admit hundreds of serious Covid patients. Several private clinics have complained of non-availability of oxygen cylinders,” he added. Acting IMA state president Dr Ajay Kumar said the condition in Bihar was getting worse. “We apprehend further deterioration if the government fails to take immediate measures. The discrimination between registered and unregistered clinics in supply of oxygen should stop. It is a matter of life and death for hundreds of people,” he added. Dr Sunil Kumar, secretary Bihar unit of IMA, said a Muzaffarpur doctor, Anil Singh, died on Saturday due to non-availability of ICU in a reputed government hospital in Patna. He said the IMA members would observe ‘satyagrah’ to draw the government’s attention on oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oxygen-crisis-ima-threatens-to-launch-satyagrah/articleshow/82122138.cms||VK Tripathi

The changes in discharge policy come after due deliberations by experts in a multi-department meeting on April 13. As per the new policy, issued by additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad, patients with mild and moderate symptoms may be discharged soon after resolution of symptoms. Previously, such patients had to remain in hospital for minimum of seven days from the date of admission or 10 days from the date of test. “The step has been taken to keep beds available in hospitals and for saving the workforce from excess work burden,” said an officer. The policy may be downloaded from the health directorate’s website dgmhup.gov.in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/amid-surge-govt-tweaks-discharge-rule-for-patients/articleshow/82122624.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, the authorities were confident that stocks would be replenished soon. “We had enough stocks for a week, but there was a two-fold increase in the number of people turning up to take the jab in Tika Utsav. We are happy that the numbers are picking up. Since it is a scenario in the whole of the state, it will be okay in a day or two,” Trichy collector S Divyadharshini told TOI. The latest stock of Covishield and Covaxin was supplied to Trichy last week, but some of the vaccination centres in the district turned away people due to non-availability of stocks. The shortage of supply was reported in other central districts too. The UPHC at Kulumani in rural Trichy ran out of Covishied after vaccinating 10 people on Saturday morning. Staff at the primary health centre (PHC) at Andhanallur near Jeeyapuram said they asked people to confirm over phone about vaccine availability on Monday. In MGMGH, Covaxin was not available for those coming to take the second shot. Health officials in Madurai claimed there was no shortage but that the stock was getting used up faster. Officials said they have been getting additional stocks based on their requirement. In south TN, more than 7 lakh people have been vaccinated including 1.83 lakh in Madurai. However, on Saturday, only 1,973 beneficiaries received the vaccine as against 5,000-7,000 in the last few days. “As and when required, if camps are to be conducted or if any vaccination centre requires additional doses, they will be mobilised,” said a senior health official. On Saturday, Madurai had only 980 doses left but is expected to receive additional stock by Monday. Health officials from other southern districts confirmed that the spike in demand for the vaccine had led to the shortage. “With the recent rise in Covid-19 cases across the district, the public have started queueing up at vaccination centres in numbers to get the vaccine,” said a health official from Tirunelveli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/vax-stocks-in-districts-will-be-replenished-say-authorities/articleshow/82122147.cms||Gokul Rajendran
---||Pune||ZP teachers survey rural areas to ‘break the chain’||Pune: The Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) has pressed into service two teacher teams for every 75-100 houses to constantly monitor the health of household members in an effort to help identify cases early as part of the “Break the chain’ initiative at various hotspots in rural areas.From facing angry residents shutting their door in their presence to locals hiding details about their health to those who are extremely helpful and even provide information about an unwell neighbour, teachers said they see it all in a day’s work.Since the pandemic began last year, teachers in government-aided schools have been deputed for various services to aid the administration’s work in the prevention and control of Covid-19. “At the beginning, I conducted surveys. Then my duty was at the toll booth, then at an entry point to the city, then at a ration shop, among others. Again, there was a survey last month and, currently, I am at the Covid centre registration desk at Loni Kalbhor. Till now, we only had election duty and other such work, but we have had varied experiences in the last year,” said Umedh Dhaware, a teacher at Sidrammala ZP school.The experience of teachers conducting surveys in semi-urban areas is quite different from those surveying rural areas. Teachers said that in villages, everybody knows each other hence hiding any illness or symptoms akin to Covid-19 is hard. However, in urban or semi-urban areas of the district, people tend to hide symptoms.Amol Gaikwad, a teacher at ZP school Khanapur completed the survey of houses in Kirkatwadi on Friday and he will begin surveying houses in Khadakwasla from Monday. “When we go to buildings with many apartments, only the person who opens the door is checked. Many people lie that they are living alone in the house when clearly, we can hear other people from the house. Some people hide the information that someone is Covid positive or in isolation,” said Gaikwad.Vijay Birhamane, a ZP teacher surveying the remote area of Hatve Khurd in Bhor Taluka said, “Villagers are responding well to questions for fear of Covid related deaths. So, it becomes easier to identify people with symptoms than in cities, where there is anonymity among neighbours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-teachers-survey-rural-areas-to-break-the-chain/articleshow/82122145.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Coimbatore||Ooty may miss summer festival for second consecutive time as Covid-19 cases spike||Udhagamandalam: Now that the Covid-19 cases are on the rise, uncertainty looms large over the summer festival in Ooty that is usually held in May. In 2020 too, summer festivities such as flower show, rose show and fruit show were cancelled following the surge in the Covid infection. However, the botanical and rose gardens, among other government parks, in the hill town are being maintained as usual.District collector J Innocent Divya told TOI that no decision had been taken on conducting the summer festival this year.Pointing out that they had begun planting flower saplings in the botanical and rose gardens in January, Shiva Subramaniam Samraj, joint director, horticulture department, said the gardens would be in full bloom in a week. “The Sim’s Park in Coonoor and Katteri Park are also being maintained as in the normal tourist seasons.”He said around 25,000 potted plants were being put on display in the botanical garden, which is spread across 55 hectares. The garden sports more than 1.5 lakh plants of 198 varieties. “The potted plants are being arranged at the entrance of the garden.”The official said they had restricted the entry of visitors to the park to below 50% of the usual figures as per the government orders. “Even otherwise, there has been a dip in the footfalls for the past one week.”The botanical garden had seen 1,338 visitors on Friday and 1,175 on Thursday. The garden authorities have cordoned off the sprawling lawn to prevent tourists from crowding the area without maintaining social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ooty-may-miss-summer-festival-for-second-consecutive-time-as-covid-19-cases-spike/articleshow/82122142.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Haryana: In Hisar, farmers still await timely payment||HISAR: The announcement by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala to pay farmers within 48 hours after filling of the J form, is proving to be false, at least in Hisar. Here, only 25% farmers have been paid over 16 days. Farmers from Haryana minister of state, labour and employment Anoop Dhanak’s assembly constituency, Ukalana, and Barwala have received the lowest payment for wheat procurement in Hisar. District marketing enforcement officer (DMEO) Sahib Ram said till April 16, 22,95,360 quintals of wheat was procured in seven mandis of Hisar, Hansi, Adampur, Uklana, Barwala, Bass and Narnaund. Of this, only 5,80,133 quintals or 25% wheat has been lifted while 17,15,227 quintals or about 75% is still lying in mandis, he said. Only 14% farmers of Uklana Mandi have got payment for wheat procurement while 15% farmers of Barwala Mandi were paid. In Hisar mandi, 36% farmers were paid, while 35% farmers were paid in Narnaund. In Hansi and Adampur, 30% farmers were paid.  District food and supplies controller (DFSC) Ashok Kumar Sharma said every procurement agency pays for wheat. He said his department has paid Rs 11 crore so far. In response to a question, he said farmers are paid only when the wheat is lifted and reaches the warehouse of the procuring agency. Chief minister Manohar Lal and deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala had announced that farmers would be paid within 48 hours after filling up the J farm. If payment was not made within this time, then the farmer would get 9% interest, they announced. Chhabil Das Kedia, president of Hisar Grain Mandi Arthiya Association, said when farmers’ wheat gets the bid, the J form is filled immediately. If payment is made after this, it becomes difficult for the procurement agency to collect the wheat, in which case payment to farmers can be made only after the wheat reaches the warehouse. If the government is to fulfill its promise, the warehouse of Dhondur village in Hisar should be opened for unloading of wheat, only then will farmers get timely payment for the wheat crop, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-hisar-farmers-still-await-timely-payment/articleshow/82122649.cms||---
---||Goa||Govt bans O2 cylinder export, will be diverted to health services||Panaji: Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Friday issued directions to the health secretary to initiate measures to ban the export of oxygen cylinders to other states with immediate effect, in view of the rapid rise in Covid cases. All industrial oxygen requirements will be diverted towards the health services, Goa Medical College (GMC) and Covid hospitals, Rane said. Hospitalisations have increased over the past few days as the state witnesses a steep rise in Covid infections, and on average, 90-100 patients require hospitalisation daily. “The requirement for oxygen has gone up,” Rane said, adding that the health secretary has been asked to coordinate with collectors to issue an order under the Disaster Management Act.” A doctor attached to a private hospital said that hospitals are facing a crunch of oxygen cylinders, but GMC dean and in-charge of Covid hospitals, Dr S M Bandekar, said they have adequate supply of oxygen cylinders. Rane, after a discussion with chief minister Pramod Sawant, announced that the bed capacity at the North Goa district hospital would be expanded, the South Goa district hospital would see 550 beds, and the ESI hospital would be converted into a Covid hospital. The North Goa district hospital is not a Covid hospital, but 15-20 beds were earmarked for Covid patients during the first phase of the pandemic. This time, 50 beds will be opened for Covid patients, Rane said. He also announced that the ESI hospital would be converted into a Covid hospital with intensive treatment unit (ITU) and intensive care unit (ICU) facilities. The hospital is presently used as a Covid care facility. The ITU facility will be extended to the Ponda sub-district hospital, which will also be deployed as a Covid hospital. “As suggested by the CM, the Shiroda primary health centre will continue as a Covid care centre,” Rane said. Also, he said that once again, agencies will be roped in to provide services such as patient handling, facility management, etc. Sodexo will be roped in for dietary and nutritional requirements, he said. Meanwhile, the South Goa collector, who is the chairperson of the South Goa district disaster management authority, Margao, declared the entire premises of Mormugao Port Trust hospital at Sada as a Covid care centre. But by evening, she held the order in abeyance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-bans-o2-cylinder-export-will-be-diverted-to-health-services/articleshow/82122629.cms||---

Besides, the region’s testing also hit a fresh high (47,276) on Saturday, while its total caseload surpassed 7 lakh, with the recent 1 lakh cases being added in just 11 days — same as the previous lakh. A report by the district health officer, Bhagwan Pawar, stated that as many as 100 patients succumbed to the infection in PMR in the last 24 hours, which as the third highest death toll for PMR in a single-day, taking its total fatalities to 11,312. Among the new cases, as many as 6,006 patients were added in the Pune municipal limits, followed by the rural areas (3,848) and the Pimpri Chinchwad areas (2,982). As for the recoveries, the PMC areas reported 5,609,highest in the region, followed by the rural areas (3,358) and the Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits (2,756). With this, the region’s total positive caseload increased above 7.09 lakh on Saturday evening, while its recoveries climbed past 5.98 lakh. Of the total active cases (1,00,444), as many as 74,802 patients were in the home isolation till Saturday evening, while 25,642 were being treated at various hospitals. Since last few days, the region’s active caseload was around 98,000 to 99,000. On Saturday, 24,506 samples were tested in the PMC limits, while 11,674 tests were conducted in the Pimpri Chinchwad areas and 11,096 samples were checked in the rural pockets. The total sample testing of the region has now reached above 35.27 lakh. “PMR authorities have been conducting 1,43,348 tests per million population in the region,” the report stated. Among the 100 fatalities recorded in PMR on Saturday, 54 patients succumbed to the infection in the PMC limits,32 in the Pimpri Chinchwad areas and 14 in the rural parts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/daily-cases-recoveries-testing-hit-new-peaks-in-pmr/articleshow/82122153.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Mumbai||After curbs, movement of trucks to and from Maharashtra state plunges by 50%||Pune: Transportation of fruits, vegetables and even raw material for various industries has taken a hit following a 50% drop in truck movement in and out of the state since the imposition of the stringent Covid-19 restrictions and weekend lockdown earlier this month. “The main reason is stringent restrictions and fear of the virus, which is preventing trucks from other states like Punjab, Karnataka and Rajasthan from entering Maharashtra despite transport of goods, essentials and raw materials being out of the ambit of the current restrictions. There is also a dearth of drivers after many fled Maharashtra fearing a lockdown,” Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, core committee, All-India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), said on Saturday. He said the impact was stark, with rough estimates indicating that daily truck movement to and from the state had dropped to between 25,000 and 35,000 trucks for industrial and essential goods from the 70,000 to 80,000 in normal times. Singh said movement of trucks from Madhya Pradesh, which bring food grains and pulses, or those transporting mangoes from Ratnagiri or onions from Nashik to other parts of the country, has been affected. “This is causing supply chain issues, which are likely to increase in the coming days, especially in fast-moving consumer goods,” he said. Pramod Bhavsar, co-chairman, AIMTC and Association of Transporters, Pune, said transport of goods from Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Harayana and Rajasthan has been affected by the stringent curbs in the state as well as fear of Covid-19. “The supply chain has already been affected as vehicles coming from other states have dropped by over 50%. Pune normally has an inflow of around 10,000 outstation trucks from other states per day, which has now dropped to about 1,500-2,000 since the stringent curbs and rise in Covid cases,” he said. Bhavsar said drivers were skipping the state, with those from Kerala restricting themselves to Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. “Due to lack of trucks, transport of agriculture produce like onions and mangoes is affected. State’s onion and mango supplies to other states have recorded a dip in the last few days because outstation truck inflow has dropped,” Bhavsar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/after-curbs-movement-of-trucks-to-and-from-maharashtra-state-plunges-by-50/articleshow/82122644.cms||Neha Madaan

Addressing a virtual meet on ‘Allergy in times of Covid-19 pandemic’, chairperson of Indian Medical Association Academy of Medical Specialties (IMA-AMS) and hed of respiratory medicine department, KGMU, Prof Surya Kant said: “Severe and uncontrolled asthmatic patients are more susceptible to Covid-19 Infection. Therefore, known asthma patients should continue with their prescribed inhalers and other therapies to prevent any exacerbation.” The meet was jointly organised by the Indian College of Allergy, Asthma and Applied Immunology, UP Chapter of Indian Chest Society and IMA-AMS. Experts advised that such patients should avoid allergy testing and pulmonary function test during Covid-19 times to prevent infection. They also suggested that serious patients should avoid biologics therapy. The experts pitched for tele-OPD to help patients in need. As a general advice, they said taking steam inhalation twice a day and staying indoor was the need of the hour. All asthmatic patients should avoid places where fumigation is on as the chemical used in the process could trigger exacerbation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/asthmatics-at-higher-risk-of-infection/articleshow/82122632.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 88% vote in Nagarjuna Sagar; TRS & Congress bullish||HYDERABAD: Voters in the Nagarjuna Sagar assembly by-elections turned out in large numbers on Saturday to cast their vote despite the sweltering heat and a deadly Covid-19 second wave. A record 88% polling was registered till 7 pm when polling ended. This is the highest turnout in history of this constituency with the previous best being 86.62% in 2018. Though political analysts kept their fingers crossed, the three main parties - TRS, Congress and BJP - claimed that the turnout would favour them. High turnouts are, however, not new to the constituency. This predominantly rural seat had witnessed over 80% polling in the last two elections after the formation of Telangana. As many as 41 candidates, including three women, contested the by-election, which was necessitated due to the death of TRS MLA Nomula Narasimhaiah. Counting of votes will take place on May 2. Barring a few technical glitches in EVMs, voting passed off peacefully. People started thronging the booths right from 7 am when polling started. Serpentine queues were witnessed at booths all through the day, although some booths looked deserted in the afternoon. Chief electoral officer Shashank Goel, who toured the constituency, said Covid-19 norms were followed and the no-mask-no-entry rule was implemented strictly. Voters waited in circles marked outside the polling booths for their turn. Disposable gloves were given to voters after sanitizing their hands. At many booths, only one glove was given to cast the vote. TRS candidate Nomula Bhagat, who cast his vote at Ibrahimpet, exuded confidence of winning the by-poll by a bumper majority. The party is banking on welfare schemes and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Ra’s appeal and promises to the constituency voters to retain the seat it won in 2018. Seven-time legislator and former minister K Jana Reddy of Congress was confident that the development done by him in the past and anti-TRS vote would give him a big majority. The voters have realised the true colours of the TRS as it did nothing for the constituency in the last seven years after coming to power in the new state, he said after casting his vote in the Sagar Hill colony booth. Ravi Naik of BJP said the saffron party is going to create history by winning the by-poll as silent voting took place in favour of the BJP. He along with his family members cast their vote at Palugu Tanda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/88-vote-in-sagar-trs-cong-bullish/articleshow/82122659.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Goa||Goa: To save workers from chemical exposure, engineering students design sanitising robot||PANAJI/VALPOI: Moved by the plight of workers exposed to harmful chemicals while sanitising buildings, three final year students of Don Bosco college of engineering, Fatorda, took on the challenge of designing a solution as part of their final year project. The result is a robot which can be operated from 400m away. The device can sanitise by both spraying chemicals and using ultraviolet light. The students — Vivek Khadilkar, Saeel Kamat and Drasti Naik of the electronics and telecommunication branch — are now planning to patent their design. Their project has been chosen by the state department of science and technology for reimbursement of the amount spent in preparing the prototype. Chief minister Pramod Sawant and health minister Vishwajit Rane, after witnessing the functioning of the robot, have also approved a demonstration for officials of the directorate of health services for possible implementation. “In June last year, as the country was battling the pandemic, we had to select a subject for our final year project,” said Khadilkar, a resident of Valpoi. “We had seen photographs in newspapers and on social media of workers who spray chemicals for sanitisation of buildings by carrying the tank of chemicals on their back. The chemicals are highly concentrated and pose risk to their life, so we thought of coming out with a solution.” The students sifted through various research papers to look for any existing findings. “We found a lot of research work done already on a robotic sanitisation device, but there was no device which combines both sanitisation by spraying chemicals and by using ultraviolet rays, and we decided to take up this as our project,” said Kamat, from Savoi Verem. The students explain that while spraying of chemicals is more useful in the outdoors due to the watery residue it leaves behind, the ultraviolet method is helpful for indoor spaces. “If our robotic device is fully charged, it can work for eight hours straight,” Khadilkar said. “It has two batteries of 12V each. For spraying, the device has five nozzles and covers a length of six metres. It has a tank of 45 litres to hold the chemicals. The ultraviolet sanitisation is available in the same device, with three tubelights of 230 volts each, including one below to sanitise the floors.” The students said that ultraviolet light of 295 nanometers wavelength can break the reproductive chain of the virus. “The device has been intentionally designed as a remote controlled one and not coded to be fully automatic, so it can be used in different locations. It is not coded to work as per the floor layout of one particular hospital or location,” said Naik, a Panaji resident. It cost the students Rs 95,000 to create the prototype, and it was designed under the guidance of their professors, Mohini Naik and Michelle Araujo. “We started work on the project in June 2020 and it was ready in February 2021. The project was also not possible without support from our college director Fr. Kinley D’Cruz, principal Neena Panandikar and head of department Varsha Turkar,” said Khadilkar. The students are now hoping their robotic device will be helpful in remote sanitisation of closed offices, open markets, hospitals and other public places without the intervention of any frontline worker. “The health department and the government will definitely help these youngsters in making more of this robotic device for the benefit of the state,” Rane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-save-workers-from-chemical-exposure-engg-students-design-sanitising-robot/articleshow/82122638.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Hyderabad||CCMB culturing ‘double variant’ to know if it stings||Hyderabad: With experts worldwide declaring the so-called double variant or B.1.617, first discovered in Maharashtra, as a variant of concern (VoC) in the fight against Covid-19, the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) has taken up the challenge to decode the genetic mystery of the new variant by culturing it in its laboratory. “The results will be out in a week or two. We will know then if the new variant that carries several mutations including two main ones — E484Q and L452R — is responsible for the spurt in new cases or if it is more infectious than other variants,” said CCMB director Dr Rakesh Kumar Mishra. He said it is a misnomer to call the new variant B.1.617 as a double mutant as it carries several mutations. Also, there are several variants with multiple mutations in circulation. “We are working to find out if the combination of two main mutations — E484Q and L452R — has made the virus more potent,” he said, adding that it is present in more than 50% of the new cases reported from Maharashtra. The B.1.617 is also present in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala. But it makes up about 5% of the total positive cases reported. Mishra told TOI that further studies are needed to know if the VoC would become a dominant variant in Telugu states and other parts of the country. In Punjab, the UK variant B.1.1.7 is present in about 50% of the samples tested. Asked if there was a way to stop the spread of B.1.617, he said it could have been stopped two months ago through restriction of inter-state movement of people. “Now that the variant is present, even though around 5% or less, the only way to stop its spread is to follow the Covid-19 protocol like wearing a mask, sanitation of hands, and avoiding crowds,” he said. Dr Mishra said though it is a variant of concern, it cannot be said to be responsible for the sudden increase as further research is needed. He said until the genetic mystery of the new variant B.1.617 is solved, people should keep their guard and take Covid-19 precautions. “The virus may be responsible for 10% or 20% cases, but our carelessness is leading to 80% of the infections. The introduction of vaccine has made people bold and many began to think that Covid-19 would not do harm as the vaccine is around. As people forgot the protocol and neglected the guidelines, the virus is spreading fast,” he said. The ‘double-mutant’ contains two types of mutations that were otherwise present separately in other variants analysed thus far. The combination of these two mutations is a real concern. It is also not clear if the new variant can escape the immune response and thus make vaccination ineffective.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ccmb-culturing-double-variant-to-know-if-it-stings/articleshow/82122703.cms||Syed Akbar

She was recommended remdesivir at home,” said Dr Vora, an additional professor at IIPH, Gandhinagar (IIPH-G). “But I consulted my friends in India and abroad. Elsewhere, the Covid treatment protocol involves oxygen and steroids, and remdesivir is not that much insisted on, as we see here.”Dr Vora added: “We administered favipiravir to her instead, which gave the desired results.”Citizens still remember the serpentine queues outside Zydus Hospital recently as hundreds turned up for the ‘miracle injection’ for Covid patients. The six-injection course of the antiviral drug is often recommended by physicians to reduce the viral load in the initial phase of the infection.“It is not a life-saving drug, but it’s used primarily to reduce the hospital stay of the patient by targeting RNA of the virus and arresting its replication speed,” said a city-based physician. “Moreover, the injections are not beneficial to those who already have a high viral load and the involvement of lungs, as it leads to the inflammation for which the patients need shots of steroids.”As the drug is in high demand due to the exponential rise in Covid cases, city-based experts and health professionals appealed again to use it judiciously and prevent its hoarding.Jallavi Panchamia, an assistant professor with IIPH-G, said that she along with her parents was infected with Covid-19 recently. “My father indeed required the injections due to biomarkers pointing at a high viral load, and they did help. But my mother and I recovered without the injection,” she said. “Oxygen saturation plays a major role, and I advise citizens not to blindly follow only one device if the reading fluctuates too much. It can lead to panic.”The experts also urged physicians to make the relatives of the patients weigh the pros and cons of the injection and to clarify to the patients’ kin that the injection alone cannot improve the condition.Patients at home to get remdesivirAhmedabad: The supply of remdesivir injections was disrupted for patients under home isolation on Saturday and hundreds had to go back home empty-handed from Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA). After a stock of 450 injections arrived on Friday, the relatives of Covid-19 patients had hoped another stock would become available. A senior AHNA official said that AMC officials have assured the association of a new stock on Sunday. “The disruption in the supply will affect the treatment as the injections are needed at a specific period,” said a senior member. AHNA has been appointed the nodal agency by the AMC for the distribution of remdesivir to patients undergoing treatment at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/remdesivir-injection-is-not-required-in-all-cases/articleshow/82122693.cms||---

The urban development and housing (UDH) department minister Shanti Dhariwal on the demand of the district administration and hospitals, announced to made the special arrangement to provide fresh and nutritious food to Covid patients. Dhariwal said, “Powers have been given to the urban bodies and district collector to establish the Indira Rasoi extension counters in the hospital and isolation wards as per the requirement so that the Covid patient as well as their families and hospital staff can also get the benefit of Indira Rasoi Yojana.” A senior local self-government official said that although Indira Rasoi in present situation has a process to serve food where beneficiary’s name, mobile number and photo is required. However, it will be exempted for the Covid patients. “If the relatives of patient eat in kitchen, then they will have to pay Rs 8 per packet/ plate as fixed by the government.”  To provide fresh food packets hospitals, the medical officer concerned will have to place an order to the operator after assessing the number of patients in the hospital. Under the scheme, food can also be made available to the corona patients by donors. For this, donors will have to contact the Indira Rasoi concerned. Donors will be honoured by the DLB for sponsoring food.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/indira-rasoi-to-give-free-food-to-covid-patients/articleshow/82122155.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Juna akhada exits Kumbh after PM calls for ‘symbolic’ observance||HARIDWAR/NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: Hours after its chief spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about observing the rest of the Maha Kumbh Mela in Haridwar in a “largely symbolic” manner, Juna akhada — the largest of the 13 sects of seers in the country — pulled out of the religious festival. With this, it became the third akhada, after Niranjani and Anand, to withdraw from the event citing concerns about Covid-19. After its announcement, two other Shaivite akhadas — Avahan and Agni — also said they were leaving. “All members and seers of the Juna akhada met at 3pm today (Saturday). After deliberations, keeping in mind the pandemic and people’s well-being, we have decided to immerse the deities we invoked and conclude the Kumbh Mela Haridwar 2021,” a statement issued jointly by Juna akhada acharya mahamandaleshwar Avdheshanand Giri and secretary Hari Giri on Saturday eveningsaid. “About 400 of our seers have left the camp on Saturday,” Hari Giri, who is also general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, told TOI. The Maha Kumbh is scheduled to continue till April 30 but the presence of large groups of seers and devotees at shahi snans without masks and social distancing had caused widespread concern. Earlier in the day, Modi had tweeted about a phone conversation with Avdheshanand Giri: “I appealed, now that the two shahi snans have taken place, the remaining Kumbh be observed symbolically as it will help in fight against the pandemic.” After the conversation, Giri told TOI, “On behalf of the sadhus, I assured the PM that the Kumbh rituals will be done symbolically. Sadhus at the Kumbh have welcomed the PM’s appeal.” At a press conference in Haridwar, he said, “From this point on, things will be largely symbolic … Faith is important, but life is more so.” He had said then that it did not mean Kumbh was “ending”. Instead, he added, “I request everyone to turn out in smaller numbers.” But he was dismissive that the Maha Kumbh might turn into a superspreader event. “A lot of people came from Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh, which are grappling with Covid. Hamare yahaan se corona nahin phaila hai (Covid-19 did not spread from our congregation),” he further said. Meanwhile, after Juna akhada’s decision to conclude the Kumbh, other sanyasi akhadas followed suit. “We support Juna akhada’s call and are withdrawing from the Mela,” Mahant Satya Giri, general secretary of Ahavan akhada, told TOI. So did Agni akhada. “Saving human lives is the biggest concern for us,” Brahmachari Sadhnanand, mela head of the akhada, told TOI. The Mahanirvani akhada, meanwhile, has decided to leave after the next snan. “After attending all three shahi snans, the akhada has decided that most of us would be leaving after April 19,” said general secretary of the akhada, Jamuna Puri. Kinnar akhada, which is part of Juna akhada, also closed its camp gates on Saturday. “A few members tested positive and were quarantined. We have decided not to allow any visitor into our camp,” said Mahamandaleshwar Pavitra Maharaj. Whether seers should stay on or leave has been a contentious matter. Those from the Shaivite sect have already completed the three shahi snans that are important to them. For the Vaishnavite, or Bairagi sect, of Nirmohi, Nirvani and Digambar, the most important shahi snan is the last one, on April 27. “All three Bairagi akhadas appreciate PM Modi’s advice but it is not possible to take a bath symbolically on the last shahi snan. We are asking our followers to not arrive in large numbers. Only seers will take a dip on the last shahi snan,” Nirmohi akhada chief mahant Rajendra Das said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/juna-akhada-exits-kumbh-after-pm-calls-for-symbolic-observance/articleshow/82121745.cms||MS Nawaz

Giving details, Dinesh Chandra, special secretary, department of culture. The UP government said, “An exhaustive knowledge bank will be created at the museum focusing on the events related to the freedom struggle. This will help not only the youth to learn more about the struggle our freedom fighters had to go through but will also help scholars who will have access to high-tech library and archival sections for which work is under progress.” District magistrate K Balaji said a seven-member team comprising mainly historians, including Dr KD Sharma, Dr KK Sharma, Amit Pathak and Amit Rai Jain, has been set for the purpose. “Apart from a dedicated section on freedom struggle, there will be special space for archaeological discoveries of western UP, with both real and replicas of artefacts on display,” said historian Amit Pathak. Balaji said, “There shall be multiple events from May 8 and will culminate on May 10, the anniversary of the 1857 Uprising. These events will involve skits, plays and songs to commemorate the great Uprising against the colonial rule, Chauri Chaura incident of 1922 and Amrit Mahotsav. The seven-member-team will finalize the details of these programmes and sprucing up of the museum and present its report before the divisional commissioner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/freedom-struggle-museum-to-house-hi-tech-archival-section/articleshow/82121743.cms||Sandeep Rai

A purported video of the young group on-board a tractor shouting objectionable slogans "just for fun" is now being widely shared online. An FIR has been registered and police traced and picked up six of them. The incident reportedly took place in Chandasina under Ratanpuri police station of Muzaffarnagar district on Wednesday, sources said. Taking cognizance of the viral video, police swung into action, and identified six suspects from the clip. Two were found to be minor and were handed over to their parents after a warning. Four others were arrested. A case was also registered under IPC section 505/2 [statements conducing to public mischief] against 15 individuals on Friday. Ratanpuri station house officer, Vindyachal Tiwari, said, "As many as six persons were detained for raising pro-Pakistan slogans. There are others involved. Raids are being conducted to arrest them as well. Investigation is on and action will be taken accordingly." Budhana deputy superintendent of police, Vinay Gautam, said, "Two were detained and handed over to their parents as they were minors. They were given a stern warning and issued a notice. The four others were arrested while the remaining ones are being traced."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/15-booked-for-raising-pro-pakistan-slogans-in-up-six-held/articleshow/82121747.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Pune||All hospitals now asked to boost share of oxygen beds||Pune: All hospitals in the state should keep increasing the number of oxygen-supported beds for at least a month more to handle the current Covid surge, a top official has said. Dr Subhash Salunke, the state technical expert on Covid-19 control, said the bed increase is an immediate short-term measure.“All private and government hospitals should have more oxygen beds. Patients with even mild symptoms, who may need treatment, should not be turned away due to a lack of beds,” Dr Salunke said, adding that the administration is in talks with suppliers for more liquid oxygen and concentrators. He said the new directive aims to increase beds across all facilities. “Over the next one month, we’ll have to ensure government and private hospitals have enough oxygen beds and oxygen supply. Most patients with breathlessness will require oxygen, so hospitals will need ample liquid oxygen supply or more oxygen concentrators,” Dr Salunke said. He said the next two months will be crucial for the district. “We cannot let our guard down even after that. We’ll have to keep improving our medical oxygen infrastructure,” he said. Last week, data showed an addition of 1,096 oxygen beds across facilities in the district. But with a nearly 13% rise in hospital admissions, Dr Salunke said the administration will need more such beds. The state’s daily demand for medical oxygen has risen to 1,400 metric tonnes; its production capacity is 1,200 MT. Earlier this week, health minister Rajesh Tope proposed the use of oxygen concentrators in small hospitals to ease the shortage of medical oxygen. Oxygen concentrators draw in room air and pass it through filters that remove dust, bacteria and other particulates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/all-hospitals-now-asked-to-boost-share-of-oxygen-beds/articleshow/82122151.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Frequent cough, poor food intake, loose motion red flags among home-isolated: Experts||Pune: Frequent cough, poor intake of food/fluids, loose motion and fatigue are among warning signs in home-isolated Covid patients and should not be ignored, especially in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) where about 80% of active cases are in home care currently, experts have said. “These symptoms could be worth reporting to the doctor, but patients with these symptoms may not necessarily require hospitalization. These are simply reg flags, which need physician’s evaluation,” physician Narendra Javadekar said. The experts said a majority of patients in home isolation do well. “Monitoring of oxygen saturation and reporting to the hospital if there is a drop in oxygen saturation or there is breathlessness, giddiness or chest pain is a reasonable strategy. The other warning symptoms like frequent cough, poor food/water intake, loose motion and exhaustion need to be assessed by a physician first and may not require hospitalization immediately,” Javadekar said. “Delay in reporting these symptoms to doctors and not following their advice are often the common mistakes made by patients in home isolation. Patients need to be sensitized enough about not indulging in them,” said Ruby Hall Clinic’s chief intensivist Kapil Zirpe. Sharing the view, senior physician Vilas Gundecha said, “The number of Covid-19 cases has significantly increased in the last 15 days. Many patients are opting for home isolation or preferring to get home quarantined due to crowded hospitals. While most of the young patients recover well, many others, especially those above 60 years and those with co-morbidities, need to be closely observed during the period of home isolation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/frequent-cough-poor-food-intake-loose-motion-red-flags-among-home-isolated-experts/articleshow/82122158.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Goa||Hotter days, rain likely as weather conditions change||Panaji: A weather system in the form of a trough running across interior Karnataka on Saturday is poised to gradually raise minimum temperatures by a degree, ending a few days of rather pleasant weather when westerly winds were keeping the mercury within normal levels. With the formation of a trough and moisture brought in by westerlies, thunderstorm clouds are likely to develop over Karnataka and move across the state. “There is a possibility of light rain or thunderstorms at isolated places over both districts (of Goa) on April 19 and 20, but as of now, there are no severe weather warnings,” a bulletin by the India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji, stated. While the trough is likely to last for two more days, minimum and maximum temperatures recorded over the past few days were largely within normal range. Cool sea breezes provided relief from the heat at mid-day and the humidity was within tolerable limits. “Once the lower level westerlies set in around 11am, they don’t let temperatures rise significantly along the coast and adjoining areas,” M Rahul, IMD scientist, said. Though the trough is likely to trigger a slight rise in mercury at night, the IMD stated that the change will be minimal and no heat wave is expected. The maximum temperature is likely to hover around 34 degrees in coastal areas. But midland and hinterland areas may experience a rise in temperature by around two degrees more than coastal areas, based on their topography and local climatology, the IMD bulletin stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hotter-days-rain-likely-as-weather-conditions-change/articleshow/82122660.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Deep Sidhu, held for Red Fort violence on Republic Day, gets bail||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has granted bail to actor-activist Deep Sidhu, who was arrested in connection with the violence that took place at Red Fort on Republic Day. Special Judge Neelofer Abida Perveen granted relief to the accused on Friday on a personal bond of Rs 30,000 and two sureties of a like amount. The order, which was made public on Saturday, noted that the accused was in custody since February 9, 2021, including 14 days of remand in police custody. It said that a police plea for further incarceration for the sole purpose of voice sampling was not justifiable. “The prosecution’s case rests largely on the contents of video recordings and footage available and accessible to all on social media sites in public domain, and there is a remote possibility of the accused-applicant being able to interfere with the content on such a platform,” the court noted. It also rejected the prosecution’s contention that the accused might abscond if released on bail. “The accused as per the own case of the prosecution is a well-known public figure with deep roots in society and such apprehensions are capable of being allayed by imposing stricter conditions,” it observed. The court further noted: “It would violate and infringe the fundamental right to life and liberty guaranteed to the accused, if the accused is denied bail in the present case on such nature of accusations and material only on the ground that the investigating agency is yet to establish the identity of the several other members of the unlawful assembly.” While granting the bail, the judge directed Sidhu to deposit his passport with the investigating officer and appear before the police station as well as the court as and when required. “He shall not influence, threaten, intimidate witnesses nor tamper with evidence in any manner whatsoever,” the court added. The court, meanwhile, said that while it was beyond the realm of dispute that dissent and dialogue is fundamental to democracy where the absolute power vests in the people exercised by the people through its elected representatives and that the Constitution of India guarantees the right to protest, “the present FIR, however, is not impinging upon this fundamental right to protest in any manner.” On January 26, thousands of protesting farmers clashed with police, the agency claimed in its FIR, adding that many of them who were driving tractors entered Red Fort, where a religious flag was also hoisted. Police said two magazines with 20 live cartridges were snatched from two cops by protesters who also damaged vehicles and robbed anti-riot gear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/deep-sidhu-held-for-red-fort-violence-on-r-day-gets-bail/articleshow/82123420.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Coronavirus surge makes wedding plans a ‘knotty’ affair||LUCKNOW: Prateek Sehta and his fiancee Nishi Athwani have been planning their wedding for months. After visiting Delhi and Mumbai for their shopping and going about in different cities to decide their wedding venue, the 25-year-old couple had finally put a stop at Jim Corbett (Uttarakhand) for their big day. However, the second wave of coronavirus and subsequently the night curfew timings following it has derailed their plans. The businessman from Krishnanagar says he couldn’t risk exposing guests and family members to infection. After several discussions and speaking to vendors and planners, the couple has decided to get married in a gurdwara, instead of their venue in Uttarakhand, in the presence of close friends and family. “Most of our relatives were coming from different cities and hotel rooms were booked for them. But the health situation has spun and it is out of control. Safety is our priority. Therefore, we have decided to go for a gurdwara wedding with limited guests. In this way, we will not breach any Covid protocol or night curfew timing,” says Sehta, adding that as soon as the situation settles, they will plan a few functions. Shikha Mishra (name changed on request), whose wedding is scheduled on April 29, is rather upset. “Our wedding was postponed last year. We had planned the marriage this time keeping in mind the protection of our guests. Invites have already been sent out and even if we want to, we can’t cancel it because all arrangements and payments have been done. No refund is being given. We do not know whether guests will arrive or not and how we will wind up the wedding before 8pm. There is so much confusion,” says the 26-year-old. Covid impact didn’t auger well for Satish Verma as well. The engineer has cancelled the wedding band and caterers, and is now planning to go for a court marriage instead. “This was not how I wanted it to be. I thought since my company has given another year of work from home, this would be the best time to get married and start a new phase of my life. However, things are not turning out the way I imagined. My wedding was supposed to be a lavish affair but night curfew timing is a big jolt to the whole plan. Most of our guests have cancelled their plans,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/corona-surge-makes-wedding-plans-a-knotty-affair/articleshow/82122656.cms||Aditi Singh

Owing to the pandemic, only a limited number of students participated in the programme maintaining distance.At 12.15pm, the sun was at the zenith (positioned directly above a location) and therefore the shadow was not visible. Trichy Astro club organised experiments explaining the phenomenon at the Bharathi matriculation higher secondary school in KK Nagar. Zero shadow can be observed for about a minute twice a year in the city, and this years it falls on April 17 and August 16. “The sun is not positioned exactly above us everyday as zero shadow day happens only in countries situated between the tropic of Capricorn and the tropic of Cancer. It is considered that Eratosthenes, a Greek mathematician had calculated the circumference of the earth on zero shadow day,” said K Balakrishnan, organiser, Trichy Astro club. A question and answer session was also held for the students to bust myths. The students had questions on the claims of kalasam of Thanjavur Peruvudaiyar temple not casting a shadow on the ground. They were informed that the kalasam casts its shadow but as the base of the temple’s vimana (structure over sanctum sanctorum) is wider than the kalasam, the shadow often fall on the vimana, thus going unnoticed. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/fewer-students-turn-up-to-observe-zero-shadow-day/articleshow/82122171.cms||---

In fact, the percentage of home isolation cases has improved by 3% when compared to last week. On April 10, around 73% patients were in home isolation as against 76% on Thursday. Health officials said a majority of the patients had mild symptoms. “About 45,700 or 84% of the total 54,351 patients in the PMC limits are in home isolation. Most of them are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. We appeal to the patients in home care to follow the guidelines strictly to avoid any complications,” a PMC health official said. A Vishrantwadi resident, who recently recovered from Covid-19, said since her symptoms were mild, she preferred to stay in home isolation under her doctor’s advice. “I successfully completed my isolation a week ago and followed all the instructions advised by the doctor during the isolation period,” she said. The Pimpri Chinchwad areas have around 22,382 active Covid-19 cases, of whom 70% patients (about 15,800) are in home isolation. According to the data released by the district health office, only 64% patients were in home isolation till a month ago (March 15). At the beginning of April, the share increased to 76% and since then it has continued to stay around 76% despite a rapid rise in Covid-19 caseload, which increased from 22,200 on March 16 to 64,800 on April 1 and 98,859 on April 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-76-of-pmr-cases-in-home-care-despite-tally-hitting-98k/articleshow/82122163.cms||Sarang Dastane

Restrictions imposed for the first time this year were taken seriously by the majority of residents as they stayed indoors. However, there were a few during morning and evening hours who were seen walking in groups on roads. Adhiraj Singh, a resident of Vaishali Nagar said, “As parks are closed, residents used roads for morning and evening walks and entered many colonies. The government should make rules to prevent such people to walk free in groups during curfew.” The curfew also failed to discourage people, particularly youngsters, from going around the city on their vehicles and socialising unnecessarily. Similarly, migrants who were apprehensive that last year’s situation could occur again, were found in large numbers at Sindhi Camp waiting for buses from morning to evening. Bhupendra Kumar, who resides near Sindhi Camp said, “Since last night, there has been an unusual rush at the bus stand. It was assumed that there would be no crowd during curfew. On the contrary, it’s more than usual.” Meanwhile, as major markets were closed, the markets wore a deserted look and roads were empty. Essential facilities such as groceries, dairies, shops selling fruits and vegetables, bakeries, milk supply, and confectioneries remained open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/weekend-curfew-to-check-covid-successful-in-city/articleshow/82122159.cms||---
---||Trichy||Crackdown on tax defaulters in Trichy||TRICHY: Hit by severe fund crunch for the past few years, the Trichy Corporation has embarked on a drive to retrieve property tax and other user charge arrears amounting to Rs 42 crore, by preparing a list of top 100 defaulters. The civic body has set a target for officials to complete the tax collection before May 1. While commercial properties face lock and seal warning, the civic body is terminating drinking water connections in houses that are yet to pay the dues. On an average, about 200 water connections are terminated daily. The civic body said fund crunch has hit the operation and maintenance activities. Officials claimed that if it escalates, it would delay the salaries and pensions of employees. Considering the situation, assistant commissioners, revenue officers and bill collectors were directed to collect the arrears in property tax, water charge and underground drainage (UGD) user fee through a door-to-door survey. With a non-existent council and assembly election result awaited, the corporation is utilising the opportunity by cracking the whip on commercial establishments that have leased the properties. The tough measures such as lock and seal, disconnection of water connections have helped the local body collect arrears for around Rs 1 to Rs 2 crore per day in the past two weeks. If the entire dues are paid, the water connection will be restored free of cost, officials said. When asked about the delayed action against lessees who defaulted on payment for decades, the civic body blamed the political influence for hindering the revenue generation. “We have collected around 68% of arrears in property taxes and water tax since 2019. Revenue wing will collect at least 90% of the arrears before May 1. The drive will go on even during the weekends,” corporation commissioner and special officer S Sivasubramanian told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/crackdown-on-tax-defaulters-in-trichy/articleshow/82122157.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Hyderabad||Will Sputnik lower $10 per dose global rate in India?||Hyderabad: Can the Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V, which received emergency use authorisation (EUA) approval earlier this week, be available in India at cheaper rates than it is globally?At a time Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and its Indian partner Dr Reddy's Laboratories are engaged in discussions with the Indian government on pricing, pharma industry sources said a cheaper vaccine may be possible in India as the cost of manufacturing it here will be significantly lower.Pharma industry sources indicated that the Indian manufacturers may be able to churn out the vaccine at much lower than $2 per dose. “The cost of manufacturing each dose in India will be well below $2 per dose and could be around $1.5 per dose,” said a source in the know.Currently RDIF is selling Sputnik V at $10 (Rs 750) per dose in global markets. On the other hand, the Indian government has capped the prices of Covid-19 vaccine at Rs 150 per dose ($2).While a Dr Reddy’s Laboratories spokesperson declined to comment on the pricing of the vaccine as “it is part of ongoing discussions”, he refused to reveal the manufacturing cost details stating that “it is sensitive information”.Most of the companies that RDIF has tied up with for manufacturing Sputnik V are learnt to be working round-the-clock to gear up for production and are already in the trial production phase.“Any GMP (good manufacturing practices) standardisation process takes about six months but as this is an emergency situation even the standardisation process is on an accelerated timeline,” said a source at one of the manufacturers.RDIF has already entered into tie-ups with Hetero Biopharma (100 million doses), Panacea Biotech (100m), Gland Pharma (252m), Virchow Biotech (200m) Stelis Biopharma (200m) for a total of 852 million doses, which is enough to vaccinate 426 million people.Sputnik V comprises two human adenoviral vectors -- Ad26 and Ad5 – that have to be injected 21 days apart.Apart from these five manufacturers that RDIF has joined hands with, Dr Reddy’s has tied up with Bengaluru-based Shilpa Medicare for manufacturing an undisclosed quantum of Sputnik V doses.The Sputnik V rollout in India is expected to begin in May with the help of imported doses from Russia after which the Indian manufactured doses are slated to be ready for use in the July-September quarter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-sputnik-lower-10-per-dose-global-rate-in-india/articleshow/82122684.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The district has 1,123 village panchayats and around 19,000 government employees have been deputed for election duty. At least 13 of them, who have been diagnosed with the infection, are now running from pillar to post to get their names removed from the duty list. One such teacher said, “I have been deputed as a polling officer. I had recently tested positive for Covid-19 and subsequently my wife got tested too. Even though her result was also positive, both of us have been deputed at different polling booths. I tried contacting my seniors, but none has responded positively so far.” Bijnor district magistrate Ramakant Pandey said that those who were already deputed as polling officers but later tested positive for Covid-19 need not join duty. He added that they would be exempted from duty after verification of their test reports. Meanwhile, superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh said that all preparations have been made for the upcoming polls and security has been beefed up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/13-covid-positive-govt-officials-deputed-for-panchayat-poll-duty-in-bijnor/articleshow/82121753.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Mumbai||Sign of the times: Autograph hunters celebrate calls from celebs||At 11 am on November 23 last year, a Delhi landline number flashed on Andheri-based Amit Chhawsaria’s phone. “The minister would like to speak to you,” said an unfamiliar voice in Hindi, which was followed by a familiar voice. “Hello Amit, thank you so much for your Diwali greeting. Extremely grateful for your warm wishes. I hope your family and you had a great Diwali,” said textile minister Smriti Irani before asking Chhawsaria what he did for a living and wishing the civil engineer a “great working experience in the steel industry”. This one-minute acknowledgement call now sits as a first-of-its-kind keepsake in the 28-year-old autograph hunter’s digital library of signed memorabilia, although two more VIPs would soon surprise him with similar sound notes. This January, Chennai-based mridangam legend UK Sivaraman called him and made small talk ranging from Chhawsaria's unique surname to the whereabouts of his birthplace, Akola while a little before that, pioneering Indian oncologist Dr V Shanta dismissed Chhawsaria’s fawning praises over the phone with “I'm just doing my job” and promised “We’ll keep in touch”, before she passed away in Chennai this January. Turns out it’s the best of times and the worst of times to be a member of the Autograph Collectors Club of India. Started in 1993 by Kolkata-based Santosh Lahoti — who got his first autograph from Mother Theresa as a 12-year-old boy scout — the club’s seasoned record-seekers are chiefly men bound by unspoken rules such as “learn to gatecrash” and “be shameless”. Over the last year — as the pandemic caused the world to hit a giant pause button — these members have been receiving unprecedented showers of personal acknowledgement calls from VIPs they’ve written to. While they find this heartening, they also mourn the loss of the thrill they lived for: chasing celebrities in person. This inability stings particularly hard right now because it's IPL season and the cricketers — whom these men would be pursuing with pens, books, sneakers, gloves, jerseys, season balls, miniature bats and hungry tummies in normal times — are ensconced in impenetrable bio-bubbles. So, on hold for the moment, are those brief, humid, unscripted meetings that often turn these enthusiastic members into keen eyewitnesses of history. “Don’t you want a selfie with me?” Herschelle Gibbs had asked Thane’s Manoj Kulkarni last year. While he misses bringing home such memories, Kulkarni who inherited his hobby from his father — has been taking solace in the calls he recently received from retired cop Julio Ribeiro and Bollywood actress Bindu. Ravish Malhotra—who had served as backup for Rakesh Sharma on the mission which launched the first Indian into space-- sent Kulkarni an acknowledgement message after signing his photos. Meanwhile, during this sluggish phase, swapping autographs has been sustaining a few members. Shivaji Sanyal —whose collection spans the gamut of penmanship from former chairman of Palestine Liberation Organisation Yasser Arafat to Western Classical maestro Zubin Mehta—recently exchanged a signature of artist MF Husain for an autograph of artist S H Raza. Sanyal is aware of a parallel autograph market—where signatures are bought, sold and forged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sign-of-the-times-autograph-hunters-celebrate-calls-from-celebs/articleshow/82123456.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

The services recently came under heavy criticism for delayed response in getting potential Covid patients from home to hospital. The authorities also accepted that compared to 10-15 minutes of response time in the city, it got stretched to up to two and a half hours due to heavy rush. Jashvant Prajapati, COO of EMRI Gujarat, said that compared to 3,000-odd calls in general days and 8,000-odd callsa day they received overall during the pandemic, for the past fortnight, the call volume increased to 25,000 a day, almost 18 calls every minute. “The older ambulances have been repaired and pressed into service, as a new line is installed to take up to 120 calls simultaneously. We have also set up a 50-seat call centre in support of the education department in Gandhinagar to address the rush,” said Prajapati, adding that all the trained personnel with EMRI services are attending the calls.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 2nd wave subdues Ramzan festivity, but religious fervour is just as strong||Mumbai: Silence falls as the muezzin calls out the maghrib or evening prayers. While fasting men and women break their roza and pray at home as mosques are shut, roadside snack sellers quickly wrap up their business. Police vans patrol the area even as those on the roads rush back to their homes. Ramzan at Mohammed Ali Road was not so lacklustre. With shops shut, Ramzan shoppers are absent from the streets. So are diners who would hit the khau gallis near the iconic Minara Masjid for a variety of kebabs, baida rotis, roomali rotis, sheermal, malpuas and sherbet. As night falls, the streets are deserted. Thanks to the restrictions and barricades to stop restricting vehicles — only those used for essential services are allowed — in the wake of surge in the second Covid wave, Ramzan’s charms are missing. “It hardly seems Ramzan is here. Nobody is rushing to the mosques and no outsiders visit our streets to enjoy Ramzan delicacies. Neither the spiritual nor culinary aspect of Ramzan is visible,” bemoaned Amin Parekh, a local. Restaurant owners, perfumers, cap and rosary sellers, snack vendors who did quick business from their carts, all complain that business is down to less than 20% of what they used to earn in previous Ramzans, barring last year when it saw complete lockdown. “We can only take orders from Swiggy and Zomato services. It is difficult to even pay salaries of the staff,” said Omair Shaikh who owns Shalimar restaurant. Shahadat Khan, manager at Chinese N Grill restaurant, rued that food lovers who came looking for fabulous delicacies earlier are absent this year due to the rampaging infectious disease. “We would be flooded with orders, both for parcels and customers who ate here. It doesn’t seem like Ramzan time any more,” he said. Gone also is the well-attended sehri (pre-dawn meal) party of Babu Qureshi Foundation’s Khalid Babu Qureshi and Imran Babu Qureshi. “The idea was to invite guests from different communities and help strengthen communal bonds over food,” said Khalid Babu Qureshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2nd-wave-subdues-ramzan-festivity-but-religious-fervour-is-just-as-strong/articleshow/82123504.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

The farmers protested for around two hours after which the administrative officials assured them to provide the gunny bags soon. However, the farmers and arhtiyas claimed that procurement of the wheat has been affected following shortage of gunny bags. “We held a protest from 11am to 1pm on Saturday at Patiala – Sunam road near Gharachon grain market of Sangrur district against the shortage of gunny bags. The administration had failed to provide the bags in time following which the farmers have been facing difficulties and the procurement of wheat produce is affected in the grain markets. The officials have assured us to provide bags by Sunday evening,” said Jagtar Singh, BKU (Ekta Ugraha) leader in Sangrur Similarly, in Patiala grain market the arhtiyas claimed that procurement was affected due to shortage of gunny bags. “The tenders for the gunny bags have been opened on Friday, but these are yet to reach the grain markets. The wheat produce is arriving in the grain markets at high pace but the yield cannot be packed and stored following lack of gunny bags. There was no procurement on Saturday in Patiala grain market.” ‘Should have been done earlier’ Navjot Kaur Sidhu, wife of Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu, on Saturday opened her office in Patiala and targeted the state government over failure to make preparations of implementing the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme and said these orders were issued by the central government around two years ago but the state government had not done any preparations regarding this but now Punjab had to implement it in one go. “The orders issued from higher authorities cannot be deferred or rejected easily. The issue of farm crisis will not be resolved with only the repeal of three agricultural laws. I am working out on a plan to improve farmers’ income. We don’t need five corporate houses, we need 200 corporate houses. We need to improve quality of soil and food.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/protest-in-patiala-as-gunny-bags-shortage-affects-procurement/articleshow/82122713.cms||---

One of them said her mother had said there was no greater duty that they could perform. At 3.30am on Thursday, her mother passed away in the Covid ICU after a week’s battle with the virus. Six hours later, Dr Shilpa Patel, an associate professor with the anatomy department at the state-run SSG Hospital, was back in the saddle trying to save lives. After carrying out the last rites of her 77-year-old mother Kanta Ambalal Patel, she diligently donned her PPE suit once again, staying true to her mother’s words: duty before everything else. Dr Rahul Parmar, too, lost his mother, Kanta Parmar (67), who passed away from age-related issues in Gandhinagar on Thursday. But Parmar, who is the nodal officer for Covid management and part of the dead body disposal team at central Gujarat’s biggest hospital, finished the cremation rituals and rushed back to join duty on Friday. “It was a natural death. I finished the cremation rituals with my family and returned to Vadodara,” said Parmar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-gujarat-doctors-back-at-work-hours-after-last-rites-of-moms/articleshow/82124665.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Lucknow||Covid helpline leaves patients helpless, frantic kin send SOS on social media||Lucknow: A 33-year-old Covid-19 patient, currently under home-isolation, is unaware of the tragedy that has struck his family. His mother has lost her battle for life while his 64-year-old father is unconscious and has been put on ventilator support at a private hospital. His mother’s last rites were performed on Thursday. His uncle, a sepatuagenarian, has been making desperate attempts to arrange for Remdesivir injection as the hospital’s stock has dried up. The hospital is located on Lucknow-Barabanki border and has been empanelled as a Covid facility of Lucknow. Finally, the family took to social media with an SOS message. Four vials were arranged but the family had to travel to Kanpur late night to bring two vials. Two more vials are awaited. The senior citizen, who is a Lucknow-based businessman, said: “I pray that nobody has to face what we have been through in the last 4-5 days. We got no support from the Integrated Covid Command Centre (ICCC). I’m 70-plus and cannot go out because of the risk involved. Since I have means and some influential contacts, I could get my brother and his wife admitted to a hospital. Unfortunately, she succumbed as she couldn’t get help in time. Thanks to social media, we could get Remdesivir injections.” “Besides ICCC, the hospital management was also unsupportive. I had to seek the help of a senior officer to ensure that Remdesivir injection brought from Kanpur is administered to my brother who is in a critical condition. I can’t imagine how others are facing this difficult time when the entire system seems to have collapsed,” he said. Like them, hundreds of Covid patients and their families are posting frantic messages on social media platforms and flooding the inbox of officials, but not many are getting help due to shortage of beds, oxygen, medicine and excessive number of cases. A 56-year-old Covid-19 patient whose oxygen saturation level was below 90 is still waiting for admission even after an SOS was sent to authorities on social media group on Friday afternoon. Similarly, the family of a 66-year-old patient sought help from officials through social media after they failed to contact ICCC. The patient was shifted to hospital early Saturday morning. In yet another case, a Covid-19 patient’s acquaintance wrote to district administration authorities: “Four days back, a referral was issued from CMO office, the patient was taken to a government-run dedicated Covid hospital but the hospital in-charge has denied admission citing non-availability of oxygen. They have asked the family to bring oxygen cylinder along for admission. Please intervene, patient’s condition is critical.” In charge of special Covid-19 control cell, Ritu Suhas, intervened in the matter and got the patient admitted to the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-helpline-leaves-patients-helpless-frantic-kin-send-sos-on-social-media/articleshow/82122708.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The accused — Sumer Jat and Shashank Pandya — were arrested from Sikar. They were also wanted in cases in Ambala, Hanumangarh and Ajmer. Five armed men had looted Rs 12 lakh and a kilogram of gold ornaments in broad daylight. Before launching the manhunt, Jaipur police took inputs from Sikar and Jaipur Rural police about the accused. “The inputs lead us to Sikar. Jat was arrested from Fatehpur and Pandya from Laxmangarh. Jat attempted to confront the police and pointed at a loaded gun, but the cops overpowered him. They were brought to Jaipur,” said Ajay Pal Lamba, ACP, Jaipur Police Commissionerate. Jat is from Sikar while Pandya is a native of Gorakhpur, who is also wanted in a similar case of loot in Ambala. Police said they had sold gold jewellery looted from the showroom. “The amount is being tracked,” said Lamba, while adding that soon other three accused will be under police net, including Vickram Barad, one of the two accused who hatched the conspiracy. The arrest did not come easy for police. After the incident on April 11, Jaipur police formed different teams and started scanning CCTV camera footage and questioned the criminals of the area. Police kept the operation secret since they were aware that the accused were armed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/two-arrested-from-sikar-in-chomu-jewellery-loot-case/articleshow/82122183.cms||---

According to the state’s election department, Rajsamand recorded 67% voting, followed by Sujangarh in Churu district (60%) and Sahara in Bhilwara district (57%). The overall voting percentage stood at 61%. In 2018 assembly polls, 74% polling was recorded in Sahara, 71% in Sujangarh and 77% in Rajsamand. The voting percentage was 10% till 9am, 23% (11 am), 36% (1pm), 45% (3pm), 49% (4pm) and 54% (5pm). On a pilot basis, the election commission used ‘booth app’ in all the 1,145 polling stations for providing information on real-time voter turnout. State’s chief electoral officer Praveen Gupta said, “The voter’s data goes to the election commission’s server as soon as the serial number is uploaded from the voter slip of a voter coming to the polling station through the ‘booth app’. This server is connected to the ‘voter turnout’ app, which shows the increase in turnout percentage immediately on the app.” He said, “If a voter tries to exercise his franchise by using the same voter slip, it can be stopped through this app.” Volunteers were deployed at every booth to assist PwD (persons with disability) voters and senior citizens. Around 925 wheelchairs and 137 vehicles were deployed for specially abled voters. Bhilwara’s election department introduced new initiatives to help specially abled and visually impaired voters cast their votes. Mikes were installed at polling stations in Sahara constituency to guide visually impaired voters to the EVMs. Gupta said there were 29,180 specially abled and elderly voters above 80 years in the state. In all three assembly constituencies, 904 voters agreed to vote through postal ballot and out of these, 895 voters finally used this facility. The state’s election department seized cash, liquor, narcotics, drugs and other items worth Rs 3.13 crore from three assembly constituencies in the run up to the bypolls. While Rs 25.35 lakh cash was seized from three districts, liquor worth Rs 27.31 lakh was seized by various expenditure monitoring teams. Drugs worth Rs 1.43 crore, other items worth Rs 90.81 lakh and precious metals worth Rs 26.42 lakh were also seized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/61-voter-turnout-in-3-bypolls-rajsamand-tops-list-with-67/articleshow/82122720.cms||---

Referring to the incident in Rajasamand’s Rajnagar police station, Poonia said it was unfortunate that Kumari, BJP MLA Madan Dilawar complained against the Congress workers of distributing money to police, but they didn’t take any action. “Congress workers gheraoed Kumari and Dilawar at the police station show how deep the administration is working with the ruling government to ensure victory of their candidate,” said Poonia. He said they have evidence that Congress workers influencing the voters and BJP workers reported the matter to the police. “On the contrary, the police had detained our party workers for the whole night under Section 151 of the CrPC,” said Poonia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-misused-govt-machinery-in-bypolls-bjp/articleshow/82122182.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Indian variant found in 50% samples sent for gene probe from Maharashtra, none from Mumbai||MUMBAI: Almost 50% of the samples that have tested positive for Covid-19 in the state and were sent from some of the districts for genome sequencing have the newly identified and highly infectious Indian variant of SARS-CoV-2 called B.1.617. Most of these samples are from Vidarbha and no sample submitted from the city has so far shown the B.1.617 variant, said scientists involved with INSACOG, a grouping of 10 national laboratories carrying out whole genomic sequencing of samples. The Union health ministry has so far not given specific details about the whole genome sequencing project. A communication on Friday said as of Thursday, 13,614 whole genome sequencing samples had been processed at the 10 INSACOG labs. “Of these, 1,189 samples have tested positive for variants of concern for SARS COV-2 in India. This includes 1,109 samples with UK variants; 79 samples with South African variant and one sample with the Brazil variant,” the ministry release said. Some information on the results of the samples sent from the state was given to state health minister Rajesh Tope at a virtual meeting with Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Saturday. Tope said that of the 1,100 samples sent so far, 500 had been examined. State govt seeks detailed report on Indian variantState health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday said that after learning that 50% of the Covid-19-positive samples from the state have the highly infectious Indian variant of SARS-CoV-2 called B.1.617, he had asked for a detailed report from the Centre on it. He said he had been told that it would be available only at the end of the research. The concern in the state — and the rest of the world, too, because the Indian variant has been isolated in multiple samples in the UK and the US — is the high transmissibility of the variant. “As the new variant is said to be highly infectious, we sought a report and revised guidelines, if any, from the Centre,” Tope said. “The Centre said a detailed report would be made available only at the end of the research.” State director of health services Dr Archana Patil said she did know from where the samples had been collected. “In some samples changes are seen, but there is no comment on whether they explain this surge,” Patil said. The B.1.617 was first identified by scientists from the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in Delhi as part of the INSACOG project. They noted two mutations, L452R and E484K, that are known to have the ability to escape antibodies. Articles written by experts across the world have noted that the Indian variant could be “at least in part” driving the current wave. IGIB director Dr Anurag Agrawal said almost 15,000 Covid-19-positive samples had been studied since December. “Our team of scientists identified the variant which has since been named B.1.617. Overall, it is present in a small percentage of samples, but its presence has been growing in recent weeks,” Dr Agrawal said. Scientists from other countries had more details. “The new strain has been detected in at least five Indian states, including Maharashtra, Delhi and Punjab, which have all contributed to the surge of cases in the country, in addition to the B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa), and P.1 (Brazil) variants which are also circulating (in) India,” William A. Haseltine, former Harvard Medical School professor, said in a Forbes article. He wrote that while the extent to which the strain had spread was unknown, of the 2,844 sequences submitted to the GISAID database from India since March 1, 162 sequences (about 6%) had been classified as B.1.617. “This percentage is likely to grow,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-govt-seeks-detailed-report-on-indian-variant/articleshow/82122718.cms||Malathy Iyer

Another meeting with the DMs and police officers is scheduled for Sunday. “Whatever decision the government takes on Sunday, it will not be the last and final. In fact, fresh decisions will be taken as per the developing situation, which will be assessed, monitored and reviewed later,” Nitish added. In his address, the governor asked the political parties to sink their differences and work for humanity, as the second wave of coronavirus had proved to be very dangerous. The governor also gave details of the steps that the state government has taken to tackle the pandemic situation. The CM said talks had been held with Medanta hospital head Dr Naresh Trehan for its conversion and use as dedicated Covid hospital (DCH), while directions have also been given to maintain the supply of medicines and oxygen at the hospitals. Leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, state BJP chief Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal, state Congress president Madan Mohan Jha, CPI(ML) state secretary Kunal, former CM and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) state chief Prince Raj, among others, gave their suggestions to tackle the critical situation. The CM, along with deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi and senior officials joined the conclave through videoconferencing from the CM secretariat. Broadly, leaders of most political parties were opposed to the blanket lockdown without making any advance arrangements. They also said the migrant workers returning from other states should be subjected to Covid-19 tests and adequate arrangements should be made for it. They also favoured conducting more tests. As to the lockdown option, Tejashwi said the government should not go for it without detailed plan and, instead, favoured weekend curfew. State BJP chief Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal supported lockdown from Friday 6pm to Monday 8am every week, leaving four and a half days for work. “If the lockdown has to be imposed, advance plan and preparations should be made. People should also be informed about it,” Tejashwi said. Similarly, Congress chief Jha, Manjhi and leaders of other parties also had reservations about the lockdown. Manjhi maintained that the “poor and labour classes will die of hunger if the lockdown is imposed”. Otherwise, they pressed for DCHs at the district and divisional headquarters, increasing the number of tests, conducting vaccination drive. Tejashwi said the hospitals of the railways, Army and such other bodies should be reserved for the frontline workers if they fell ill. Dr Jaiswal asked for DCHs at Madhepura, Bettiah and Darbhanga. As students and young persons were also getting infected, schools should be declared closed from April 18 to June 1, while extra classes could be arranged by cancelling leave for puja and other festivities in winter, Dr Jaiswal also suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/new-curbs-to-check-covid-today-nitish/articleshow/82121791.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Ahmedabad||584 hospitals, 1,292 schools in city lack fire NOC: Gujarat govt||AHMEDABAD: The state government has placed before the Gujarat high court new figures of hospitals, schools and industrial units, which do not have valid fire NOCs. The government response came following the directions issued by the court in response to a PIL regarding the Shrey Hospital fire tragedy, in which eight Covid-19 patients lost their lives last year. In a report submitted to the high court on Friday, the joint secretary of urban development and urban housing department R H Vasava said that the city of Ahmedabad has 584 hospitals which did not have valid fire NOC on April 1. The city has 1,292 schools and as many as 15,165 factories and industrial units without the fire department’s certificate required to prove that they have adequate fire protection system in place. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) had initiated a sealing drive citing the HC order, but only two hospitals were sealed and 309 hospitals were issued notices. This has brought the association of hospitals before the high court with a separate petition. In its affidavit, the state government has said that it had data of 1,852 hospitals and it found that 65 hospitals were closed. There were 210 hospitals in the city whose fire NOC term had expired. For schools in Ahmedabad, the government said that on April 1, there were 1,292 schools without fire NOC. There are total 2,395 schools, which include 441 schools run by the AMC. Earlier statement by the authorities was at variance with this so far as the figure of schools without fire NOCs is concerned. With regard to over 15,000 industrial units without fire NOC, the government has submitted that it will convey to different bodies like Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) to instruct these units to obtain fire NOC. During the last hearing, the HC had pulled up the authorities for negligence regarding keeping the schools across the state safe. The judges had expressed shock at 5,911 schools across the state running without valid fire NOC. The government said that the activity of securing fire safety measures in schools is going on in ‘campaign’ mode in city areas. It said that in municipal corporation limits, the government received 554 applications from schools for obtaining NOCs, whereas the authorities have issued notices to 2,720 schools for installation of fire safety systems. Six buildings have been sealed. The government has also informed the HC that it has decided to establish a high level technical committee to solve the problems of old buildings which have height between 15 and 18 metres. Earlier, buildings with heights above 18 metres were required to get fire NOC, but new norms mandate it for all buildings with height above 15 metres. The government said that it is facing difficulty in examining the possibility to retrofit minimum fire protection installations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/584-hospitals-1292-schools-in-city-lack-fire-noc-govt/articleshow/82122748.cms||---

Battling uneasiness and severe weakness at home, Rupal inquired for admission at the hospital on Friday and got confirmation, following which she went all by herself to the hospital. Her family was shocked to learn about her death in the wee hours of Saturday and alleged a mismanaged admission process and inadequate infrastructure. “The hospital confirmed a room and bed for her. But when she reported at the emergency ward around 7pm on Friday, she was denied admission citing ‘there was no relative accompanying her’,” said Dipan Thakkar, Rupal’s brother. Around 9pm, she was finally on oxygen support through Bipap. “The hospital didn’t have an ICU bed, so we decided to shift her next morning,” Dipan added. Around 3.30am, he learnt from the hospital that Rupal’s oxygen levels had dipped critically. “Despite repeated attempts, we couldn’t find a single ambulance. By 5am, I leanrt that she has a cardiac problem and within 30 minutes, she was no more,” said Dipan. The family was left devastated but their ordeal didn’t end yet. “On Saturday morning, the hospital asked us to obtain death certificate from Rupal’s physician. After repeated arguments, they asked for an NOC from the police station. Finally we got a certificate around 1pm and initiated process for last rites,” her brother said. Later, when they went to collect her belongings, the family alleged that Rupal’s ATM card and Rs 5,000 in cash were missing. Sunil Mehta, general manager of Shalby Hospital, said the patient was critical when she arrived. “She did not have any relative with her that can complete the formalities. The hospital however started treatment,” he said. Talking about the post-demise procedure, Mehta said that the hospital followed the protocol. He added that Thakkar did not have the said ATM or cash on her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-patient-dies-within-8-hrs-of-admission/articleshow/82122731.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Shrinking med facilities in pandemic compound woes of non-Covid patients||Lucknow: Shaista Alam (79) of Nishatganj, who had breathing problem, was admitted to a private non-Covid facility after testing negative to coronavirus infection. She, however, lost her battle for life on Saturday for the want of a ventilator. Shaista was admitted to the non-Covid hospital on Tuesday but the CT scan of her lungs two days later suggested she might have corornavirus infection. The hospital asked her family to arrange antiviral drug, Remdesivir, but before it could be arranged, her blood oxygen level dropped to 35% on Friday night. “The hospital referred her to KGMU Trauma Centre but no ventilator for Covid or non-Covid patients was available there. We came back to the same private hospital which said that a ventilator would be available in the morning. However, she could not survive,” said her grandson, Anwar. In Shaista’s case, the family members are not sure if she had Covid-19, but they said her life could have been saved had there been a ventilator in non-Covid hospital before she could be shifted to a Covid facility. As most of the multi-speciality and superspeciality centres have been converted into Covid facilities, the non-Covid hospitals, both government and private, are facing shortage of required expertise and infrastructure. The problem is even bigger for people from economically weaker sections who cannot afford costly private hospitals and depend on facilities like KGMU, RMLIMS or SGPGIMS. Namita Shukla, 37, suffers from liver cirrhosis but is unable to visit the doctor at KGMU because the entire staff of the department concerned had to quarantine itself when some staff members tested Covid positive. Moreover, the university has limited patient intake. Santosh Puri (57), a resident of Aashiana, who suffers from obstructive sleep apnea has bought a machine costing over Rs 50,000 for continuous positive airway pressure therapy so that he can take care of himself in case of emergency. “His condition deteriorated on April 2 but no doctor or hospital was available because of the Covid situation. We somehow managed the situation through teleconsultation from a doctor friend. Later, we decided to buy the machine and all medicines in bulk for any emergency,” said Puri’s son Ankit. Pragati Tewari (29) of Wazirganj is six-month pregnant and suffers from several complications but her doctor has closed her clinic. “I don’t know where to go for follow up. Another issue which is bothering me is what I would do if I contract infection,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shrinking-med-facilities-in-pandemic-compound-woes-of-non-covid-patients/articleshow/82122724.cms||---

Its heritage, culture and captivating natural sites have always attracted filmmakers.To showcase these opportunities to the film industry, a dialogue programme was organised by the Rajasthan Foundation through Bollywood celebrity Aamir Khan recently. In this programme, suggestions were sought for the proposed film city and a film policy by the state government, besides promoting film tourism, which would provide opportunities to local artistes.Suggestions were also sought from Bollywood producers to overcome the problems faced by them.Commissioner Dheeraj Srivastava apprised him of the proposed film policy and the efforts being made by the state government to promote the film industry in the state and assured the film producers of full co-operation from the state government to overcome the problems faced by them in the state.“The state government is planning to come out with a policy to promote filmmaking in the state. Rajasthan, which is known for its desert, palaces and forts, has been a favourite of the film directors, but due to some unsavoury incidents in the past, film producers have been hesitant to come to the state. So the state government has initiated steps to reach out to the film fraternity to assure them of all help,” said source familiar with the development.Actor Aamir Khan, appreciating the initiative, gave very important suggestions to promote film tourism in the state, in which single window solution for the filmmakers is the main one. The producers must get clearance expeditiously so that they need not approach various departments for approvals. Appreciating the draft film policy issued by the state government, it was proposed to be placed in the Film Producers Guild. After getting suggestions from the Guild, the final draft would be made, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-govt-to-promote-film-shooting-policy-soon/articleshow/82122186.cms||---

---||Patna||Increase Covid beds, RTPCR tests in Bihar: HC||PATNA: The Patna high court on Saturday directed the state government as well as AIIMS-Patna to increase the number of beds for Covid-19 patients. It also directed the state government sternly to increase the RTPCR testing. A division bench of Justices Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Mohit Kumar Shah conducted a special hearing via virtual mode for three hours from 4.30pm on three PILs on the alarming situation of Covid-19 in the state. Health department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit along with state health society executive director Manoj Kumar appeared before the bench. However, Amrit took leave of the court soon as he had fever. The court urged the AIIMS-Patna director to remain present for next hearing on Monday. Additional advocate generals Anjani Kumar and SD Yadav appeared for the state while Binay Kumar Pandey represented AIIMS-P and Rajeev Kumar Singh appeared for Shivani Kaushik. The health director’s reply that there was no problem in getting RTPCR tests done in the state irked the court as the ASG submitted that even he could not get his daughter’s RTPCR test done. The bench observed that if a person like the ASG is facing such a problem then the situation of a common man could be easily understood. The state government submitted that 40,000 RTPCR tests were being done per day with the help of 18 laboratories in different medical college and hospitals and five private ones. It also submitted that nine more laboratories, including three at Motihari, Munger and Purnia, would be commissioned for RTPCR testing within three weeks. The court directed the government to ensure their functioning within the said time. Obeying the HC’s Thursday direction, the state submitted that the Ct value was being mentioned in the RTPCR reports from April 16 onwards. The state government also submitted that it will purchase 20 x-ray machines within a week and a letter of intent for purchasing 14 CT-scan machines for different district hospitals would be issued within three months. It also submitted that 16 district hospitals already have Ct-scan machines. The state government submitted that it would make emergency procurement of Remdesivir under National Disaster Management Act. Counsel Sumeet Kumar Singh, appearing for a petitioner, Gaurav Kumar Singh, submitted that he failed to find the injection in the open market and it was available on blackmarket for more than Rs30,000. Centre’s ASG KN Singh submitted that he has received information from the defence department on deployment of medical team of armed forces at ESIC hospital in Bihta. The HC directed that the Bihta hospital must start functioning as a dedicated Covid hospital from Monday. Meanwhile, the state government also submitted that steps were being taken to increase the Covid-19 beds at IGIMS up to 100 and at AIIMS-Patna up to 250. Medanta and Rajendra Nagar Eye Hospital will be utilised for Covid-19 patients. The high court observed that there was alarming dearth of oxygen cylinders for Covid-19 patients and expressed displeasure over the unexplained contradictory state government’s data showing availability of huge number of beds with oxygen. However, the state submitted that it was working with the Centre to install pressure swing absorption plants at medical college and hospitals to overcome oxygen shortage. To this, the bench directed the state to submit a report over further progress made in their installations. During the last hearing, the high court had directed the state to boost health infrastructure by purchasing x-ray and CT-scan machines. The HC observed that the state government was unable to inform the residents about facilities available and it needed to inform them through a portal about the facilities available at different centres. In response to HC query, the state submitted that a high-level meeting with all the DMs and SPs will take place on Sunday and a comprehensive action plan will be prepared and submitted to the high court on Monday. The bench observed that the state must ensure that all those reaching Bihar from outside are tested at entry points.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/increase-covid-beds-rtpcr-tests-in-bihar-hc/articleshow/82121801.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Loss of income, Covid curbs put Ganga Jamuna residents in spot||NAGPUR: The already sombre mood at Ganga Jamuna, city’s red-light area which police has shut to enforce the lockdown-like restrictions, turned grimmer after death of a 40-year-old woman, probably the first Covid fatality in the locality, on Saturday. For the local residents who are not much aware and always in self-denial mode, testing and vaccination are mere ideas. Though many may have Adhaar card with them, there is hardly any motivation to go for vaccination. Only a handful few have taken the jab, that too after being goaded by their doctors. Cops are keeping a vigil on the locality round-the-clock, especially between 8pm and 7am when the business would be at peak in normal times. The female sex workers are facing acute hardship as their income has reduced to bare minimum and on some days they don’t even get a penny, they said. Apart from fear of police action, the fear of contracting Covid-19 too seemed to have made customers wary of visiting the area. The female sex workers have to dodge cops who come charging at them with a cane in their hands on seeing them stepping out to solicit customers. “If I don’t take risk and earn then who would feed my children and support their education,” said Romi (name changed), a female sex worker from the area. “We are hardly getting any walk-in customers who in normal times would help earn an income up to around Rs500-1,000 for younger women and somewhere around Rs500 for elderly ones after a day’s work,” she said. The woman’s death seemed to have rattled the locality where the lanes are already deserted and rooms locked. The news spread quickly in the lanes lined by rickety brothels. Many claimed the woman died of heart attack but some stated it was merely a rumour as there was no death. Others said that the death had happened in Mumbai. According to a source, the residents feel the customers will be further discourage customers to visit Ganga Jamuna if they come to know about the death. “Already number of customers has reduced to almost nil as cops are always chasing them away,” said a resident. Dr Milind Bhrusandi, a member of the District Covid task force, said the civic body is planning to conduct an antigen test drive here with the help of the Indian Red Cross Society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/loss-of-income-covid-curbs-put-ganga-jamuna-residents-in-spot/articleshow/82122772.cms||Soumitra Bose

On Saturday, UP farmers were stopped by police from entering Haryana as the state government has put generation of gate passes for two days on hold to speed up lifting of wheat. Thereafter, they parked their tractor-trolleys in the middle of the highway and blocked the road. They alleged that the Haryana government was not procuring their produce even as they had registered on the ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal. Due to the blockade, hundreds of people were stranded for several hours. Hours after, Uttar Pradesh police reached the spot and farmers lifted the blockade. Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said, “The produce of all the registered farmers is being procured as per the scheduling system. But now procurement operation has been halted by the government for two days (Saturday and Sunday) to speed up the lifting process. Hence, farmers were stopped for two days. They have been urged to bring their produce on Monday as per their schedule.” Notice to mandi secretary over tardy lifting Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav on Saturday took a serious note of slow lifting of the procured wheat and issued a show-cause notice to Assandh mandi secretary. He said strict action will be taken against officials and transporters if there was any delay in lifting caused by them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/whet-procurement-on-hold-for-2-days-in-haryana-up-farmers-block-meerut-karnal-highway/articleshow/82122769.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Parents unwilling to send kids, 70% drop in nursery admissions||Lucknow: A number of parents have decided to skip the first year of school education of their wards as their four-year-olds don’t sit for online class and offline classes are not possible due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. This has led to a drop in nursery admissions by around 65-70% in city schools. A number of parents who had bought admission forms at the beginning of this year thinking that the pandemic has subsided and offline education will be back have changed their minds. According to parents, there is no point providing online education to little ones as they learn on school campus and are not interested to sit in front of computer screens and follow instructions. President of Unaided Private School Association, Anil Agarwal, said only 50% admissions were made in nursery last year in schools across the city while this year it had dropped to 35-40%. “When students go to school, they follow discipline and are introduced to teaching culture for the first time. It is difficult for me to make my elder son, who is in Class 2, to sit for online class. How can I invest in school fee for my second son in nursery,” said a Swati Sharma, a resident of Indiranagar. “I had taken admission form thinking that offline classes will resume but now have decided not to admit him in school. I will teach the child on my own,” she said. Another parent, Dikshant Singh, said: “Online education is not very suitable for primary students as they follow instructions only when they sit in class with other children and teacher. I don’t want to stress the eyes of my four-year-old child. It’s better to hire a private tutor than to make them attend online classes. It is difficult to make them sit in front of a screen for more than 20 minutes.” “Last year I paid a hefty fee for class nursery and my daughter, Vidhushi, hardly attended any online class. In between the classes she used to rush to take her toys, or insisted on watching television or eat something,” Singh said. “A number of city schools had good sale of nursery admission forms earlier this year but due to the rise in Covid-19 cases, school education went back to online mode as most of the parents backed out,” said Anil Agarwal. “Still, a number of parents believe that online class is not working for primary and pre-primary classes while we are trying our best to engage the little ones,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/parents-unwilling-to-send-kids-70-drop-in-nursery-admissions/articleshow/82122755.cms||---

Since Wednesday, officials have been evaluating the possibility of installing air-conditioners to preserve the bodies for at least 4-5 hours. The Samras hostel will also house sufficient beds provided by the AMC with additional oxygen facility. Right now, the arrangement for some 500 beds has been made at the hostel.“We are arranging extra oxygen for the hostel and the facility will be ready soon,” said a senior AMC official. Interestingly, almost a year ago, the Samras hostel was being readied as India’s largest Covid facility with 1,200 beds and had begun admitting patients since April 15. The hostel was mainly to isolate people with moderate to mild symptoms till they recovered. The last patient walked out of the Samras hostel on December 27 last year. On January 7 this year, the hostel was handed over to the social justice department. “A water line that was laid near the boys’ hostel was removed by the AMC thinking that the hostel will not be used as a Covid centre any longer. But now the AMC may lay back the water line,” said a senior official of the social justice department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/now-administration-mulls-setting-up-morgue-at-samras/articleshow/82122730.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Maharashtra must mobilise Rs 12k crore for Covid battle’||MUMBAI: Besides budgetary provision of medical education and public health departments, cash-strapped state government will have to mobilize at least Rs12,000 crore to tackle Covid-19 this year. Relief and rehabilitation secretary Assem Gupta told TOI the state will require huge funds to tackle the virus. “Besides budgetary provision of medical education and public health departments, we will require Rs12,000 crore to enhance healthcare infrastructure and medicines. Last year, we used nearly Rs6,000 crore to tackle the pandemic,’’ Gupta said. Gupta said it had been proposed to provide Rs2,100 crore from State Disaster Relief Fund, Rs236 crore from CM’s relief fund, a substantial amount from corporate social responsibility fund and Rs3,300 crore from district planning & development fund. “We are sure we can tackle the pandemic in the best possible manner. Our healthcare infrastructure has already been upgraded,’’ he said. A senior finance department official said after an announcement by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, it is expected that Rs366 crore will come from MLA local area development funds. “Pawar proposed that each legislator should contribute Rs 1 crore from the fund. It will be used exclusively in his/her constituency to enhance healthcare infrastructure,’’ he said. The official said CM has declared a Rs5,476 crore package for eight crore people, particularly those below poverty line. “The package will give huge relief to a major section of society. In view of fresh demand, scope of the package may be widened to include more sections of society,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-must-ready-rs-12k-cr-to-fight-covid/articleshow/82123510.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Lucknow||Time for Unesco world heritage tag for Banaras ghats, Lucknow||One wonders as to which Indian state can boast of a truly iconic monument like Taj Mahal, Varanasi as a city with the world’s oldest living civilisation, the distinctive culture of Lucknow, the Buddhist circuit, the birthplaces of Ram and Krishna, captivating wildlife experience of Dudhwa, Katarniaghat and Chambal, and the world’s largest congregation of people at Kumbh? History of the region, now known as UP, is 4000 years’ old. Its foundations go back to the Aryan civilisation and the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, Brahmanas and Puranas were written here. Many believe that Banaras, Prayag, Ayodhya, Mathura and the Himalayas hermitages, which were earlier a part of the undivided UP, were the epicenters of Brahmanical culture. Historical Expanse: Between the 6th and 4th century BC, India saw the advent of Buddha who delivered his first sermon at Sarnath. Mauryan and Gupta civilisations prospered here whereas Buddhism and Jainism blossomed during the Magadh Empire. UP reached its pinnacle of glory during the reigns of Harshavardhana and later Akbar during the Mughal period. The role of the British in Awadh led to the deposition of Wajid Ali Shah, the greatest proponent of art and culture. UP’s history ran almost parallel to that of India and the state played a key role in the Mutiny of 1857 and beyond. UP has experienced it all, from the Kingdom of Lord Ram to the East India Company’s rule. Heritage Arc and Beyond: The state is uniquely blessed with the Heritage Arc, comprising Agra, Lucknow and Varanasi, which takes the tourists through a kaleidoscopic voyage of wonderful monuments and cultural experiences. State’s heritage landmarks include Buddhist stupas, monasteries, palaces and forts, temples, mosques, imambaras, churches and Sufi shrines in Agra, Lucknow, Varanasi, Allahabad, Jhansi, Mathura, Kanpur, Mirzapur, Meerut, Banda, Jhansi, Bithoor, Lalitpur, Gorakhpur and many other cities, towns and kasbas. UNESCO Listing for Lucknow & Varanasi: UP’s Mughal structures are a perfect blend of Islamic, Hindu, and Central Asian architecture. Agra’s existing UNSECO World Heritage sites include Shahjahan’s Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Akbar’s dream capital Fatehpur Sikri. A major priority for UP should now be to get the ‘Historic City of Lucknow’ and ‘Ghats of Banaras’ listed as UNSECO World Heritage sites as these are of outstanding cultural value to humanity. This would lead to a heightened sensitivity for conservation as well as tourism. Amazing Handicraft Clusters: UP has a vast expanse of handicraft clusters like woven silk of Varanasi, chikankari of Lucknow, marbleware of Agra, woodwork of Saharanpur, brassware of Moradabad, ittar (perfume) of Kannauj, glassware of Firozabad, carpets of Bhadohi, locks of Aligarh, and ceramic pottery of Khurja. The world is waiting to experience these craft traditions if properly showcased. Kaleidoscope of Diverse Arts: As the land of Kabirdas, Tulsidas and Surdas, UP embodies a culture that encompasses every aspect of social life and celebration of diversity. UP has the enchanting Kathak, soulful classical music, and well-rooted folk music spread state-wide. We need to conserve the homes of UP’s Hindi and Urdu authors and poets, singers, dancers, and musicians and to enable the posterity to celebrate their legacy. The Culinary Narrative: UP’s food heritage constitutes Mughlai, Awadhi and Banarasi cuisines. Awadh’s courts were famous for their elaborate gourmet cuisine, including the Dum Pukth style, originally perfected for its royalty, astonishingly rich and yet subtle. Mathura and Vrindavan are famous for their vegetarian fare. Traditional Banarasi food stands for purity, simplicity, and refinement. Rampur kitchens also serve delectable food. Visitors are invariably enamoured by UP’s culinary heritage. Monetisation of Heritage:If UP’s heritage is monetised responsibly, a significant portion of its GDP target of USD 1 trillion can come from tourism alone. There is a hugely untapped heritage tourism goldmine that we are sitting on. We need to create a top-notch think-tank comprising hoteliers, travel agents, tour operators, experts, and revivalists; to ideate, visualise and lead the transformation of UP as Asia’s most-sought after heritage tourism-led economy.

---||Lucknow||Covid forces scrapping of Ayodhya Ram Navami fest||Ayodhya: Amidst a lethal Covid run in Uttar Pradesh coupled with fervent appeals by senior Ayodhya seers, the district administration on Saturday decided to call off the April 21 ‘Ram Navami Mela’, which witnesses a mammoth gathering of pilgrims on the last day of Navratra at Ramjanmabhoomi and Saryu banks. Ayodhya’s borders will be sealed and nobody, including seers from Haridwar kumbh will be allowed entry. The fear of a pandemic spread was compounded by the surge in Covid cases at the Haridwar kumbh, where hundreds of seers were scheduled to come to Ayodhya to offer prayers at Ramjanmabhoomi on the last day of Navratra. The district administration directed devotees to celebrate Ram Navami at home and curtailed pilgrim presence at temples. Talking to TOI, district magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha said, “Our priority is to break the corona chain. We have taken all precautionary measures and banned all gatherings in Ayodhya.” The administration has ensured low-key Navratra celebrations in the temple town. Ram Ki Paidi on the Saryu banks which would be crammed with pilgrims at least 10 days before Ram Navami, wears a deserted look. Bathing in the Saryu has been banned and entry points to the river barricaded. Acharya Satyendra Das, chief priest of Ramjanmabhoomi temple, said, “Nobody will be coming here to pay obeisance on Ram Navami. There will be only one priest, one-duty policemen and Ram Lalla Virajman.” This is second year Ram Navami celebrations have been scrapped due to the pandemic. It’s a virtual curfew on the road leading to Ramjanambhoomi through Hanumangarhi and Dashrath Mahal temples. Barring a fleeting glimpse of sadhus or a stray monkey, the streets are empty. Mahant Jugal Kishore Sharan Shastry, the chief priest of Saryu Kunj temple. said, “Not just devotees, even sadhus of Ayodhya are not visiting Ramjanmabhoomi to offer prayers due to the pandemic. Holding the Haridwar kumbh was a big mistake and we cannot afford a repeat in Ayodhya.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-forces-scrapping-of-ayodhya-ram-navami-fest/articleshow/82122782.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

Patient Ramesh Sahu died of burns and four others — Ishwar Rao, Vandana Gajmala, Devika Sonkar and Bhaghya Shri — suffocated to death in the smoke, said police. The fire broke out at 5pm on the second floor of the twostorey Covid-dedicated hospital. There were 34 patients admitted at the time, nine of them in the ICU. The supervisor saw smoke billowing out of the ICU and alerted the authorities, who informed police. Smoke engulfed the ward and the fire cut off oxygen supply. Firemen, hospital staff and attendants ran into the smokefilled rooms to rescue patients. It took an hour to douse the fire. It’s believed the fire broke out in the power board of the ICU due to a short circuit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/5-patients-die-as-fire-breaks-out-at-raipur-icu/articleshow/82124671.cms||---

Singh further said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to have left his parliamentary constituency to fend for itself and is busy campaigning in West Bengal while hundreds of bodies are piling up in Varanasi, which is the second worst affected district in UP after Lucknow. “The whole of UP is reeling under a terrible wave of Covid-19. Horror stories are emerging from state capital Lucknow. The situation is such that the state’s medical infrastructure has collapsed,” Singh said, adding that there are queues of dead bodies at crematoriums and people are having to wait for hours to cremate their loved ones. Instead of addressing the situation, the government is trying to block the view inside the crematoriums by putting up tin sheets outside, he alleged. Singh said that there is a shortage of several essentials, ranging from oxygen to hospital beds in the state. He claimed that the wait for oxygen and ventilators was as much as three days in several districts because of which several people were losing their lives to the virus, but the state government is trying to hide its incompetence by not giving out the correct data of the daily deaths due to Covid-19. “While people are dying, BJP leaders are more worried about winning elections. As per official data, more than 1.75 lakh people have died due to Covid-19 in the country. Meanwhile, the PM is holding as many as six rallies a day in West Bengal. Where are the crores of rupees that were collected under the PM Cares Fund?” Singh asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/centre-must-intervene-now-to-control-situation-in-up-aap/articleshow/82122790.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Besides Vidarbha, nearby regions too will gain from refinery||Pradeep MaheshwariNAGPUR: The proposed refinery can change the entire landscape of Vidarbha in all aspects. Most of the region’s infrastructure is underutilized. The much-needed project would significantly benefit districts like Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Yavatmal, Wardha, Akola and Amravati, not only in the terms of employment but also increase Human Development Index. The agriculture and industrial balance isn’t satisfactory in Vidarbha, as farmers and rural labourers are still earning meagrely. A majority of the population depends on government schemes like MNREGA. All metro cities thrive on big industries to maintain a vibrant economy. In Vidarbha, we are still struggling with only agriculture-based economy. With such a big petrochemical complex, big industrial investments will come to the region, thus boosting job prospects. For years, Vidarbha’s industrial estates have been waiting for industries. A large number of plots are lying vacant in MIDC. The refinery project has the capacity to bring more industries in the form of ancillary units to MIDCs in the region. Those using petrochemicals as raw materials in Mumbai and Gujarat will purchase land near refinery. The project would require material like steel, cement, bricks sand and others worth Rs25,000 crore. This would boost local manufacturers. Moreover, it would likely create 20,000 direct and over 5 lakh indirect jobs. There’s a possibility of about 25,000 medium and small enterprises (MSMEs) along with 10 large units making investment in Vidarbha as ancillary units. It would ensure that 18,000MW power generated through various thermal power plants would be consumed. It would also save transmission and distribution losses. The water stored in various Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) reservoirs could be utilized for the refinery and bring revenue. The project would need a pipeline distribution network that could be laid along Nagpur-Mumbai Samruddhi Expressway along with NHAI, thus bringing revenue for the state and centre. Nagpur’s central location would be an added advantage as maximum fuel products would be distributed from the pipelines network across 250 districts in India. With sulphur as a by-product of the refinery, acid manufacturers can utilize it to make fertilizers. Vidarbha and surrounding region need urgent industrialisation to accommodate youth eligible for different types of jobs. Importantly, the surrounding states affected by Maoism would save crores spent on tackling the menace if local youths get jobs. The region already has good infrastructure of roads, rail and air, thanks to initiatives taken by Union minister Nitin Gadkari. It could be put to the best use and will help to boost the economy of three major cities in Central India – Nagpur, Jabalpur and Raipur. Setting up a refinery in Vidarbha will be best decision by the government on social, economic and political fronts as it will boost the economy of four states, which incur huge costs on logistics for bringing petroleum products here. The refinery would also boost existing projects like Mihan where companies would thrive to invest. Even the existing and upcoming projects like Sindhi dry port and CONCOR depot would be fully utilized. The passenger flow at airport would also incraes. So, it’s a win-win situation for Vidarbha.

In these booths, polling started around 7.30 am instead of 7 am. While voters queued up for voting before 7 am, the polling staff informed the authorities after they noticed problems in EVMs as soon as the polling began. The EVMs were replaced and polling began at around 7.30 am. Polling officials said polling was smooth in all the 346 booths except at one or two places. “The complaints were attended to immediately. The Election Commission deputed some engineers to look into such issues in the constituency,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/evm-glitches-noticed-in-some-booths/articleshow/82122207.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Doon continued to record the highest daily spike in Covid-19 cases among all districts in the state and accounted for nearly half of the state’s tally. On Saturday, 1,179 of the 10,050 samples tested positive for the coronavirus. This was 43% of the total 2,757 cases reported in Uttarakhand on the day. As per the data provided by the health department, the positivity rate in Dehradun on Friday reached an all-time high of 16.9%; 6,188 samples were sent for testing with 1,051 among them testing positive. The figure was nearly triple of the 5.53% positivity rate recorded a week before. On April 10 (Saturday), the positivity rate in the state capital was 8.84%, with 589 people testing positive among 6,662 tested for the virus that day. On April 11, 582 of the 5,670 tests done in Dehradun returned positive and the positivity rate stood at 10.26%. The next day, April 12, the positivity rate increased to 10.53%, as 554 people tested positive among the 5,259 who were tested that day. On April 13, 775 persons of the 6,904 that were tested turned out to be Covid-19 positive, taking the positivity rate to 11.23%. On April 14, the positivity rate rose further to 11.23% (as 796 tested positive out of the 6,240 samples tested). On April 15, 5,411 samples were tested and 914 tested positive, as the positivity rate touched 16.89%. Speaking about the trend, Anoop Nautiyal from Social Development for Communities Foundation, said, “To my surprise, even when Dehradun consistently accounts for almost half of the state’s daily Covid-19 cases, the administration has failed to ramp up testing. I hope and wish that more and more tests are conducted so that we are able to identify and isolate infected patients. It’s the only way to stop the spread of the virus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/positivity-rate-at-5-day-low-in-doon-but-experts-say-more-tests-need-of-the-hour/articleshow/82121094.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Chandigarh||SAD: Remove procurement hurdles or we protest||Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday asked the Congress government to remove hurdles being put in the procurement of wheat in two days or it would statewide protests. Former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra said procurement started 10 days late and it had been delayed further due to lack of preparedness on the part of the state government. He said severe shortage of gunny bags would to lead to a glut in mandis which were already facing labour problems. Asserting that farmers were being forced to wait for long periods in mandis to sell their wheat produce, Chandumajra said the callous attitude of the Congress government towards the woes of farmers indicated that it was hand in glove with the central government in harassing them. “Farmers are suffering due to the three agricultural laws. They also faced inclement weather and Covid pandemic. Now they are victims of the utter insensitivity of the government, which has failed to ensure smooth procurement of wheat. In case the government does not take immediate measures to restore order in mandis, we will stage protests keeping in view all pandemic norms,” he said. Chandumajra also asked chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to take action against food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu for failing to place orders for gunny bags in time. He said Ashu was blatantly lying that orders for used gunny bags were placed late and opened only yesterday because the central government delayed giving permission for the same. “If this is so, how come the Haryana government placed the same tender and even opened it 10 days ago to corner the lion’s share of used gunny bags available in the market?” he said. The SAD leader also asserted that the government was making wrong claims of providing facilities to safeguard against Covid to farmers. He said contrary to claims, foot-operated taps had not been installed in mandis. He said similarly there was no facility to provide sanitisers and masks as claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-remove-procurement-hurdles-or-we-protest/articleshow/82122796.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Police nab four in Udaipur elderly couple murder case||Udaipur: After a week-long intense investigation, Udaipur police succeeded in cracking the double murder case of an elderly couple that had taken place in Kolyari settlement of Falasiya block in Udaipur district on April 10 and arrested four men in the case. “It was a big challenge for the police to solve the blind murder mystery but after intense search and investigation, our teams arrested four men for the crime. An additional SP, three deputy rank officers, 4 SHOs and their teams hold the credit for it,” Udaipur SP Rajiv Pachar told the media. Devilal (68) and his wife Pushpa Devi (64) were found murdered in their homes in Kolyari village and the police were told that the man ran a grocery store in Falasiya and also lent loan against jewellery. The couple didn't have children and the complaint was given by Devilal's brother Dhadamchand. Prima Facie, the police guessed that the assailants were acquainted with the couple and might have trespassed the house with the intention of loot. Cops scrutinised the money-lending details’ register and found that Devilal had lent huge amounts to borrowers in bordering villages of Panarwa and Falasiya settlements. They made a list of suspects with tinted backgrounds who had taken money from the deceased. “One of the accused, Dinesh Garasiya (21) had in 2020 taken loan from Devilal while his aide Kamlesh (22) too had had a financial deal with him sometime back. The men knew that they could get huge cash and many ornaments from his home. Hence, the two men planned the loot with the help of two other men Pyarchand (22)and Narayan (21),” Pachar said. The assailants entered through the terrace and while they ransacked the rooms in search of keys, the couple woke up to the noise and resisted them. The accused strangled the couple with two towels and later slit their throats with shaving blades. They decamped with some cash they could find.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-nab-four-in-udaipur-elderly-couple-murder-case/articleshow/82122206.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Fearing another lockdown, migrant workers start leaving industrial city Rudrapur||RUDRAPUR: Migrant workers carrying luggage, some alone and others with families, could be seen flocking to the interstate bus stand and the railway station in Rudrapur in Udham Singh Nagar on Saturday. After the night curfew was recently extended to all districts of the hill state, these workers were fearing a repeat of last year’s sudden and complete lockdown, when 1 lakh migrants working in more than 300 industrial units in Rudrapur, known as the industrial capital of Kumaon, had left for their native places. Ashok Kumar Rai, an automobile vendor at Pantnagar industrial estate, said he employs 44 workers and 27 of them have left for their hometowns. “Most of the labourers in my factory are from eastern Uttar Pradesh. They left to be with their families during Holi and did not come back, apprehending another lockdown due to the rising Covid-19 numbers,” Rai said. Sunil Narang, owner of a plywood factory in the city, who employs around 300 workers, said more than half of them had recently left for home. “The day chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat announced a night curfew in the state, the workers started leaving. Production has been on halt for the past few days as there is a scarcity of labourers now,” Narang said. Aniruddha Yadav, a worker from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, said he had somehow managed to reach home last year by hitch-hiking. He earns Rs 18,000 at a firm in the city that manufactures corrugated boxes and pays a monthly rent of Rs 3,500 for his accommodation. “We got messages on WhatsApp about the possibility of another country-wide lockdown. We would be left without jobs and beg for food again. We will neither be able to afford rent here nor be able to pay for transportation back home. I will come back if and when the situation improves,” he said. Lalman Koli, a migrant worker from Bihar’s Samastipur, said in a similar vein, “I had no choice. What if there is another lockdown? I had to leave while transportation is still available. I earn Rs 12,000 monthly here at an FMCG company and pay Rs 2,000 as rent. I cannot afford to stay if the firm I work at shuts down.” The state government, which had initially imposed night curfew in a few high-load districts, including state capital Dehradun, extended it to all districts on Thursday, along with several other restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus. On Saturday, it extended night curfew timings, imposed weekend lockdown in Dehradun and weekly lockdown on Sundays in rest of the districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/fearing-another-lockdown-migrant-workers-start-leaving-industrial-city-rudrapur/articleshow/82121100.cms||Aakash Ahuja
---||Kolkata||Tale of two queues and poll as a great leveller||Kolkata: Sporting a polo shirt, chino shorts and aviator sunglass, financial consultant Sanjeev Gupta got off his black sedan outside a Narayanpur school off Rajarhat Road on Saturday morning and stood behind a 30-year old mason Farukh Molla in a striped shirt and lungi outside. The two were in the queue along with hundreds of others to cast their vote at the same polling booth highlighting once again how elections are the ultimate equaliser in public life. At multiple poll booths off the eight-lane expressway, overlooking tall residential complexes on both sides at New Town and Rajarhat, there were a curious mix of voters with diverse aspirations and expectations from the election — while one group struggling to make a proper living and the other hailing from rather privileged section of the society living in high-rises. “We may not share the same aspirations but our goal is the same — to exercise our voting rights to uphold democracy. No matter how our social status is, the elections are a reminder that in a democracy, everyone is equal,” said Gupta, a resident of a high-rise complex on Rajarhat Road. TOI had mentioned in an article on April 16, how the Rajarhat-Newtown assembly segment highlight the changing demography, difference in lifestyle and aspirations between the new mobile population and the older settlers. At Mahishgot primary school that lies on a dingy broken alley behind three tall complexes in New Town Mahisbathan, similar scenes were displayed with techies, entrepreneurs and white-collar professionals sharing the same queue with men and women who work as drivers, domestic helps or security guards at the same complexes. “Till 2019, I used to cast my vote at Howrah where my parents live. Although we shifted here 10 years back, this is the first time I am casting my vote here,” said Samarpita Majumdar, who runs a fashion boutique. Since Majumder was unaware of the poll booth, her domestic help escorted her to the place at Mahisbathan after she had completed her household chores. “Didi was a bit hesitant to come alone. So I brought her with me as both of us were listed under the same polling booth,” said Afsana Bibi, standing behind Majumdar. At Nopara Free Primary School near Chinar Park, there were two queues but such was the rush of voters even at 8.30am that both queues meandered up to the main thoroughfare choking traffic. The queues also had the same diversity of voters – residents from nearby complexes coming in cars while those living in colonies at Hatiara and Nopara coming in party-provided Totos.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tale-of-two-queues-and-poll-as-a-great-leveller/articleshow/82122215.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Shockingly, the Co-Win website states that the senior citizen has been scheduled for the first dose. “My father Anand took the first dose at the vaccination centre at AIIMS on March 5. We did not get any message or certificate till date. I lodged complaints with AIIMS and the Nagpur Municipal Corporation twice last month but received no response. Again, I lodged a complaint with AIIMS and NMC on Saturday,” said lawyer Pruthu Abhyankar. His father will not be administered the second dose as there’s no proof of the first. “Another problem is that the website has not recorded the first dose that my father took at AIIMS on March 5,” he said. As per the guidelines of the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), senior citizens are due for the second dose after 28 days. Already, the second dose has been delayed by 14 days. On Saturday, TOI had highlighted how few vaccination centres in the city and other districts of Vidarbha are denying the second dose to senior citizens. Nearly 16,299 above 45 years, healthcare workers and frontline workers took the vaccine in the district on Saturday. The number of beneficiaries reduced in the district despite rise in the number of vaccination centres. Last month, the district had registered vaccination of over 40,000 in a day for a few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-cant-take-2nd-shot-as-co-win-fails-to-register-1st-taken-42-days-ago/articleshow/82122212.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The virus spread 500 times more speedily to the rest of the country from states where polls were either held recently or are underway,” Sena said in party mouthpiece Saamana. Had the Centre reduced its “dose of politics” and focused on tackling the pandemic, the situation would have been in control, it said. There is a shortage of oxygen, Remdesivir, ventilators... Crematoriums are overflowing, but the central government is busy in electioneering in West Bengal, said the editorial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-sena-blames-centres-dose-of-politics-for-covid-wave-2/articleshow/82122823.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Nagarjuna Sagar known for high polling||HYDERABAD: Nagarjuna Sagar, predominantly a rural assembly constituency located 140 km away from Hyderabad, is a trendsetter in recording high polling percentages. For instance, the segment recorded an all-time high of 88 per cent voter turnout on Saturday. Not long ago, the constituency had 86.62 per cent of voters turning out in December 2018 assembly polls. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had chosen to go for early polls and had dissolved the Telangana state assembly in September, eight months before the completion of the first term of his government. KCR’s gamble had paid off as the TRS not only won the Nagarjuna Sagar seat but also won 88 seats out of 119 at stake. In the 2014 election, the polling percentage in Nagarjuna Sagar was 80.03 which saw K Jana Reddy of Congress winning it for a seventh term. Nagarjuna Sagar constituency was created in 2009 after the delimitation process was completed as per the changes initiated by the 87th constitutional amendment in 2002. Earlier, it was known as Chalakurthi constituency. In the first election held in Nagarjuna Sagar constituency in 2015, it registered 76.74 per cent polling in 2014. Interestingly, it was a straight fight between Congress and the TRS in both the elections in 2014 and 2018 with BJP candidate K Niveditha Reddy losing deposit in 2018 and TDP candidate K Anjaiah Yadav finishing a distant third in 2014 polls, the first after the state was formed following bifurcation. While TRS, Congress and BJP exuded confidence of winning the seat, political analysts did not rule out the possibility of a close contest this time too. In 2018, Nomula Narsimhaiah of the TRS had won with a majority of over 7,700 votes. However, following its good show in the Dubbak bypoll and the GHMC elections, the BJP is keen to make a mark in this byelection as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nsagar-known-for-high-polling/articleshow/82122226.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Chandigarh||New variant infecting the young severely, says PGI||Chandigarh: The new variant of Covid in the city has been infecting younger population mainly to the level of severe disease, according to doctors in PGI. Most of the patients admitted to Covid hospital in PGI are under high oxygen and ICUs. Unlike last year, this section of population who were mainly asymptomatic or had mild to moderate virus, are now coming with severe form of the infection in critical care. “The symptoms are the same as last year, but we are seeing younger patients on oxygen. The age group is between 25 and 40 years of age. They are in the ICU at the moment,” said Prof GD Puri, dean, academics, and head of the department of anaesthesia and intensive care, PGI. In 60 samples randomly sent from PGI to National Centre for Diseases Control, Delhi, for genome sequencing in March, the UK variant was found in 70% of the samples, while 20% had 681 H mutants. The UK strain is said to spread faster than the others. “The variant was found in Punjab and we expected the same here,” said Puri. Sources said children and infants as well are admitted to the Covid hospital with the infection. “Mostly, the children used to be asymptomatic, but with this strain, they too are easily exposed,” said a PGI doctor. However, PGI doctors said the recovery rate has been satisfactory as patients are discharged after a week or so. “We try not to switch over patients on ventilators are there is risk of mortality. In the past two weeks, we had most of the patients on ventilators, but now we have around two to three,” said Puri. There have been over 230 patients admitted to PGI’s Covid hospital. Also, over 20 health care workers are testing positive daily. “Two of our health care workers are in the ICU,” said Puri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/new-variant-infecting-the-young-severely-says-pgi/articleshow/82121827.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: DRDO hospitals to harness Tejas tech for oxygen fix||LUCKNOW: At at time when the gap between the demand and supply of oxgen is continuously widening, the makeshift hospitals to be set up by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in Lucknow are likely to have their own oxygen supply with the help of a technology used in light combat aircraft Tejas fighter jets. This is the first time that the self-sustainable oxygen generation technology for fighter pilots will be used in makeshift hospitals in Uttar Pradesh. Defence minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh sent a team of DRDO officials to the state capital on Friday to start the process for setting up of hospitals at Haj House and Golden Blossoms resort. The hospitals, likely to get ready by next week, will have around 250-300 beds each and will be run by the doctors, nurses and support staff of Armed Forces Medical Services. According to defence ministry sources, DRDO has developed a medical oxygen plant as a spin off technology of the ‘On board oxygen generation system’ (OBOGS) of LCA Tejas. On condition of anonymity, an official told TOI: “This plant can provide medical grade oxygen round-the-clock at a high-flow rate catering to at least 50 ventilator ICU beds. This technology will be used to activate oxygen plants at Covid hospitals.” The technology, which has been developed by DRDO’s Defence Electromedical & Bio-Engineering Laboratory (DEBEL), breaks down molecular components of the atmospheric air to provide continuous oxygen to pilot within the aircraft for long duration and high altitude flights. Once set up, the technology will help in continuous supply of oxygen to critical beds for Covid patients, refilling of oxygen cylinders and eradicating logistical problems related to cylinder transportation from one point to another, apart from sharing the burden of oxygen demand and supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/drdo-hosps-to-harness-tejas-tech-for-oxygen-fix/articleshow/82122818.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Chandigarh||Wheat grain spills over due to shortage of gunny bags and space in Ambala||Ambala: Farmers and arhtiyas at the grain market in Ambala city are complaining of improper wheat procurement and lifting arrangements, reportedly due to sudden arrival of wheat. Procurement came to a halt on Saturday and Sunday due to shortage of gunny bags and space, because of which arhtiyas say they are facing problems in lifting scattered wheat. In Ambala city, there is no space for unloading wheat at the grain market. Officials of the district administration are claiming that there is no shortage of gunny bags. “Procurement has been halted due to sudden arrival of wheat for two days and to empty space for adjusting incoming wheat,” said an official of the food and civil supplies department requesting anonymity. Ambala deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma said till April 16, 2,03,831.3 metric tonne (MT) wheat had been procured by agencies (HAFED, HWC and DFSC) in Ambala, and that procurement had been smooth in all grain markets and purchase centres. Farmer Rajeev Sharma from Hasanpur village in Naraingarh block of Ambala district said in case it rained, wheat grains will be damaged and the loss will have to be borne by farmers or arhtiyas. Haryana Arhtiya Association chief patron Duni Chand said gunny bags were not being supplied as per the requirement. “Government should instruct agencies to ensure their contractors lift procured crop within 72 hours. They should supply the required number of gunny bags and also start releasing payments on time. Till Saturday night, gunny bags had not been supplied at the grain market in Ambala city,” he said. Ambala district food and civil supplies controller (DFSC) Rajeshwar Mudgil said they had instructed contractors to increase the speed of lifting by increasing the number of vehicles. About the issue of shortage of gunny bags, DFSC Rajeshwar said, “There is an issue in availability of the gunny bags and the government is making efforts to resolve the same.” Sanjeev, a farmer from Sarawan village in Sadhaura block of Yamunanagar district who received payment of for his wheat crop through direct benefit transfer (DBT), has said the policy will “cause loss(es) and break the arhtiya-kisan relationship”. “I have received about Rs 47,000 in my account for the wheat crop. I will manage my expenses from this money. But what will I do for the paddy cultivation of the next season and for the fertilizers, seed and other expenses? I was dependent on the arhtiya. But now, the arhtiyas are not ready to lend any money. How will we manage expenses in case of any emergency or medical needs in time of pandemic or of any family function or others? The government has broken the arhtiya and kisan relationship. The DBT is more of a loss for farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/wheat-grain-spills-over-due-to-shortage-of-gunny-bags-and-space-in-ambala/articleshow/82122826.cms||JK Singh
---||Delhi||Covid raging, Delhiites obey weekend curbs||NEW DELHI: Delhiites quietly acquiesced with the weekend curfew imposed in Delhi in the wake of the raging Covid-19 pandemic. On Saturday, the streets were largely deserted with most people avoiding non-essential travel in the hope that they can contribute to the official effort to break the chain of novel coronavirus transmission. “The weekend curfew was imposed to fight Covid. We have news from across Delhi that people are obeying the curfew. We will keep a watch on the situation for the next few days and if the situation deteriorates, we will take all steps needed to control the situation for your safety and to save your lives,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said at a press conference later in the day. Work in all industrial areas and markets remained suspended, barring essential stores like chemists and milk vends, which ran as usual. Delhi Police personnel and district administration teams monitored the sensitive places to ensure that the curfew was not violated. The markets, which usually brimmed with activities on weekends, also did not report any flow of customers. A few individuals who were seen on the streets or in the markets were stopped by the police and questioned on why they weren’t at home. Most pleaded they had essential work. Only a few of the people who were out did not have valid identity cards or curfew passes. Brijesh Goyal of the Chamber of Trade and Industry said that markets at Chandni Chowk, Kashmere Gate, Sadar Bazaar, Connaught Place and other places strictly followed the curfew norms on Saturday. The bus terminals and railway stations continued to report the presence of travellers, as permitted under the curfew regulations. During the curfew, the government has allowed interstate travel, though those going to the airport, railway stations and bus stands have to produce proof of travel in the form of valid tickets. People engaged in essential services were also seen availing Delhi Metro services. There was no rush for movement passes either on Saturday. The authorities did not share any official figure on the total number of curfew passes issued. The night curfew passes issued earlier are valid for the weekend curfew too. The district administrations and police had held numerous meetings with market associations before the start of the curfew and sought their help in making it successful. The curfew, which began on Friday at 10pm, will remain in force till 5am on Monday. The government has announced the curfew only for the current weekend and any decision related to the coming weekend (April 24-25) will be taken only next week. All essential services and government officials moving for official purposes have been exempted from the weekend curfew.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-raging-delhiites-obey-weekend-curbs/articleshow/82122240.cms||AlokKNMishra

We will know then if the new variant that carries several mutations, including two main ones — E484Q and L452R — is responsible for the spurt in new cases or if it is more infectious than other variants,” said CCMB director Dr Rakesh Kumar Mishra. He said it is a misnomer to call the new variant B.1.617 as a double mutant as it carries several mutations. Also, there are several variants with multiple mutations in circulation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ccmb-to-read-double-variant-genetic-code/articleshow/82124673.cms||---
---||Kolkata||But fringe areas witness pockets of unrest||Kolkata: Sporadic violence — highlighted by a scuffle between BJP and Trinamool Congress supporters at Shantinagar in Salt Lake that required intervention of both TMC and BJP Bidhannagar candidates Sujit Bose and Sabyasachi Dutta respectively — blemished the otherwise peaceful  process at Rajarhat New Town, Bidhannagar and Rajarhat Gopalpur constituencies. After a series of complaints of faulty EVMs leading to delay in start of voting process in the morning at Salt Lake, Baguiati, Narayanpur and Rajarhat areas, the first large-scale trouble broke out at Shantinagar off Chingrighata around 10am when some women in the voters’ queue alleged a group of outsiders pelted stones at them, injuring some of them and creating a commotion in the area. A huge police force including RAF rushed to the place to bring things under control. “We saw many people gathering just outside the booth and there was much commotion as a huge police force came in,” said Partha Basu, a local resident. Dutta, the BJP candidate, blamed the local police for inaction. “I heard that some outsiders had gathered near Naobhanga primary school and were obstructing voters to cast their votes. All this happened under the nose of some officers of Bidhannagar South police station. People here are terrified. Two of our women party workers were badly injured. I have informed the matter to the higher authorities,” Dutta said. TMC candidate and fire minister Bose also rushed to the area. “People want to cast their vote peacefully but they (the BJP) are trying to create nuisance. He (Sabyasachi Dutta) knows that he will lose the election, that’s why he is doing such nuisance. I have complained about the matter to the observer,” Bose said. A similar trouble was reported from Nayapatti when a commotion occurred between Dutta and former Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation councilor Joydeb Naskar. The local BJP alleged that Naskar had come to the area with some outsiders to create trouble. Dutta faced 'go-back' slogan from a section of locals as the police with the central force had to pacify them. At Baguiati, BJP’s Rajarhat – Gopalpur candidate Samik Bhattacharya was allegedly stopped by central forces while he attempted to enter a booth that angered the veteran politician and he was heard screaming not to touch him. However, he later said: “It was not a big issue and overall voting was peaceful.” At Hatiara and Ghuni, both under Rajarhat New Town constituency, two BJP polling agents alleged they were stopped from entering the booth by TMC workers and claimed they were assaulted with blunt objects. “The Trinamool activists assaulted me and even tried to run over me with a scooter,” said Swapan Malakar, the BJP polling agent. Also at Machibhanga under Rajarhat New Town constituency, a scuffle broke out between the BJP and Trinamool supporters where TMC alleged BJP workers were trying to influence voters within 100 metre of a booth. Meanwhile, CPM candidate Saptarshi Deb alleged that polling agents affiliated to his party were not allowed to sit inside a number of booths in Rajarhat and Narayanpur. Later, Deb and his supporters sat on a demonstration on Rajarhat road, alleging booth capturing and rigging by TMC poll agents. TMC candidate Tapas Chatterjee denied the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/but-fringe-areas-witness-pockets-of-unrest/articleshow/82122251.cms||Suman Chakraborti

We also recorded statements of villagers at the spot. In the meantime, Kamlesh’s wife Maya Devi came and said she had gone to fields when Brajmohan and aides thrashed her husband and set her house afire.” Police traced Kamlesh on Friday morning but no injuries were detected when his medical examination was conducted. “We recorded his statement and sent a team to interrogate Brajmohan who was canvassing,” he said. Brajmohan contradicted all the allegations after which villagers were called to know the exact sequence of events on Thursday night. “We found Brajmohan was canvassing with his aides and asking villagers to vote for him, Brajmoham also met Kamlesh, who got irked and started abusing Brajmohan,” said the SHO. Brajmohan warned Kamlesh not to abuse and this led to verbal spat between them. Brajmohan went away but Kamlesh nursed a grudge and said he would not let Brajmohan become gram pradhan again, and hatched the conspiracy to frame him in a case.

---||Nagpur||Process to employ MBBS docs under bond service begins||NAGPUR: Finally, the commissionerate of health services has asked all MBBS graduates who have completed their internship on or before March 31, 2021 and also the ones who have not finished their bond service till date to apply for bond service. The letter was issued to 2,479 doctors on April 16. They have been asked to fill the online application form by uploading documents and mentioning preferences. The move is expected to bring at least 2,479 trained MBBS doctors with good experience of Covid service into the fold. As per the state policy, they can be appointed in rural, tribal and hilly regions where there is a shortage of trained doctors. On April 4, TOI had reported how the problem of shortage of doctors can be solved if the bond service is implemented properly. On April 14, the state had given assurance that the bond service rules will be implemented strictly this year. RTI activist and social worker Amrut Bang and Dr Vitthal Salve had been insisting for this decision as doctors under bond service have experience of treating Covid patients. “These doctors completed their internships in their respective medical colleges. As they have treated Covid patients, it would be a great value addition to the state’s health manpower,” said Dr Salve. “This process should be completed on a fast track basis because we need additional doctors immediately in the current scenario,” he added. Officials informed that the process of online application and uploading preferences will complete by April 21. Allotment orders will be uploaded on April 22 and 23. As per the rules, candidates must join the allotted institute within 7 days after the generation of the bond service allotment order. This means that the state will get the services of these doctors from April 25 onwards. If doctors fail to join the specified institute within the stipulated period, DMER will take penal action against them. As per the government order, there are 323 doctors from Nagpur, 134 from Yavatmal, 138 from Akola and 87 from Chandrapur who will apply for the bond service. As all the districts of Vidarbha are now gearing up to establish jumbo hospitals for Covid treatment, these doctors would certainly come handy. On similar lines, the administration is also adding more beds to government hospitals where these doctors can be deployed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/process-to-employ-mbbs-docs-under-bond-service-begins/articleshow/82122259.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Several callers wanted to check whether their services are exempted or not,” said an officer.The citizens were also guided to apply for passes on the dedicated websites and were made familiar with the existing guidelines of Delhi Disaster Management Authority. “In many cases where we found that help is needed on ground, senior officers from the concerned districts were contacted to ensure that the needy people did not have to face much struggle,” the officer said.“Delhi Police has started a Covid-19 helpline to receive genuine requests from persons in connection with difficulties in movement for essential services and goods,” Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava had said on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-helpline-gets-1500-calls-in-less-than-24-hours/articleshow/82122254.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Cops issue 2,432 challans, act against 1,950 violators||New Delhi: Delhi Police registered 72 cases and took preventive action against 1,950 people who violated curfew norms between Friday night and Saturday morning. From Saturday morning till 8pm, police registered 363 cases and arrested 164 people for violating the weekend curfew norms. A total of 2,432 challans were issued.Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava visited various parts of the city on Saturday to take stock of the execution of weekend curfew orders. During interaction with the field functionaries, the top cop asked them to enforce the weekend curfew instructions in letter and spirit. The staff were asked to be firm and polite while checking people. Strict action will be taken against those found wilfully disobeying the weekend curfew instructions, he added.“The needy and genuine persons will be dealt with compassionately and their hassle-free movement facilitated.”At several pickets, police officers had a tough time dealing with people who had stepped out for no reason and gave some random and funny excuses. “Some people even went to the extent of saying they were Covid positive but they did not have any documents to support their claims. In Jamia Nagar, a man claimed that since the country was affected by the virus, he had come to buy alcohol. Some said they were running a take-away joint but were found roaming for no reason and away from their workplace,” said RP Meena, DCP, South-East.Apart from enforcing the curfew, police officers also lent a helping hand to those in need. A 40-year-old Covid patient from Indore was in urgent need of Remdesivir but it was not available. Then someone on behalf of the patient approached head constable Yogender Dhaka of Mayur Vihar who made a lot of efforts and arranged it.In Central Delhi, a civil services aspirant who tested positive and was unable to walk called police as she wanted some medicines and food items. She sent a message to ACP Karol Bagh who then asked beat constable Narendra to deliver the essential items.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-issue-2432-challans-act-against-1950-violators/articleshow/82122262.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Parents worry about social isolation & irritation in kids||Mask sagging under his nose as usual, when little Aveer sat on a swing in his neighbourhood park for the first time last month, his parents celebrated the milestone a bit too soon. Till then, the two-year-old had almost never interacted with other people his size and, each time his parents had taken him to the park post lockdown, he had shrivelled away from the prospect of playing with other children. Naturally, Thane's Ketki Gupte welcomed her son's ascent to the swing as a step towards him becoming the social animal that human beings are supposedly meant to be. "But then we realized he sat on the swing only when other kids were not around," says Gupte, who worries when she watches her toddler playing idly with toy cars or bawling each time his father steps out of the house, even for doctors' appointments. A year since the pandemic robbed kids of the social interactions that shape their malleable human brains, tykes between the ages of two and five-- especially those who used to attend playgroups or daycare centres--are growing increasingly cranky, reclusive and anxious. "My kid is not smiling like before" and "I don't even know if my kid even knows the concept of friends" are among the concerns that psychologist Seema Hingorrany has been increasingly hearing from millennial parents. Some kids' personalities have shown a marked change. "When one is not able to make friends or doesn't know how to have a conversation, it affects his self-esteem and could lead to frustration," says Swati Popat Vats, educator and President of the Early Childhood Association, who has noticed some formerly outgoing children retreating into a shell. "A preschooler views a laptop screen like a television. His brain has been trained into thinking that the screen is supposed to speak to me and I don't have to talk back," says Vats, who has also seen children clam up during online school sessions. At Kangaroo Kids in Kandivali, there were times when some children would miss their teachers' physical presence and get cranky. "So, teachers have been scheduling one-on-one video calls with them post school," says Kusum Kanwar, managing director of the school, who recalls that some children insisted on visiting the school building to verify if it was indeed shut. A major fallout of not having a structured school atmosphere is disturbed sleep patterns among children. "Children don't have to wake up early to travel to school anymore. So even the younger kids who should be in bed by 9 pm are staying up late with other family members," says psychiatrist Dr Avinash De Sousa. If some kids are growing so attached to their working-from-home parents that they are showing signs of "separation anxiety" when the parents leave their side even briefly, "language delay" is another huge complaint, points out psychologist Divya Andar. "As the parents are busy working from home, they find it difficult to spend quality time with the child," says Andar, whose friend's five-year-old daughter spends so long watching a tablet that she has not only developed eyesight problems but also an American accent. Asmita Powar, a Thane-based hotel management lecturer, misses the sweet daily father-daughter moment that would play out in her living room daily before Covid. "Baba, you go to office, I'll go to school," her three-year-old daughter Swasti would wave off her father when he would leave for work even as she readied for the playgroup where friends and teachers had taught her how to speak. Today, in trying to make up for her daughter's absent circle of friends and teachers, Powar is running around in circles. Having exhausted most of the games, flashcards and worksheets she had bought, Powar took Swasti down to the building lobby a few days ago. But Swasti refused to set foot on her bicycle because her back seat would be empty. "Cycling for her was about meeting friends but they have stopped coming now because of the second Covid wave," says Powar. The Early Childhood Association has advised its member schools to have younger children interact with each other in virtual chat rooms with no interference of adults to develop social skills. "The chat rooms have not more than five kids at a time. They can get their toys or snacks and chat about whatever they wish with a teacher watching only if support is needed," says Vats, who remains optimistic about the future: "Children are resilient when handled properly by both parents and teachers alike."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-parents-worry-about-social-isolation-irritation-in-kids/articleshow/82122267.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Kolkata||Every district gets nodal officer to fight second wave||Kolkata: The state government has asked markets and commercial units to adopt a staggered work schedule, besides appointing senior bureaucrats for each district as nodal officers to step up the battle against the second wave. Moreover, the railways will impose Rs 500 fine for not wearing masks on railways premises, including Metro stations. In an advisory issued by the state home department, the government has asked the business and commercial units to maintain staggered timing to maintain social distancing. Henceforth, police will strictly enforce wearing of masks in public places. For effective and seamless management of Covid situation, a handful of experienced senior bureaucrats will henceforth be the nodal officers for each district. Home secretary H K Dwivedi, for instance, will be the nodal officer for Kolkata and Howrah. Apart from managing the Covid crisis and enforcing the guidelines, the nodal officers will keep a close contact with the state-level Covid task force and report to the chief secretary. All public places, including malls and industrial units, will carry out routine sanitization at least one a week, it has been advised. Thermal scanning and hand-sanitation needs to be strictly enforced at the entry points of malls, shopping zones, restaurants, theatres, play grounds, amusement parks, places of worship. Stadia and swimming pools should strictly adhere Covid guidelines . Already, all government departments have resumed functioning with 50% workforce. The advisory said that similar functioning should be adopted by private entities. In Kolkata, designated officials will be there to impose fine on offenders on Metro premises. Any act of spitting, which is dangerous to public health, will be dealt with strictly by railway officials. In buses and ferries, the transport department will shortly devise a crowd-controlling mechanism. The transport department may impose access control to limit the number of passengers in buses and ferries. Masks will be mandatory for boarding any public transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/every-district-gets-nodal-officer-to-fight-second-wave/articleshow/82121843.cms||---

The yatra is scheduled to start from May 14. The minister also hinted towards placing a limit on the number of pilgrims that can visit a shrine daily. “Pilgrims coming from other states to Haridwar Maha Kumbh as well as the Char Dham Yatra are requested to follow the Covid-19 guidelines. The government is fully prepared for the yatra and as part of the guidelines, devotees must get CBNAAT, TrueNaT or RT-PCR tests done before coming. Char Dham pilgrims must register online and will be allowed to enter the shrines as per the shrines’ capacity,” Maharaj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-ve-report-will-be-mandatory-for-char-dham-yatra-ukhand-tourism-min/articleshow/82121121.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Delhi||Delhi: One burial ground out of bounds, space filling up fast||NEW DELHI: After last year’s resistance by residents of Madanpur Khadar against burial of Covid-infected bodies, the authorities are not using the local facility. But the main Covid burial facility at the Firoz Shah Kotla new cemetery, which is catering to the largest percentage of such burials in the city, is fast filling up and funeral managers say if the current death rate continues, the authorities may soon be forced to designate more Covid burial grounds. Mashkoor Rashid, who is in charge of the Kotla burial ground, said they were receiving 15-16 Covid-protocol bodies every day and space for only 70-80 bodies were left in the Covid block. More than 435 bodies have been buried in this 1.7-acre block since last year. One of the oldest burial grounds in the capital, the facility’s non-Covid free space, too, is fast shrinking. Rashid said that in many cases, families decided to dig the same old grave and bury another body in the same space. He also complained about the shortage of PPE kits and other protective equipment. Last year, the civic bodies had reserved Covid-designated burial spaces in Kotla, Mangolpuri, Mulla Colony, Shastri Park and Madanpur Khadar. Abdul Rehman, who manages the Madanpur Khadar facility on behalf of the Kalam Welfare Society, said when the bodies of Covid patients were brought last June, locals started throwing stones and no body could be buried. “There was a lot of ruckus and police had to be called in. This year, the corporation hasn’t sent us Covid-protocol bodies,” he added. The removal has increased the pressure on the other four burial grounds. North Delhi Municipal Corporation is utilising the Mangolpuri ground for Covid-protocol burials. An official overseeing the operations said a small section of the ground was reserved for such funerals and the rate at which bodies were coming would soon lead to exhaustion of this block. “In Mangolpuri, we have a cremation ground, and Muslim and Christian cemeteries adjacent to each other. On Wednesday, we received 17 dead bodies for Covid-protocol funerals. Each hospital is linked with one ground and the corporation may soon have to reassign these grounds or add more facilities to the list,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/one-burial-ground-out-of-bounds-space-filling-up-fast/articleshow/82122276.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||With new wave, hotels hoping to earn during wedding season brace for losses||NEW DELHI: With Delhi government ordering The Suryaa to be converted into an extended Covid care facility for Holy Family Hospital, there has been a sudden shift in their plans of hosting multiple wedding functions from next week, apart from catering to the heavy “saya” dates from this weekend. Greesh Bindra, the hotel’s VP (operations), said that from being fully booked to being inundated with cancellation calls after being labelled as a “Covid facility”, the hotel has already lost a lot of revenue. After Delhi government’s notification listing hotels and banquet halls to be converted into extended Covid facilities, many popular wedding venues are looking at huge revenue losses. Crowne Plaza at Okhla and Rohini, WelcomHotel Dwarka, Radisson Blu Paschim Vihar and The Suryaa are among those on the list that are popular wedding venues. From next week till May end, these hotels were fully booked for weddings on dates that were considered auspicious. Bindra, whose hotel was attached last year too, said hospitals already had beds available and attaching hotels would badly impact a beleaguered industry hoping for some revival from the wedding business. “A hospital refers a patient to a hotel once its beds are full. A patient pays the hospital, which further pays the hotels. With hospital beds not fully utilised, no patients will be referred and the hotels will remain vacant,” he added. Executives at Fraser Suites, Mayur Vihar and Svelte Hotel, Saket said they had not received any instructions so far regarding conversion to a Covid facility, but would promptly do so if asked. A hotel representative expressed concern over the safety of staff and long-term guests. He said many hotels were popular among people visiting their relatives in the vicinity as they offered five-star experience at an affordable cost. Speaking from last year’s experience, Bindra said, “Hotels can never provide critical care to serious Covid-19 patients. Patients who don’t need hospitalisation go under home isolation. Hotels will have to invest in converting their existing premises into Covid facilities and bear losses if no patients are referred there by hospitals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-new-wave-hotels-hoping-to-earn-during-wedding-season-brace-for-losses/articleshow/82122265.cms||Amin Ali

These orders will remain effective for next six months. According to railways, they are trying to run trains while following all guidelines to safeguard passengers.

But now, railways have imposed penalty to control the spread of infection and made wearing face masks while travelling or coming to railway premises compulsory. A penalty Rs 500 will be imposed on those not wearing masks or found spitting.

---||Lucknow||Weddings, exams & industrial activity allowed in Sunday curfew||Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday rolled out guidelines for the statewide Sunday lockdown, which will be in place till May 15 amid a sharp surge in Covid cases. Industrial activity, movement of workers to their workplace, examinations, essential services, public transport with 50% capacity and weddings will be allowed. Additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said, industrial work, including continuous process industries and those involved in manufacturing of sanitisers, medical equipment and masks will be allowed to continue. “All industries, particularly those in the pharmaceutical, sanitizer making sectors and other firms directly linked to the fight against Covid can function, barring those closed on Sunday for weekly off,” the government order states. The government also permitted weddings, subject to restrictions. A ceremony in the open can be attended by a maximum of 100 persons, while a maximum of 50 guests will be permitted in closed spaces, provided Covid protocols are followed. For funeral services at crematoriums and burial grounds, a maximum of 20 persons will be allowed. “All examinations, including National Defence Academy will be allowed and examiners and candidates should carry their ID cards for seamless passage to test centres. Public transport will be allowed to run with 50% capacity, especially state transport buses. Also, night curfew with extended hours was clamped in five more districts where active cases crossed 2,000 on Saturday. These include Ghaziabad, Moradabad, Jaunpur, Rae Bareli and Barabanki. When the order was issued on Thursday, there were only 10 districts, where active cases had crossed 2,000. The night curfew in these areas will be from 8 pm to 7 am. In other districts, where active cases are more than 500, the curfew will be from 9 pm-6 am. “There are standing instructions to district authorities to extend curfew timings when active cases cross the 2,000 mark. For instance, there are three districts where active cases are over 1,900. This include Sonbhadra with 1,934 active cases, Agra with 1,985 active cases and Muzaffarnagar with 1,936 active cases. We can expect that night curfew hours in these districts will be extended from Monday, by when the Covid count could cross 2,000,” said a government official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/weddings-exams-industrial-activity-allowed-in-sunday-curfew/articleshow/82122838.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Kolkata||Kolkata hospitals will need seven more days to ramp up Covid beds||KOLKATA: Private hospitals across the city have agreed to ramp up the number of Covid beds but hospital administrators said it would take about a week at least to jack up the numbers. According to them, they need to discharge some of the non-Covid patients who are now currently admitted so that they have vacant beds to convert those for Covid treatment. On Saturday, the state health department formed a task force that would oversee the augmentation of beds by private hospitals with Sanjay Bansal secretary in the state health and family department as its nodal officer. On Friday, the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission had asked private hospitals to hike Covid beds by 25% above the number that they had during the peak last year. AMRI-Mukundapur is planning to start a 100-bedded Covid ward at a brand new building at its Mukundapur unit. The Dhakuria unit is expected to have an additional 10 beds in a week that would add to the current 120 beds. “We can start a 100-bed facility in the new building at Mukundapur for Covid care as soon as we get the license from Kolkata Municipal Corporation. For our Salt Lake unit, we need to relocate our dialysis unit before we could increase beds there,” said a source at AMRI. “The issue this time, unlike the previous wave, is that there is a continuous flow of non-Covid patients. We currently have 300 non-Covid patient, out of which 60 are under the Swasthya Sathi scheme. That is the reason we have requested the health commission to give us some time to augment our Covid beds,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Hospitals currently have a good number of non-Covid patients who are either recuperating after surgeries or are admitted for other treatments. For example, on Monday, among the admitted patients at Rabindranath Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences, 100 were post-surgical patients while 200 were critical care patients across all specialities. “Currently, we have 110 Covid beds, including 48 critical care beds. We will try to take this up to 121, seven of which will be critical care beds, in the next few days,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (East) of Narayana Health. “Increasing the number of beds was easier last year as non-Covid patients had stopped coming to hospital unless in emergency,” said Alok Roy, chairman of Medica Group of Hospitals. While the 325-bedded Medica has already converted 167 beds for Covid care, the 230-bed Fortis Hospital has enhanced Covid beds to 88. Sources in the health department indicated bigger corporate hospitals that still have not augmented Covid-19 beds will come under its scanner. “As for the government sector, the 200-bedded Covid facility at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital hopefully will become functional by the end of next week. The possibilities of hiking up beds in other government facility is also on the cards,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hospitals-will-need-seven-more-days-to-ramp-up-covid-beds/articleshow/82121841.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) has now allowed schools to appeal on behalf of such candidates so that their remaining practicals can be rescheduled on campus after they get well and leave quarantine. The CBSE had earlier announced this too. Candidates with non-lab-based subjects who had to come to school for their board viva, but could not do so because of Covid, have been tested online. On Friday, an ISC candidate of South City International School broke into fever at the end of the practical examination and the school advised the parents to immediately get the child tested. He could not come for his last practical exam on Saturday. “We are yet to get a report about whether the fever was due to Covid, but have assured the child about the decision of the Council that another exam will be organized for him,” said principal John Bagul. For another commerce student, the viva was arranged online. Similar online viva were organized for two ISC students of commerce and humanities at St Augustine Day School, Barrackpore, since they tested positive, said school head Janet Gasper Chowdhury. A student of the Shyamnagar branch of the school missed his practi-cals because his parents had tested positive. “We have assured the child that the Council has permitted a re-schedule of his practical exams,” she said. Parents of a topper at Heritage School tested positive for Covid just before his physics practical exam on Friday. But since it was his last exam and he was well, the school allowed the boy to come in PPE after the rest of the batch had finished the test. “We have an ISC candidate who could not come for his home science practical test because he tested positive. We appealed to the Council with his medical documents and he has been granted a reschedule. We will do that after he has finished his quarantine and tested negative,” said principal of DPS Newtown Sonali Sen. Many schools have completed their practical exams and viva-voce, whereas some will do so by next week. Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, for example, is yet to complete its CBSE XII practicals and has about five to six candidates who could not appear because they were infected. “They informed us that they tested positive and we informed the Board. However, there is nothing to worry about since their practical exams have been rescheduled,” said director Meena Kak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/practicals-to-be-rescheduled-for-board-students-with-cov/articleshow/82121844.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

DRDO will also be helping the government set up 10 new oxygen plants across the state to augment supply for medical use. Till Saturday evening, the state capital recorded 44,485 active cases and was receiving Covid patients from neighbouring districts, triggering massive shortage of beds. During a review of the Covid situation in the state on Saturday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed officials to ensure that every hospital has at least a 36-hour oxygen supply. He said, private hospitals unable to admit patients in the ICU due to oxygen shortage will be provided with cylinders. “The CM said, work should take place on a war footing for setting up oxygen plants and the sites have been identified. The minister of medical education and the health minister will be monitoring the work. The CM also said, HAL has offered to set up a Covid Hospital with CSR funds. The health department has been asked to coordinate with HAL to ensure the project kicks off on priority,” said a government spokesperson. On Friday, it was decided that DRDO would help set up a 1,000-bed Covid facility in Vrindavan Yojna and two smaller facilities at Haj House on Kanpur Road and Golden Blossom Resort on Faizabad Road. The CM instructed officials to carry out intensive monitoring of operations of Uttar Pradesh Medical Supplies Corporation. He said, officials should regularly review availability of beds, oxygen, RTPCR testing, medicines and manpower in each district. The CM said, the integrated command and control centres should be made nodal points in managing the pandemic and each district should decentralise work and strengthen ICCCs. To raise testing, the CM said, RTPCR tests should be conducted through private laboratories authorized by the district administration.

The advisory says that “if the students want, they can go home and return as soon as the situation improves in Delhi.”IIT-D director V Ramgopal Rao told TOI: “The advisory is a precautionary measure and it is voluntary. We do not have a spike in cases in the campus.”He further said: “Around 25 students have tested positive in the last one month. Our worry is that since we have 2,000 students on the campus and the cases are rising in Delhi, it is better if students go home.”In the advisory, deputy director (strategy and planning) Ashok Ganguli informed the research scholars that a meeting took place between the administrative personnel, who are part of the Covid Committee, and the IIT director to review the alarming situation arising out of increasing Covid-19 cases. IIT has witnessed 15 students, six staff members and two family members of the staff testing positive recently.Ganguli said that the Gulmohar facility for home quarantine of students was full to capacity. “While some faculty members and staff members are in home isolation, this option is not available to hostel residents. As per norms, they have to be shifted to government isolation centres, which are also getting fast overwhelmed.”A similar advisory was earlier issued by JNU where the students were advised to leave the campus. However, many are against the idea.“I came back to the campus only in November after studying from home and without any facilities for several months. I am not sure if I want to go back home indefinitely,” said Subhadeep Nath, an MSc student.Harshita Bathwal, a PhD scholar, said that she would not leave the campus. “I have archival work that can only be done from Delhi.” She questioned why the central government has not opened the vaccination drive for people younger than 45 years.This was reiterated by Saket Moon, JNU Students’ Union vice-president too. He also questioned the varsity administration for not setting up a proper quarantine centre in the campus.Delhi University’s Gwyer Hall hostel has recorded four positive cases of Covid. “Residents are worried and not stepping out of their rooms,” said Sandeep Sharma, a resident at the hostel. On whether DU will also issue an advisory asking students to leave, dean of students’ welfare Rajeev Gupta told TOI that “the university will hold a meeting and decide on the plan ahead.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-jnu-iit-d-also-advises-students-to-return-home/articleshow/82122284.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

Asutalian media has identified the man as 24-year-old Vishal Jood. NSW police, in a statement, said Jood was arrested on Friday morning, from a house on Dixon Street in Parramatta, a major commercial hub outside Sydney. He has been charged with “three counts of affray, three counts of armed with intent commit indictable offence, two counts of destroy or damage property » $5000 and =$15,000 (DV), and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company of other(s)”, said police. The 24-year-old was refused bail and he was produced in a Parramatta court on Saturday. “Since September last year, officers attached to Parramatta Police Area Command have been investigating a number of incidents in Harris Park. About 8.30pm, September 16, 2020, a man walking along Brisbane Street was assaulted by a group of up to five men. The man was allegedly struck several times in the head with a baseball bat and then kicked when on the ground. He was taken to Westmead Hospital for treatment to facial injuries,” said NSW police. About 6.30pm on February 14, 2021, a man driving a black 2015 Range Rover along Marion Street was allegedly attacked by a group of up to five men, holding sticks and other weapons, police said. Mentioning the third crime, in which Jood was involved, police said, “About 10.15pm, on February 28, 2021, a group of people travelling in a vehicle on Kendall Street was allegedly attacked by up to 10 men. The vehicle sustained serious damage.” It was the last crime which attracted huge attention as it happened when bitterness between pro- and anti-farm groups had already spilled overseas and a few incidents took place in Australia, New Zealand and Canada displaying this tension. The car with Sikh youths inside was attacked by a group of persons carrying baseballs bats, rods etc and all its windows were smashed. The group had participated in anti-farm-laws protest and one of the youths had told TOI that they were either attacked due to their Sikh identity or for their support to anti-farm-laws protest in Sydney where four of them had participated. The incident was caught on CCTV cameras. The youths were returning after dinner at an Indian restaurant in Harris Park area. All five are in early 20s and are students. “It seems that our presence was marked at the restaurant by one or more attackers and then more gathered to waylay and attack us,” one of the Sikh youths had told TOI a few days after the attack.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/indian-origin-man-arrested-for-attacks-on-sikhs-in-australia/articleshow/82122862.cms||IP Singh

---||Kolkata||E-forms to be sent to ICSE candidates on taking test later or opting out||Kolkata: The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) has announced that ICSE (Class X) candidates can either choose to write their exams alongside the deferred ISC examinations or may opt not to write them at all. To get a clear picture of what students want, city schools will start giving out digital forms from Monday. Schools feel they will be asked to share the numbers of ‘ayes’ and ‘nays’ by the Council by the end of next month. Many schools said that a majority of ICSE examinees might want to take the test later since they prepared for it and might not want to give in to an evaluation based on “personal averages” for the past two years. School heads said that many candidates pull up their socks after the pre-boards are over and often manage to score far higher than what they had during their school exams. A WhatsApp message has gone out to all parents of students due to appear for ICSE from principal of South City International School John Bagul, saying that they will be given a Google form to fill in, showing their choice, on Monday. “We will give them a long time to think and make up their minds before filling these in and sending them to us. Parents and students are free to consult teachers, too,” Bagul said. Heritage School principal Seema Sapru felt that most of her students will opt to write their examinations. “We will send out Google forms next week so that they can make their choices. We will have counselling sessions with our co-ordinators and counsellors,” she said. Some schools said that the anxiety was palpable among ICSE students and they first needed to be calmed down and guided so that they can make an informed decision. Many schools have already scheduled meetings on Monday to plan the way forward. “We will meet and decide on Monday how the choice forms will be given out, the time frame for decision making, etc,” said Sujoy Biswas, principal of Rammohan Mission School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/e-forms-to-be-sent-to-icse-candidates-on-taking-test-later-or-opting-out/articleshow/82121855.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The officials estimated the reduction in workers’ strength by around 25% to 30%. A major drop was reported in the last one week as several of them left for their native places. The officials stated that they were managing the work with the available manpower, but the progress would be affected if the shortfall continued for long. The MahaMetro officials stated that they had started vaccination of eligible workers and providing all necessary assistance to them. “We had a strength of 6,000 workers, of whom 1,600 have not reported for work in the past few days. The absence of workers has not stopped work, but it could hamper the pace. We are drawing up plans to manage the work,” Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations), MahaMetro, said. A source said the impact had been less this time compared to the 2020 lockdown. An official from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said, “It seems many have returned to their hometowns.

Some of them have even made an appeal to the West Bengal University of Health Sciences and state health government officials about the same. The majority of the 3,000-strong workforce that belongs to the final-year MD/MS/diploma courses in different specialties of various medical colleges and hospitals in the state had been deployed on Covid-19 duties. Currently, most are on study leave due to the pending examinations and some are Covid-19 positive. “Some of us are infected and in isolation or on treatment. There is no clause under WBUHS that one can take the examinations from isolation. Therefore it is only fair for the examinations to be deferred,” said a final-year PGT doctor at NRS Medical College and Hospital. In addition to the internal assessment part, the final-year MD/MS doctors have to appear for both theory tests, scheduled between May 6 and 12, and practicals, scheduled between May 17 and 29. “Can you imagine the number of cases there is going to be by the end of this month? Each hospital will be swarmed by Covid patients. Will the environment be conducive to an exam?” said a final-year PGT student at RG Kar Medical College. “This workforce will not be available for Covid duties till June 15 (declaration of examination) or other hospital services. One of us might become infected during the physical exam and carry the virus back to either the hostel or home,” said another final-year PGT at Medical College Hospital. Medical teachers also felt there should be some modification in the examinations if deferring was not the solution. “Many of them are posted in Covid wards and some are still infected. The university can at least think about modifying the method of examination — may be on the basis of internal assessment and some online examination,” said Manas Gumta, professor of general surgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/final-year-pg-trainee-doctors-appeal-for-pushing-back-of-exams/articleshow/82121857.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

From five bodies piled on a single pyre for cremation, to opening up of defunct crematoriums to tide over the fresh demands and one mortuary van b ringing in seven bodies in body-bags to the Kurukshetra crematorium — the horror is unrelenting. Saturday too was no different. With the existing fleet of morgue vans proving insufficient to carry the overflowing number of bodies, the state health authorities deployed 15 discarded 108 EMRI ambulances as morgue vans. These 15 vans have been distributed in five cities equally. Even after 17 days of the spike in the number of deaths the fresh arrangement suggests that the high number of deaths are likely to continue. According to health officials, the system has been developed to ensure that the bodies can be shifted for cremation in time. Currently, 22 morgue vans of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) carry the bodies from Covid-19 hospitals. Of these vans, eight are SMC’s vehicles while 14 others were on hire. In time of emergency, the civic body hires five more vehicles from contractors to meet the unexpected rise in demands. “Total 15 discarded vehicles not fit to be used as ambulances were provided to the government. After some repair and changes, these are now being used as morgue vans while a black sticker of ‘shabvahini has been pasted on all of them’. They are being put to use by the health department at the New Civil Hospital (NCH),” said Faiyaz Pathan, program manager, 108 EMRI services, Surat. In the Diamond City, the SMC as well as a few NGOs provide morgue vans. But owing to the high number of Covid related deaths this year, these vans are always on the move. Ekta Trust, which also provides service of shifting Covid-19 bodies from private hospitals, however, denied revealing the exact number of morgue vans it is using at the moment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/now-discarded-108-ambulances-turn-into-morgue-vans-for-covid-bodies/articleshow/82121138.cms||---

Deepender, who visited Barwala and Uklana assembly seats, sought an investigation. Hooda said the government had promised to pay within 48 hours, but even after weeks, farmers were not paid. Despite repeated calls, the government did not make arrangements for buy-and-pay, he said. “That is why the pace of procurement is sluggish and farmers are facing dislocations in mandis,” he added. tnn “There is no space left in mandis due to the rapid rise in wheat arrivals and the grain has spread to roads. Rain and the storm are rubbing salt on the wounds of farmers. Due to the lack of tarpaulin sheets, the grain is getting wet. Chaos in mandis is because the government had to declare to stop purchase, which had never happened before. It is clear from this that the government did not make adequate arrangements for procurement of crops in time and only misled farmers”, he said. Hooda said the BJP government was destroying farming and had already raised price of DAP by 58.33%. Describing the Covid situation in the state as extremely worrying, he said the Haryana government should take a lesson in view of the situation of other states. “Because the new variant of Covid is very dangerous and is spreading very fast,” Deepender said. Deepender also unveiled the statue of Bhim Rao Ambedkar at a programme organised by Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar Yuva Seva Samiti in Badhavar, a village in Uklana assembly.

The attendants have to rush to get remdesivir from different sources which can increase chances of them falling prey to black marketing and purchasing the injection at exorbitant rates. A private hospital official said, "We are not getting regular supply of remdesivir from stockists due to which we do not have sufficient doses. The attendants of the patients have to buy it from outside". Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Society (PHNHS) has raised the issue and demanded its resolution for the betterment of patients undergoing treatment in private hospitals. "Situation is grim. Immediate improvement in terms of availability and distribution of remdesivir injection in private hospitals needs to be done before things go from bad to worse," said Dr Vijay Kapoor, secretary, PHNHS. He alleged that the hospitals are not getting the supply from the stockists. The demand from private hospitals for remdesivir has to be fulfilled for Covid-19 patients. The shortage is being faced by private hospitals, while the government hospitals have enough stock of the injections. "Our department is procuring remdesivir regularly from the companies and we have sufficient stock available for treatment of Covid-19 patients," said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officier (Jaipur-I). Besides, SMS Medical College has also released a protocol for judicious use of remdesivir. The college appealed to the doctors not to give remdesivir to every Covid-19 patient as it is useful in some patients and useless in patients with some health conditions. On the intervention of the Centre, major manufacturers of ‘remdesivir injection’ have reported voluntary reduction in the maximum retail price, said the order issued by National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/attendants-of-covid-patients-asked-to-arrange-for-remdesivir-in-pvt-hosps/articleshow/82122298.cms||---

The tiger was rescued and shifted to Gorewada Rescue Center in Nagpur. The tiger was hit by an unidentified vehicle while attempting to get across the four-lane highway. The animal did not use a small underpass constructed near the spot. Foresters say that the tiger must be habituated to the route to move from Pench Tiger Reserve to the forest on the other side of the highway. The NHAI has constructed two 750 metres and one 300 metre underpasses for wildlife. Wild animals are using these passes as is evident from the photos available in cameras placed there. Pench field director & CCF Ravikiran Govekar says, “It is possible the tiger may be resident of Khursapar area of PTR. We are yet to identify it.” Deputy conservator of forest (DyCF) Prabhu Nath Shukla said, “The limping tiger was first sighted at 10 am by a forest labourer in a road off the highway. After walking a few metres, it sat down under a tree unable to move.” “Our staff kept watch from a tower for two hours but the animal stayed put. When they went near the tiger it growled and tried to attack but could not stand up, indicating something was wrong. Though there were no external injuries, the animal had suffered femur fractures,” said ACF Sandeep Giri. The forest team led by wildlife veterinarians Dr Mayur Kate and Dr Syed Bilal from transit treatment centre, Nagpur, tranquillized the tiger. It had suffered a femur fracture on the left leg and also injured its front leg. “It is a young male and needs to be operated upon, and a rod inserted. It is unlikely to be able to hunt on its own and will have to spend a life in captivity,” said the vets. State wildlife board member Kundan Hate said, “There have been four such incidents involving tigers in the last two years. Regular patrolling and monitoring is a must between Chorbahuli and Deolapar. Vulnerable spots should be identified and warning reflectors placed to deter the wildlife.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pench-tiger-injured-in-hit-and-run-near-deolapar/articleshow/82122310.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The accused, Sachin Tribhuvan (26), has 25 body and property offences registered against him, with the latest case resulting in registration of offence under Narcotic Substances and Psychotropic Substances Act. Crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav said during the current restrictions, his teams are keeping a close watch on the activities of the habitual offenders. Crime branch assistant inspector Ajabsingh Jarwal said, “The accused had procured and stored this marijuana and was selling it while using measuring equipment from his house.” The seizure of such a large amount of marijuana being sold from a densely populated Harshnagar area has raised many eyebrows. “It will be interesting to find the source and how such a large amount of marijuana has reached the accused’s house, especially when there is heavy police bandobast across the city,” said inspector Sambhaji Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/21kg-of-marijuana-seized-from-a-criminal/articleshow/82120774.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC relief for sr pilot named in sexual harassment case||Mumbai: The Bombay high court recently granted interim anticipatory bail to a 53-year-old senior captain of an airlines who was accused of sexually harassing his colleague, a pilot. The senior captain told the court that he had been falsely implicated. His anticipatory bail plea had said that he had refused to circumvent procedures after the woman was allegedly referred for “corrective training” following air safety lapses during one of the flights she commanded. He said that he was being targeted by her and others for being completely dedicated. The woman had accused him of repeatedly making sexually coloured remarks. She complained to the police on March 30. In her complaint, the woman alleged that the man would look at her body in an inappropriate manner and make passes. The man moved high court after the sessions court rejected his plea. However, granting him relief, the high court said, “The applicant is working as general manager... and in the event of his arrest his employment would be in jeopardy. Considering the facts of this case, interim protection can be granted to the applicant...” the court said. The high court said that in the event of his arrest he is to be released on bail on furnishing a bond of Rs.25,000. “This interim protection is granted till the next date of hearing,” the high court said. His bail plea said that in January 2021, after learning that he was likely to be promoted... an absolutely false frivolous and malicious complaint came to be filed with the internal committee. He said he even filed replies to the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-relief-for-sr-pilot-named-in-sexual-harassment-case/articleshow/82122330.cms||---

At a programme held in Gandhi Bhavan in Hyderabad, TRS leader from Palair Assembly constituency Madhavi Reddy along with her followers joined the Congress in the presence of Pradesh Congress Party president N Uttam Kumar Reddy and the other senior leaders. Uttam said the elections to the urban local bodies are being held in the state with political malice. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has got the State Election Commission to go for the polls of municipal corporations and municipalities fearing an adverse outcome in the Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll, he alleged. “The chief minister wanted that the municipal elections process is completed before the announcement of the result of Nagarjuna Sagar constituency on May 2,” he said. He said the ruling TRS is scared of losing the Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll and it do not want it to adversely affect the outcome of ULB elections. “Do we need elections in this time when Covid-19 cases are rising steeply in the state?

Although the state announced that inter first-year students will be promoted without examinations, they said that it is just a time gap arrangement as students will have to appear for exams at a later stage. “The current second-year batch students are the most affected ones as they will have to appear for this year and also had to live in uncertainty the whole year as the board did not make it clear, until recently, on whether or not they will have to appear for supplementary exams to clear backlogs,” said Venkat Balmoor, state president, NSUI.

Though vendors are being allowed to access apartment complexes and residential colonies, while maintaining all precautionary measures, play areas and outdoor activities within many communities have been restricted. “We have not really changed the quarantine and sanitisation procedures that we had put in place from the beginning of the pandemic last year but since the time we got to know about the second wave and how it is affecting families, especially children, we shut down the play area and other outdoor activities,” said Konala Verma, general secretary, Lanco Hills, Manikonda. “Also, in case someone from a particular flat tests positive, we ensure that they go into isolation immediately. The errands of that family are taken care of by our housekeeping department. The house help is also asked to go into quarantine for two weeks as a safety precaution,” said Verma. The state health department recently issued a warning about the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the state and said that the virus is spreading much faster this time. “We have been checking temperature of every single person who is entering the apartment and ensuring that sanitisation is done regularly. A few cases were reported in our apartment,” said K Srinivas, security official of Czech colony, Sanathnagar. A security official of Glendale apartment in Begumpet said that guidelines were issued to the residents to curb the spread of the virus. “Four people from a family tested positive in our apartment last week.

---||Ranchi||Lalu’s sentence suspended by HC, set to walk free||Ranchi/Patna: Incarcerated RJD president Lalu Prasad is set to walk out of jail after the Jharkhand high court suspended the remaining duration of his prison sentence in the Dumka treasury fodder scam case, RC 38A/96, on Saturday. Lalu, currently undergoing treatment at AIIMS in New Delhi under custody, is likely to be released next week after the formal processes are complete. During the hearing on Saturday, former Union minister and senior advocate Kapil Sibal argued on behalf of Lalu, saying that the RJD president had completed more than half of the maximum sentence of seven years’ rigorous imprisonment in the Dumka treasury case and was entitled to be released. Lalu’s family and party supporters were elated. While Lalu’s wife, former CM Rabri Devi, and their eldest daughter, Rajya Sabha member Misa Bharti, arrived at AIIMS Delhi, his sons and other daughters expressed happiness on social media. Lalu’s younger son, leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, thanked the high court. "But we are more concerned about his health now," he said. Tejashwi said a decision on Lalu’s coming to Patna would depend on the advice of doctors attending to him at AIIMS Delhi. "He is suffering from different ailments, including of the kidney and heart. We don’t want to take any chances," he said. Lalu’s elder son, Tej Pratap Yadav, tweeted, "The messiah of the poor and downtrodden is now back. Tell those who have been doing injustice to them that our leader is coming back." One of Lalu’s daughters, Rohini Acharya, said she had got his "Eidi (Eid blessings)", for which she has been observing Ramzan. Rohini also said she was observing "Chaitra Navaratra" rituals for his father’s release. RJD workers and supporters celebrated the news by bursting firecrackers and distributing sweets. Though the party appealed to its supporters not to celebrate the occasion in a big way, and to follow Covid-19 guidelines, a few supporters went to Rabri Devi’s 10, Circular Road residence in Patna to celebrate. Earlier, RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari said, "The whole of Bihar welcomes his (Lalu’s) bail. It has been a long wait for him, his family members and party workers." RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said Lalu’s release would boost the morale of party workers. Former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s HAM(S), part of the ruling NDA in the state, also welcomed news of Lalu’s bail. HAM(S) spokesperson Danish Rizwan said, "Our leader Jitan Ram Manjhi always expressed his concern about Lalu-ji’s ill health. We hope now Lalu-ji will be able to take care of himself in a better way. We are pleased with his bail." On April 9, a bench comprising Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh ascertained from the CBI counsel that Lalu had indeed completed more than half of his sentence and ordered his release on Saturday. Lalu has been in custody since December 2017 following convictions in four fodder scam cases (Chaibasa, 2 cases; Deoghar and Dumka, one case each) in Jharkhand relating to fraudulent withdrawal of funds from treasuries in undivided Bihar when he was chief minister. The fodder scam, related to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 900 crores by the then animal husbandry department, was first unearthed in January 1996. Then West Singhbhum deputy commissioner Amit Khare, who conducted raids on the animal husbandry offices in Chaibasa, first detected the scam. Khare is now posted in Delhi on central deputation. The scam was found to involveme senior politicians, chief ministers and top officials of the then Bihar government. A PIL was also filed in the Supreme Court, leading to a CBI probe and the initiation of several cases against the high-profile accused. Later, Lalu had to resign as CM and surrendered in a Ranchi court. After his conviction, Lalu has been imprisoned at the Birsa Munda Central Jail. He was undergoing treatment at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), Ranchi, under custody. During the period, he was also referred to better healthcare institutes in the country. The RJD president had been seeking bail Erin the high court in the Dumka treasury case, where fraudulent withdrawals amounting to Rs 3.13 crore were made, since April 2018. In the remaining two cases, he has been convicted for less than three years and had got bail. The trial in another fodder scam case in Jharkhand, related to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 139 crore from Doranda treasury, in which Lalu is an accused, is still on. Another case related to fraudulent withdrawal from Bhagalpur treasury (in Bihar) is also on. However, Lalu has got bail in both cases. The primary allegations against Lalu are that he had shielded several corrupt animal husbandry department officials who have regularly provided money to him while he was CM during 1990 and 1994. He was also in charge of the finance ministry then. Being at the helm of affairs, he was also aware of the excess budget and expenditure in the animal husbandry department showing transport of fodder for animals on scooters and motorcycles, according to the charges against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lalus-sentence-suspended-by-hc-set-to-walk-free/articleshow/82122448.cms||Ramashankar

---||Ranchi||Rift in ruling alliance over lockdown, BJP to back govt||Ranchi: Differences cropped up between ruling Congress and JMM, the lead partner in the Mahagathbandhan, during the all-party meeting on Saturday over the imposition of a complete lockdown to break the chain of Covid-19 in the state. As there was no consensus, the government could not announce any measures. While JMM is in favour of the lockdown, Congress along with Left parties cited the problems faced by the poor and the underprivileged groups during the countrywide lockdown last year and urged chief minister Hemant Soren to focus on other stringent measures and strengthening of the healthcare infrastructure. RJD, another partner of the ruling alliance, remained neutral on the issue. Meanwhile, opposition BJP and Ajsu-P, assured Soren that they would extend full support to any decision his government takes while blaming the administration for failing to manage the pandemic effectively with a host of glitches and lapses. During the meeting, JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharjee strongly pitched for a complete lockdown. He said, "Although, it would be harsh on the people, the party is of the strong view that a complete lockdown is necessary to break the chain of infection.” Bhattacharjee added that once the lockdown is imposed, its lifting must be done in a phased manner to keep full control over the situation. State finance minister and Congress state president Rameshwar Oraon, on the other hand, said an economic lockdown will not be in the interest of the state and its people. He said, “Economic lockdown is not the answer but we would welcome religious/social lockdown and prevent congregations and gatherings.” Oraon demanded that the Centre must relax the vaccination norms and appealed to state BJP president Deepak Prakash to press for it with the Union government to prevent fatalities among the younger population. He said, “People below 45 years are also affected this time and the Centre must relax the vaccination norms, at least in highly infected areas, to include them in the vaccination drive.” Oraon also reminded Soren that even if the government is forced to go for a lockdown, it must be done sector wise for brief periods and shouldn’t be continuous to ensure that the economic cycle is not halted. “We have to reset up quarantine centres across the state to prevent the spread of the virus like we did during the first wave,” he said. Taking part in the discussion, Prakash assured Soren of full support in the fight against the virus. “Besides strict restrictions, the need of the hour now is to improve the flow of medicines, increase beds in hospitals and proper monitoring of the situation. Currently, everything is in chaos and it has to be streamlined. Some of the immediate to-do lists must be to set up 24x7 helplines, timely testing and providing reports and monitoring of patients in home isolation among others,” he said. Ajsu-P’s chief Sudesh Mahto agreed with the state BJP president and demanded that the state government steps up testing and issue reports on time. “People are not getting test reports for days as a result of which those who are infected but unaware are moving freely and infecting others,” he said. Acknowledging the inputs, Soren said his government is exploring ways to cut the transmission rate and set up more testing facilities to meet the challenges. He also rued the deaths due to the unavailability of beds and said the government is working round the clock to address the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rift-in-ruling-alliance-over-lockdown-bjp-to-back-govt/articleshow/82122559.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand CM seeks help from military docs, infra to battle Covid surge||RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to assign doctors and paramedics, who are working in the military and central paramilitary forces deployed in Jharkhand, for Covid management in the state. Citing that the state is facing a manpower crunch and lacking sufficient infrastructural facilities, Hemant in his letter said, “We are trying to fight the pandemic with whatever resources we have but the number of people required to tackle so many patients is pretty low. A large number of central paramilitary forces like CRPF and SSB have been deployed in Jharkhand to tackle Left-wing extremism and several doctors and paramedics work in these forces. There are two military hospitals in Ranchi and Ramgarh. These resources could be of immense help to us and I request you to direct the home affairs and defence ministries to issue necessary instructions for permitting us to deploy those doctors and paramedics for Covid management here.” He added, “Since mid-March, Jharkhand has been in the middle of a raging second wave of the pandemic and the daily caseload is rising exponentially, as a result of which the healthcare infrastructure is under acute pressure. During the first wave, more than 90% of the patients were asymptomatic and the number of people requiring oxygen support or ventilators was not extremely high. We had anticipated the second wave to be less virulent due to vaccination and herd immunity but it has turned out to be extremely lethal. And the fact that Jharkhand shares its borders with five states and the resultant inter-state movement of people is adding to our woes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-cm-seeks-help-from-military-docs-infra-to-battle-cov-surge/articleshow/82122551.cms||---

The Pune residents pitched in by making meals for her till she got better. Word spread like the aroma of well-cooked dal and soon the couple, who had lost their jobs during the pandemic, was cooking for 40 homes in their area. The menu was simple in keeping with the needs of patients and charges nominal (Rs 40 for breakfast and Rs 100 each for lunch and dinner.) In this pandemic, people have learnt that a hot well-cooked meal comes closest to human touch. And seeing people suffer has stirred many to step out of their comfort zone and do more. Manish Shukla in Lucknow is also part of a husband-wife cooking duo, though neither him nor his wife Pooja have done it professionally before. “About a week ago we started offering tiffin services here. I lost my job as a driver for a travel company recently and we both wanted to serve people as we saw the situation in Lucknow get worse,” he says. They cook for Covid-positive families and Shukla delivers it on his bike, which is why they only deliver within a 10km radius of their home. “It feels nice to be able to help people in this time of need. It doesn’t even feel like I am working.” They charge about Rs 80 for a meal. Some philanthropic citizens have pooled in resources to lend a helping hand. Like Ahmedabad-based Jasubhai Solanki who started a free tiffin service with a couple of friends just a week ago. “We saw so many people struggle to take care of their loved ones. We wanted to do something to relieve their stress a little,” Solanki says. The group delivers about a 100 meals for lunch and dinner that includes a dal, vegetable, rice and roti that is free of charge. People leave messages booking their orders and the food is delivered at their doorstep observing Covid protocols. Kalapi Pariwar, also started by a group of friends in Ahmedabad, is delivering 600 lunch tiffins in 10 areas in the city. The idea came to the group last year when one of them fell sick and could not cook. Says grain store-owner Sudhir Madhwani, “The tiffin my friend started used to get delayed. So we cancelled that service and started one ourselves. We ran it from June last year till August but then shut it when demand came down.” The group resumed a fortnight ago as cases began to spiral. They charge Rs 115 for the meal. Deshpande says what he’s noticed in this second wave is that the weakness people are experiencing is stretching out far more than it used to. “We have a family that was out of quarantine two weeks ago, but they’re still too weak to be able to cook themselves.” Social media has become a significant tool for seeking and offering help, particularly in the last few weeks as the situation gets more dire. Delhi-based Puja Bahri recently tweeted offering her services to people living in and around New Friends Colony and GK in Delhi. What led her to do this was her own experience with Covid. “I got Covid in February and I live alone. I know how difficult it was to manage — you’re too dead to do anything, let alone cook and clean up. Friends and family would send food across which is how I managed,” she says. “I just want to be able to do the same for people. It’s just cooking a bit extra every day. I hope it inspires others to do this in their neighbourhoods as well. People have already started offering to buy the ration for the food I send.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tiffin-samaritans-helping-covid-patients-get-a-home-cooked-meal/articleshow/82124679.cms||Ketaki Desai

In 2020, around 70 adoptions took place, less than half the figure in 2019 (156). The state saw 843 adoptions between 2012 to 2021. Speaking to STOI, Kritika Shukla, director of the women development and child welfare (WD&CW) department, explained that the state has 294 children available for adoption, out which a majority of 163 are identified as children with ‘special needs’. “As of now, total 116 children are sheltered in 14 Sisu Gruhas; among these 116 children, 39 are abandoned or orphan children,” Shukla told STOI. These 116 children are aged between 0 to 6 years. For adoption, officials try to match a prospective parent to a child before she/he reaches the age of six. Sources said that there are around 3,440 prospective adoptive parents (PAPs) registered in the state, and some of them have been in the queue to adopt since 2016. In a bid to increase adoptions during the pandemic, officials are conducting virtual matches for children by adoption committees and virtual court hearings to facilitate the adoption procedure in a smooth and speedy manner. District-wise data from the WD&CW department reveals that Visakhapatnam tops the list with the highest number of children available for adoption at 57 followed by Ongole (53), Chittoor (34) and Guntur (34). Around 68% of the PAPs are matched to adopt a child between 0 to 2 years of age, with the most popular choice being a male child (46%). Girls follow at 30% and the remaining specify no particular choice. Sources said that the time taken to complete an adoption process is mostly dependent upon fulfilling the specific choices of the PAP, followed by the elaborate procedure. “Once a successful matching has been done, complete matching process will be completed in 30 days and the child will be placed under pre-adoption foster care to prospective adoptive parents,” Shukla added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/adoptions-in-ap-drop-55-during-pandemic/articleshow/82121314.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Police acknowledge that there has been a rise in illegal activities in the region. On March 18, rowdy-sheeter Mangaraju was hacked to death by four people allegedly led by a Thunga Gopi near Gujjanagundla centre in broad daylight. Police arrested all four with the help of CCTV footage and found that old rivalries festering over a long time finally came to a tipping point after Gopi had an extra-marital relationship with Mangaraju’s daughter-in-law. On April 3, police foiled an attempted murder of a rowdy-sheeter named Naddi Vamsi Krishna (34). Cops had information that Krishna’s sworn enemy Nagaraju was planning to kill him over a decade-old rivalry after learning that Krishna wanted to eliminate him. Six people were arrested at Pattabhipuram police station limits. On January 3, six people including two rowdy-sheeters killed former TDP-supported sarpanch Puramsetty Ankulu due to old rivalries over territorial domination. All six were arrested on January 21. Overall, at least five such murders involving rowdy-sheeters have taken place in Guntur (urban and rural combined) over the last three months. With a gradual rise in crimes involving rowdy-sheeters, police have started organising counselling sessions for them. Speaking at one such counselling session, Guntur (urban) SP RM Ammi Reddy said that rowdy-sheeters have been categorised in three groups — A, B and C based on the severity of their offences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/5-rowdy-sheeters-killed-in-3-months-is-organised-crime-returning-to-guntur/articleshow/82121421.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

On March 5, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) submitted the voluminous document against several accused, including actor Rhea Chakraborty. “Perused the complaint or chargesheet... The documents are also relied upon by the complainant along with CDR of mobile numbers of Reliance Jio, Vodafone, Airtel, etc. The complainant has relied on digital evidence as well as documentary evidence. Prima facie, allegations in the complaint are well-founded... for taking cognisance of the alleged offences,” the court said. The court had also issued summons against the 33 accused. “As the number of accused in this case is 33, due to Covid-19 circumstances, and to avoid gathering of several persons in court, the production of accused/appearance of the accused has been classified in three categories, as per sections imposed on them and their status as to whether they are in JC (judicial custody) or on bail,” the court had said earlier this month. Subsequently, accused Jinedra Jain and Rahila Furniturewala submitted bail pleas which are pending. Australian architect Paul Bartels, who is out on bail, submitted a discharge plea. The matter was adjourned to Tuesday. In the next stage, the prosecution will submit draft charges. The accused can also submit discharge pleas. The court will then decided which charges, if any, are to be framed against the accused and if any are to be dropped. Once charges are framed, the trial in the case can commence. But if any accused is discharged, proceedings against them end before NDPS court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/charges-on-33-accused-in-ssr-drug-case-well-founded-court/articleshow/82124706.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||India||Private vehicle not ‘public place’ under NDPS Act: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has reiterated that a private vehicle would not come within the expression of a public place under the NDPS Act and different provisions mentioned in the act for private and public place must be followed. Section 42 deals with power of entry, search, seizure and arrest without warrant or authorisation and provides a detailed procedure to follow. Section 43 deals with power of seizure and arrest in public place. While deciding a criminal appeal, a bench of Justices U U Lalit and K M Joseph said that the explanation to Section 43 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act clearly says that a private vehicle would not come within the expression of ‘public place’. In that case, recovery was made from the accused while they were in a jeep at a public place. The Punjab and Haryana high court had held that the case of the accused would be covered by Section 43 of NDPS Act and not by Section 42. Setting aside the HC order, the apex court said that rigor of Section 42 may get lessened in certain situations but in no case, total non-compliance of Section 42 be accepted. “The evidence in the present case clearly shows that the vehicle was not a public conveyance but was a vehicle belonging to the accused. The Registration Certificate of the vehicle, which has been placed on record also does not indicate it to be a Public Transport Vehicle. The explanation to Section 43 shows that a private vehicle would not come within the expression public place as explained in Section 43 of the NDPS Act. On the strength of the decision of this court in Jagraj Singh case, the relevant provision would not be Section 43 of the NDPS Act but the case would come under Section 42 of the NDPS Act,” the bench said. The court acqutted the accused after noting that there was total non-compliance of the requirements of Section 42 of the NDPS Act. “In the circumstances, the courts below fell in error in rejecting the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellants. We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the view taken by the high court and acquit the appellants of the charge levelled against them. The appellants be released forthwith unless their custody is required in connection with any other offence,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/private-vehicle-not-public-place-under-ndps-act-sc/articleshow/82124722.cms||---

The tiger was rescued and shifted to Gorewada Rescue Center in Nagpur. The tiger was hit by an unidentified vehicle while attempting to get across the four-lane highway. Foresters say the animal must be habituated to the route to move from Pench Tiger Reserve to the forest on the other side of the highway as it did not use a small underpass that has been constructed near the spot. The NHAI has constructed two 750m and one 300m underpasses for wildlife movement. Deputy conservator of forest (DyCF) Prabhu Nath Shukla said, “The limping tiger was first sighted at 10am in a road off the highway. After walking a few metres, it sat down under a tree unable to move.” “Our staff kept watch for two hours but the animal stayed put. When they went near the tiger it growled and tried to attack but could not stand up. Though there were no external injuries, the animal had suffered femur fractures,” said ACF Sandeep Giri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pench-tiger-suffers-femur-fracture-in-hit-and-run/articleshow/82124727.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||India||ED hopeful Nirav Modi won’t get relief from UK courts||NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate is hopeful higher courts in UK will turn down fugitive Nirav Modi’s appeals against the order to extradite him, now ratified by the home department of that country. The agency’s optimism stems from the fact that Nirav’s bail applications have been rejected, including by UK’s high court, at least seven times in the past two years. The diamond trader is the prime accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank ‘letter of undertaking’ fraud. In a similar case fought by India in the UK, the high court in London had last year rejected an appeal by Vijay Mallya, the fugitive economic offender and chairman of defunct Kingfisher Airlines, facing extradition on charges of money laundering to the tune of Rs 9,000 crore. A two-judge bench of the UK high court had then upheld the charges framed by India against Mallya and those upheld by the senior district judge in London (through a judgment in December 2018) holding the swasbuckling liquor tycoon guilty of money laundering. After the UK home department cleared extradition of Nirav Modi on Friday, the fugitive diamond trader is left with the option of going in appeal before the high court or later approaching the home department again seeking asylum so that he is spared extradition to India. A senior agency official, however, said that Modi, who has been in prison in London since his arrest in March 2019, has slim chances of success in UK's higher courts. He pointed out how the Westminster Magistrates' court, while allowing his extradition in February, had accepted evidence produced by the Indian agencies that included the fugitive and his associates’ deposits in Swiss banks and in tax havens, laundered from the proceeds of the PNB scam. The fugitive diamond trader had fled India in February 2018, soon after the CBI and ED had registered a case against him for fraud to the tune of $2 billion. His claim of ‘improper’ prison conditions in India as a ground for not being extradited had already been turned down by the district court earlier. This should leave him with little chance of success also with the UK’s home department in case he moves an application for asylum. On Friday UK home secretary Priti Patel had signed his extradition order based on the order of the Westminster Magistrates’ Court, the same court that had in 2018 allowed extradition of Mallya. Nirav Modi, like Mallya, had fled to the UK to evade arrest from the Indian agencies probing the banking fraud and money laundering. However, unlike Mallya, who had obtained bail from a UK court in 2017, Modi was arrested and is in a prison in London. Extradition requests against Modi and his close associates were sent to US, Egypt and UK, before he was traced and arrested in London in March 2019. The ED has so far attached assets of Modi and his relatives to the tune of Rs 1,800 crore, including Rs 970 crore of assets seized and attached in Hong Kong, Switzerland, UK, USA, Singapore and UAE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-hopeful-nirav-modi-wont-get-relief-from-uk-courts/articleshow/82124743.cms||Pradeep Thakur

Kunwar said a challan regarding this is required to be submitted in the court of competent jurisdiction, as mentioned in the first challan presented on May 27, 2019, pertaining to FIR number 129/2018 of Kotkapura city police station. The IG also mentioned that another challan is required to be filed in FIR No. 130/2015 in the Behbal Kalan firing case. He further said that a closure report has to be filed in FIR number 129/2015 in Behbal Kalan case as per the SIT’s investigation and added that he stood by each and every sentence of the nine challans presented in the court. Kunwar also wrote that he had been subjected to “threats as well as coercive and abusive language” by Shiromani Akali Dal leaders Sukhbir Badal and Bikram Singh Majitha, but it did not deter him from the "righteous and rightful path". He emphasised said that nothing had been done regarding this by the office of advocate general, Punjab despite his informing the competent authority. Referring to the spate of writ petitions in the high court, he says, "I can only say that trial of a case is the yardstick/ benchmark of an investigation conducted by an investigating officer or an investigating agency. As regards to the contents and veracity of the challans, I can only say that any decision should be made on merit of the cases and material produced before the trial court. The legal team of the state of Punjab has also been briefed from time to time." The IG said that on reading of the gist of these writ petitions, it has come to fore that point interalia challenged by the petitioners is challan by one person (Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh), pertaining to Section 173(8) of the Code of Criminal procedure/ further investigation/ reinvestigation/fresh investigation, an order of 2013 about his integrity and impartiality, a letter on June 26, 2020, to Faridkot district judge with comments about a judge being close to a political family and the Election Commission of India’s reference of April 5, 2019. He also gave details of the case diaries, saying that every challan/charge sheet submitted under his signature on behalf of the SIT bears proper sanction from the competent authority including prosecution sanction from the department of home affairs & justice, Punjab. As regards personal integrity and competence, the IG wrote, " It is a matter of record that I have been entrusted with numerous investigations suo moto by the high court and the state government and the same has been appreciated in various orders and judgments". Shiromani Akali Dal spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema, when contacted, said, "… He could not substantiate the facts in investigations due to which the court has quashed this… Censure from ECI was not enough that now high court has to give directions to not include him in the SIT, which is enough to describe his intentions."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ig-kunwar-sit-examined-badals-in-2018-challan-needs-to-be-filed/articleshow/82122709.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Mumbai||168 patients from six Mumbai hospitals shifted as oxygen supply falters||MUMBAI: Shortage of oxygen hit the city’s public health system hard as 168 Covid-19 patients—including 40 critical ones—from six municipal hospitals were shifted in an overnight operation to bigger facilities between Friday evening and Saturday morning. The six include Bhabha hospitals (Bandra and Kurla), Bhagwati Hospital (Borivli), Shatabdi Hospital (Govandi), M T Agarwal Hospital (Mulund) and Trauma Hospital (Jogeshwari). Messages were sent on various NGO helplines to get cardiac ambulances to move the patients; finally, each ambulance had to make multiple trips. “In six to eight hours, we completed the transfers,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The supply in the city was disrupted for a few days due to a mishap in one of the plants. ‘Hospitals should limit indiscriminate O 2 use’As we didn’t want anything untoward to happen due to depleting levels of oxygen at these hospitals, we decided to move some patients to bigger centres as a precautionary measure,” said Kakani. The city needs 235 metric tonne of oxygen a day for patient care. The oxygen situation is so precarious the BMC has started pushing hospitals to use it rationally. The state’s Covid task force has already asked doctors to use ventilation mechanisms that use less oxygen. “Giving oxygen to a patient who doesn’t need it, too, can harm him or her. We have to decide who will benefit,” said a doctor who was a part of the BMC’s virtual training programme on Saturday for hospitals on rational use of oxygen. Kakani said hospitals cannot wait until the last minute to announce they are short on oxygen. “Calling one or two hours before the supply runs out won’t help. Hospitals have to quantify their requirements over days and tie up with multiple supply agencies so that they have a backup plan,” he said. Patients from Bandra’s Bhabha Hospital were moved in batches from Friday night itself. A senior medical officer from HWest Ward said 25 out of the 35 patients moved were on oxygen support and the rest on bipap support. “They were shifted as a precautionary measure as oxygen was almost on the verge of depletion in the hospital,” said BMC H-West Ward medical officer Dr Sanjay Funde. The patients were shifted to BKC and Dahisar facilities and Rajawadi. Bandra corporator Asif Zakeria said it was a trying experience for patients who needed cardiac ambulance for the transfer. Some others who were critical were not shifted until later as the authorities feared the movement would affect them. “Bhabha is one of the largest public hospitals and if that is running out of oxygen too, it is a matter of concern,” said Zakeria. From Shatabdi Hospital, Govandi, 44 patients were moved. Ward M-East’s medical officer Dr Alka Mane said the patients were moved to the Mulund Covid centre, Rajawadi and BKC. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar, who visited various civic hospitals, directed the municipal administration to set up a liquid oxygen plant in its hospitals to find a permanent solution to shortages. She directed an oxygen plant be set up at Shatabdi and Bhagwati start. In Ghatkopar, BJP MLA Parag Shah said, “Some hospitals such as Zynova and Hindu Mahasabha are running out of oxygen.” Shah said those who want to get tested are not getting an appointment, those who get tested are not getting reports on time, if a person is positive, there are no beds, if they get a bed, there is no oxygen, and if one dies, there is a queue for cremation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/168-patients-from-six-mumbai-hospitals-shifted-as-oxygen-supply-falters/articleshow/82124752.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Not necessary to reach hospital in ambulance’||AHMEDABAD: The Jadav family of Ghatlodia on Friday lost the head of their family as they waited for an EMRI 108 ambulance to take him to the hospital. “He was taken to an AMCrun hospital in a private vehicle on Thursday when he started getting breathless. But they were denied, and my daughter was told they cannot admit patients coming on their own,” said his wife Rajshree. “We had to use all our might to get an ambulance from Viramgam so that we could take him to Civil Hospital. The call we had made to 108 at 9pm got answered at 12 noon the next day when he had passed away.” Amid rapid rise in the Covid-19 cases in the city and elsewhere in the state, the blaring EMRI 108 ambulances are getting to be a common sight on city roads. But both the emergency services officials and members of public are under duress as several hospitals are denying admissions to patients who are not coming through the services. Jashvant Prajapati, COO, EMRI Gujarat, said that there is no such rule for the ambulances. “We of course are collaborating with authorities like Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to help find the patients a bed. But we are not aware of such a norm,” he said. EMRI officials said that the ambulance also doesn’t guarantee hospitalization. Sources said that in several instances they had to go from one hospital to another as the patients could not find oxygen or ventilator beds. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that the member hospitals have no such rule. “How can any hospital deny patients admission irrespective of the mode they came into? Role of ambulances is to provide stability to the patients before they get admitted, but the wait for ambulances can sometimes also prove critical,” he said. Dr Rakesh Joshi, additional medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that they have not made any such rule. “We are admitting patients who are coming on their own for long,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-not-necessary-to-reach-hospital-in-ambulance/articleshow/82124749.cms||---

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak also directed the police commissioner to deploy necessary staff near hospitals and pharmaceutical stores to avoid any untoward incident. The HC called on for setting up to Dedicated Covid Centres at IGGMCH, GMCH, and AIIMS considering large number of patients approaching these hospitals. Earlier, the intervenor Dr Shishir Kolhe through counsel Tushar Mandlekar pointed out discrimination towards Vidarbha by government. He claimed that it supplied double Remdesvir doses to Thane in comparison to patients numbers, but in Nagpur, it sent 3,326 vials for 8,250 beds citing shortage. The application was filed in a suo motu PIL based on TOI report where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed as amicus curiae. Mandlekar argued that the government has made discriminatory allocation of Remdesvir Injection to the patients in Nagpur. On April 13 and 18, there was no supply of this life saving injection in the city. He accused the government of deliberately Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/supply-10000-remdesvir-doses-to-nagpur-urgently-hc-state-govt/articleshow/82144702.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

In a statement that called the police action “draconian and undemocratic”, the Guild said police had forbidden journalists from reporting live encounters with militants “on the specious plea that it is ‘likely to incite violence’ or that it can promote ‘anti-national sentiment’”. “Nothing can be further from the truth. Visibly, police are giving an impression of trying to maintain peace by attempting to control the fallout of violence in a high strung environment, but what is being instead done is an attempt by the security forces to escape from any kind of media scrutiny about the flow of events behind the violence,” the Guild said in a statement. It also said live reporting was one of the most important journalistic duties of any responsible media. The EGI said police may at best issue some guidelines with respect to reporting from such scenes, “with the aim of protecting the integrity of tactics and plans of security agencies” and also to prevent journalists from interfering with the evolving situation and from sensationalising the issue that could stir up emotions at the audiences’ end. Referring to the Kashmir police order as one that flew in the face of the stellar role that journalists in the country have played in covering conflict, the Guild also said police must withdraw the order immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/revoke-advisory-on-covering-shootouts-egi-tells-jammu-and-kashmir-cops/articleshow/82124757.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Refinery will lead to pollution and deprive farmers of water||Sanjay KhadakkarNAGPUR: After the Shiv Sena strongly opposed the proposed oil refinery at Nanar in Konkan, there’s a demand from some quarters to shift it to Vidarbha. It’s an ambitious project between the IOC, HPCL and BPCL and Saudi Arabian petroleum giant Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. An oil refinery or petroleum refinery is an industrial/chemical processing plant where crude oil is converted into petrol, gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and jet fuel. In India, there are 24 oil refineries out of which only three are private. The project is not only infeasible for Vidarbha, but would prove to be a big health hazard for citizens here due to pollution. It would require huge land of farmers and also the water used for their fields. Already, the region’s irrigation backlog is 1.60 hectares. When our farmers are not getting water for their crops, from where the government will provide water for the refinery? Already, Vidarbha has so many power plants that produce 59% of Maharashtra’s power. All these plants consume a lot of water, leaving the poor farmers in lurch. Moreover, what’s the guarantee that only the youth of Vidarbha will benefit? Just under the pretext of creating employment opportunities, farmers’ land can’t be put at stake. It is better to bring information technology (IT) parks, health cities and textile parks that can create job opportunities along with economic consideration and without risk of pollution. Also when there are talks about bringing in solar powered vehicles by 2030, then why the need for a refinery in Vidarbha? In fact, it will be feasible to set up the refinery in neighbouring Marathwada which is relatively closer to the coast than Vidarbha. Today, we import more than 80% of India’s crude oil which comes by sea. If a refinery comes to Vidarbha, the crude oil will have to cross a distance of 700km by road from the coast. How financially viable will it be for the government? It might provide employment, but it involves heating and chemical processes, which pollute the environment. Chemical emissions cause air pollution due to toxic gases released. These gases are harmful and can cause serious health problems. Research shows children in schools next to refineries are 40 % more likely to have respiratory problems than others. It’s economically feasible to have a refinery where there is a large customer base for petrol, diesel, oil and aviation fuel. Most of the world’s population lives in big cities in coastal areas. So, most of the refineries in the world are on or off the coast. Refineries use large amounts of steam and cold water. Generally, one barrel (159 litres) of crude oil requires 1.5 barrels of water to process. That's why most of the oil refineries are on the beach, where the river meets the sea, so they can take advantage of the water and also for transportation.

---||Delhi||24,000 Covid-19 cases & 167 deaths: Situation grave, says Delhi CM||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday painted a grim picture of the escalating Covid crisis in the capital, saying it was turning quite serious and the city was facing a shortage of beds despite making efforts to increase availability. In the past 24 hours, the city recorded 24,375 fresh cases and 167 deaths, he said. The positivity rate has now crossed 24%, meaning that one in every four persons being tested for the infection is turning out to be positive. Delhi has reported more than 100 deaths in a day for four consecutive days - 104 on Wednesday, 112 on Thursday, 141 on Friday and a fresh high of 167 on Saturday. The CM said he had called up Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and requested that the Centre makes more beds available for the city at AIIMS, Safdarjung and other hospitals. He also expressed concern over shortage of oxygen and drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, warning hoarders that they would face serious action. Govt to act against labs delaying test reportsReferring to reports that many labs were delaying RT-PCR reports, the CM said while addressing a press conference that labs were picking up samples 3-4 times their capacity and hence the reports were getting delayed. He said his government will take action against such labs. Kejriwal said the weekend curfew had got a good response and his government will constantly review the situation to take more steps if required. In the next 3-4 days, Delhi government will be adding 6,000 oxygen beds to its health infrastructure across various facilities. Kejriwal said his government has been receiving multiple complaints of hospitals denying beds to patients. He threatened action against hospitals that are providing wrong information on the government Covid app or on phone. The government has, meanwhile, asked officials to carry out raids and take strict action against those found hoarding medicines or indulging in blackmarketeering. “In the past 24 hours, over 24,000 new cases have been reported in Delhi. The positivity rate is over 24%. The situation is quite grave. Now, there is a shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir in Delhi,” Kejriwal said. “Since the cases are increasing rapidly, the facilities that we thought would be enough, based on our assessment 3-4 days ago, are falling short. Today, there is a shortage of oxygen, Remdesivir, and Tocilizumab. Any health infrastructure has its limits. In Delhi, too, there are limited ICU beds. The oxygen and ICU beds are getting depleted fast," the CM said, adding that the government was trying to make more beds available. "About 1,300 beds are being arranged at the Yamuna Sports Complex and Commonwealth Games Complex. At the Radha Soami Satsang Beas, we had arranged for 2,500 beds initially and are now adding another 2,500 beds. We have been successful in coming up with 2,100 oxygen beds by attaching banquet halls and hotels to hospitals. This will be highlighted in the app by tomorrow or the day after. These would be within the overall purview of the hospital. I hope that in this manner, we will be able to add 6,000 more beds in the next two to four days," said the CM. Before the recent surge, the results of Covid tests were out within 24 hours, but now the reports are getting delayed. "For the past few days, it has been noticed that results are taking three to four days. The reason behind this is that some labs have started taking more samples than their actual capacity," said Kejriwal, adding that this could be dangerous for Covid patients. "You are playing with their lives. Strict action will be taken against labs that collect more samples than their actual capacity and do not provide the report within 24 hours,” he said. The government has asked all district magistrates to check whether a lab has any pending sample before more samples are sent to them. Delhi government has an app that shows the number of occupied or vacant beds at a particular hospital, on a realtime basis. “We do not directly operate this app. Each hospital has been given a password and updates data in the app on its own. So, if a particular hospital has stated that it has 40 beds available in the app and then turns away patients, strict action will be taken against it," Kejriwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/24000-covid-19-cases-167-deaths-situation-grave-says-delhi-cm/articleshow/82124778.cms||Alok KN Mishra

While Trinamool sought action for “violation of the right to privacy” and under various sections of the Indian Telegraph Act, IT Act and the IPC, the BJP demanded a probe into “how and by whom the tape was made viral to solicit votes on religious lines, which is prohibited under the model code of conduct”. In its written complaint to EC, a Trinamool delegation — comprising leaders like Yashwant Sinha, Derek O’Brien and Purnendu Basu — said the purported telephonic conversation between chief minister Mamata Banerjee and the party’s Sitalkuchi candidate Partha Pratim Ray was played by the BJP at its office in the presence of BJP’s IT cell in-charge Amit Malviya and its MP Locket Chatterjee. “In the said conference, it has been alleged that in the aftermath of the CISF firing in Sitalkuchi, Mamata Banerjee had a conversation with Partha Pratim Ray. The BJP has not only illegally recorded and/or caused it to be recorded, but also played it at a press conference out of context. The entire exercise by the BJP is an illegal act and is a direct assault on legal rights, including the right to privacy of Mamata Banerjee and Partha Pratim Ray,” the TMC complaint said. “For such gross violation and the consequences of the said act of BJP, necessary steps for prosecution under criminal law shall be taken separately,” it added. A BJP delegation of Swapan Dasgupta, Ashwini Vaishnaw, Shishir Bajoria and Shoumendu Mukherji, meanwhile, met Bengal’s chief electoral officer in Kolkata. “It is apposite to mention that Banerjee has been repeatedly making statements to divide the electorate on religious lines. On Friday, an audio conversation surfaced in the public domain. The video has been made viral intentionally by fellow partymen of Banerjee. The intent is to secure their political interest by polarizing the votes of a particular community on religious lines,” the delegation said in its complaint. The BJP also alleged that the release of private conversation between two individuals showed a deep-rooted conspiracy. “The time of release of the alleged audio is significant. Further, the admission regarding the authenticity of alleged audio in the AITC press conference reflects their intent,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-bjp-move-ec-for-probe-into-leaked-tape/articleshow/82122560.cms||---

District civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak said, "Five ventilator beds have been sent to Ranchi on the direction of state government.” The move sending of ventilator beds, however, is criticised by residents and political leaders, including local BJP MLA Biranchi Narayan, as Bokaro is among the three severely hit districts of the state. Criticising the district administration's move, Narayan said Bokaro has not been utilising the beds to treat patients from the district. He has also written to DC Rajesh Singh for effective utilisation of beds. He said, "It is very painful that the district health department is sending the ventilator beds when Covid patients in Bokaro are searching for beds and other facilities." Department sources said since the start of the pandemic in the state last year, the state government had sent 25 ventilator beds to the Bokaro sadar hospital. The beds are bought with the PMCares fund to be used in ICUs and ICCUs of the hospital and provide at least one each to the community health centres at the block level. Nine months back, a 10-bed ICU was inaugurated but became functional on Thursday this week when the state government asked to return the unutilised beds. Another 10 beds were donated to the Bokaro General Hospital (BGH) which already has about 15 such beds. The remaining five beds were set up at the ANM Covid care centre where asymptomatic are treated. It practically meant that the ventilators beds are not utilised as government-run hospitals refer serious patients to BGH. Even after the ICU at the sadar hospital becomes functional two days ago, the doctors at the hospital said the unit will not be used for Covid patients. The hospital's deputy superintendent, Dr Renu Bharti, said the ICU will be utilized only for general patients. Even after ICU of Sadar Hospital becomes functional two days ago, the doctors in Sadar Hospitals has claimed that it will not be used for Covid patients. There will be no corona patients admitted in ICU of Sadar Hospital, said Renu Bharti, deputy superintendent of Sadar Hospital, she added that this ICU will be for general patients. Sources said that there is no surgery department even the medicine department is not getting much serious patients in Sadar Hospital. In past two days span since ICU become functional in Sadar Hospital only a single patients has been treated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bokaro-sends-5-ventilator-beds-to-ranchi/articleshow/82122060.cms||Divy Khare

---||Kolkata||Didi doing politics with the dead: PM Narendra Modi||ASANSOL/GANGARAMPUR: PM Narendra Modi has accused CM Mamata Banerjee of “doing politics with the dead”.  This was “an old habit” of Banerjee, Modi said on Saturday, a day after the BJP released an audio tape of a purported conversation between the Bengal CM and Trinamool Sitalkuchi candidate Partha Pratim Ray immediately after the April 10 CISF firing that killed four people. “The tapes reveal how Didi is asking a Trinamool leader to keep the bodies. She is heard saying the party will take out a rally with the bodies. The tapes show how Didi is trying to benefit from the unfortunate deaths,” Modi said at a rally in Asansol in West Burdwan as residents of neighbouring East Burdwan went to vote. This time, however, the strategy would not work because people of Bengal had “formed a morcha” against Didi, Modi said, adding: “The Trinamool has been broken into pieces after four phases of polls. Didi and bhatija (nephew) will be vanquished after eight phases. She is perturbed because her team is not being able to cast chhappa votes,” he added. “People have not been able to forget how their rights were taken away during the 2018 panchayat poll. Trinamool packed 20,000 panchayats with extortionists. And candidates who won even after all this had to take shelter outside the state. But that will not happen this time. That is why Didi is afraid. Chitto jetha bhoye akranto (Where the mind lives in fear),” Modi said, inverting Tagore’s “Chitto jetha bhoy shunyo (Where the mind is without fear)”. Modi listed date-wise in South Dinajpur’s Gangarampur how Banerjee was abusing him. “Tum sala khuni ka raja, the CM told me on March 26. This is an insult to the rich tradition, culture and language of Bengal. Do you approve of this kind of language against the PM?” Modi asked. “Didi is arrogant. She looks down on others. She bunks the PM’s meetings with CMs on corona. She does not attend Niti Ayog meetings. She is above the Constitution. She does not cooperate when central teams come here to help the state government. She slams central forces, puts pressure on the Election Commission and makes false charges against the armed forces,” the PM accused Banerjee. He then accused the Trinamool government of “standing as a wall” between Bengal’s poor and a union government that wanted to transfer benefits to them. “But now confrontation will end, cooperation will start,” he added. The PM pointed out how a Trinamool leader had insulted the Matuas and Namasudras — disciples of Guruchand Thakur and Harichand Takur and followers of Yogendra Nath Mandal — and called them “beggars”. “Didi did not say a word to that Trinamool leader,” he added. Modi told the gathering how a BJP government in Bengal would start granting citizenship to refugees after May 2. “Why is Didi opposing citizenship to refugees? But do not worry, the BJP government in Bengal will grant you citizenship after May 2. People have formed a morcha against Didi. They will give you the ‘former CM certificate’,” he said. Union home minister Amit Shah, too, held election rallies in North Dinajpur’s Chopra and North 24 Parganas’ Amdanga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-doing-politics-with-the-dead-modi/articleshow/82122955.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||Kolkata||Fall in turnout on city fringes, less violence in Bengal’s fifth phase||Kolkata: The fifth phase of polling in Bengal on Saturday saw a marked decline in voter turnout on the city’s fringes, but the day, coming in the wake of the Sitalkuchi incident of the fourth phase, also saw a dip in violence. The turnout figures till 5pm in the immediate vicinity of the city — places like Bidhannagar, Rajarhat-New Town, Dum Dum, Baranagar and Barasat — were much lower, compared with that of the 2016 assembly polls. The overall turnout till 6pm was reported around 78.4%. In the final count, it may still exceed that of the fourth phase (79.9%), but it’s expected to be lower than the average turnout of the first three phases (around 85%). Interestingly, there was a widening gap in the rural and urban voting pattern, with the 23 seats in Jalpaiguri, Nadia and Burdwan (East) recording over 80% polling by 5pm. These three districts accounted for a bulk of the 21 reserved seats that saw polling on Saturday. Phase five, during which 45 seats went to the polls, did see sporadic incidents of violence, but it had little impact on voter queues at booths. However, an injury to Kamarhati BJP candidate Raju Banerjee — allegedly after some goons threw stones at his car — and sporadic clashes in Shantinagar, off Kolkata, added to the rising temperature. The Election Commission intervened and later stepped up Banerj-ee’s security. At Baranagar, BJP candidate Parno Mittra was gheraoed by Trinamool Congress supporters while she was trying to enter booth No. 78 at Alambazar. Bengal chief electoral officer Ariz Afrab said 23 people were arrested in specific cases statewide and 100 were held preventively. According to the EC, most violence was reported from the fiercely fought eight Nadia assembly segments. Trinamool had trailed BJP in each of the eight seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Pockets of violence were reported in Gayeshpur and Shantipur as well. CEO Aftab said that in Chakdah, independent candidate Kaushik Bhoumik was arrested with a firearm. “He was found going around a polling booth with a country-made gun tucked in his trousers and he dropped it when intercepted by central forces,” Aftab said. In another incident, TMC worker Haran Baul (18) was injured with bullet wounds in Shantipur. He was hospitalised. An hour later, central force jawans rescued a youth, a BJP supporter, who was tied up with a rope and his mouth stuffed, at a place near the point where the shooting occurred. Tempers ran high after a complaint reached the EC that central forces had fired in the air to disperse a mob at Deganga’s Karalgacha. The incident was reported at booth No. 215 at Karalgacha Primary School. The poll panel denied any such incident. “After getting information about firing, we looked into the matter but nothing such happened. We haven’t got anything to establish the incident,” said Sumit Gupta, DM, North 24 Parganas. At Kamarhati’s Ariadaha, Abhijeet Samanta alias Paltu, a 43-year-old polling agent of an independent candidate, died inside booth No. 107 at Nawdapara Sripati Viddyaniketan during polling. “He suddenly fell seriously ill inside the booth after suffering a heart attack. He was rushed to the Sagore Dutta Medical College and hospital, where he was declared brought dead,” said Rintu Dey, his friend. The EC has sought a report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fall-in-turnout-on-city-fringes-less-violence-in-bengals-fifth-phase/articleshow/82122910.cms||---
---||Kolkata||PM Narendra Modi ‘intercepting’ my calls: Mamata Banerjee||KATWA: CM Mamata Banerjee on Saturday accused PM Narendra Modi of “intercepting” her phone calls. “Don’t you have any shame that you intercept a CM’s phone? You should resign as PM,” Banerjee said. The Criminal Investigation Department had been asked to track down the person/s responsible for intercepting her telephone conversations, she said, adding that even Modi was within the ambit of the inquiry. His statements at the Asansol rally on Saturday were a direct “admission” that CMs were under telephone surveillance, Banerjee said, adding: “The probe will not exclude you. You must respond (to this surveillance allegation) or resign.” Banerjee’s response to the audio tape released by the BJP followed the line Trinamool took on Friday, when it did not deny the voice heard on the tape was hers and said putting CMs’ telephones under surveillance did not match the Centre’s stated stand in Parliament.  “We may be politically opposed to you but we at least value the chair you occupy,” Banerjee said, reminding Modi that even the Supreme Court had upheld the right to privacy. “I never said anything wrong (on the tape). They killed those children. They were barely 20-25. I had said keep the bodies... I would go the next day. How could I have gone that day? Could I have gone there on election day? I am not a Cooch Behar voter. So I said to keep the bodies. It is true that I wanted to go there. I had also told the media that I will go to Sitalkuchi the next day. But then the Election Commission said I could not go there for 72 hours. What does it prove? Does it prove anything at all?” she asked. “People understand who has encouraged this (putting my phone under surveillance) when the PM of the country himself refers to the tape,” the Bengal CM said in her first public response to the leaked tape. Banerjee, attacking Modi for peddling lies and having mistaken priorities, said: “The country is witnessing an emergency because of rising Covid cases. And he is electioneering in Bengal.” She also iterated her allegations against the “politisation” of central forces. “They have been photographed sharing a meal with a BJP candidate. I would appeal to central forces to work impartially. People will go to court against you if you foment trouble. Do not heed BJP leaders. They will not stand by you. You will have to keep coming here (if people lodge cases). A case has been lodged in the Sitalkuchi incident,” Banerjee said before repeating that she “respected central forces”. The Election Commission campaign curbs were aimed at restricting the Trinamool Congress, Banerjee said. “They reduced four days of campaign time. Why? Because BJP leaders did not have any programmes then while I had scheduled programmes. Polling is moving towards urban localities but the EC has stopped evening meetings, when urban localities have public meetings after dusk because mornings are spent in door-to-door campaigning. Why? I suggested you club the last three phases. There is a 2020 Supreme Court order on this. But this was ignored,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pm-intercepting-my-calls-mamata/articleshow/82123038.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||Ranchi||Govt procures equipment to increase ventilator, oxygen beds at Rims||RANCHI: In order to increase the strength of oxygen and ventilator-supported beds at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), the state government procured 70 high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) cannula and equipment for 30 more ventilator beds. On Saturday, a consignment with all necessary items reached Ranchi’s Birsa Munda Airport from Delhi. This comes in the backdrop of several instances of Covid-19 patients dying outside hospitals, including Rims and Ranchi sadar hospital, due to lack of availability of beds. Currently, the active caseload of the virus in the district stands at 9,400. In order to ease out patients’ woes of hunting for Covid beds in the city, the district administration had also launched a dashboard to check availability of beds. However, the initiative failed to help out in the hour of crisis as the data was not realtime. It was also found that the dashboard showed availability of Covid beds at a particular private hospital, but when TOI tried to confirm the same, the healthcare facility said they are yet to begin treatment of infected people. In a meeting on Friday, chief minister Hemant Soren was informed about the arrival of the consignment. Soren asked officials to ensure at least 100 ventilator-supported beds at Rims. According to sources, the CM also expressed unhappiness on the way the officials are handling the crisis in the state capital and was said to have pulled up a couple of them during the meeting. On being contacted, a senior official of the state health department confirmed all the equipment will be sent to Rims on a priority basis. Currently, Rims has 48 ventilator beds. Sources said more such orders have been placed and the consignments are expected to reach the state soon. Meanwhile, state health minister Banna Gupta reached Rims on Saturday afternoon and inspected the three-storey multi-level car parking area which will be converted into a makeshift hospital for Covid-19 patients. Banna along with Ranchi deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan inspected the area and held discussions with senior officials of the hospital. Banna said, “The car parking will be converted into a 300-bed Covid Care Centre to treat patients. I have also instructed officials to ensure installation of an oxygen plant for the upcoming centre so that we don’t face any shortage once the centre is ready.” On the shortage of nurses and support staff, the minister said he has asked the hospital administration to hire additional manpower immediately and ensure patients do not face inconvenience. INSET Mumbai/Pune: The Maharashtra Covid-19 task force last week advised hospitals to discontinue the use of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) cannula as it guzzles oxygen and instead use non-invasive ventilation while treating Covid-19 patients with respiratory distress. Maharashtra is using up almost all of the 1250 MT oxygen that is produced in the state daily. Mumbai’s 150 Covid hospitals are currently utilising around 235 metric tonnes of oxygen daily. Civic chief I S Chahal said that the supply currently meets the demand, but looking at the trajectory of the pandemic, a demand for more supply has already been conveyed to the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-procures-equipment-to-increase-ventilator-oxygen-beds-at-rims/articleshow/82122076.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The arrested persons are identified as Manoj Bhagat, Anmol Singhania, Nazmi Hasan, Wasim Ahmad and Zashim Ahmad. A car and a motorcycle used in the crime along with mobile phones were also seized from the arrested persons. The loot took place on April 12 when the five criminals accosted trader Subham Agrawal along with three others, including his partner Nikesh Mishra, was about to leave for Odisha from his rented house in Obaria road under Jagannathpur police station. Soon after getting the information, police registered a case under Section 392 of IPC based on the statement of Agrawal and formed a special investigation (SIT) team under Hatia ASP Vineet Kumar to probe the crime. The SIT arrested the criminals from different areas of Ranchi, including Pandra and Chutia. Ranchi SSP Surendra Jha said, "The SIT gathered inputs from CCTV cameras and technical cells to ascertain the identities of the culprits and nab them. Anmol had prior information that Mishra would be moving out with the money." Further investigation and raids are going on to nab one more accused in the case. SP (city) Saurav said they are expecting to recover the remaining amount of the money soon. In another development, SP (rural) Naushad Alam reviewed the law and order in his jurisdiction like verification of criminals, solving of property-related cases, raids on gambling and liquor centres and crime against women. Alam also asked his officers to enforce the government directives related to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/5-arrested-in-rs-1-crore-loot-case-in-city/articleshow/82122047.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Deepak Kumar (40), who worked at the fire brigade department of Tata Steel. He was brought to Jamshedpur on Friday and sent to the jail on Saturday. Forty-year-old fireman told police during interrogation that he actually wanted to kill his friend Roshan and his uncle Prabhu Sao for allegedly cheating him in a transport business and causing him lossed in lakhs. However, his plot, inspired by a couple of Hindi web series, failed and he instead killed his 33-year-old wife, two daughters aged 15 and seven, and their tuition teacher on April 12. SSP M Tamil Vanan said, “Kumar had invited Roshan for lunch with an aim to eliminate him at his home. Knowing well that he would get caught and in a bid to save his family members from problems in the future, he first killed his wife and daughters and dumped their body in a room. Around noon, when his daughters’ tuition teacher arrived, he asked for her scooter’s keys as he had planned to reach Prabhu’s house in Sopodera on it. She refused to hand over the keys and, while trying to escape, spoted the corpses of his wife and daughters. Kumar then overpowered the teacher and raped her before bludgeoning her to death.” Vanan added, “When Roshan arrived with his wife and brother-in-law, Kumar saw his plan failing. But when Aradhya and Ankit went to the washroom, Kumar tried to kill Roshan. On hearing Roshan scream, the duo came to his aid and managed to escape from the house.” Kumar fled from the house on his bike and later hired a cab and between April 12 and April 16, travelling to Rourkela and Puri in Odisha.

---||India||Maharashtra records another high with 67,123 new infections||MUMBAI: The state reported 67,123 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, the highest-ever for a day since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year. The state also reported a surge in fatalities, with 419 deaths, the highest in nearly 200 days since October 2, when 424 deaths were recorded. It was the first time in months that the deaths crossed the 400 mark. The total caseload in the state reached 37.7 lakh and deaths touched 59,970. In Mumbai, cases continued to be under 9,000 for the third consecutive day with 8,811 detections on Saturday. Deaths in the city were high at 51, taking the toll since March 2020 to 12,301. The tally has so far reached 5.7 lakh. “Although many presume that Mumbai has reached the peak, we want to look at the daily caseload for another week before agreeing,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said. Dr Ishwar Gilada, public health expert and secretary general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild, said that the state was nearing its peak or was already at the peak. As per the data compiled by him, the state has reported a 4.7-fold jump in daily detections in the last 30 days, as against states like UP and Bihar, which reported 226- and 142-fold jump, respectively. The new cases in Maharashtra on March 10 were 13,659, which had gone up to 63,729 on Friday, April 16. Although social media has many messages seeking beds, oxygen and the antiviral remdesivir for patients, Kakani said the city had adequate facilities. The city has over 20,456 beds, with almost 20% of these vacant. “The fact that Mumbai has enough beds is borne out by the fact that we could between Friday evening and Saturday night transfer 168 patients, 40 of whom were critical, from six BMC hospitals to our bigger centres,” Kakani said. The second wave has affected the affluent in contrast to the first wave that swept across slums. “As most patients coming in now are affluent, they prefer private beds,” a BMC official said. Private hospital beds have risen from 4,800 in the first wave to 6,610 now. While the recovery rate in the city has fallen from 96% in January to 82%, the doubling rate has improved from 33 days a week ago to 44 days on Saturday. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region reported 17,975 cases and 85 deaths on Saturday. Nashik division reported 108 deaths, the most in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-records-another-high-with-67123-new-infections/articleshow/82124817.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||India||States rush to test Kumbh returnees||NEW DELHI: Fearing that Kumbh Mela returnees may turn Covid ‘super spreaders’, several states have decided to screen the pilgrims and quarantine them if needed. Maharashtra government on Saturday held talks with railway authorities on curbs for pilgrims returning from Haridwar. Self-quarantining and possible rapid antigen tests are being considered, senior officials said. “RT-PCR testing of those returning is difficult to consider given the shortage of kits and the lag in results,” a senior official said.Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said those returning from Kumbh Mela should be quarantined at their own expense. After the Gujarat government announced that all Kumbh returnees will be screened, the Western Railway authorities tested around 330 passengers, of which 33 tested positive. Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani told reporters earlier in the day,“Every returnee will be RT-PCR tested and if found positive, will be isolated for 14 days.” A day after a Kumbh-returnee sadhu died of Covid in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Chouhan on Saturday ordered to screen and quarantine all those returning from Haridwar. In Jabalpur, officials identified two dozen people and three disciples who had come in contact with the sadhu who died on Friday. The three disciples have tested positive for Covid-19. There are reports of the head of a wellknown temple in Bhopal being hospitalized with Covid after returning from Kumbh. On Thursday, Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar urged those returning from Kumbh to stay in home quarantine and get tested. “They can go back to their routine only if they test negative.” However, health experts have said everyone who went to the Kumbh Mela must stay in home quarantine for 14 days even if found negative.

---||India||As cases surge, Ayodhya administration calls off Ram Navami Mela||AYODHYA: The Ayodhya district administration decided on Saturday to call off the April 21 Ram Navami Mela due to the lethal Covid surge in Uttar Pradesh coupled with fervent appeals from senior Ayodhya seers. The mela witnesses a mammoth gathering at Ram Janmabhoomi and the banks of the Saryu on the last day of Navratra. Ayodhya’s borders will be sealed and nobody will be allowed to enter. Mahant Jugal Kishore Sharan Shastry, the chief priest of Saryu Kunj temple, said, “Holding the Haridwar kumbh was a big mistake and we cannot afford a repeat in Ayodhya.” The fear was compounded by the surge in Covid cases at the Haridwar Kumbh. The district administration directed devotees to celebrate Ram Navami at home and curtailed pilgrim presence at temples. District magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha told TOI, “Our priority is to break the corona chain. We have banned all gatherings in Ayodhya.” The administration has ensured low-key celebrations in the town. Ram Ki Paidi, on the banks of the Saryu, which would be crammed with pilgrims at least 10 days before Ram Navami, wears a deserted look. Bathing in the Saryu has been banned and entry points to the river barricaded. Acharya Satyendra Das, chief priest of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple, said, “There will be only one priest, on-duty policemen and Ram Lalla Virajman.” This is the second year Ram Navami celebrations have been scrapped due to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-cases-surge-ayodhya-administration-calls-off-ram-navami-mela/articleshow/82124884.cms||Arshad Afzal Khan

In what appeared to be a reference to PM Modi’s statement at an election rally in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “shamshaan aur kabristan donon.... jo kaha so kiya (crematorium and graveyard both... he did what he said).” He also used the hashtag “Modi made disaster”. The Prime Minister’s reference during the 2017 election campaign, however, was to the Samajwadi Party’s policy of offering graveyards financial assistance for building boundary walls, which was criticised by BJP as a possible means to encourage land grab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-rahul-gandhi-uses-old-remark-of-pm-to-attack-him/articleshow/82124894.cms||---
