It involves planting dozens of native species in the same area, and becomes maintenance-free after the first three years. While a lot has been written and documented about this method of urban forestation, it can be quite expensive, which means that it is not feasible in many parts of the country. So, in 2019, the then Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Head of Forest Force), Sridhar Punati, tried out a cost-effective variant of the Miyawaki method at Agara Lake. Not only is it cheaper, but it also requires minimal human intervention. Cut to two years later, he is surprised at how well the mini forest is growing. ‘Much cheaper than Miyawaki’In 2019, the then Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Head of Forest Force), Sridhar Punati, tried out a cost-effective variant of the Miyawaki method at Agara Lake. Not only is it cheaper, but it also requires minimal human intervention. Cut to two years later, he is surprised at how well the mini forest is growing.Sridhar was aware of the amount of work required in the Miyawaki method, but didn’t think that it was all necessary. So, using logic and knowledge, he tried something different at Agara Lake — and it worked! “The Miyawaki technique requires a lot of work, such as digging the area, importing soil and fertiliser, using coco peat and compost etc., which makes it very costly — as much as Rs 300-Rs 350 per sq ft of planting area. I didn’t think that so much effort was necessary. In Miyawaki, three saplings are planted at every one meter — that is very intensive, and probably okay in a rainforest. We planted one sapling every meter. This was a mix of local species and those from the Western Ghats. All we did was dig a pit, plant the saplings and applied some fertilisers initially to boost growth. There is no irrigation or other form of intervention. I was pleasantly surprised with the growth when I recently visited the lake after two years, and happy that my experiment was successful,” says Sridhar, who is now retired. Minimal intervention required to grow a mini forestKavitha Reddy, a key member of the Agara Lake Volunteers — a group that has been ensuring the upkeep of the mini forest — told us that barely any work was done for the upkeep of the plantation. “Since the mini forest was planted during the 2019 rainy season, no watering was required till January-February 2020, because even post the monsoons, water was retained underground. Such plantations require care for the first two years, and we would ensure that it was watered, either from the lake or otherwise, only during the dry months — and that too as and when it was required. There has been no regular intervention required from anyone, and still the plantation has grown really well. It’s been two years since we planted it, so we see it self-sustaining now. We might need to water it in April 2022, but not much else will be required,” she says. Similar operation on at Somasundarapalya Lake For years, citizen volunteers have been trying to revive the Somasundarapalya Lake. While work on the lake itself began four years ago, a four-acre area of land was being used by the Karnataka Compost Development Corporation Ltd. A lot of reject waste was being dumped in the open over the four acres, and in 2019, the land was released on record. Over the last two months, volunteers of the Citizen Task Force have been meeting at the lake every single day, come rain or shine, to clear up the plastic waste and plant trees for the future urban forest. “The BBMP provided us with plants and a borewell, which unfortunately failed. We remove plastic and plant at least 5 saplings every day. I have personally been going to Sundaravana (what they call the four acres of land) everyday, to ensure that work goes on. Hundreds of citizens are involved in this and it is a citizen-driven and citizen-funded project. Children from the nearby government school also visit and help us. Our intention is to have an urban forest; we want to transform the plastic dumping area into a green patch — something that is required in Bengaluru,” says Lalithamba BV, a citizen volunteer from HSR, who tells us that the entire plantation might take anything from six months to one year to complete. Important to have other such green patches in the city Kavitha and Sridhar both agree with Lalithamba that more such plantations are the need of the hour in the city, especially since they are cost-effective and easy to manage. All that is required is a change in perspective — a better way to use the few open spaces that we still have left in Bengaluru. “We were thinking about setting up a seating area or play area in the patch of land at Agara Lake, but Sridhar’s idea of setting up the plantation instead was brilliant. We have realised that we needed a green patch and the water retention that it now enables. We see a variety of birds flocking there due to the many fruiting and nesting trees. There are a lot of flowering trees as well, and the fragrance you get just by walking past the plantation is a pleasing experience,” says Kavitha. BOX: MONEY MATTERSSridhar Punati, former Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Head of Forest Force), breaks down the costs of Miyawaki and the regular planting that he spearheaded at Agara Lake in 2019. Cost of Miyawaki: Rs 300-Rs 350 per sq feet. At that cost, it will cost Rs 1,30,68,000 per acre (this is the lowest possible estimate @ Rs 300/sq ft) Cost of the planting at Agara Lake: An estimated Rs 2-Rs 2.5 lakh per acre Amount saved: Rs 1,28,18,000 (Reported by Dhwani Desai)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/growing-an-urban-forest-in-bengaluru-at-a-fraction-of-the-cost/articleshow/86481036.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Attack on cops at Dholpur pre-planned: Assam BJP chief||Guwahati: The Assam unit of the ruling BJP on Friday claimed that the attack on the police and the district administration officials by “doubtful citizens” while conducting an eviction drive at Dholpur in Assam’s Darrang district on Thursday was “pre-planned” and that a third party was involved behind the clash. Addressing a press conference here in Guwahati, state BJP president Bhabesh Kalita said, “People were mobilized from different parts to prevent the eviction drive. And finally, they attacked the police and district administration officials.” Saying that the incident was unfortunate, he said, “There is involvement of a third party behind the clash at Dholpur. They conspired to stop the implementation of a state farming project at Garukhuti in Dholpur. Whoever is behind the clash must be arrested immediately.” He urged the state government to carry on the eviction drive in the area and free the encroached government land. He also appealed to the people of the area to cooperate with the district administration and the government. In the meanwhile, national general secretary of BJP Dilip Saikia said the eviction drive conducted in a part of the area last Monday was peaceful. “People extended cooperation to the eviction drive that day. Unfortunately, the situation turned violent in the area and the people, who were living there by encroaching government land, attacked the district administration officials and the police with sticks and machetes. They pelted also stones. They must have been instigated by some outsiders to fulfill their vested political interests,” he added. “The CM recently held a meeting with the All India United Democratic Front and All Assam Minority Students’ Union delegation on the matter. They all agreed. But a few so-called minority leaders used the entire issue for fulfilling their vested political interest,” he said. Saikia appealed to the encroachers to cooperate with the government and shift from the government land to the area specified by the district administration for rehabilitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/attack-on-cops-at-dholpur-pre-planned-state-bjp-chief/articleshow/86492622.cms||Mukut Das

This has been done for the purpose of national security and for the “safety of people’s assets”, the bank said. Vast amounts of Chinese wealth, including that generated by business community engaged in international dealings, is concentrated in digital coins like Bitcoin and Tether. The Biocoin market fell nine per cent from $ 45,000 per unit to $ 40,900 within three hours of the announcement, according to data from CoinMarketCap . The People’s Bank of China, or the central bank, feels that these coins — which are outside its regulatory ambit — are being used for money laundering. The bank said the offenders would be "investigated for criminal liability in accordance with the law". Besides the central bank, nine other government agencies, including the powerful National Development Reform Commission, have come together to express determination to eliminate the use of digital coins. At the same time, the government has not asked holders of the cryptocurrencies to return the digital coins to the state. It does not want to unsettle the market because it will cause much of the “national assets” held in digital coins to be lost in erosion, sources pointed out. The move comes in the midst of a large-scale crackdown on a large number of privately-run Chinese companies, including tech giants and US listed companies. The Communist Party feels it is losing control over a wealthy section of stakeholders in the 248 US-listed companies, and they need to be restrained. The People’s Bank of China said as much when it tried to explain the purpose of the ban on cryptocurrencies. It promised to “resolutely clamp down on virtual currency speculation, and related financial activities and misbehaviour in order to safeguard people’s properties and maintain economic, financial and social order”. The global cryptocurrency market has rapidly grown to a whopping $2 trillion as of April this year (the last figure available), causing alarm among regulators the world over. China fears a massive global meltdown in this form of currency. It is trying to get a first-mover advantage in the case of a crash, sources said. Several other regulators, including the Federal Reserve in the US, are contemplating measures to restrict the use of cryptocurrencies. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last July that the government must move quickly to establish a regulatory framework for such coins. China has been trying to stop the production of bitcoins in the country, which is the source of nearly up to three-quarters of the world's supply of bitcoins because mining them demands vast quantities of electricity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/china-bans-cryptocurrency-transactions-digital-coins-tumble-world-over/articleshow/86492489.cms||Saibal Dasgupta

PCC president Bhupen Kumar Borah took out a protest rally from its party office Rajib Bhawan to the office of the deputy commissioner of Darrang district in Mangaldoi. The party leaders and workers had staged a protest outside the deputy commissioner’s office at the district headquarters at Mangaldoi. The Congress claimed that party workers were barred from entering the DC’s office initially after which they sat in front of the office. The leaders were seen arguing with police outside the office. “Kill me but don’t take away my democratic right to protest against injustice,” Bora told the officials at the DC’s office. The memorandum, signed by Bora and leader of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) Debabrata Saikia, also demanded the suspension of both the deputy commissioner Prabhati Thaosen and superintendent of police Sushanta Biswa Sarma, younger brother of chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and an inquiry into the incident by a sitting judge. The state government has ordered a judicial inquiry into the incident by a retired judge of Gauhati High Court though the name of the judge was yet to be announced. The party also demanded that the cameraman and the police personnel who were stationed and took part in the whole barbaric act should be given exemplary punishment while the victims and the injured adequately compensated. An all-party meeting along with stakeholders should be immediately called to strategize and plan a rehabilitation and compensation programme for the evicted people of Goroikhuti, Dholpur and other villages, it said. “The chief minister, despite holding a constitutional post who has taken an oath to serve and protect all citizens, has behaved in a biased manner by constantly giving provocative statements which have made matters worse,” the leaders alleged. The Congress delegation, led by Bora, submitted the memorandum to the governor at Raj Bhavan here. “The Congress strongly condemns the most barbaric act of police firing and inhumane act on protesters during the state government's eviction drive..... the manner in which a protester is ruthlessly beaten to death ‘in camera’ by police personnel and subsequent violence on the deceased protester by the cameraman in the presence of police is horrifying,” Bora said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/congress-marches-against-eviction-seeks-rehab-package/articleshow/86492662.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

The photographer – Bijoy Baniya — was produced before Kamrup (Metro) chief judicial magistrate by the CID early on Friday. Baniya, who was hired by the Darrang district administration to cover the eviction drive, has been booked under charges of attempt to murder and using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty. Baniya was arrested within hours, on Thursday night, after a video went viral where he was shown assaulting a person lying on the ground after being hit by a bullet. Meanwhile, all the 11 people, including the three police personnel, Munir Ahmed, Amritraj Choudhury and Apurba Ronghang, who were injured in the clash, are currently undergoing treatment at the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). Talking to the press, GMCH superintendent Abhijit Sarma said, “All the 11 persons were admitted on Thursday night. Three of them are police personnel. Munir Ahmed has an internal bleeding in his head. He has suffered a bone fracture on his face and head. He is under observation, as his case is serious.” Sarma further said that Ronghang had sustained a minimal injury on his head, while Amritraj Choudhury suffered a soft tissue injury. “Both of them are stable. We are monitoring their health and might discharge them soon,” he stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/photographer-sent-to-judicial-custody-for-assaulting-bullet-hit-man/articleshow/86492664.cms||Mukut Das

He also announced that one of the oldest operating refineries in the world, the Digboi refinery in Assam, would be expanded. The minister, who was speaking at the programme on Upstream Oil and NER, also called upon investors to actively participate in the oil and gas sector. Puri said that NER, with its abundant natural resources, rich cultural heritage and huge opportunities for growth, is at the centre of our country’s development agenda. “The NER is of strategic importance to India. In line with its intent of rapidly transforming the region, the Union government has undertaken many key initiatives to augment infrastructure and pace up economic development,” the minister said. “There is a huge hydrocarbon potential waiting to be tapped. Of the estimated 7,600 MMTOE in the NE, only 2,000 MMTOE has been discovered so far. With concerted efforts by industry and governments, oil production is expected to increase by 67% from 4.11 MMT in 2020-21 to 6.85 MMT in the next four years. Gas production is expected to be more than double from 5.05 BCM in 2020-21 to 10.87 BCM in the next four years,” he said. Speaking on the occasion, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma extended full support in the exploration activities. He said the state government is taking steps to provide early environment clearance for oil and gas projects. He said Assam’s contribution to the sector is well-known and that he wants exploration activities to increase further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/1l-cr-oil-gas-projects-approved-for-northeast/articleshow/86492691.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

The five districts which have not provided the reports are Karbi Anglong, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, Nagaon and Barpeta. Taking suo motu cognizance, the commission on July 7 had asked the state government to conduct an inquiry into the circumstances leading to the gunning down of 12 accused in alleged police firing within one month of the new government taking charge. On August 16, the state home and political department had sought an additional six weeks’ time as many district authorities were yet to submit their reports. The commission on Thursday noted that on August 16, the state home and political department had revealed that magisterial enquiry reports submitted by the deputy commissioners of five districts and superintendent of police of seven districts have been received by the Commissioner and secretary, home and political department, whereas reports from deputy commissioners of Sivasagar and Mongaon have not been received.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/ahrc-asks-govt-to-file-police-encounter-reports-by-nov-1/articleshow/86492694.cms||Rokibuz Zaman
---||Guwahati||Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma blames ‘third force’ for Darrang violence||Guwahati: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Friday said the encroachers at Dholpur in Assam’s Darrang district had agreed to leave peacefully and also accepted the rehabilitation package by the government elsewhere two months back but the situation turned hostile because of a “third force”. Sarma said that acts of such violence were not new to Dholpur, the site of massacres of Muslims and Hindus in 1983 during Assam’s anti-foreigners movement in which eight Assamese youths were brutally killed. One of the two killed in Thursday’s police firing, Shakh Farid of Kira Kara NC village under Sipajhar, was 12 years old. The other victim is Moinul Haque (28) of Dholpur and authorities confirmed that he was the person who was mercilessly stomped upon by a photographer. According to the chief minister, each person had encroached into more than 200 bighas of land. “This is not a question about Bangladeshis, but how can an individual illegally occupy such huge area of land?” he asked. According Assam Land Policy of 1989, the maximum limit of land for allotment to an individual is seven bighas for agriculture and one bigha for homestead. Sarma added, “For last two months discussions were on with members of the All Assam Minority Students’ Union and they all agreed to a peaceful shifting and re-location to the land being offered by the government as per our land policy for landless. The government told them that 6 bighas of land will be given to each of the evicted landless families. They were also told that the government would build houses, schools and Anganwadi centres for them. Then, who instigated the mob? There is a third force.” “The police had gone to evict 60 households but how come 10,000 people had gathered there, armed with lathis and daos? They should not have attacked the police,” Sarma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-cm-blames-third-force-for-darrang-violence/articleshow/86492723.cms||Prabin Kalita

"It is not for the UK to prescribe a solution or to act as a mediator," said Amanda Milling, who was appointed minister for Asia in the UK PM’s recent reshuffle. "It would be for India and Pakistan to agree if they desired external mediation from any third parties. We regularly raise our concerns about human rights and about the situation in Kashmir at a senior level within the governments of Pakistan and India," she said. MPs from all political parties condemned India’s alleged human rights abuses in Kashmir, the closure of Amnesty International and the revocation of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution at the debate on Thursday. Many said human rights were "not a bilateral issue" and were "a multilateral issue" and called for UN human rights officials to get access to both sides of the LoC and for Britain to take a bigger role in facilitating peace in the region, saying it had a duty given it had overseen Partition. "We in this Parliament talk about girls’ rights in Afghanistan, but what about girls’ rights in Indian-occupied Kashmir," said Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi, whilst Conservative MP Paul Bristow, who also referred to the region as "Indian-occupied Kashmir", said: "Just as we care about injustice against the Rohingya and the Uyghur, we also care about injustice against Kashmiris." "This is not pro or anti any country; it is definitely pro-human rights," said Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, who secured the backbench debate. She was deported from India on February 17, 2020 because she had an invalid visa. The following day she flew to Pakistan and met PM Imran Khan, a trip that was funded by the Pakistan government. Abrahams called on the British government to "make an annual statement to the House of Commons on the government’s contribution to conflict resolution and peace-building in Kashmir", whilst shadow minister for Asia Stephen Kinnock, presenting the official Labour line, proposed that the British government "send a delegation to Jammu and Kashmir to assess the human rights situation and report back to Parliament". Many of the MPs taking part had constituencies with large Mirpuri populations and some had clearly been lobbied by the Pakistan government. Conservative MP Steve Baker said he had received a letter from the Pakistan high commission alleging that India had used cluster bombs along the LoC on July 30, 2019, striking civilians and villages. He called for the British government to investigate it, saying if true it was a "crime against humanity". Conservative MP Robbie Moore, who represents Keighley, where many British Pakistani Kashmiris live, said: "Yesterday, I received a letter from the high commissioner of Pakistan in which His Excellency wished to bring me up to speed on the continuing violations of human rights…" Labour MP Liam Byrne said there should be no trade deal with India or Pakistan unless human rights are observed, whilst Labour MP Tahir Ali said that the Indian high commissioner should "be barred from the parliamentary estate, pending an end to the military occupation of Kashmir" given that China’s ambassador to the UK had also been prevented from entering Parliament. Conservative MP Bob Blackman was one of the few MPs that defended India. He said that the illegal occupation by Pakistan of part of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir should cease. "When that is done, we can talk about the other United Nations resolutions." He said Kashmir had been tainted by radical Islamist terrorists. "If the troops were withdrawn and the protections were not there, the plight of Jammu & Kashmir would be the same as Afghanistan, with Islamist forces coming in and eliminating democracy in the area."

Abonmai, advisor and former president of Zeliangrong Baudi (Assam, Manipur and Nagalnd) was shot dead by suspected cadres of the NSCN (IM) in Tamenglong district on Wednesday evening. He was abducted by unknown persons the same morning in front of some security personnel, including Manipur police, near the gate of a public ground where a major government event was held. Chief minister N Biren Singh and his cabinet colleagues arrived there later to join the programme. “As many as 16 police personnel have so far been put under suspension,” the CM said at a press conference here on Friday. The suspension of the policemen, including five BN Manipur Rifles personnel, and disengagement of the VDF man, was made for their “negligence of duty” during the CM’s visit at Tamenglong district headquarters. Meanwhile, an inquiry committee, headed by inspector general of Manipur police (intelligence) K Radheshyam Singh as chairman, has been constituted to probe the incident. “The other two members of the panel are deputy IGs K Kabib (Range-II) and Angam Romanus (Range-IV),” said an order dated September 23 issued by the state DGP LM Khaute. “The committee will also inquire into whether there were lapses in the security arrangements, fix responsibilities and suggest measures to prevent any such incident in future,” it said, adding that the committee should submit its report within one week “without fail”. A large combined team of state forces led by a senior officer rushed to Tamenglong to launch a massive operation to nab Abonmai’s killers, a source said, adding that Assam Rifles already deployed in the district have been asked to to coordinate with the state police during the operation. A Joint Action Committee formed against murder of Abonmai demanded a high-level probe by the NIA. The opposition Congress has demanded a judicial probe into the incident to be headed by not less than a sitting high court judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/imphal/abonmai-murder-oc-15-other-manipur-policemen-suspended/articleshow/86491185.cms||K Sarojkumar Sharma

He added, “Any individual or group involved in abduction and subsequent killing of Abonmai, will not be spared.” “As a home minister-in charge of the state, I apologise to the public for the security lapses, and also condemn the police personnel for not intervening when Abonmai was being abducted in broad daylight,” Biren told reporters at a press conference at his office complex here. “The state government suspects the NSCN (IM) cadres to be responsible for the murder. But we cannot categorically confirm which group they belong to, until and unless the culprits are arrested,” said Biren. Stating that NSCN (IM)-Centre ceasefire does not extend to Manipur, the CM said any illegal activities of the Naga outfit in the state will not be allowed. “If there is any involvement of group/s that are under ceasefire agreement with the government of India, then the case will be handed over to the NIA,” Biren said, adding that his government is in communication with the home affairs ministry regarding the incident. It has sent a detailed report on the situation to the Centre, he said. Abonmai was a politician and social worker who always worked for cordial relationship with hills and valley and also for integrity of Manipur, Biren said. Stating that the state government shared the pain and sorrow of the family members and relatives of Abonmai, he said the state cabinet will decide on providing ex-gratia to the next of kin.

The BSF officials claimed that havildar Satbir Singh and constable Pratap Singh had a heate exchange of words during patrol duty along the border. At one point of time, in a fit of rage, constable Pratap shot havildar Satbir in the head from his Insas rifle. Satbir died on the spot. Leaving the body at the border, Pratap returned to the camp and started to fire indiscriminately. At this time, sub-inspector Ram Kumar Singh came out and tried to pacify him and asked him to surrender. Pratap, still livid, shot Ram too. The bullet hit the sub-inspector in the leg, injuring him seriously. Since Pratap was in no mood to surrender and was still firing indiscriminately, BSF sentry Abhimanyu Yadav shot him dead on the spot, a BSF source said. Ram was shifted to Agartala Government Medical College and Hospital, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/bsf-fragging-leaves-2-dead-one-injured-in-tripura/articleshow/86491192.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

The girl became pregnant after being allegedly raped by two men, said an official from the Mahabaleshwar police station. "By the time her family learnt about the pregnancy, it was late for abortion. After she revealed the names of alleged rapists, the family summoned them. The two men agreed to help the family get rid of the baby," he said. The girl gave birth recently, following which the accused along with others tried to give the infant girl to a Mumbai-based couple without following the legal procedure for adoption, he said. "We have arrested the two men who allegedly sexually assaulted the girl, and registered another case against them as well as 11 others including a member of the victim's family and the Mumbai couple for the illegal adoption attempt," the police official said.

US Justice Department attorney David Kessler told a hearing in federal court in Brooklyn, New York that the government agreed to suspend Meng Wanzhou's prosecution until December 1, 2022, and that if she abided by conditions of the agreement, the charges would then be dropped. He further recommended that "Ms Meng be released on a personal recognizance bond." Meng agreed to a statement of facts in the case, in which she was accused of defrauding HSBC Bank and other banks by falsely misrepresenting links between Huawei and Skycom, an affiliate that sold telecoms equipment to Iran. But Meng, who appeared by video transmission in the courtroom from Vancouver, maintained her "not guilty" plea in the politically-explosive case. Judge Ann Donnelly approved the agreement, saying: "I find that the government has established that the deferred prosecution agreement is bona fide." As the daughter of Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei, Meng was known internally as the "princess" of the company and its possible future leader. Her detention in December 2018 has fuelled a major, years-long diplomatic crisis, exacerbating strains between Washington and Beijing -- and pulled Canada into the fray with the detention of two of its citizens in what was seen as tit-for-tat retaliation by China. The 49-year-old Meng was arrested on a US warrant in the Canadian city of Vancouver, where she has been stuck ever since, fighting extradition to the United States. With a deal agreed, her house arrest in Vancouver is now expected to be lifted and the extradition case dropped. As a Skycom board member, Meng she was accused of masking financial transactions of the company through the US financial system, violating US sanctions on Iran, and lying about it to FBI investigators. But the case was swept up in a broader battle between the United States and China over Huawei, one of the world's largest telecommunications companies. Huawei maintains it is an independent, privately owned company but Washington claims the Chinese government holds sway over it and could use its equipment for intelligence collection. The Pentagon lists Huawei as a military-backed company to be avoided in contracting, noting that its founder Ren was formerly an engineer in the People's Liberation Army. The US government and the military have banned Huawei equipment and sought to get other local governments and private businesses to abandon the company's widespread routers and switching equipment. The US has also forbidden US technology firms from exporting certain equipment and materials to Huawei, and has encouraged other countries to forego Huawei equipment. The United States secretly issued a warrant for Meng's arrest in August 2018, and pressed Canada to arrest her when she flew into Vancouver's international airport on December 1, 2018. Meng was placed under house arrest in Canada as the US Justice Department pushed for her extradition. She faced a possible 30 years in prison on the charges, which China labelled "entirely political." Days after her arrest, China detained two Canadians, businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig, accusing them of espionage. Both were tried in March, and in August Spavor was sentenced to 11 years in prison. No decision has been announced in Kovrig's case. Western nations have accused China of "hostage diplomacy" for arresting and charging the Canadians. Beijing-Ottawa relations have hit rock bottom over the case and those of the Canadians held in China. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau denounced Spavor's sentence as "unacceptable and unjust," and said the charges were "trumped up."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/huawei-executive-resolves-criminal-charges-in-deal-with-us/articleshow/86492478.cms||---

TNHB has proposed to construct three 19-storeyed blocks with 304 residential units and a commercial complex. Environmental clearance (EC) for this project was sanctioned by the state-level environment impact assessment authority (SEIAA) in January. . G Devarajan, a resident of Chennai, challenged this EC at the NGT southern zone citing environmental violations. So, the tribunal appointed a committee of officials from SEIAA, the Union environment ministry, the Chennai district collectorate and the public works department (PWD) to look into the issue. This panel found that TNHB had encroached on the flood plain of river Cooum. As per revenue records, the river width upstream (near inner ring road bridge) and downstream ( Naduvankarai bridge) is 120-130 metres. But it was just 40 metres abutting the TNHB site, which is located between these bridges. "This could possibly create flood surge and afflux during heavy flood and inundate the adjoining areas," a report by this panel read. A baby canal, which was constructed to carry sewage during the dry season, was also encroached by TNHB. Since this canal is encroached there was a possibility of sewage seeping into the soil strata of Cooum riverbed thereby polluting the groundwater table. Also, the PWD had given its nod for the project on conditions that no construction material should be dumped near the river. But during the inspection, the panel found that this condition too was violated, and no barricading was done to stop sliding of earth excavated from the basement. Besides this, TNHB was earlier directed to halt the construction of the project so that there was no obstruction to the proposed Chennai Port-Maduravoyal Elevated Corridor project by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) along the riverside. However, TNHB construction works are in progress till date violating the order. So, the tribunal in its order on September 20 ordered TNHB to maintain status quo of the proposed construction for two weeks, except for debris removal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ngt-stops-tnhb-flats-construction/articleshow/86493822.cms||Ram Sundaram

The state government has decided to challenge the stay orders in Supreme Court. The Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) has scheduled the auction of the 95 acres on September 28, which is now in jeopardy. Earlier on Tuesday, the HC had stayed the auction of 11 acres in survey number 301 at Puppalaguda village, making it clear that the state cannot sell a piece of land over which it has no title. The litigation is over land notified by Centre for refugees from Pakistan during the Partition on which the state claims ownership. The state has been refusing to recognise documents furnished by petitioners and contending that they were not pre-Partition tenants as claimed. On Friday, a bench of Acting Chief Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar was hearing the petition by Ramchander Singh and six others claiming rights as pre-Partition tenants over the 18 acres in survey number 301 at Puppalaguda and challenging TSIIC auction notification. The bench stayed the auction saying that the case had come on remand from Supreme Court and it was not proper to accord rights to any of the two parties, petitioners or the state, at this stage. “If we allow auction now, then that would create third-party interests in the land and would cause severe prejudice to the cause of the petitioners,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-stays-auction-of-18-more-acres-t-moves-sc/articleshow/86494696.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

A bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar passed the direction after a medical panel of JJ Hospital advised MTP, saying “though at 28 weeks of gestation, termination of pregnancy carries substantial risk to the pregnant minor, continuation will have physical and mental stress to the minor mother”. The petition seeking HC permission was filed by the girl’s maternal aunt. Her parents died in an accident a decade back and her aunt has been looking after her. Palghar police booked her 21-year-old neighbour for rape under IPC and POCSO. On Tuesday, her aunt’s advocate Ashley Cusher said the Child Welfare Committee (Palghar district) said the girl’s mental and physical state was very fragile. He said travel from the rural area of Palghar to Byculla would be inconvenient. The judges directed JJ Hospital to admit her when she comes for examination to avoid travelling all the distance. They directed that she shall be discharged “subject to further orders of the court”. The panel’s report, submitted by state advocate Himanshu Takke, said there was no abnormality in the foetus or the minor. “The minor is anguished with the pregnancy,” it added. It stated that the minor and her aunt “are made aware of the dangers of continuation of pregnancy, as well as, termination of pregnancy.” The judges directed that blood and DNA samples of “the mother and the foetus may be preserved by hospital authorities for investigation”. They posted the matter on October 1 to know the outcome of the MTP procedure.

CGST Mumbai unit arrested trader Ujwal Jain, a resident of Thakurdwar and director of SPN Gold India Pvt Ltd, engaged in wholesale of gold-plated articles, jewellery of precious metals. SPN had availed inadmissible ITC amounting to Rs 7 crore on fake invoices issued by non-existing entities. In the second case, CGST Bhiwandi unit, which was probing the fraudulent availment of Rs 10 crore in ITC, arrested Deep Himanshu Desai on Thursday. The CGST Bhiwandi commissionerate had earlier arrested Nisha Munjal (49), proprietor of Dixa Fabrics, Ekta Fabrics, and director of Ridgewood Industries and Pretty Woman Fashion Pvt Limited. The CGST and Central Excise Commissioner, Bhiwandi commissionerate, Sumit Kumar, said further investigation is on to identify other scamsters involved in the fraud. Munjal’s lawyer Ravi Hirani said his client Nisha is innocent as she was only a namesake director in these firms, and the day-to-day activities of sales, purchase, taxation and accounting of these firms were carried out by Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2-bizmen-held-in-separate-cases-for-gst-fraud-of-17cr/articleshow/86492661.cms||Ahmed Ali

Douglas County Judge Sally Pokorny sentenced Lawrence massage therapist Shawn P O'Brien (50) on Friday after jurors in August found him guilty on eight counts.  Three of the charges accuse O'Brien of indecent liberties with a child under the age of 14 for fondling a girl who was either 9 or 10 on three occasions between 2013 and 2015. All three resulted in "hard 25" sentences, meaning he will have to serve at least 25 years before being eligible for parole. Pokorny said the three life sentences would be served concurrently, the Lawrence Journal-World reported.  The other five charges accuse him of sexual battery for fondling four women while giving them a massage to treat sports-related issues between 2016 and 2019. Three of the women played for the University of Kansas soccer team. The fourth woman was a university student who was a client at his office.  O'Brien had a contract with the university to provide massage treatments to many athletes on campus. That contract was terminated after initial charges were filed.  Deputy District Attorney Joshua Seiden told jurors during closing arguments that O'Brien used his credentials as a professional massage therapist as a guise to fondle the victims when he was giving them massages.  Seiden also pointed to the testimony from the soccer players who said that O'Brien fondled them while he was providing massage therapy for the team. He said O'Brien claimed to not remember any of the incidents with the athletes.  Defense attorney Philip Sedgwick argued that the case came down to a "he said, she said" situation and suggested the prosecutors did not present enough evidence to convict O'Brien. He said athletes did not complain about his methods or let him know that what he was doing made them uncomfortable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/massage-therapist-gets-25-years-to-life-for-sex-crimes/articleshow/86495808.cms||---
---||World||Biden won't invoke executive privilege on Trump records in Jan 6 probe: White House||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden will not invoke executive privilege to shield his predecessor Donald Trump's records in relation to an investigation into the deadly attack on the United States Capitol on January 6, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday.  "The president has already concluded that it would not be appropriate to assert executive privilege," Psaki said. "And so, we will respond promptly to these questions as they arise."  The US House of Representatives Select Committee investigating the deadly riot at the Capitol has subpoenaed four former members of Trump's administration, including Mark Meadows and Steve Bannon, the panel's chairman said on Thursday.  A mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan 6 as Congress was meeting to certify Democrat Joe Biden's election victory, delaying that process for several hours as then-vice-president Mike Pence, members of Congress, staff and journalists fled from rioters.  Trump said he would fight the subpoenas "on executive privilege and other grounds".  Executive privilege allows the White House to refuse to comply with demands for records such as congressional subpoenas or Freedom of Information Act requests. The legal principle is rooted in the idea that some privacy should be given to presidential advisers so they can have candid discussions.  A sitting president has in the past used executive privilege to keep records and communications from an earlier administration secret, but it is rare.  With Biden nixing executive privilege, it was widely expected that Trump would file a legal challenge.  Representatives for the former president were not immediately available for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-wont-invoke-executive-privilege-on-trump-records-in-jan-6-probe-white-house/articleshow/86496283.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Top gangster killed by rivals in Rohini court, both hitmen shot||NEW DELHI: In a brazen strike inside a courtroom in the Rohini district court complex on Friday afternoon, gangster Jitender Gogi was gunned down by two shooters alleged hired by his rival. The two assailants, dressed as lawyers, were killed on the spot in a calibrated response by men of Delhi Police’s special cell, who were accompanying Gogi. There was panic and chaos at the complex although timely action by the cops averted more casualties. People scrambled for cover and ran out of the courtroom as gunshots were exchanged between the cops and the criminals. A total of 12-15 bullets were fired from both sides. Gogi had been on the top of the police’s most wanted list till his dramatic arrest last year in April. According to police, his arch-rival, Sunil Tajpuria alias Tillu, had orchestrated the hit, with assistance from another gangster, Naveen Bali. The plot was hatched in Mandoli jail where Tajpuria is lodged at present, sources said. The two shooters were identified as Rahul Fafunda, a contract killer with a reward of Rs 50,000 on him, and Jagdeep Jagga. The incident took place around 1.15pm, just when additional sessions judge Gagandeep Singh arrived to begin hearing in room number 207. The two shooters had come to the court around 12pm in full “advocate attire”, complete with black collar bands, blazers and shoes. They were seated in the courtroom. Gogi arrived with a heavy escort team. As he had been categorised as a very-high-risk undertrial, two teams from the special cell were present in the room besides cops from Delhi Armed Police, which escorts inmates to courts from jail. The cops were on an escalated alert because a henchman of the Tillu gang, Sunil, was also to be brought there for the hearing. As soon as Gogi entered the courtroom, the two shooters stood up, whipped out 7.65mm pistols and fired at Gogi. The cops reacted almost immediately and shot back, with the shooters falling on the floor along with Gogi. The shooting lasted for less than 30 seconds, an eyewitness said. It was to the police’s advantage that Gogi was accompanied by the special cell sleuths as part of the new security apparatus for high-risk inmates which involves men from the arresting unit to be present when they are being produced in court. This was put in place after the GTB Hospital shootout, officials said. Police have launched a manhunt for the others involved in the plot. The investigation of the case has been transferred to the crime branch. Tillu will be taken on remand for questioning along with other associates. "Delhi Police reacted swiftly and shot dead the assailants," said police commissioner Rakesh Asthana. “No one was injured during the incident. The police took clean and correct action while bringing down the assailants. We will now investigate the issue of a security lapse,” he added. Initial investigations indicate that Tajpuria had planned the hit by borrowing henchmen from other gangsters he had aligned with in the past. "Naveen Bali is suspected to have lent at least one of the shooters to Tajpuria’s gang. Another gangster, Sunil Rathi, is also under the scanner for helping Tajpuria,” said a source. Shooter Fafunda was involved in a recent murder in the Kanjhawala area. The Delhi Police brass has initiated a high-level inquiry under a joint commissioner rank officer and is conducting a review of the court security. “All three were declared brought dead to the hospital. A criminal case has been registered and investigations have been taken up as per guidelines of the court and NHRC. The judicial authorities of the Rohini courts have been briefed about the incident and action has been taken,” said DCP (Rohini) Pranav Tayal. The police said they have been coordinating regularly with the Rohini court administration and other stakeholders for ensuring security at the premises and several meetings were held recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/top-gangster-killed-by-rivals-in-court-both-hitmen-shot/articleshow/86496090.cms||Rajshekhar Jha

For this, four consulting firms, which have experience in archaeological restorations, have already been appointed. Five of these come under the jurisdiction of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The temples that will be restored as per the archaeological specifications as mandated in ASI guidelines include Gondeshwar temple in Nashik, Ekvira Mandir in Karla, Khandoba temple in Aurangabad, Markanda Shiv Mandir in Gadchiroli, Purushottam Mandir in Beed, Kopeshwar temple, Kolhapur, Anandeshwar shiv temple in Amravati and Dhootpapeshwar temple in Ratnagiri. A Rs 101-crore fund has already been set aside for the project, an MSRDC release revealed. The decision to take up these conservation and rejuvenation works of the temples was announced by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in the last budget session of the state legislature. A committee was constituted under the leadership of additional chief secretary Manoj Saunik, and presentations were made before it recently. Other than restoration of the temple structures as per their original architecture, the wrong paver blocking, oil-painting and tiling made on the structures and their pathways, artificial sheds built in and around the temples, and haphazard shopping lanes, electricity and water supply networks will be streamlined. The measures are aimed at protecting the ancient architectural designs. The works have been planned in such a way that each renovation looks synchronised with the original architecture, the release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/msrdc-to-renovate-eight-ancient-temples-in-state/articleshow/86492657.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||India||SC: Convict’s right to raise juvenility plea at any time needs rethink||NEW DELHI: Nearly a decade after giving convicts the right to raise juvenility plea at any stage, the Supreme Court on Friday realised that its 2012 ruling has opened the floodgates for petitions where convicts, even more than a decade after dismissal of their final appeals, continue to raise the plea that they were juveniles at the time of the crime to seek reduction in sentence. What made a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli mull the need for reviewing the judgment was a petition filed by one Sher Khan, who raised the plea of juvenility for the first time 22 years after a gang-rape incident at Dadri in Uttar Pradesh for which he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment along with others. At the receiving end of a flurry of questions from the bench was advocate Rishi Malhotra, who kept reiterating that the SC itself has settled the issue in the 2012 judgment and that a convict would not be time-barred to raise the plea of juvenility. The bench asked, "Does that mean an accused who did not even whisper that he was a juvenile at the time of committing an offence for close to two decades would be permitted to raise it even after the final judgment from the SC upholding the conviction and sentence?" Justice Surya Kant was concerned as both the Alllahabad HC and Gautam Budh Nagar trial court found that the accused belonged to influential families in the village and that the rape survivor was from a poor family. The bench said, "Were you not aware of your age at any point of time during the last two decades?" What the SC bench feared is that influential accused can use their money and muscle power to obtain age certificates to claim juvenility at the time of the crime to get a very lenient sentence even in gruesome or heinous crimes, as happened in the Nirbhaya rape-murder case. Malhotra referred to the birth certificate and the school-leaving certificate, both issued in 2018, to plead that the convict was a juvenile needing an inquiry to establish the fact as mandated under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act. But the bench said the certificates were obtained in 2018 and the birth certificate was issued on the recommendation of the village panchayat. It asked the petitioner to file the original recommendation letter from the village panchayat about the age of the convict, based on which the authorities had issued the age certificate. Justice Kant said the SC in many cases has refused to rely on the evidentiary value of a school-leaving certificate to prove the age of a person. The SC in Abuzar Hossain alias Gulam Hossain vs State of West Bengal had in 2012 ruled that "a claim of juvenility may be raised at any stage even after the final disposal of the case. It may be raised for the first time before this court as well after the final disposal of the case. The delay in raising the claim of juvenility cannot be a ground for rejection of such claim. The claim of juvenility can be raised in appeal even if not pressed before the trial court and can be raised for the first time before this court though not pressed before the trial court and in the appeal court". Section 9(2) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 contemplated that whenever a claim of juvenility is raised before any court, the court shall make an inquiry and take such evidence as may be necessary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-convicts-right-to-raise-juvenility-plea-at-any-time-needs-rethink/articleshow/86496770.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

This marks the first time that a candidate for the top job at the UN health agency has not been nominated by the home country.  Tedros, who goes by his first name, has been in the global spotlight over the organization's response to the coronavirus pandemic over the last 19 months -- an epochal crisis that eclipsed all else throughout his term that began in 2017. The election for the next WHO director-general, which carries a five-year term, takes place at the agency's next annual assembly meeting in May.  Tedros has run afoul of the Ethiopian government of Nobel Peace Prize-winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed over his outspokenness about killings and other human rights abuses in his home region of Tigray.  Tedros was formerly a top official in the Tigray People's Liberation Front, once a dominant member of a coalition running Ethiopia but now designated by the national government as a terrorist group.  Tedros also served as health and foreign minister in the previous Ethiopian government.  The diplomatic missions of France and Germany to UN institutions in Geneva announced their support for Tedros on their Twitter feeds after a deadline for candidacies for the director-general post expired on Thursday. On its web site, the WHO has said it doesn't plan to announce the full list of candidates until November, but some diplomatic officials have suggested that he may not have any competition.  A diplomatic official in Geneva, speaking on condition of anonymity because she was not authorised to speak publicly about the matter, said 15 other European Union members joined in nominating Tedros.  Macharia Kamau, principal secretary for the foreign affairs ministry in Ethiopia's neighbour, Kenya, tweeted that his country backs Tedros - the first African to head the WHO.  "Kenya supports continuity of exemplary African leadership at helm of crucial global world health organization, and will work towards that realization," he tweeted.  The WHO, under Tedros, came under withering criticism from the US Trump administration last year over allegations of grievous missteps in responding to COVID-19 and of an over-willingness to praise China in the early phases of the outbreak that first emerged in Wuhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/france-germany-nominate-who-chief-tedros-for-a-second-term/articleshow/86496832.cms||---

---||India||Union defence ministry inks Rs 21,000 crore deal with Airbus for 56 IAF planes||NEW DELHI: The Union defence ministry on Friday inked the over Rs 21,000 crore (around $3 billion) contract with Airbus Defence and Space (Spain) to acquire 56 C-295 medium transport aircraft to replace the old Avro planes of the IAF. Airbus will deliver 16 of the twin-turboprop C-295MW aircraft in a flyaway condition within four years, with the remaining 40 being manufactured in India by the Tata Consortium under a joint industrial partnership within 10 years. After the delivery of the 56 aircraft, the subsequent planes manufactured here can be exported to countries cleared by the Indian government, said MoD officials. Airbus executive vice-president (military aircraft) Jean-Brice Dumont, in turn, said the C-295 certainly had “export potential” but his company’s “first priority” is to execute the 56-aircraft project. “Our priority is to unleash the potential of the aerospace industry in India for India. The project will create 15,000 skilled direct jobs and 10,000 indirect jobs over the next 10 years,” he said. The Airbus-Tata project, which was hanging fire for around a decade, was cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Security on September 8. Breaking the virtual monopoly of defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics in the field, this will be the first time an Indian private sector company will manufacture a military aircraft, as reported by TOI earlier. Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata said the joint project was “a great step forward in the opening up of aviation and avionics projects” in India. “It envisages total manufacturing of the aircraft in India. It will create a domestic supply chain capability to international standards, which has never been undertaken before,” he added. The highly-versatile C-295 aircraft, which can carry up to 9-tonne of payload or 71 soldiers, is capable of operating from semi-prepared strips and has a rear ramp door for quick-reaction and para-dropping of troops and cargo. “The aircraft will give a major boost to IAF’s tactical airlift capability, especially in the northern and north-eastern sector with China as well as the Andaman & Nicobar Islands,” said a MoD official. Tata Advanced Systems CEO Sukaran Singh said, “It’s a momentous day for the Tatas and a milestone for the Indian military manufacturing ecosystem. This endeavour demonstrates Tata Advanced Systems’ capabilities as a defence manufacturer to build globally competitive complex platforms in India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/union-defence-ministry-inks-rs-21000-crore-deal-with-airbus-for-56-iaf-planes/articleshow/86496886.cms||---

Congress sets an exampleHandling of Punjab affairs by the Congress high command during the past five months, including the latest chapter of replacing the chief minister, could well be a B-school case study explaining how not to tackle an internal crisis in the party. The latest and the worst was the delay by the partyThe frequent meetings suggest that the leadership has put the Pilot-led revolt last year behind it, and is looking at the future. This has triggered the question if Pilot can be given back some of his earlier responsibilities like the state chief. Congress is also looking for an in-charge of Gujarat Congress where the post of AICC manager is vacant after the death of Rajiv Satav. The state goes to polls next year.

The decision by British Columbia Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes comes after Meng earlier reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the United States prosecutors to avoid felony fraud charges. The top executive resolved the criminal charges against her as part of a deal Friday with the US Justice Department, paving the way for herself to return to China, and concluding a case that roiled relations between Washington and Beijing. The deal with Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of the company’s founder, Ren Zhengfei, calls for the Justice Department to dismiss fraud charges late next year in exchange for Meng accepting responsibility for misrepresenting her company's business dealings in Iran. The arrangement, known as a deferred prosecution agreement, resolves a years-long legal and geopolitical tussle that involved not only the US and China but also Canada, where Meng has remained since she was arrested at Vancouver's airport in December 2018.

A drainage network, which was planned for the flooded zone in the area off Bypass under Kolkata Environment Improvement and Infrastructure Project (KEIIP), was ultimately implemented in another belt near Garia, leaving vast areas between Nayabad and Chowbhaga vulnerable to waterlogging every monsoon. KMC drainage department officials said these areas developed on the wetlands could be saved only if and when a drainage infrastructure was created. Town planners pointed out rampant filling up of ponds and wetlands in the belt, unplanned development, inadequate focus on infrastructure and slack maintenance were the reasons for this flooding. According to a KMC sewerage and drainage department official, not only underground drainage network but surface drains are also absent in large areas there. “Storm water flows down and gets accumulated in vacant or low-lying places. There is no drainage network in large areas along this belt,” said the civic official. “Portable pumps appear to be the only way out that the civic body uses to flush water out of Mukundapur, Madurdaha and Panchasayar after heavy spells of rain.” Following the nightlong torrential rain on Sunday and again on Monday, people in the area were marooned at home for three days for this lack of infrastructure. A KMC drainage department official, who was confined to his Mukundapur Main Road home, pointed out they would face such waterlogging in three more monsoons as the KEIIP scheme, if implemented, was not likely to be completed before that. Even in areas like Anandapur, Kasba, Garfa, Patuli, Topsia and Beliaghata, where there are drainage lines, clogged canals do not allow the water to flow out. Town Head Cut canal, Suburban Head Cut canal and Tollygunge-Panchannagram canal were heavily clogged, said a KMC drainage official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/drainage-upgrade-only-solution-for-east-of-bypass/articleshow/86504810.cms||Saikat Ray

The new feature may go live by next week. A senior central government official with the CoWIN management portal said the introduction of the new feature stems from ongoing technical discussions between India and the UK on CoWIN certification. A senior official with the portal told TOI, “We believe that the UK wants the date of birth format in the CoWIN certificate as per WHO standards — in the dd-mm-yy format — for international travellers. Hence, the same feature will be introduced in the CoWIN certificates for those going abroad.” The UK government’s relaxed travel rules come into force from October 4. “You must be able to prove that you have been fully vaccinated (plus 14 days) with a document (digital or paper-based) from a national or state-level public health body that includes, as a minimum, forename and surname(s), date of birth, vaccine brand and manufacturer, date of vaccination for every dose, country or territory of vaccination and/or certificate issuer. If your document from a public health body does not include all of these, you must follow the non-vaccinated rules. If not, you may be denied boarding," the website added. CoWIN vaccination certificate currently displays the beneficiary’s name, age based on the year of birth, gender, ID, unique health ID, vaccine name, date of first dose, date of second dose, vaccinator, vaccination centre’s name, and city/state. A senior official from the ministry of health and family welfare told TOI, “No changes are required in the current CoWIN certificates as the format is in sync with WHO standards. The new feature can be opted for by those who want to travel abroad." National Health Authority (NHA) chief executive officer Ram Sewak Sharma said there was no concern at any point expressed by the UK government about India’s certification process. Sharma, who is also the head of the CoWIN platform, said, “As per the WHO Covid vaccination certificate template, there is a ‘date of birth’ column, which is optional. At CoWIN, we collect only the year of birth of the beneficiary, as per which his/her age reflects on the vaccination certificate. Hence, the new feature will be introduced only for those travelling internationally. Such users can download their updated certificate after putting in their month and day of birth as per their passport. The downloaded certificate will then contain the full date of birth of the beneficiary."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cowin-to-add-date-of-birth-for-fully-vaccinated-travelling-abroad/articleshow/86497049.cms||Neha Madaan

The total sanctioned strength has now gone up to 91 personnel for the small area that primarily covers the VIP zone of Nabanna. Sixty-nine personnel have already been assigned to this outpost. Keeping tabs on vehicles that are approaching Nabanna and controlling the traffic approaching the toll will be the main job of this outpost, said officers. “The additional OC-II of Vidyasagar Setu guard — under which the output operates — has taken over as the OC here. As many as seven officers have now been posted here,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/manpower-boost-for-traffic-outpost-in-nabanna-area/articleshow/86504856.cms||---

A retired deputy superintendent of police and an inspector too were among the lifters for their attempts to cover up the crime. "...there is nothing honourable in 'honour' killings, and they are nothing but barbaric and brutal murders by bigoted persons with feudal minds. In our opinion, ‘honour’ killings, for whatever reason, come within the category of rarest of rare cases deserving death punishment. It is time to stamp out these barbaric, feudal practices which are a slur on our nation. This is necessary as a deterrent for such outrageous, uncivilized behaviour. All persons who are planning to perpetrate 'honour' killings should know that the gallows await them," said special judge for SC/ST cases S Uttamarasa on Friday. In 2004, the CBI took over the case and found it to be complicated technically and procedurally, said additional director-general of police A K Viswanathan, for whom it was the first case in the CBI. The agency booked 15 people and filed a 660-page charge sheet in the same year. Eight-one witnesses were examined and cross-examined and 36 of them turned hostile. Chemical engineering graduate Murugesan, 25, a Dalit from Pudu Colony in Kuppanatham in Cuddalore district, and D Kannagi, 22, a Vanniyar from the same village, fell in love and secretly registered their marriage on May 5, 2003 but decided to live in their respective houses until Murugesan gets a decent job.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-who-killed-sister-gets-death-sentence-10-get-life/articleshow/86492123.cms||Bosco Dominique

Thanks to the sizzling rally in group companies’ share prices and speedy recovery in their earnings after the first Covid wave, market capitalisations of India’s fabled business houses surged, adding to shareholders’ kitty. Not surprisingly, India’s largest group by revenue, the House of Tatas, is the largest wealth-creator for shareholders. Its 28 listed entities together added more than Rs 6 lakh crore wealth for investors since January this year — a return of over 40%. Next is Reliance Industries (RIL) Group, controlled by Mukesh Ambani. Its nine listed firms cumulatively added close to Rs 4 lakh crore wealth for investors, a return of 28%. Bajaj is the third-largest wealth creator for investors followed by Adani, while Aditya Birla and L&T are neck and neck in the fifth spot .Read the full story on TOI+||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-lead-wealth-creation-among-indias-business-houses/articleshow/86497360.cms||Reeba Zachariah

He was 75. A key Hindu litigant in the Ayodhya title suit, Pandey had moved the Supreme Court after he was made custodian of the sanctum sanctorum (middle part of the complex) in a three-way division of the then disputed land by a three-judge bench of the Allahabad high court in August 2010. The third in the line of the “Friends of Ram Lalla” after Devaki Nandan Agarwal and TP Verma, Pandey was considered the real architect of the 'Ramjanmabhoomi liberation' for his decades-old legal battle, which he won. He was not a high-profile leader of the Ram temple movement, but he devoted his life to a legal battle for the Ramjanmabhoomi. Despite his long association with Vishwa Hindu Parishad, he believed in a harmonious relationship with his Muslim brethren, particularly the lawyers pleading the Babri Masjid case. Pandey's younger son Amit, a Delhi-based software engineer, confirmed his death to TOI. Amit said his father passed away around 8 pm at Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow, where he was hospitalised a fortnight back. His mortal remains will be brought to Ayodhya late in the night and then his last rites will be performed at his ancestral village in Ballia district. In an interview to TOI, a month before the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict, he had said, “It was Lord Ram, who inspired us to fight for his rights in the court. To represent God is a glorious job and to think I was chosen to do this job from among millions of Hindus made me proud and joyful.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ramjanmabhoomi-owner-ram-lallas-friend-triloki-nath-pandey-passes-away/articleshow/86496991.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

India recorded 29,595 fresh cases of the virus, down from 31,407 on Thursday and 32,028 on the day before. The drop was mainly on account of Kerala reporting 17,983 cases after having posted close to 20,000 on the previous two days. The state’s daily test positivity rate, however, remained high at 16.27%, according to a statement by CM Pinarayi Vijayan. Tamil Nadu continued to log a gradual rise in cases. The state’s daily count remained higher than 1,700 for the second straight day, as 1,733 fresh cases were recorded. In Mizoram, another state witnessing a Covid spike, 1,257 new cases emerged on Friday. There were 291 deaths from the virus reported on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-cases-fall-below-18000-india-tally-under-30k/articleshow/86497897.cms||---

He also has decided to keep his daughter out of politics. He had already indicated his intentions to TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu and had told him to look for an alternative candidate for the Vijayawada Lok Sabha constituency for 2024 elections. The MP has been keeping away from party politics for some time, due to differences with party local leaders. TDP senior leaders Budda Venkanna and K Nagul Meera have raised their voice openly against Kesineni before municipal elections early this year. Sources close to the MP said Kesineni had complained to the party chief against the two leaders for speaking against him and working against his candidates in the municipal corporation elections. He projected his daughter, Kesineni Swetha, as the mayoral candidate, but the party ended up winning only 14 divisions. Sources further said the MP had already withdrawn his daughter from active politics. When contacted, Kesineni said he informed Naidu about his decision about a month ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vij-mp-kesineni-to-quit-active-politics-in-2024/articleshow/86490831.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: NGT summons 2 principal secretaries over clogged canals||KOLKATA: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) summoned two state principal secretaries through virtual court proceedings on September 28 in connection with water flowing back from clogged Kestopur and Bagjola canals, flooding New Town, Salt Lake and large stretches along the two channels off VIP Road. The eastern region bench of NGT of Justice B Amit Sthalekar, a judicial member, and Saibal Gupta, an expert member, said they were “constrained to observe” no step was taken to stop the problem. It said the “irrigation and waterways department has not cared to file its affidavit, showing what action plan has been prepared to prevent the disasters of the previous week and this week ... People have fallen into open manholes... Cars have driven into a lake... The fear of the tribunal has been proven correct and colonies have been deluged with dirt, filth and gutter water due to backflow of the Kestopur and Bagjola canals”. “I have submitted a supplementary affidavit, detailing encroachments on the banks of the Kestopur and Bagjola canals and pile of garbage,” said amicus curiae of the case and activist Subhas Datta. The state had told the NGT that a Detailed Project Report (DPR) for abatement of pollution of the Bagjola canal was finalized and work order issued on January 10, 2020. “There is nothing at the ground level to show the results of the efforts,” the NGT replied. “We are surprised that Rs 1,400 crore was required to prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) for 8 sewerage treatment plants,” the court observed. On Friday, five days after the torrential rain, a few stretches and housing complexes in New Town close to Bagjola canal still remained waterlogged. The NKDA and Hidco operated as many pumps as possible to flush out the water. A portion of the road leading towards the periphery canal near Sukhobristi Housing was cut for water to flow out. The situation at a few other complexes near Bagjola canal had improved marginally. “The water level has gone down by only a few inches but there is still ankle-deep water in some places,” said Souvik Bhattacharya, a resident of Elita Garden Vista. NKDA has placed sand bags on the banks of the canal to prevent backflow of water. “We are taking all immediate precautionary measures. We are operating about 100 pumps in New Town areas, which are still waterlogged. Our engineers are on the road to monitor the work and all the drainage lines are being thoroughly cleaned up. The water reservoirs where storm water had entered are being cleaned up and refilled with fresh water. The banks of the periphery canals have been cleaned up to ensure maximum discharge of storm water,” said a NKDA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ngt-summons-principal-secys-over-clogged-canals/articleshow/86493190.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

According to Satyanarayanapuram station house officer B Bala Murali Krishna, the incident took place at around 8 pm when the complainant was returning home after completing a transaction and carrying the bag full of money. Soon, two persons who were following him took the opportunity to attack and push the man before snatching the bag at an isolated place and fleeing from the spot. “The complainant informed that there were two persons who attacked and snatched the bag containing Rs 6 lakh and some change. We have registered a case and are inquiring into it,” Krishna told TOI. Cops suspect that the persons might have been following the man as their modus operandi indicate they were aware that the cash was in his possession.

Speaking after a meeting with union textile secretary U P Singh at Udyog Bhawan where he shared information through a presentation regarding the draft, Shahnawaz said, “All possibilities are being worked out for the establishment of textile industry in Bihar. All necessary help, which can be provided by the Centre has also been discussed with the union textiles secretary.” Speaking about his meeting with Bihar BJP president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal held earlier on the issue of development of Bettiah in West Champaran, Shahnawaz said that there was a discussion about establishing a large textile park in Bettiah. He said Jaiswal wanted to remove the discrepancies regarding the price of land of Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA). While interacting with the entrepreneurs at another event, Shahnawaz announced setting up of four industrial clusters in Patna Sahib assembly segment. “Four clusters of LED bulbs, steel furniture, toys and footwear will be set up in Patna Sahib assembly segment,” he said. Former road construction minister and Patna Sahib MLA Nand Kishore Yadav participated in the dialogue with the entrepreneurs. Shahnawaz said two clusters have already been approved for the production of LED bulbs, steel furniture and other items at a cost of Rs10 crore and the two others for toys and footwear will be approved shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-industrial-clusters-in-patna-sahib-okd-min/articleshow/86490907.cms||---
---||Business||‘My doctor says problems start after 60. So tr(e)ading cautiously’||Devendra Dewasthale is a keen observer. He picks up useful conversations with friends and experts and converts them into golden opportunities. The well-travelled Dewasthale once visited a blue-chip company’s manufacturing unit, where he learned that the firm was benchmarking itself against the best in the world. He immediately bought the shares of this company which has since paid him rich dividends. The 61-year-old Dewasthale, who has been investing in the capital markets for around 30 years, is elated with the sensex hitting 60K. “I have made good money on the markets over the decades,” he says while adding that he is equally comfortable with using technological platforms to make investments. “That way the control is in my hand,” he reasons. However, when he was younger, Dewasthale used to speculate on nearly 40% of his portfolio. Today, only 5% of his portfolio is used to speculate on. “For the last 3-4 years, I have concentrated only on blue-chips. In fact, I have taken this decision against the advice of my financial consultant. I am happy with 15-20% returns, which is better than the bank’s savings/FD rate,” says Dewasthale. He withdrew from small-cap and mid-caps entirely and invested in index funds. “My approach now is safer,” says the self-employed Dewasthale who lives in Thane. Mumbai-based Srinivas Ananthan is equally cautious. “For the last 25 years, what I bought in my portfolio, I rarely sold. Looking at the market now, I am a bit skeptical and thus cautious about where I invest. For my children also, now I only buy select high-quality scrips,” says Srinivas, while concluding: “My doctor says, problems start after 60... I am not very comfortable!” Therefore, most 60-year old investors are taking safer bets. Raja Iyer, 66, who started investing in the stock markets and mutual funds even before demat happened, used to follow his gut and invested in “anything and everything” till he reached the age of 50. “It’s a process of evolution. When you are new to something and much younger, you take a lot of risks. You speculate more than you invest,” says Iyer. What suddenly made Iyer’s become cautious? “After the red lines hit you below the belt, I realised I should be more prudent and study before making investments. I stopped taking risks after 50,” says Iyer, who retired from HDFC. This was the time when Iyer began to look only at the Nifty 50 stocks — or at best extended to 100 stocks on Nifty — which form the crux of his investments. Iyer’s trading accounts are restricted to proven brokerage houses only. Given his low appetite for risks now, new-age platforms of investments do not lure the likes of Iyer. The 61-year old Srinivas, a follower of Warren Buffet, has read ‘The Intelligent Investor’ twice. Srinivas, who started investing in the capital markets 25 years ago, does not believe in day trading. “I invest and don’t sell easily — only in emergencies. I believe in long-term investing and not short-term. The main purpose is wealth creation,” he says. He doesn’t monitor the market movements or his portfolio on a daily basis. But when he fancies a stock and smells an opportunity, he does pick them up. His secondary market investments are carried out by a broking firm, but Srinivas keeps a hawk’s eye on his portfolio of investments which he visits periodically. Call it an age factor, there is a pattern in which capital market traders undergo some change in their behaviour and attitudes towards investing and spending after a certain age. There’s been a marked change in Iyer’s philosophy of saving and spending after he turned 50. “My generation used to always spend less and save more. However, in the last 10-15 years, I have decided, if I have money, why should I save for tomorrow? I do save and invest 15-20% of my income, but I do not hold back on my expenses now. I like to travel in India and abroad,” says Iyer, an avid cricket fan who has attended the World Cup tournaments. This was a conscious decision. “It’s a beautiful world out there — we should enjoy the small pleasures,” he says. Dewasthale’s demeanour has changed as well. Earlier, at 9-9:30, he would be keenly viewing the market movements. Nowadays, he does that maybe twice a week. His advice to young investors is simple: don’t believe in rumors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/my-doctor-says-problems-start-after-60-so-treading-cautiously/articleshow/86495168.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Kolkata||Residents thank plastic ban for saving Bangur Avenue from waterlogging woes||Kolkata: For residents of Bangur Avenue, which was once infamous for being waterlogged every monsoon, that sinking feeling has been absent for the past few years. After the recent spells of rain, several city pockets have been waterlogged, including Dum Dum Park and Lake Town. But Bangur Avenue remained free of inundation even on Tuesday. One of the biggest reasons for this change is that the locality off VIP Road has been a no-plastic zone for more than a decade. Sunil Kumar Kedia, who runs a stationary shop in the locality, said that earlier, an hour-long downpour used to be enough to flood the locality. “A sustained heavy shower would put 2ft of water in my shop, which would take at least a week to drain. But for more than five years now there has been no significant waterlogging,” said Kedia. This time, when the city was lashed by more than 150mm rain, Bangur was only ankle deep under water in some stretches. By Tuesday, that had receded as well. “The last time our locality had a waterlogging issue was in the monsoon of 2007 when the entire area was submerged — in knee- or chest-deep water in a few places — for days. Things started improving gradually and now a heavy downpour like the one this time only flooded a few lanes. And that, too, was barely for a day,” said Mrinal Deb, a resident of Block A. The transformation began with the Bangur Avenue Residents’ Association and the then ward councillor, Mriganka Bhattacharya, imposing a plastic ban. The ban started as early as 2000, but strict implementation started after the 2007 flooding. Whether it is meat, fish, vegetable or fruit, customers are handed their purchase in paper packets. Even multinational food chains and department stores in the locality do not use plastic bags, not even the thicker ones. Additionally, KMDA set up a drainage pumping station in 2011 to help solve the inundation issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/residents-thank-plastic-ban-for-saving-bangur-avenue-from-waterlogging-woes/articleshow/86493338.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Patna||Caste census: JD(U) awaits PM’s statement||PATNA: With the Centre, in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, virtually ruling out caste census in 2021, the ruling and opposition parties in Bihar are unhappy as the all-party delegation led by CM Nitish Kumar had earlier pressed for caste census before PM Narendra Modi last month. The all-party delegation that Nitish led comprised leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, as well as legislature party leaders in the House of ten parties, including the JD(U), BJP, RJD, Congress, CPI(ML), AIMIM, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), CPM and CPI. State BJP president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal, however, said the decision of the Centre to have the 2021 census according to the past practice was justified. JD(U) leader and minister in the Nitish Kumar government, Sanjay Kumar Jha, the party was always in favour of caste census in the country. “A delegation of all the political parties, including the BJP, had presented its case before the PM. Now, we in the JD(U) will wait for what the PM has to say. We are expecting a positive response,” Jha said. Meanwhile, after a meeting of the five-party Grand Alliance partners of the RJD, Congress, CPI(ML), CPI and CPM on Friday, RJD leader Tejashwi said, “We are in favour of caste census, but the Centre has made its position clear. Now, we will wait for what the CM says.” BJP state president Dr Jaiswal said the Centre had pointed out in the affidavit that it had not used the data furnished by the 2011 socio-economic caste census (SECC) as the raw data available was too large and complicated to sort out and use. Dr Jaiswal said the 2011 caste census had thrown up 4.28 lakh castes. “Even in the 1931 census, the British government had done the caste census of only 24 prominent castes and it was never the general caste census. Therefore, the 2021 census will be conducted in the manner as has been done since 1951 in the post-independence period,” he said. Meanwhile, national spokesperson of Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), Dev Jyoti, said party chief Mukesh Sahani still hoped that the PM would consider the demand of political parties of Bihar to conduct caste-based census.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/caste-census-jdu-awaits-pms-statement/articleshow/86491654.cms||Abhay Singh

Even after five days, several parts of New Town remained under water on Friday. In many complexes, the pump rooms were submerged. In others, the accumulated water has seeped into underground reservoirs. The demand for water has gone up because residents have been instructed to scrub and flush the walls of the reservoirs with bleaching powder and water and then pump out the water to remove contamination. The PHE officials are visiting the complexes to collect water samples for tests. “We have increased water production and supply to New Town. Reservoirs in many complexes have reportedly been contaminated. As a result, we have issued the advisory to residents to scrub and flush the tanks with bleaching powder before refilling. This has increased water demand,” said an PHE executive engineer. The department is also treating the water with chlorine to avoid bacterial pollution due to submergence. “We have increased the rate of treatment of the water being supplied,” said the engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/have-boiled-water-phe-advises-new-town-locals/articleshow/86493428.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Such was the blast intensity, that it not only shook the entire market but also caused much damage to nearby shops. According to the police, the explosion took place at around 9:30am when the duo, identified as Razaq Kana (54) and Raees Kana (22) both are the residents of Upleta town, was trying to cut open the compressor of an old refrigerator using a gas cutter. Assistant superintendent of police, Jetpur, Sagar Bagmar told TOI that it is not clear what caused the blast. “The forensic team and bomb disposal squad are also investigating,” said Bagmar, not denying the possibility of an explosion. This incident occurred when the cutlery market was jam packed. According to eyewitnesses, the blast was so powerful that body parts of the victims were strewn across the area. While the entire market tumbled from the shake, the blast led to cracks on the walls of nearby shops. Shutter of a shop too was badly damaged, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/powerful-blast-in-upleta-scrapyard-kills-man-son/articleshow/86491700.cms||---

The results were declared on Friday. A mining engineer from Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Budania completed his schooling from Adarsh Vidhya Mandir School in Churu. His interest in engineering made him the first from his extended family to have cracked bagged a seat a premiere engineering school by scoring 2,986 rank in the entrance exam. “I was offered a package of Rs Rs 10 lakh per annum for a job at Hindustan Zinc Ltd, but I chose to appear for civil services exam. It was not an easy call for me to deny a job offer which could help me alleviate the financial status of my family,” said elated Budania. Son of government school teacher, Ram Prasad Budania, the UPSC topper started preparing for the civil services in 2016. He cracked the RAS-2018 examination, the result of which were announced in 2021. He had scored 12 rank and finished his training in July. “I was about to receive the order for my posting as a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), but destiny chose some other path for the same goal, which is service of the nation,” said Budania, whose life’s aim is to see his village receive potable drinking water. Entire life he has been drinking salty water as his village lies in the harshest arid region with salty groundwater. “My teeth are yellowish due to high saltwater intake. I hope to bring fresh water to all villages in my region so that nobody suffers from any health hazard,” said Budania. Explaining the impact he can bring with a degree in mining and as a civil servant, he said, “What all I have learned in my engineering classes have exposed me to shortcomings at the administration. There can be a better coexistence between engineering and governance. I will certainly advocate the use of scientific temperament in administration, which will lead to positive development in the society,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ras-officer-from-churu-townbags-13th-rank-in-upsc-exam/articleshow/86494821.cms||---
---||Patna||Amid Covid threat, Durga Puja to be a low-key affair in Patna||PATNA: With less than a fortnight to go for Navaratra, several Durga Puja organisers in the city have decided to keep the celebrations a low-key affair this time due to Covid threat. There will be small pandals and little decoration to ensure small gathering of devotees on Saptami, Ashtami and Navami which will fall on October 12, 13 and 14, respectively. Sanjiv Prasad Toni, chairperson of Navyuvak Sangh Shree Durga Puja Samiti Trust, Dak Bungalow, said they have decided to reduce the size of the pandal and do away with decorations. “No idol will be made. Simple illumination will be there and kalash-sthapna will be held on October 7. Local artisans will erect a small pandal. The priest who will perform the Puja rituals this time is from Darbhanga,” he said, adding special arrangements would be made for prasad distribution. Vijay Vahini Durga Puja Samiti at Anandpuri has started decorating the pandal on rainbow theme, which symbolises hope and the beauty after the storm. “A community puja pandal on the theme of the Kedarnath Temple will come up ahead of the celebration,” said the committee’s convener Santosh Kumar. “The height of the pandal will be smaller than previous years. Due to the pandemic, we are not making the celebration a grand affair this time. All the artisans are local and everyone is vaccinated against Covid-19,” Kumar said. Saurabh Bhattacharya, assistant secretary of Bengali Akhara Durga Puja Samiti, said, “The decoration will be a simple one. However, there will be no compromise with prasads and other ingredients used in performing rituals. The ‘Matri mudra’ idol of Durga will be 12 to 14 feet high. Earlier, we had planned to serve the prasad on clay pot. However, due to pandemic, we have dropped this idea,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/amid-covid-threat-durga-puja-to-be-a-low-key-affair-in-patna/articleshow/86491370.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Onion prices crash at Kurnool market yard||AMARAVATI: A steep fall in prices of onion in the wholesale market is pushing farmers towards a debt trap. Matters worsened after traders disappeared from the purchase scene at Kurnool agriculture market yard, the nodal centre for sales in the region. The traders, who initially refused to pick up the stocks citing inferior quality, subsequently boycotted purchases, refusing to take part in the online purchase mode. After the intervention of local public representatives and senior officials, traders finally agreed to resume transactions on Thursday. However, the situation has not improved at the field level as many wholesale traders are yet to return. In fact, traders have been offering a very low price for the Kurnool stock for the past several weeks, resulting in a crisis in the market. “They are offering Rs 250 to Rs 300 per quintal, which means that one kilo of stock costs just Rs 3. We can’t even get picking cost from this amount,” said K Ramireddy of Meenaiahgari Palle village in Kurnool. According to farmers, the investment cost per quintal would be anywhere around Rs 600 to Rs 800. Farmers purchased onion seed at Rs 1,100 to Rs 1,500 per kilo. They would require at least 20 kg of seed for cultivating one acre of land. The initial investment per acre would come to Rs 30,000 while the total investment including fertilizer, labour and lease amount would touch Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.4 lakh per acre. Farmers have been cultivating around 100 quintals from an acre. With each quintal fetching just between Rs 300 to Rs 400, total returns are less than Rs 40,000 per acre, which is nearly 60-70% less than the investment cost. A farmer, who takes his stock all the way to Hyderabad due to the closure of the Kurnool market, ends up borrowing to pay for his return journey and food as he could only fetch enough to cover for transport after selling 500 quintals. In spite of the low wholesale price of Rs 3 to Rs 4 per kg, the price by the time it reaches the retail market is Rs 30 per kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/onion-prices-crash-at-kurnool-mkt-yard/articleshow/86491108.cms||Samdani MN

Of the nearly 38.5 lakh violators, officials have recorded 11.3 lakh cases in Visakhapatnam district alone, which accounts for about 30% of the total cases. Guntur reported the lowest number of violations among all districts at 41,888. In monetary terms, Chittoor collected Rs 5.7 crore from these cases, followed by Anantapur (Rs 4.61 crore). In tandem with its case numbers, Guntur has realised Rs 41 lakh in the form of penalties, the lowest among districts. These violations range from not wearing masks in public places and flouting social distancing norms to social gatherings in excess of permissible strength, public consumption of tobacco, curfew violations, etc. Meanwhile, the public on their own have raised 66 complaints through the recently announced official WhatsApp number (8010968295) for reporting Covid-19 violations. People from Anantapur have alone made 25 complaints, while there have been no complaints from districts such as Prakasam, Srikakulam and Kadapa. According to the state officials, the citizens have to send photographic evidence with location details to the WhatsApp number to initiate action. They can also track the status of their complaints. The state government has prohibited using smokeless tobacco products and spitting in public by invoking the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. Among other directives to prevent the spread of the pandemic, the state government has also directed that wearing of face masks is compulsory in public places, workplaces and during commute, which otherwise will attract a penalty. Based on transmission rates and daily Covid-19 case numbers, the health department is revising the number of guests that can attend a social gathering such as wedding and birthday parties. The case of night curfew timings is similar. As per guidelines, individuals must maintain a minimum distance of six feet in public places. Shops should ensure physical distancing among customers. Large public gatherings and congregations will continue to remain prohibited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/penalties-for-violating-covid-norms-cross-rs-30-crore-mark/articleshow/86490664.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Ever since the last of the Muslim families left the village after the 1981 communal riots, the Hindu residents not only maintain the mosque but also ensure timely five times ‘azan’ (call for prayers) using electronic devices. A local resident, Uday Kumar, said the mosque is like a living deity for them as its existence protected them from the devastation of floods and other natural calamities. He said when the last of the Muslim families left the village, the Hindus have taken up the upkeep of the mosque. “Funds for meeting the expenses of the mosque are collected from local residents. Every sacred work in the village begins with the attendance and prayers at the mosque,” Uday said. Even newlywed Hindu couples first visit the mosque to receive blessings before visiting a temple. Those leaving or visiting the village offer prayers there. Khalid Alam Bhutto, a resident of Biharsharif with his roots at Madi, said the original name of the village was Mandi, which later became Madi. “Muslims settled here at least three centuries ago. But after the communal riots in 1946, majority of them migrated to other places. My grandfather left the village and settled at Biharsharif,” Bhutto said. Bhutto’s is the only family that still has over 15 acres of cultivable land in the village. Md Bashir, originally from Madi but now a resident of Biharsharif, said, “Altogether 45 families of Muslims, 45 of kurmis and 10 others lived in the village till 1945. However, Muslim families started leaving the village after the 1946 communal riots and the remaining 12 families sold their assets and left the village soon after communal riots in 1981.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hindus-maintain-guard-this-mosque-in-nalanda-village/articleshow/86491222.cms||---

It was a complete turnaround from the earlier findings of the local police, which had booked the woman’s father and her two brothers for shooting dead the couple who wanted to get married against their wishes. Local police have rejected the “honour killing” theory now. Ashish Singh (25) and Bunty (22) were found dead in Naughava Narottam village on Thursday night. Bunty’s body was found in her home, on her bed. Ashish was found dead near the house. They were shot in the chest, from a close range. The next morning, local police had registered an FIR against the woman’s father, two brothers, village head and a distant relative under IPC section 302 (murder). Both the brothers were missing then. Now, after a week of investigation, police said that when the woman’s father saw the two bodies lying in the house. Out of fear, he dumped the man’s body at a distance of nearly 100 metres from his house and hid the pistol along with his blood-stained clothes in a field. Additional superintendent of police (ASP) Sanjay Kumar said, “A thorough investigation was carried out involving forensic experts, dog squad and a crime branch team. We had recovered the firearm discharge residue (FDR) from the hand of Ashish and forensic test has also confirmed the presence of FDR. “After getting this report, we took Kishanpal -- the woman’s father -- into custody for questioning. He said that he found Ashish and his daughter dead in his house and got scared which is why he dumped his body outside his house. He also dumped the pistol found near the bodies along with his blood stained shirt.” Ashish and Bunty were in a relationship for the last six years but their families were against it as they were born in the same ‘gotra’. Police have now charged the woman's father Kishanpal for causing disappearance of evidence and intentionally giving false evidence. He has also alleged that his daughter was shot dead by Ashish because she refused to go along with him. “We have booked Kishanpal under sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) and 193 (intentionally giving false evidence) and sent him to jail,” the ASP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/shahjahanpur-couples-death-no-honour-killing-jilted-lover-killed-woman-took-his-life-claim-cops/articleshow/86490593.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: People move out of flooded complexes in New Town||KOLKATA: Flooded homes, acute drinking water crisis and a possible power cut forced many residents of New Town complexes to shift out of the township. Accumulated water after Sunday’s downpour showed no signs of receding even on Friday. Safe drinking water is not easily available and, to top it all, on Thursday, the authorities announced a possible power cut in the township. Many residents have senior citizens and patients at home who have to go out for treatments, but the elevators have been shut since ground floors are flooded. The forecast of more rain early next week has also prompted many to leave. Most of these waterlogged pockets are in Action Area III while some are in Action Area I. “Several residents have shifted to their relatives’ homes outside New Town. Many people who still have their old houses but had shifted to New Town have gone back for the time being. The scramble to leave increased when it was announced that power in Action Area III might be shut. People did not want to further harassment,” said Mainak Kanrar, joint secretary of the Shukhobrishti residents’ association. IT professional Subhranghsu Ghosh, who has shifted to his in-laws’ place in Haridevpur, said, “Lifts were not working and there was no drinking water. But the tipping point was when they announcedthat power connection to the complexes in Action Area III might be severed. I then moved out with my family.” “My mother needs to visit the hospital once in a while. But the lifts have not been working since Sunday night. What if there is an emergency? I cannot take a risk, so, I decided to move to my old apartment on Bangur Avenue for now,” said Shilpa Jaiswal, a resident of Elita Garden Vista.  New Town Citizens Welfare Fraternity held a convention beside the New Town clock tower on Friday to find solutions to the waterlogging issue. “Something needs to be done to prevent waterlogging here,” said NTCWF secretary Samir Gupta. “The issue needs to be solved with proper planning, involving all stakeholders,” said New Town Forum and News chairperson Samaresh Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/people-move-out-of-flooded-complexes-in-new-town/articleshow/86493297.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Gujarat recorded a bell-shaped Covid graph with alarmingly rapid rise in cases with a peak of 14,605 cases on April 30, at the rate of 10 cases every minute. The fall was equally sharp at 2,230 cases on May 30, a seven-fold decline. This steep rise and fall in Covid-19 cases during the second wave baffled common man and scientists alike. A Gujarat Biotechnology Research Center (GBRC) study has now revealed that a mutation in Delta-variant of Covid-19 virus led to much faster immune response in hosts triggering a rapid generation of antibodies thus paving way for the coveted `herd immunity’ against the virus. A paper titled ‘Defective ORF8 dimerization in Delta variant of SARS CoV2 1 leads to abrogation of ORF8 MHC-I interaction and overcome suppression of adaptive immune response’ by the researchers fromGBRC claimed that Delta variant’s inherent design may have led to higher antibody levels even when the person was mildly infected. The Delta variant of the virus caused rapid antibody generation, something which was not seen in the earlier variants. “Due to two missing amino acids on ORF8 protein in the Delta variant, it cannot hold MHC-1 – the cell surface molecules that alert the immune system in humans – tightly. We hypothesize that the weaker binding resulted in early alert to the immune system that got triggered after Covid, however milder,” said a researcher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/delta-triggered-higher-antibodies-in-gujaratis/articleshow/86493461.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Vijayawada||Director of edu asked to appear before HC||Vijayawada: The high court on Friday expressed displeasure over the manner in which private aided educational institutions are being taken over by the state government. After perusing the details submitted by the petitioners abut the proceedings issued by the Kadapa district education officer, the court observed that “prima facie it appears that what officials told the court and what they are doing on the ground are contrary to each other. If they act smart, we can act smarter than them”. Hearing a petition filed by various educational institutions and students studying in them challenging the ordinance issued by the state government to take over the management of private aided schools and to absorb the staff into government service, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice J Uma Devi said it’s evident from the proceedings issued by the DEO that the officials were pressurising schools to give consent for takeover by the government. The state government had earlier told the high court that the new ordinance was intended to take over only those schools which come forward voluntarily. It had also stated that the aid was being stopped to schools which surrender their staff to the government on voluntary basis. The court was also told that the government would utilise the services of teachers in an efficient manner to provide quality education to students by rationalising the schools. The counsel for the petitioner contended the government’s arguments and submitted the proceedings issued by the Kadapa DEO to his subordinate officers to get consent from school managements for takeover of the institutions’ staff. Taking a serious note, the high court suspended the DEO’s proceedings and asked the director of school education, Vadrevu Chinaveerabhadrudu, to appear before the court. The court also directed him to explain as to what action has been initiated against officials who pressurised school managements to give consent, and posted the matter for further hearing to September 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/director-of-edu-asked-to-appear-before-hc/articleshow/86491720.cms||Srikanth Aluri

However, as the FIR was not included with the petition, Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy declined to issue any order. Venkatesh pleaded the court for relief from arrest and sought directions to the police to issue 41A notices. Considering his arguments, Justice Roy directed the police not to take any coercive steps and to follow the procedure under 41A CrPC for investigating the case.

Days after the Centre told the Supreme Court that holding caste census of backward classes, except for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe, was administratively difficult, Lalu took to social media and alleged that BJP and RSS were deceiving people from backward and extremely backward categories. “If the central government cannot enumerate 60% of the population just by including an additional column, it’s shame on such government and MPs and ministers elected from these categories. They should be boycotted,” Lalu tweeted. In another tweet, he wrote, “If animals, insects and plants can be counted, why not people from backward and extremely backward categories? Why BJP-RSS has so much of hatred for backwards? Caste enumeration will benefit all. It will reveal the truth (sic).” Even Congress legislative party leader Ajit Sharma has criticised the Centre’s virtual; refusal to hold caste-based census. “Caste census is must. It will help the governments tailor their welfare schemes properly. The Centre, which is guided by RSS, is least bothered about the benefit of backwards. They have money and manpower for advertising, but cannot initiate caste-based census,” Sharma said. BJP’s state spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel said there was technical fault in the census done in 2011 as people had even mentioned their title as caste and nearly 4.28 lakh castes were registered then. “The same thing will happen again,” Ranjan said. “If states feel like getting it done, they can initiate the enumeration process themselves,” he added. It may be recalled that an all-party delegation from Bihar led by CM Nitish Kumar had met PM Narendra Modi last month and pushed for holding of caste-based census in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-slams-centre-for-ruling-out-caste-census/articleshow/86491710.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Checking up on the sensex has become a morning ritual for them, just like catching up on social media. Market corrections get these youngsters as excited as offers from e-tail players. They might find filing I-T returns taxing but are comfortable entering buy orders at limit prices on their brokers’ app. “Is IRCTC stock overvalued currently?” “Should I apply for the Paras Defence IPO?” “Why are sugar stocks rallying? Should I be buying?” These are some of the questions that come up on a WhatsApp group called ‘Financial Info’ created by a bunch of over 20-year-olds to discuss investments. Here profit-&-loss screenshots and links to news articles are shared apart from memes celebrating ITC stock rallies or back-to-back opportunities to buy-on-dips (market correction). Several Gen-Z investors (aged 25 and below), a growing share of retail investors, told TOI they make investment decisions after referring to financial reports, news articles, podcasts and opinions from a growing online community. Advice from ‘investing’ friends is another big factor that influences decisions such as which broker to choose and when to sell a stock. Freelance copywriter Progyaa Dutta (25) allots a couple of hours every month to look for under-performing stocks and buys them if she thinks their long-term growth potential is intact. “I purchase a stock only if I am convinced by the rationale behind a ‘buy’ call in an analyst or news report,” Progyaa, who started investing last year, said. Manjiri Satam (24) got hooked to the markets after she quit her job as an actuarial analyst early this year. “It hurts when I see how low the prices were last year. However, I have clocked 16% returns this year, which is decent as most of my savings are in FDs earning a measly 5%,” Manjiri said. Both Manjiri and Progyaa said they don’t buy stocks on a whim but instead use ‘watchlists’ with price alerts that come up in their notifications. Despite their relatively low initial capital (usually between Rs 50,000 and Rs 2 lakh), many youngsters understand that compounding will help them grow their money and hence intend to stay invested even after the pandemic. “Investing helps me keep up on what’s happening across the world. I prefer to read about different sectors, try to spot trends and then buy stocks,” said Neil, a 24-year-old who runs a homestay business in Alibaug. Social media platform Reddit has become a popular discussion platform for newbie investors. Forums like IndianStreetBets and IndiaInvestments have seen a surge in followers amid the pandemic. The posts in these forums range from “rate my portfolio” to “how to plan an exit strategy”. IndianStreetsBets member Austin Thekkanath (25), who recently quit his job to pursue an MBA, does his own research. “I have tried technical analysis, but it seemed like astrology to me,” he said. Austin, who has been investing since late 2019, aims to create a retirement corpus. Another 18-year-old Reddit user, who is an engineering student, started investing in February this year with small savings from his allowance and cash gifts. “I look at what makes a company better than its competitors and how it adds value to people’s lives,” the teenager, who didn’t wish to be named, said. “The idea is to build wealth and not try to become rich overnight,” he added. The influx of smartphone-holding millennial & Gen-Z investors has driven the share of trades made on the BSE via mobiles higher from about 6% in January 2020 to nearly 18% as of August 2021. Market veterans said the new generation’s investing behaviour is more mature compared to previous ones due to easy access to expert advice and ability to monitor portfolios. Dinesh Thakkar, CMD of Angel Broking, one of India’s largest stockbrokers, told TOI that the tech-savvy generation has grabbed the opportunity that brokers’ intuitive apps provided as there was no other option but to put savings into an asset that can earn better returns than FDs. “As age is on their side, they would like to take calculated steps towards creating wealth. It does not take time for them to understand how to protect themselves from market volatility or take advantage of it. There are many experts on social media. We have also created lots of nudges and educational programmes,” Thakkar said. The median age of customers added by Angel Broking in January-March 2021 was 30 and 75% of all trade orders were placed via its app.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/idea-is-to-build-wealth-not-become-rich-overnight/articleshow/86495093.cms||Aseem Gujar

Account aggregators allow accountholders to provide digital lenders to get access to their savings account history. This is one of the core principles behind ‘open banking’, allowing customers to access services from anywhere and stop being tied to their bank. With AA in the picture, digital lending apps that got a bad name because of their dependency on personal information, can now lend efficiently as they will have access to bank data. Shady digital lenders may die a natural death as regulated lenders can now provide the same service efficiently. In the past, lack of access to bank data made it difficult for regulated lenders leaving the field open for Chinese apps to provide loans by scraping personal data and other records which were used for recovery. Onemoney is the first off the block among the seven entities that have got permission. Other promoters include Cams Financial Information, Cookiejar Technologies, NSEL Asset Data, Yodlee, Perfios and PhonePe. “The account aggregator helps to democratise data and ‘sachetise’ financial products so that small-ticket loans, insurance and investment products are widely available,” said Krishna Prasad, founder CEO of FinTech Products and Solution, the company that own Onemoney AA. Onemoney already has on board ICICI, HDFC Bank, Axis and IndusInd Bank. It is in the process of onboarding SBI, Kotak and Federal Bank. With these lenders, over 60% of bank accounts in the country would get covered. Incidentally, the banks, which are categorised as financial information providers can also become financial information users by providing loans to customers of other banks. While AAs provide the same service, participants can differentiate themselves by giving better tech support to lenders and providing value-added services to accountholders outside loans. “We provide the financial information users with an SDK (software development kit), which allows them to seamlessly onboard borrowers onto the account aggregator platform. Accountholders can control access to their data using our app,” said Prasad. The app comes in two versions, one where the customers directly control the information. The second version is designed for those who require handholding with the help of business correspondents or heads of self-help groups. “For customers, besides access to financing we will provide them a single view of all their accounts and can support the role of personal finance manager,” said Prasad. “MSMEs and new-to-credit borrowers will be among the major beneficiaries of the AA framework as they lack access to formal credit. Using the AA framework, lenders can give credit based on verified data such as GST invoices, bank statements, securities information and other cash flow surrogates,” said an Emkay Finance report. The positive for digital lenders is the that the RBI is currently supportive of innovation. “As the system grows and matures, newer business models and customer offerings will pour in. While the RBI is open and encouraging to innovation, we need to bear in mind the fact that there is a need to maintain balance between innovation and spirit of the AA regulatory structure,” RBI deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao had said recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/a/c-aggregators-can-end-dodgy-loan-apps-menace/articleshow/86493505.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||RBI joins climate change fight||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: Banks received a clear message from the RBI last week — climate change is a risk to financial firms and there is a clear case to act early to ensure an orderly transition. This message came from RBI deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao in a speech at a conference on green and sustainable finance. This is the first time that the RBI has stated that the central bank is part of the fight against climate change. The regulator’s unequivocal stance came at a time former governor Raghuram Rajan had stirred a debate on the subject, stating that green policies were a purview of the government. His successor, Urjit Patel, believed that climate change should be incorporated in the central bank’s macroeconomic models. Rao making public the RBI’s stance of the need to weigh in on fighting climate change puts the onus on banks to act. Rao highlighted two major risks. The first of weather events that were a direct outcome of climate change and second the transitional risk or the compliance cost of adjustments to a low-carbon economy. He also highlighted the opportunities available for raising green finance. “Supporting innovation in new technologies (clean energy and climate-related R&D) is paramount, as is acting and investing in green infrastructure that uses better standards and lower-carbon production processes. The financial industry has a role in and responsibility to help develop new financial instruments to channel savings towards green initiatives to make them more sustainable, rewarding, and impactful,” said Rao. According to Sanjay Agarwal, head (India corporates) at Bank of America, banks are not only looking towards carbon footprint reduction of their borrowers but at broader sustainability goals across environmental, social, governance (ESG). The opportunity for lenders in India is the willingness of global refinancers to accept lower margins on green debt. Bank of America has made a $1.5-trillion sustainable finance commitment by 2030, aligned to UN sustainable development goals. “Green bonds or loans work well in situations where clients can earmark end-use for green projects, which is usually not linked to enterprise-wide sustainability targets. Sustainability linked bonds or loans on the other hand can be raised for general corporate purposes and have certain sustainability targets like carbon emission reduction, waste reduction, water reduction consumption,” said Agarwal. On Thursday, Axis Bank has now become the first financial institution in India to have a standalone ESG committee at the board level as part of its plan to adopt ESG as a strategic driver for the organisation’s plans and performance. The bank was also the first in the country and second in Asia to raise $600 million of sustainable AT-1 bonds this month. By dedicating the funds to ESG, the private lender managed to raise funds at 4.1%. “Over the past two years, we have been working on bolstering our holistic strategy, governance, and performance benchmarks around ESG. These commitments are part of our longer-term ESG strategy woven around our purpose of banking that leads to a more inclusive and equitable economy, thriving community and a healthier planet,” said Rajesh Dahiya, executive director, Axis Bank. Floating sustainable bonds and investing them in green projects helps to counterbalance the lenders’ exposure to carbon-emitting sectors. Many multinational banks have said that they would stop lending to carbon-emitting sectors by 2030, which means the doors of global finance will be shut for India’s thermal projects. Top global reinsurers have already stopped reinsuring coal-based power projects, which is straining domestic underwriting capacity. For lenders, green financing helps counterbalance these risks. “I see a push-pull strategy at work here. It will become increasingly harder to fund projects which have not been holistically evaluated from an ESG perspective. Lenders are incentivising corporates having sound ESG strategies in place with completive financing,” said Agarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-joins-climate-change-fight/articleshow/86493586.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Tatas lead wealth creation among India’s biz houses||The country’s conglomerates have not only gained heft in the market but have also created wealth for shareholders big time. Thanks to the sizzling rally in group companies’ share prices and speedy recovery in their earnings after the first Covid wave, market capitalisations of India’s fabled business houses surged, adding to shareholders’ kitty. Not surprisingly, India’s largest group by revenue, the House of Tatas, is the largest wealth-creator for shareholders. Its 28 listed entities together added more than Rs 6 lakh crore wealth for investors since January this year — a return of over 40%. Next is Reliance Industries (RIL) Group, controlled by Mukesh Ambani. Its nine listed firms cumulatively added close to Rs 4 lakh crore wealth for investors, a return of 28%. Bajaj is the third-largest wealth creator for investors followed by Adani, while Aditya Birla and L&T are neck and neck in the fifth spot(see graphic). “The highest wealth creation has come from the Tata Group and rightly so. Not only is the quantum of its contribution the highest but, more importantly, it is the most diversified group and also has the largest shareholder base (85 lakh) thus providing a larger slice of the pie to public shareholders,” said RippleWave Equity Advisors partner Mehul Savla. Seven of the top 10 business groups ranked according to their market capitalisations outperformed the sensex (see graph for returns). Two of them, RIL and Mahindra delivered broadly in line with the performance of the sensex, while HDFC Group underperformed. Hero (owned by the Delhi-based Munjals), Indiabulls, and Future (led by the beleaguered Kishore Biyani) groups gave negative returns. The sensex delivered a return of 26% since January this year. “Strong recovery in earnings after the first wave of Covid and a re-rating of companies where valuations turned attractive during the crises have been the driving factors for the rise in market capitalisation of top business groups,” said Sharekhan BNP Paribas research head Sanjeev Hota. “Moreover, a global flush of liquidity and overall equity re-rating has kept the buying interest in these companies through both domestic and foreign institutional funds.” On the flip side, Hota said, “Questionable corporate governance and weak earnings coupled with a troubled balance sheet were the factors for wealth destroyers in many companies.” The low-profile CK Mehta Group, which owns Deepak Fertiliser and Deepak Nitrite, created the fastest wealth for shareholders, generating over 150% return this year. On the other hand, the Rajan Raheja Group, which runs Exide Industries, Prism Johnson and Standard Batteries, created the slowest wealth for shareholders, generating just 4% returns. “The strong performance of the phenolics and chemicals businesses propelled the stunning returns by the CK Mehta Group, while there’s an overhang of the challenging battery business (Exide) on the Rajan Raheja Group stock,” said Motilal Oswal Financial Services CEO (broking and distribution) Ajay Menon. Savla of RippleWave said returns have varied across corporate groups reflecting the “divergence in sector trends with technology and commodities leading the pack while autos lagged”. With the sensex now topping 60,000 points, one group has topped too: shareholders of India’s corporate houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-lead-wealth-creation-among-indias-biz-houses/articleshow/86495221.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The state transport department figures also revealed around 10% rise in the number of people getting injured in 2021, compared to 2019. The figures of 2020 were not taken into account because of complete lockdown from March 23 till Unlock 1.0 in May. As many as 4,040 persons died and 4,402 got injured in the 5,016 road accidents in the state between January and June this year, compared to 5,493 accidents, 4,027 deaths and 4,002 injuries during the period in 2019. Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the department has decided to keep record of all road accidents and injuries, even the minor ones. “All the data related to road accidents will be computerised. The trial run of a mobile application developed to create a data base has been going on in several districts,” he said. “There are 115 black spots in Bihar and most of them are on national highways (NHs) and state highways (SHs). Black spots are those where 10 or more deaths are reported in a year. Now, we have formed teams in every districts to identify the grey spots to reduce road accidents. The team will identify the spots where five deaths and more than 10 accidents took place in a year. Based on the data, the department will be able to work on 4 Es of road safety — education, enforcement, engineering and emergency care,” Agarwal said. “In 50% of the road accidents, trucks, lorries or heavy commercial vehicles are involved. Though there was a complete lockdown in Bihar in 2020. commercial vehicles were allowed to ply in 2021,” he said. Agarwal further said that chances of road accidents have increased when things are manual. “Now, we have automated driving test track in Patna and Aurangabad. All the drivers will have to go through this test before they get their driving licences. After the automated driving test, there will be less scope for fault among the drivers and road accidents will also be reduced. The driving tracks will be developed in all the districts by next financial year and ten districts will get the tracks by March 2022,” Agarwal said. Meanwhile, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report released recently mentioned 8,633 accidents and 6,634 deaths from January to December in 2020 while 10,007 accidents and 7,205 deaths during the same period in 2019. Of which, 7,177 died due to negligence relating to road accidents and 1,385 were victims of hit and run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/8-fall-in-road-accidents-but-0-3-rise-in-fatalities/articleshow/86490967.cms||Faryal Rumi

Earlier, banks were barred from selling NPAs classified as fraud, which had left them saddled with a resolution of several large accounts. Banks are targeting to sell Rs 2 lakh crore worth of NPAs to the bad bank or the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL) for recovery. However, they have hit a roadblock in respect of accounts that have been classified as fraud, as they were not allowed to sell them. RBI has now allowed banks to sell fraud accounts, provided the transferee is not connected to the borrower. RBI has also said that responsibilities of the transferor with respect to continuous reporting, monitoring, filing of complaints with law enforcement agencies and proceedings related to such complaints shall also be transferred to the ARC. “The transfer of such loan exposures to an ARC, however, does not absolve the transferor from fixing the staff accountability as required under the extant instructions on frauds,” RBI said. “Due to forensic audit in all big NPAs, in last three years, advances amounting Rs 3.83 lakh crore were declared as fraud accounts. Now, This big chunk of NPAs will be available for sale to ARCs in general and specifically to NARCL in case of large advances with consortium lending,” Hari Hara Mishra, director, UV ARC, said. According to RBI in respect of large frauds, the average time lag between occurrence and classification was 57 months. This meant that there is the possibility that some defaults are yet to be classified as fraud. This would considerably reduce the pool of loans available for sale. RBI data shows that in FY21 3,501 loan accounts amounting to Rs 1.4 lakh crore were classified fraud. In FY20 the number was 4,608 accounts for Rs 1.8 lakh crore while in FY19 its 2603 accounts with Rs 64,539 crore. Some of the large accounts that have been classified as fraud by lenders include DHFL and IL&FS which are undergoing an RBI initiated and government-initiated resolution process respectively. Other large accounts are Bhushan Power and Steel, which has been already resolved by lenders and Cox and Kings, which is undergoing investigation. Bank of Baroda and PNB had classified the account of Reliance Home Finance as fraud but the same was stayed by the Delhi High Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-can-sell-fraud-npas-to-asset-recast-cos-says-rbi/articleshow/86495867.cms||---

Keen on detecting the infection when it is still in its early stages, when it is much easier to treat the patients The students were admitted to the hostels only after they furnished a certificate confirming they were not infected with Covid-19. In the past week, apart from the trio from Moraji Desai Residential School, two from Adarsha Government Model Residential School in Yelandur tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The students displayed symptoms of fever, cold, cough before they were subjected to a test for Covid-19. Since the schools were reopened for classes six to ten only three weeks ago, the district administration is understandably worried. All the 398 students at the Adarsha school were tested as part of a random drive, and two of them tested positive for the novel coronavirus. “Instructions have been issued to all the taluk health officer in Chamarajanagar to carry out a similar random testing drive in all schools in Hanur, Kollegal, Chamarajanagr, Gundlupet and Yelandur. The department has already tested students in 16 residential schools,” Chamarajanagar district health officer Dr KM Vishweshwaraiah told TOI. Chamarajanagar’s in-charge deputy director of public instruction Manjunath said, “I have inspected both the residential schools where the students tested positive. Those heading residential schools in the district have been advised to direct students displaying symptoms of Covid-19 to undergo a test compulsorily. But we have heard complaints of students being reluctant to subject themselves to a test.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/cnagar-health-dept-on-alert-after-five-schoolkids-test-positive-for-covid/articleshow/86490557.cms||---

BJP, which is now trying to come to power in HDMC, is also making efforts to grab the MLC seat. The party is planning to field incumbent Pradeep Shettar as its candidate, whereas Congress is looking for a new candidate as is sitting MLC Srinivas Mane is reluctant to contest this poll. He wants to contest the assembly election from Hangal According to sources, both the national parties have decided to field a single candidate as earlier. If BJP’s Pradeep Shettar refuses to contest, then there will be competition in the party for the ticket. Lingaraj Patil and Shivaram Sajjanar from Haveri are said to have expressed their willingness to contest the election before party leaders, said sources. Lingaraj Patil, president of the BJP Disciplinary Committee, said, “I am in BJP for 32 years. I know the constituency and have worked hard to strengthen the party in undivided Dharwad district which consists of Haveri, Dharwad and Gadag. If the party gives me a chance to contest, I will definitely win.” In Congress, there are many ticket aspirants including former minister AM Hindasgeri, Saleem Ahemad, Shakir Sanadi, Altaf Hallur, Ismail Tamatgar, Anand Gaddadevarmath, Mohammed Yusuf Savanur and others. According to party sources, Congress has decided to field candidates from the minority community due to the lobbying by community leaders. Former minister AM Hindasgeri said, “I am also an aspirant for the ticket. I have been actively involved in the activities related to the cooperative sector since 1994 and currently I am an elected director in the All India Urban Cooperative Banks Federation. I have been a two-term MLA, a two-term MLC and minister twice. The party will also consider all the experiences that I have.” There are rumours that a former MLA and senior JD(S) leader is expected to join Congress and that he will be fielded as the candidate from the party. When contacted former Navalgund JD(S) MLA NH Konaraddi said, “I haven't decided anything right now. It is left to the workers and followers to decide and I am the candidate for the assembly election,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/political-churn-begins-ahead-of-mlc-polls/articleshow/86491069.cms||J Abbas Mulla

I want to see them perform well in the Ranji Trophy too,” said former Aussie cricketer Dav Whatmore who has joined the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) as head coach and mentor. “All the formats of the cricket are important so the team should perform well in the longer version of the game too. I have already had a word with coaches of all the categories and firstly I want to focus on improving the mental strength of the boys,” Whatmore told TOI. Impressed with the fitness of the Baroda boys, Whatmore said that being mentally and physically strong helps in performing for a longer period of time. Though he refused to comment on the immediate steps he wants to take as the head coach, Whatmore did say that having 30 to 35 players in the pool for senior teams is too much. “One cannot focus on so many players and hence the pool of probables has to be reduced so that we can work on quality cricketers. But no decision has been taken on the number of players to be culled from the probables pool,” he added. He has also suggested the association to start its own T20 league ahead of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. “We might unearth some talented cricketers from the Baroda Premier League,” he felt. The 66-year-old former batsman, who played seven Test matches for Australia, has a vast experience in coaching international teams like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Zimbabwe and Nepal. He was head coach of the Sri Lankan team that won the 50-over World Cup in 1996. BCA officials said that he will be an asset to their teams. Though he has been appointed as head coach of the senior teams, Whatmore said that he would also like to nurture the junior cricketers. “They are our future who will play for the state team. I am keen to share my knowledge with junior cricket team coaches too,” Whatmore said. He was hired as the head coach of Baroda team in April last year but Whatmore couldn’t join the BCA due to restriction on international travel amid the Covid pandemic. He then went on to join the Nepal cricket team as their coach for one season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/want-baroda-to-do-well-in-ranji-trophy-whatmore/articleshow/86491252.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Business||D-St to Wall-St: Investors bet on foreign cos via MFs||Several Indians are investing in international markets like the US and China through the mutual fund (MF) route in a bid to diversify their portfolios. Strong market rallies and appreciation of foreign currencies are other factors contributing to rising flows in the niche category, a trend that has picked up in the last couple of years. Most major asset management companies offer mutual funds that invest in stocks listed abroad, including through fund of funds (FoF), exchange-traded fund (ETF) structures. Investing in foreign companies like Amazon and Alibaba through mutual funds turns out to be cheaper than buying their stocks directly for Indian investors. RBI data released last week showed that investments made by Indian mutual funds in foreign stocks jumped over three and half times in FY21 to Rs 20,865 crore from Rs 5,808 crore at the end of March 2020. The launch of several new funds this year is expected to give a further boost. A combination of factors, including new entrants into the market, has led Indians to explore options to invest outside India in the last one and half years, according to Niranjan Avasthi, head of product marketing and digital business at Edelweiss Mutual Fund. “Overall, investing has taken off. People have also realised there are good opportunities to invest outside India…it could be because of fund returns, awareness campaigns,” Avasthi said. According to Ashwin Patni, head of products and alternatives head at Axis Mutual Fund, though there will be a home market bias, the share of allocation to international funds will grow to about 10% in five years. “We (investors) understand the opportunities the Indian market presents better, so we will always prefer to have a large allocation to the domestic market. There was virtually zero allocation to global markets, so from there it will move to a more material number, eventually, 15-20% of capital will go to non-home markets,” Patni said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/d-st-to-wall-st-investors-bet-on-foreign-cos-via-mfs/articleshow/86495416.cms||Aseem Gujar
---||Vijayawada||Duggirala prez poll put off over lack of quorum||Guntur: The suspense over the election of president of Duggirala mandal parishad in Guntur district is continuing as the authorities put off the election due to lack of quorum on Friday. The election authorities adjourned the meeting as the MPTC members of TDP and Jana Sena abstained from the special meeting held to elect the mandal president. Interestingly, the local legislator Alla Ramakrishna Reddy along with eight YSRCP members stayed in the meeting hall till the presiding officer put off the election process. Returning officer Ram Prasanna said that they would conduct the election on Saturday. Tension prevailed in Mangalagiri constituency particularly about Duggirala MPP election as both YSRCP and TDP have taken it as prestige issue. While YSRC bagged eight MPTCs, TDP got nine and Janasena, one. The MPP election has become more curious after the tehsildar refusing to issue BC certificate to the lone eligible candidate Shaik Jameela in the TDP camp. The post of MPP is reserved for BC woman. Although the Jana Sena member reported to have agreed to support the TDP, the alliance had no eligible candidate to contest the election after the tehsildar turned down Jameela’s application to recognize her as BC community. Speaking to the media, MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy said that TDP had tried to kidnap two of their members to win the MPP post. He said that TDP’s game plan backfired as their members stick to their loyalty to the party. “It is surprising that TDP abstained from the meeting despite winning nine members. They have no faith in democracy,” alleged Alla. He said that YSRCP would surely win the MPP post and also cooption members whenever the election was held. Although YSRCP won more than 95 per cent mandals, the election of presidents has become a tough task in few places due to the internal rife in the party. Election in a few mandals in Vizianagaram, Srikakulam and West Godavari districts were also postponed to Saturday. “Elections to MPPs were held peacefully in most of the places. It is obvious that there will be more aspirants for the prized posts since the party won overwhelming number of seats,” said government advisor and YSRCP general secretary Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/duggirala-prez-poll-put-off-over-lack-of-quorum/articleshow/86491208.cms||Samdani MN
---||Business||Sebi cancels 2 commodities brokers’ permits||TNN Mumbai: Markets regulator Sebi has cancelled the registration of two commodities brokers, Joindre Commodities and Pragya Commodities, for their role in the NSEL scam of 2013. The certificate was cancelled since these brokers did not meet its ‘fit & proper’ criteria. Industry experts said that several other commodity brokers have also been served similar show-cause notices and may result in such actions. Since Sebi is also the regulator for the stock market, all the brokers who are found to be unfit to be commodity brokers may see their stock broking licences also cancelled, industry players said. In the two orders against the commodity market brokers, Sebi said that Joindre Commodities and Pragya Commodities had indulged in trading practices on the NSEL platform which were not allowed by the government and Forward Markets Commission (FMC), the then regulator for the commodities trading segment. The NSEL scam came out in the open in August 2013 and, two years after that, FMC was merged into Sebi. Since the scam came out in the open, trading on NSEL has been stopped by the government. Industry sources said that they were aware of several show-cause notices from Sebi to commodity brokers alleging similar violations like in the case of Joindre Commodities and Pragya Commodities. There are several large players that have also been served notices. “If Sebi passes similar orders, some of the large stock brokers will may also face closure,” said a source. A pan-India body of commodity brokers has already moved Sebi to arrive at a consent mechanism for settling these cases. However, the regulator is yet to agree to such requests. Under Sebi’s consent mechanism, the entity that has been issued a show cause notice, may prefer to pay a monetary penalty to settle the case with admitting or denying its fault.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-cancels-2-commodities-brokers-permits/articleshow/86495813.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Met office spies two back-to-back weather systems coming your way||KOLKATA: The city and south Bengal could be hit by two low-pressures in succession this weekend and on Tuesday, with the second one predicted to trigger heavy rain in the city and its surrounding districts.  While a “well-marked” low-pressure area over east-central Bay of Bengal is now approaching the Odisha coast and could strike on Sunday, another cyclonic circulation — again over east-central Bay — could lead to heavy showers in Kolkata on September 28. “The first one could have minimal impact on Kolkata since the system is moving towards the Odisha coast. But the second one, which is set to form on Saturday, could have a strong impact. We expect the system to move towards north Bay of Bengal by Tuesday and then move into Gangetic Bengal. This may result in heavy rainfall in Kolkata and across south Bengal,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. He added the Odisha-bound system, too, could lead to showers in Kolkata on Sunday. It is set to develop into a depression on Saturday, but the rain could be light to moderate. “The second system, however, should trigger heavy rain, though only in the city and its surrounding districts. Since it’s set to move into north Bay, the impact on Gangetic Bengal is likely to be higher,” said Das. The RMC has issued a heavy rain warning for Kolkata on September 28, along with East and West Midnapore, Jhargram, Purulia, South and North 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and Bankura. One or two places in Midnapore and South 24 Parganas are likely to receive heavy rain on Monday. On Friday, the city received sunshine and remained dry for most part of the morning, though it turned cloudy subsequently and some areas got occasional drizzles. According to the Met office, local clouds that have been forming in south Bengal have been triggering the showers since Wednesday and may continue till Sunday when the depression is likely to hit Gangetic Bengal and Kolkata. The Met office said the two systems could lead to a rise in water level of rivers, waterlogging in municipal areas, damage to crops and kachcha roads. People have been advised to stay safe from lightning strikes and avoid old and dilapidated buildings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/met-office-spies-two-back-to-back-weather-systems-coming-your-way/articleshow/86493157.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

As a result, the monthly SIP inflows have been rising since November last year with some dips in between. The number of SIP accounts, called folios in trade terms, has also been rising steadily. Industry experts said that long-term investors have remained firmly on track in equity funds, which resulted in record monthly inflows through the SIP route. In August the inflows through this route had jumped to Rs 9,923 crore, an all-time high level, from Rs 9,608 crore in July. This is the second consecutive month of Rs 9,000-crore-plus net inflows through the SIP route, data from industry trade body AMFI showed. Interestingly, investors who invest through the SIP route also recommend the same to others. A recent survey by Aditya Birla MF found that as high as 83% of the respondents to its survey with SIP investors showed that they were willing to recommend it to others as well. “Almost 50% of people think SIPs help in building long-term corpus with benefit of compounding interest and that would be the primary reason for them to recommend (this) way of investing,” it noted. August mutual fund assets under management data, the latest disclosed one that has been made available by AMFI, indicated that in several other types of funds, investors were booking profit since the leading indices have been hitting life-high levels on a regular basis. The rise in SIP folios has also been strong. AMFI data showed that so far in fiscal 2022, the total addition to the folios in the industry was nearly 60 lakh or about 16%. The Birla MF survey also found that since SIPs help maintain investment discipline, it was the single-most important reason for 35% of the respondents to choose this mode of investing. However, the survey also showed that 40% of the respondents started their first SIP in their 40s. Fund managers and investment advisers say that this should start even earlier and indicates that there is a necessity for spreading awareness about it, especially in smaller towns and cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/keeping-faith-highs-lows-dont-affect-sip-evangelists/articleshow/86495737.cms||---

The CM also announced that authorities of districts concerned would issue orders for procession and crowd management during upcoming festivals and the travellers coming from states having too many Covid cases would have to go through compulsory Covid test on arrival in Bihar. Nitish made all these announcements through a series of posts on his Twitter handle, soon after he chaired a meeting of the high-powered crisis management group (CMG), comprising senior members of his cabinet and the state’s top bureaucrats, to review the current scenario of Covid pandemic in the state. “The Covid restrictions have yielded positive results. After reviewing the situation today, it has been decided to open all anganwadi centres, pre-primary and play schools from November 15, 2021,” he tweeted. In another post, he wrote, “All eligible people will be vaccinated. The other decisions of the previous meeting of the CMG will continue. Covid-appropriate behaviour and cautions are still necessary.” After the CMG meeting, state’s chief secretary Tripurari Sharan issued a fresh notification, announcing new relaxations in Covid restrictions. As per the fresh notification, the district authorities would issue orders at the local level for crowd management in the wake of the number of passengers coming from other states during the festivals and likely spread of infection. “The district administration will give special attention on two points while giving permission for erecting pandal during Durga Puja and holding local fairs: (a) the manager of pandal or fair and its workers must have taken at least one dose of Covid vaccine and (b) the space for pandal or fair must be barricaded and there must be an arrangement to check vaccination certificate of visitors at the entrance point,” the notification said, adding, “The health department will make arrangement of special camps for vaccination and Covid test near important pandals and fairs.” The health department will make arrangements for rapid antigen test at the entry points on the interstate borders, railway stations and airports for compulsory Covid test of the travellers. “The passengers carrying a RT-PCR negative report of the last 72 hours will be exempted from the rapid antigen test,” the notification said. “Wedding ceremonies can be organized in adherence to Covid guidelines and strict compliance of the updated standard operating procedures (SOPs). However, DJ and wedding procession will not be allowed. Local police stations must be informed about the wedding ceremony three days in advance,” the notification read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/anganwadi-centres-pre-primary-schools-to-reopen-from-november-15-nitish/articleshow/86491274.cms||Madan Kumar

The elections were held for 4,500 posts under 151 panchayats amid tight security. The security personnel foiled attempts of booth capturing by the candidates and their supporters at some places. Around 14,000 polling and 10,000 security personnel drawn from different wings of the state police were deployed at 2,119 polling booths under 12 blocks in 10 districts, which went to the polls in the first phase. The polling on booth numbers 144 and 145 at Bisaini village under Naugarh panchayat in Maoist-hit Aurangabad district remained disrupted for a while following clashes between two groups of people and subsequent stone pelting. Aurangabad SP Kantesh Kumar Mishra, however, denied the report of police firing to quell the troublemakers, who reportedly attempted to capture polling booths. Aurangabad SDO Vijayant Kumar and SDPO Gautam Sharan Omi visited the polling booths. Similarly, reports of clashes and attempts to capture booths were received from Unthu panchayat in Aurangabad district. In Nawada, a mukhiya candidate, Prince Singh, was arrested on charges of intimidating the voters at booth numbers 82 and 83 under Madhopur panchayat. Singh has also been accused of misbehaving with the police personnel. State panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary cast his vote at polling booth number 4 at Lakhanpur village under Tarapur block in Munger district. Choudhary later told mediapersons that EVMs were being used for the first time in the panchayat election in the state. There were 15,328 contestants in the fray for different posts of the three-tier panchayati raj institutions. Voting was held under Dawath and Sanjhauli in Rohtas district, Belaganj and Khijarsarai in Kaimur, Govindpur in Nawada, Kako in Jehanabad, Bandipur and Suryapur in Arwal, Tarapur in Munger, Sikandara in Jamui and Dhauraiya in Banka districts. The EVMs were used for the election of mukhiyas, panchayat samiti members, panchayat members and zila parishad members. Elections were held through ballot papers for the posts of sarpanchs and panchs. State Election Commission officials said that arrangements of web casting and biometric attendance of the voters were made to maintain transparency and avoid bogus voting. The voter turnout in Belaganj and Khizarsarai blocks of Gaya was 66% and 68%, respectively, till 5 pm. Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said five pink booths were made in each of the two blocks to encourage women voters.

Addressing a Bihar Police Building Construction Corporation (BPBCC) event after launching police building projects worth above Rs377.84 crore, the CM said as per the details provided to him, 15 police stations/outposts have so far not got land for the construction of their buildings, while the buildings for the other 234 police stations/outposts are under construction. “Similarly, 143 other police stations/outposts have been provided land, but their projects are at the ‘estimate preparation’ stages. For other 90 police stations/outposts, the department has so far only identified the land. The building projects of other 56 police stations/outposts are in the ‘process of tender’ till date,” the CM said. “Why construction works of these police stations have not been completed? Why such delay?” Nitish asked the officials while expressing his displeasure. “In almost every meeting with the DMs and the SPs, I keep reminding them of the construction of buildings for the remaining police stations. Why is land not being made available for the proposed buildings? It is the work of the home department. I am pained over such a delay. Even land has so far not been identified for 15 police stations/outposts,” he said. The CM asked development commissioner Amir Subhani, who was earlier heading the home department, to sit with the officials and expedite the pending construction works. He also asked chief secretary Tripurari Sharan to convene a meeting with the DMs concerned tomorrow itself and resolve the issue of non-availability of land for the 15 police stations within a week. Recalling the recruitment of the “highest number of women in Bihar police”, Nitish asked the officials to ensure their deployment at all police stations. “I hereby ask all senior police officers to make arrangements of separate bathrooms, lavatory and sufficient sitting space for women constables in every police station,” the CM said. He also asked the police officers to take effective action against the smugglers of illicit liquor, ensure regular patrolling and speedy trial of criminal cases. “Take stern action against the people involved in liquor trade. Liquor traders should not be spared at any cost,” Nitish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-pulls-up-officials-for-delay-in-construction-of-police-station-buildings/articleshow/86491626.cms||Madan Kumar

Nothing had been done to cover the junction boxes from which wires stuck out. We heard the coordinators’ associates were at the spot but they did nothing to save my daughter and her friend,” Sneha’s mother said. While a bystander can do little to rescue an electrocuted person, the mother’s anger at the civic apathy over the exposed wires in the street lights is widely shared. Anushka’s mother Priyanka Nandy also held the local coordinator and civic administrative member Surajit Roychowdhury of South Dum Dum Ward 9 responsible. “I want action against him for criminal negligence. Roychowdhury should be punished. Our area gets flooded and all the lampposts have exposed wires. He did not pay heed to our complaints,” she said. Roychowdhury dismissed the charge as allegations by families sympathetic with the opposition party. “They can level any allegation and can take legal step. I’ve got nothing to do with it,” he said. South Dum Dum civic officials on Friday issued show cause notice to the agency supposed to maintain 7,000 street lights in Ward 35. An inquiry panel inspected the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/electrocution-deaths-girls-kin-plan-legal-action/articleshow/86493326.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

Take a deep breath||MUMBAI: There’s no reason for investors in the stock market to feel fearful when the benchmarks are at record peaks, provided they’ve invested after due diligence relating to their risk-taking ability and have several years on their hands before they would need the money. New investors, however, should ideally not put all their investible funds in the market in one shot. They would be better off if they invest in a staggered manner over the next six months to a year by slicing their whole fund into several small chunks, financial advisers said. Read AlsoSensex at sixtyMUMBAI: In November 2017, Ridham Desai, one of the top equity strategists at global financial major Morgan Stanley, told a business channel that he expected the sensex to touch the 100,000-point mark in 4-5 years. This was at a time when the index was hovering around the 33,500-level and almost“If you are a long-term investor already invested in stocks, hold on and enjoy the party,” said Ladderup Wealth Management MD Raghvendra Nath. “One should take confidence from the fact that the current rally is backed by three important factors: Economic fundamentals are falling in place, there’s enough liquidity in the system and there is ample investor interest in the market. I don’t see this rally being punctured in a hurry.” On Friday, the sensex crossed the 60k mark for the first time and some market commentators feel that the market is too heated up now. Wiseinvest CEO Hemant Rustagi, a registered mutual fund distributor, said that at times the leading equity benchmarks could intimidate investors and could force people to be in awe of it. “That’s how (equity) markets are…But if you’ve done your risk-profiling correctly that allows you to invest in equities, and also the time horizon to reach your goals is not close, don’t get carried away by the pace of the rally. Nor should you become fearful of the fact that the sensex is at such a high level,” Rustagi said. What about those who want to enter the market now? “They should keep in mind that in the stock market there would be periods of euphoria, phases of absolute quiet and then negative returns also. That’s part of the process of the natural progress of the market,” Rustagi said. One should not come with a short-term view. If an investor has about 10-15 years or more to reach his financial goal, a systematic investment plan (SIP) in mutual funds is the best route. In setting up SIPs, it’s better to distribute the monthly portfolio allocation in the ratio of 50-60% in large-cap funds and the balance distributed between mid-cap as well as small-cap funds, according to leading financial advisers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/sensex/afraid-of-sensexs-dizzying-height-take-a-deep-breath/articleshow/86495987.cms||---

That would make India one of the top five economies in the world. But how does that enrich the people of the country, especially the investing crowd? A report by K R Choksey Shares & Securities pointed out that as three countries traversed this path — when their respective economies grew from $2 trillion to $5 trillion — their leading stock indices went up multiple times. The rally even continued after that milestone, making investors richer through the years, it showed. The US was the first economy to reach the $5-trillion GDP figure in 1988, and between then and 2000, just before the dot-com bubble burst and the Dow Jones index plunged into a massive bear zone, the index had rallied 17 times. In Japan, the Nikkie had rallied over 19 times, while in comparison the Hang Seng just jumped by a modest five times. According to Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey investment managers, the movement of market capitalisation to the $5-trillion mark is not very different from the movement of the economy to the same mark. “For India, the economy may reach that mark a year or two later,” Choksey said. The Indian economy is currently at about the $3-trillion mark, while the stock market’s market capitalisation is at about $3.6 trillion. A recent report by global financial major Goldman Sachs noted that in the next 2-3 years, several new economy companies, most of them unicorns, are expected to list and add about $400 billion worth of market cap. In addition, according to estimates, the listing of life insurance giant LIC is also expected to add over $200 billion worth of market cap in the next six month. According to Choksey, as the economy and the market traverses the $5-trillion mark, it’s important for investors to choose right stocks. “Stick to the bigger companies in this journey. Because of their sheer size and execution capability, they would outperform their smaller peers and grow to be even bigger,” he said. In addition, as more and more large global fund managers invest in India, they would look at the large-size companies more intensely than the mid-sized and smaller ones, Choksey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/5tn-answer-for-investors-expect-multiple-returns-as-eco-grows/articleshow/86495935.cms||---
---||Business||Women turn investment hobbies into habit||Namrata Singh & Partha Sinha | TNN For Lucknow-based Nandini Bhargava, investing in stocks has become a self-sustaining model. When she started investing in stocks twenty years ago in her late 20s, it was more like a hobby. Bhargava started her career in the corporate world where she spent eight years. Later, she took a break in her career and got married to a business family, and also set up a consultancy for travel agencies. But she never gave up on her hobby of investing in the stock markets. “When you become financially independent, you start spending on the luxuries. I decided to put some in the stock markets as well, mostly in blue-chip companies and through IPOs. When I started seeing the kind of profits and gains I was making, it boosted my confidence and I began analysing things and that motivated me to keep investing in the markets,” says Bhargava. Gradually, as Bhargava decided to spend more time investing in stocks, the gains she has made through this “hobby” now more than meet her financial needs. “Every year prior to the pandemic, I have sponsored foreign trips for my family through these very gains. I have never borrowed money from my husband because I pay for all my bills,” says Bhargava. Travel consultancy is now a mere hobby for Bhargava while investing in stocks is a full-time job. Fifty-year-old Anjana Desai, who is self-employed, started investing in the markets when she was 33 and working for an advertising agency. Even though Desai has taken career breaks due to personal reasons, it is these very regular investments she made in MFs and SIPs that have helped her when she did not have a regular income. “When my mother’s health condition was not good, and I had to take career breaks, I used to wonder where I would get funds in case of any emergency? That’s when the investments I made in the stock market helped me immensely,” says Desai. Now, Desai invests regularly in such avenues and has good faith in the appreciation value of her portfolio. Studies reveal that women’s participation in the capital markets — in the range of 20-30% — is still way behind men. Five years ago, the number was less than 25%, according to a CDSL survey in 2016. According to a survey by DSP Mutual Fund and Nielsen two years ago, only 33% of women took independent investment decisions compared to 64% of men. The survey also revealed that one-third of the women who did take their own investment decisions were encouraged by their spouses. The tide is changing for the better. Kuvera saw women’s participation increase from 19% to 27% on its app, in the last 10 years. Research suggests that women make better investors as they tend to be more patient and more goal-based. At Upstox, out of the total women customers, more than 60% of women are millennials and nearly 80% of women are from Tier 2 & Tier 3 cities. Upstox co-founder Kavitha Subramanian, says: “Women are known to have an aptitude for managing finances and savings, both at home and office. Many women took the lockdown as an opportunity to educate themselves and participate in the stock market. Increasingly, we are now seeing women investors challenge gender stereotypes and achieve their financial goals all by themselves.” Sujaya Banerjee, CEO, Capstone Consulting, says women form about 20% of active traders in India. This number has interestingly been on the rise during the pandemic. There is a 32% increase in trade accounts by women of which 35% are housewives, says Banerjee. During the pandemic, when business took a hit, what helped Bhargava’s family were these very liquid assets. “Women have traditionally shied away from stock investments, given it’s a male bastion. Also their conditioning of saving rather than investing and expanding. Good to see women busting the myth that they lack knowledge of the stock market,” says Banerjee. Finsafe India founder Mrin Agarwal says women have generally preferred low-risk traditional investments as compared to men who are willing to take more risk with their investments. Women also tend to hold investments for the long term as compared to men. “These days I do find many women interested in equities but it may be due to the feeling of being left behind,” says Agarwal. An internal survey by Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund shows women are more willing to start a new SIP in their 20s (33%) than men (22%). This shows that women have a higher propensity to start their SIP journey in their 20s — a major shift in investment behaviour of the category which is a reflection of shifting social norms driven by higher access to education, skill-building, and awareness towards financial freedom. What’s more, Bhargava says since her kids were teenagers, she wanted to give them her full time. “My investments in stocks gave me the flexibility to not only be with my kids but also be financially independent,” she adds. Hope women are listening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/women-turn-investment-hobbies-into-habit/articleshow/86502465.cms||Namrata Singh

The jungles gave way to habitation, the area became a social forestry zone and, now, it is a densely populated settlement. The corridor was lost. But now, the elephants are back — about 30 of them — and forest officials are trying to understand why. “The last time an elephant herd was seen here was in the 1980s. It is possible that a member of the old herd is leading this one,” DFO Samir Kumar said. “We hope they return, as they have in the past.” In July this year, seven elephants had been spotted at Mohammadi. Villagers were surprised and alarmed. But the herd went back 20 days later, travelling over 100km away to the Uttarakhand border through Pilibhit. The same herd is back — much larger. Videos of the long line of elephants crossing the under-construction Gola state highway were shared widely on Friday. “We can confirm the presence of at least 22 elephants as seen in the videos,” Kumar said. Locals said there were about 30. “The herd is peaceful. We are not disturbing them. We have alerted senior officials in Lucknow (the direction in which they are headed).” Experts suggest the reason could be one of many — “genetic memory” of a lost corridor, disrupted route to Uttarakhand or rising waters of the Sharada river. “Genetic memory is inherited from one generation of elephants to the next. It is possible that an elephant corridor was used the reach the Ganga decades ago. As of now, there is a deadlock in Mohammadi and the movement of elephants is surprising,” Dr Mudit Gupta, state coordinator of WWF-India who has been working in the region for over a decade, told TOI. “Normally, elephants migrate towards Uttarakhand through the Surahi-Kilpura-Khatima corridor near Pilibhit. But they have returned from the Uttarakhand side twice this year. We need to make sure that the corridor is functional and there are no obstacles.” The other possibility, wildlife expert Siddharth Singh said, could be one exacerbated by the presence of calves in the herd. “It rained heavily in the hills in September. The water level in the Sharada river (known as the Kaali in Nepal) rose. Elephants normally migrate to Nepal from India during this period. They cross the Sharada to reach the Lagga Bagga corridor, through which they get to the Shuklaphanta National Park in Nepal,” Singh added. “Since there are new calves in the herd, they may be reluctant to cross the river until the water level comes down and might be looking for other routes.” Forest officials, meanwhile, are counting on the herd turning back. “It will be a big problem if they stay on,” the DFO said. Bagh Mitra (appointed by WWF-India to manage human-wildlife conflict) master trainer Anil Chauhan said the herd could turn aggressive because it is protective of its calves. “They have destroyed cane fields at Mallapur village. We are lighting fires outside the village, using acrid smoke with chillies, crackers and beating drums to keep them away.” The herd has reached the Aonla beat, after which there are no forests in the direction they are moving. But they are marching on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/after-3-decades-30-elephants-march-through-forgotten-corridor-in-up/articleshow/86490615.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Delhi||Farm stubble: Arvind Kejriwal launches preparation of bio-decomposer solution, urges neighbours to adopt method||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and environment minister Gopal Rai on Friday visited Kharkhari Nahar in Najafgarh to start the process of preparing the bio-decomposer solution created by Indian Agricultural Research Institute at Pusa to convert stubble into manure as a step to fight air pollution. “Stubble was earlier a liability for us when it had to be burnt, but now it turns into an asset. When stubble is burnt, nutrients and good bacteria of the soil also tend to get eradicated. When it is decomposed, it enriches the soil,” Kejriwal pointed out. The chief minister said farmers were already beginning to see the benefits of spraying the solution, with the number of applicants more than doubling this year as against last year. The bio-decomposer was sprayed last year for the first time in some land in Delhi where basmati rice was harvested. While Delhi government is working actively to solve the stubble burning problem, its neighbouring states need to take equal action to assist their farmers, Kejriwal said. “Earlier, farmers would burn the stubble left in their fields after harvesting. Now the stubble decomposes in 15-20 days of spraying this solution, and turns into a fertiliser,” he said. WAPCOS, a central government agency, has found that among several other nutrients, the carbon and nitrogen content in soil increased significantly after using the solution, he pointed out. This year, the solution is being prepared from September 24, as compared to October 5 last year. The government plans to start spraying the solution for free from October 5 to give farmers more time to plant the next crop, officials said. After inspecting the preparation site, Kejriwal said that while around 300 farmers last year got the bio-decomposer sprayed in around 1,950 acres of farmland, 844 farmers had already given their nod this year, which would cover around 4,200 acres. “We are thrilled to see this response and how a positive word of mouth has spread among farmers. This time, we will also spray it on non-basmati paddy fields and cover almost all farmlands of Delhi,” he added. The process of making the solution to spraying it is costing the government less than Rs 1,000 per acre, said Kejriwal, urging other states to adopt the method. Instead of buying expensive machineries, “I can safely say we have found a cost-effective solution for stubble management. If the Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments implement the solution with the seriousness of an emergency, we’ll be able to get rid of this problem”, he added. Environment minister Rai said the majority of pollution from stubble burning originated in the neighbouring states. “This is why we say that until all the states move towards using this decomposer, we will not be able to do anything,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farm-stubble-from-liability-to-asset/articleshow/86497039.cms||---

This is the first such attempt in over two decades to fill up all positions in this department. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said owing to the pandemic, the focus has been on strengthening and expanding the department, and filling up of vacant posts is one step towards that. “Filling up of vacancies will ensure smooth functioning of hospitals and good patient care,” Tope said. He added that before these posts, recruitment has been done for posts of doctors, specialists and technicians, which fall under A and B category. TimesViewThis is a step the state ought to have initiated much earlier. Finally it is stepping up. In several healthcare facilities, not only is there a shortage of doctors but there are 20 nurses who do the work of 40 due to shortage of staff. Posts of specialists such as anaesthetists and those in preventive medicine and psychiatry are also not adequately filled, particularly in the state’s remote districts.Following the start of the pandemic, the state had allowed the health department to fill up 50% of its vacancies and later 100%. The first round of recruitment was held in February. A total of 1,825 MBBS graduates were given appointments then. Thereafter, the department started filling up vacancies of 2,739 Group C and 3,466 Group D posts. While Group C cadres include nurses, assistants, x-ray and laboratory technicians, Group D includes drivers and peons. Their exams will be held on Saturday and Sunday.  An official said they have received 8.65 lakh applications for 6,205 posts. He added more than 800-850 people have applied for every clerical post. “The vacant positions affected efficiency of the systems. While medical posts could be filled up with temporary positions, clerical posts were never filled up, creating delay in releasing salaries, etc,” said an official. The filling up of nursing positions will also ease the burden on nurses and improve patient-nurse ratio to some extent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-health-depts-drive-to-fill-6200-vacancies-draws-8-6-lakh-applications/articleshow/86494884.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Sources in city police informed TOI that nearly 490 centres have been designated in the city for the REET examination. Besides students from Sikar, Alwar and other nearby cities who would throng Jaipur for the exam, around 83,000 would travel from Jaipur to other cities for the same. An expected 2 lakh people are likely to travel and yet there are only 6,000 cops to take care of the students’ movement. Talking to TOI, additional commissioner, law and order, Rahul Prakash said that there is adequate number of cops deputed for the job. “I want to reiterate that residents will not face any problem. We have made a proper plan to ensure that there is no chaos on the streets because the police will take care of everything,” he said. The examination that is held across all parts of the city has raised concerns about traffic jams and the safety of residents. While police have asked hawkers and vendors who operate alongside streets and pavements not to set up shops on Saturday and Sunday, sources in the police said that such a mammoth exercise is unprecedented. “Examination centres are located at far-flung locations, one police station has multiple places. It will be a major problem to keep an eye on all centres simultaneously,” an official informed TOI on condition of anonymity. While reserve companies of the Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC) have also been pressed into service, it is yet to be seen if the police are able to properly control the situation. Meanwhile, many REET aspirants have already begun to arrive in the city.

The total GST collection till August 2021-22 surpassed that of the pre-Covid year of 2019-20. The Delhi government has collected Rs 8,863 crore till September 20 of this financial year. In 2020-21, a year marked by a lengthy lockdown and uncertainty, the total GST collected for the same period was Rs 5,712 crore. The overall GST recovery is, however, yet to touch the pre-Covid level. In 2019-20, the collection for the corresponding period was Rs 9,144 crore. The higher collection indicates a strong rise in consumption. According to an official report, the GST receipts for August stood at Rs 2,213 crore against Rs 1,225 in the same period of the last financial year. In the same period in 2019-20, the receipts stood at Rs 1,530 crore. The growing demand before the onset of the festive period augurs well. An official said the high collection was the result of a sustained economic recovery. “We have started key performance indicator-based monitoring in each ward and introduced intelligence and data-based specific monitoring, besides carrying out a special drive against defaulters,” the official said. Due to the significant improvement in the Covid situation, the government has permitted the resumption of almost all economic activities. The collection of VAT is also improving with a Rs 2,520-crore mop-up till September 20. The VAT collection during the same period last financial year was Rs 1,532 crore and Rs 2,507 crore in 2019-20. VAT is primarily collected from the sale of fuel. Chamber of Trade and Industry convener Brijesh Goyal said unlike this year, people had curtailed expenses in the previous one. “The government has expanded the GST network and created trust among traders. It has motivated traders to ensure greater compliance and that has resulted in higher GST collection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gst-collection-till-aug-trumps-last-years-figure/articleshow/86497047.cms||AlokKNMishra

The case has been registered under the charges of abetment to suicide against Anand Giri, who is currently under judicial custody after being arrested by the Prayagraj police. The CBI officials said that all aspects pertaining to the death of ABAP chief would be probed by them. A six-member team to probe the case will soon reach Prayagraj, said sources in CBI. They also said that a member of Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) is also a part of the team. A unit of CBI had already visited the crime scene for preliminary inquiry and met members of the Special Investigating Team (SIT) constituted by the government to probe the case on Thursday. Senior officials in CBI remained tight-lipped but sources added that a crime recreation would be done soon after the CBI team reaches Prayagraj. On the other hand, SIT officials were also busy collecting all documents pertaining to the case for handing it over to the CBI team. “Two mobile phones, the handwritten note, and the post-mortem examination report along with the videography done would be handed over to the CBI,” said an officer in SIT. Highly placed sources in the central agency also claimed that initially the case was being handed over to the CBI special crime branch in Lucknow unit but after it stated that it already was over-burdened with cases, the Delhi unit was handed over the Giri case. The Uttar Pradesh government had recommended a CBI probe into the death of Mahant Narendra Giri on September 22. The government had always maintained that it was open to any investigation by any agency in the country if required. Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had also said that a CBI probe would be ordered if needed. Former BJP MP and seer, Ram Vilas Vedanti, had raised questions over the suicide note and demanded a CBI probe into the death of Mahant Narendra Giri. The demand for a CBI probe was also raised by opposition parties, including Congress and the Shiv Sena. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had sought a probe by a sitting high court judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cbi-delhi-unit-lodges-fir-in-giri-death-case/articleshow/86496671.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

It announced on Friday that there have been talks with corporates and the undertaking will soon come out with ‘corporate shuttle services’ during morning and evening peak hours. “The corporates will have to ensure that they buy monthly passes for all seats on the bus -- with three categories of seating capacity such as 25/35/45 seats, depending on mini/midi/regular bus -- for its employees,” said BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra. The buses will only run point to point — pick up passengers from a certain stop in the morning and ferry them to offices before switching to normal bus service, he said. This means that a bus picking up passengers from Navi Mumbai to Bandra-Kurla Complex in the morning will terminate its ‘corporate trip’ after dropping off office-goers. It will then run on a regular route from BKC to any part of the city and ferry general passengers.s In the evening, BEST buses will pick up office-goers from outside their offices and drop them back to a designated drop location near their residence. The first corporate shuttle services are being planned from Nerul/Vashi to Mumbai and from Thane to south Mumbai, sources said. “We are in talks with a few private firms, including a few mutual funds companies who have evinced interest in these shuttles. They will be launched soon,” Chandra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-takes-corporate-route-to-increase-income-will-now-cater-to-office-goers/articleshow/86494974.cms||Somit Sen

There are more than 85 lakh people aged above 18 years who have to be vaccinated with the first dose in next three days if every eligible individual has to be vaccinated by September 27. As per official figures, the estimated eligible population for vaccination in Madhya Pradesh is around 5.49 crore. Of these, 4.63 crore have been vaccinated with the first dose, which is 84% of the total eligible population and this highest in the entire country. However, even now, 85.9 lakh people are left unvaccinated in the state. So far in 42 districts of the state, more than 80% of the eligible population has been vaccinated with at least the first dose. Sidhi with 74% coverage and Bhind with 72% are among the lowest coverage districts in terms of first dose vaccination. Sources said, to achieve the target of vaccinating each and everyone, district level officials—district collector and chief medical and health officers— have been instructed to ensure that list of such people who are aged above 18 and are yet to be vaccinated should be prepared. And on September 27, door-to-door visits should be done and each and every eligible individual should be vaccinated, it is only after ensuring that every eligible individual is vaccinated that districts should send information to state head quarters, added sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-is-state-with-highest-vac-coverage-but-achieving-100-target-in-3-days-is-difficult/articleshow/86492690.cms||Amarjeet Singh

He claimed that contrary to Yogi’s public announcements, the district administration had confirmed to him that they had received "no such orders from the state government". Azad reached the dalit victim’s house on Thursday and spent the night with the family. The next morning he met the district magistrate (DM) to know about the reasons for delay in fulfilling the CM's promise. After the meeting, Azad told media persons that "no CM would ever lie like Yogi Adityanath". He added that such a person should not continue in his position. “Who should we trust and expect justice from, if the CM starts lying?” he said. Later in the day, Azad met the commissioner (Aligarh range) and DIG and they assured him that they would work on it and try to fulfil the demands within a week. “They promised a job and a house to the victim’s family within seven days. We will stage an indefinite protest, if the demands are not met,” he said, adding that they will wait for at least 10 days. Incidentally, a letter which was signed by the then DM, superintendent of police and additional DM mentioned several assurances. It included "Rs 25 lakh financial assistance, provisions of a government Group C job to one of the victim’s brothers and a house for the family and fast-tracking of the investigation". The Bhim Army chief further said the dalit community was treated like "pests" by the BJP-led government and they will give a befitting reply in next year's assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/cm-yogis-promise-of-job-house-to-hathras-victims-kin-was-a-lie-claims-bhim-army-chief/articleshow/86490740.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Coimbatore||Ban on outsiders hits business in cattle market||Coimbatore: The ban on traders from neighbouring states has adversely impacted the business in the Pollachi cattle market. While the market caters to the local need of cattle for agricultural activities and meat, over 60% of the business depends on traders from Kerala. In fact, most sellers come from the neighbouring states like Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh making it an ideal location for transaction of cattle and one of the biggest in south India. As there were no buyers from Kerala, the sellers too didn’t show interest in sending their cattle to the market. Operating twice a week, majority sales happen on Tuesday and half of it on Thursday. Over 3,000 cattle heads were sold on both the days during the pre-Covid days. “Less than 1,000 cattle heads were sold this week, bringing down the sales to less than a crore which used to be between Rs 3 crore and Rs 4 crore,” secretary of Maanila Maatu Viyabarigal Sangam Thendral Selvaraj said. Locals say cattle from Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Villupuram, Madapattu and Pattukottai were coming in large numbers but the pandemic has brought down their numbers as well. As the administration allows only locals in the market to prevent crowding, business has been hit hard. “There are at least 7-8 big cattle markets operating out of Kerala every week despite the pandemic. This has been encouraging people from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to send their cattle to Kerala,” S Prajapathy, a seller from Pukkulam near Udumalpet who is a regular to Pollachi cattle market, said. He said many have started going to the neighbouring states to purchase cattle based on their requirement without relying on the cattle markets, he said. “The administration can enforce strict norms but should give access to people from other districts and states if the market has to be revived,” Selvaraj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ban-on-outsiders-hits-business-in-cattle-market/articleshow/86494941.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Varanasi||No one can stop Uttar Pradesh from becoming Uttam Pradesh under Yogi Adityanath: Defence minister Rajnath Singh||GORAKHPUR: Heaping praise on chief minister Yogi Adityanath for his work done for the development of the state, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said “nobody could stop Uttar Pradesh from becoming ‘Uttam Pradesh’ under the leadership of Yogi Ji.” “Today, criminals are scared of Yogi Ji’s name in the state. He implemented Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s schemes for the benefit of the people earnestly and set new records of development. During the Covid-19 pandemic, CM Yogi was praised all over the world for the success of the vaccination drive and management of the pandemic. Along with administrative power, he has a strong willpower,” the defence minister said at a programme held for unveiling the statue of Brahamleen Mahant Avaidyanath at Chowk Bazar college in Maharajganj on Friday. The statue was jointly unveiled by the defence minister and the CM. “Earlier, goondas were more powerful than police but now the police have an upper hand. For a state to excel, maintenance of law and order is the foremost condition and CM Yogi is doing the same. He is demoralizing the criminals and boosting the morale of good people. Now, no one could say that corruption is prevailing in UP under CM Yogi. The state is on the path of development with medical colleges in every district, seven new universities and health security for all,” he added. The defence minister said that after the change in the government at the Centre in 2014, the nation's standing in the world has gone up. In 2017, PM Modi decided to give control of UP to CM Yogi, he said. The defence minister added, “Today India is not a weak country. No one can encroach upon even one inch of our country’s land. As per our history, we have instructed our forces not to attack first, but if someone attacks us then give a befitting reply. For this, they are not required to take any permission .” While praising Mahant Avaidyanath, the defence minister said “Mahant Ji worked for social harmony and social unity all his life. CM Yogi is also following the path shown by Mahant Avaidyanath. Mahant Avaidyanath had seen the future and that’s why he chose such a capable successor (CM Yogi)”. Sharing his memories of Mahant Avaidyanath, the defence minister said, “I am also of Nath sect — ‘Rajnath’. I got blessings of Mahant Avaidyanath. His face used to glow with divine brilliance and his voice was spiritual. I remember in 1971 when I was doing MSc from Gorakhpur University, separatist forces had hijacked an Indian aeroplane and torched it. At that time I had made a student organization and went to Mahant Avaidyanath to seek permission for closing the city as part of our agitation. He advised me to only appeal to the people and not disrespect or cause discomfort to anyone.” “Nath sect worked to unify the society. The sect has done many important work for the country and society. I have come to know that the main pujari of Gorakhath temple belongs to a dalit community. Mahant Avaidyanath’s name will be written in golden letters in the history of Ramjanmabhoomi (movement). He worked to make entry of dalit community in temples possible. The Nath sect has always given a message of unity to the society,” he added. CM Yogi praised PM Modi and the defence minister. “We all know about the condition of the nation’s internal and external security before 2014. Many used to infiltrate in the country as per their will and even hijack planes. Bomb explosions and Naxalite attacks were also frequent, but since PM Modi took charge of the country and Rajnath Singh Ji took over Home ministry and later defence ministry, enemies are showing their back,” the CM said. He added, “Earlier, students of this area used to go to Gorakhpur to get a degree. Later, Mahant Avaidyanath established an inter college under the name of Mahant Digvijaynath in the area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/no-one-can-stop-uttar-pradesh-from-becoming-uttam-pradesh-under-yogi-ji/articleshow/86494855.cms||Arjumand Bano

In a welcome initiative by the commissioner of Jhansi division, Ajay Shankar Pandey, around 101 statues of leaders, which otherwise stand neglected and are covered with dirt, were garlanded on Friday. Pandey has directed officials of these three districts falling under his division that all the statues and the areas where they stand should be kept clean. He has also ordered that all statues should be garlanded every Friday between 9.00 am and 10.00 am by a government official. The officials are free to invite local leaders to do the honour. He has nominated the municipal commissioner, along with ADMs, as the nodal head, and has also assigned each statue to an officer to ensure its upkeep on a regular basis. To keep a real time check, the divisional commissioner has made a whatsapp group where the concerned person has to post the photo of the garlanded statue every Friday for review. Talking to TOI, the Jhansi commissioner said, “It is a shame that the statues of our leaders are left neglected and covered with mud and bird droppings only to be revived once a year on the leaders’ birthdays. We erect statues to pay respect to our beloved leaders, but neglecting these statues shows that we have no regard or respect for our leaders in reality. Hence, I have ordered for its weekly maintenance. This initiative will also evoke a deeper sense of gratitude and respect in citizens towards their leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/statues-of-leaders-get-new-lease-of-life-in-jhansi-division/articleshow/86494978.cms||Arindam Ghosh

The court also said that the material brought on record does not in any way state that she is in imminent need of medical aid and that the same is not available in the government hospital. Sen was arrested in 2018. “...I am inclined to conclude that the discretion to release the applicant on temporary bail, cannot be exercised in her favour,” the court said. Sen told the court that she was suffering from high blood pressure, glaucoma and osteoarthritis and her ailments put her at higher risk for severe illnesses from Covid-19. The court directed the prison authority to observe medical protocol and, in case of requirement, provide appropriate medical aid.  It has been further claimed that she may tamper with prosecution evidence, if released on bail. Sen’s defence, however, contended that in view of the directions of a high-power committee, since she was suffering from co-morbidities, she was entitled to be released on bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/elgar-accused-shoma-sen-needs-no-imminent-medical-aid-in-mumbai-nia-court/articleshow/86497982.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Farmers from nearby villages of Rawta, Daurala, Jhuljhuli were some of the beneficiaries last year and the news had spread by word of mouth, prompting more cultivators deciding to give it a try this year. Delhi government data shows while 324 farmers applied to get the solution sprayed across their farms last year, 844 farmers have already registered this year. Dharmender Singh, a 32-year-old farmer from Rawta who grows both wheat and rice, said while Delhi farmers clearly understood this to be a better option over stubble burning, they had also learnt how to use stubble over the years. “Prior to this, we would use the stubble as fodder for our cattle. If the government approaches us, we will get it sprayed, too; but Delhi farmers have been conscious in not burning stubble,” Singh said, adding the village had other issues to deal with, including the high groundwater table. “If the government can assist farmers with a free spray, I hope they can help us in tackling the water levels, too, which ends up in our farms due to the nearby Najafgarh lake,” he said. Dharamvir, a 38-year-old farmer from Jhuljhuli who was among the beneficiaries last year, said the solution had been welcomed. But he, too, pointed out, “This year, with rains, our paddy has become submerged under two feet of water, which kills the crop. I have once again registered with the government for the spray, but it will reap no benefit if my crop does not survive.” While the solution was earlier sprayed in basmati fields, the government will also cover non-basmati fields that use harvesters, officials said. Ramnath Singh, a 60-year-old from Jhuljhuli, has a three-acre farm to manage and, like Dharamvir, is trying to find solutions to the monsoon problem. He has registered for the bio-decomposer spray. “Farmers are appreciating the move. This will benefit us in the long run, but we want Delhi government to find solutions to our waterlogging problem,” he said. Others are, meanwhile, still sceptical about the impact the solution may have, stating a majority of Delhi’s farmers have small land holdings. “Most farmers have been using the stubble for fodder and with little area, it does not take much time to get it out. This can be beneficial for large land holdings, but I will have to see with my own eyes to believe that it is both time saving and enriches the soil,” said Naveen Dagar, a 42-year-old from Malikpur in Najafgarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farmers-give-thumbs-up-but-flooded-fields-a-spoiler/articleshow/86497053.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The health department data has revealed that over 25.20 lakh jabs have already been administered to 14 lakh male and 11 lakh female recipients in the district so far. Besides, over seven lakh jabs were administered to beneficiaries in just 24 days of September. On September 23 alone, as many as 46,651 doses were administered to recipients of all age groups, including 39,267 recipients of first dose and 73267 recipients of second dose. Statistics also revealed that as many as 11,504 jabs were administered to recipients in January, 51,575 in February, 1,17,625 in March, 1,86,853 in April, 2,21,808 in May, 2,74,860 in June, 3,52,925 in July, 5,84,496 in August and 6,39,540 till September 22 . Out of 25.20 lakh doses, 14 lakh doses were given to male recipients, 11 lakh to female recipients, and 1,073 to transgender persons. The district health authorities have set a target of administering jabs to 46.10 lakh beneficiaries, and till September 24, it has already crossed the 25 lakh mark. District immunization officer (DIO) and additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Teerath Lal on Thursday told TOI, “Sincere efforts are underway to cover recipients of all age groups living in villages, blocks and urban areas. Moreover, special camps are being held at several places in the city to cover maximum number of people.” He added that five special camps have already been held, including two in August and three in September. This has helped the department cover over 25 lakh beneficiaries. Dr Lal said that the response was way better than expected, and around 20 lakh recipients have been given at least one dose each so far. The department has, in fact, increased the number of Covid-19 vaccination sites (CVCs) with every passing month, and September witnessed the highest number of sites (400). These measures were taken to expand the reach of health teams, particularly in remote villages. Roughly, 52% of the targeted recipients have been given jabs and around 11% are fully vaccinated now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/city-hits-another-milestone-over-25-lakh-doses-given-so-far/articleshow/86495054.cms||---

His complaint was regarding alleged fake domicile documents by 25 medical students. The STF has registered a case against 14 of them after investigation. The notice sent to Digvijaya says his statement is required for judicial proceedings against them. The Congress Rajya Sabha MP had also raised the red flag on alleged impersonation in police constable recruitment, and submission of fake documents in medical entrance examination. The STF has initiated investigations into 1,200 pending Vyapam complaints that were not taken up by CBI. Whistleblower Ashish Chaturvedi was also summoned by the agency along with documents related to around 150 complaints regarding ‘Vyapam scam’ that they had filed with the agency over the last four to five years. CBI had taken over 180 of the 251 Vyapam cases from STF after Supreme Court handed over the probe to it in July 2015. At that time, STF had around 1,200 more complaints pending and they were all pushed to the backburner. STF ADG Vipin Maheshwari told TOI that they are investigating every complaint that the agency has received. “There are only a few cases pending for investigation,” he said.

---||Lucknow||Parties, religious events to help cattle shelters earn money||Lucknow: After taking several initiatives to make ‘gaushalas’ (cow shelters) self-sustainable in the state, developing them as centres of tourism, picnic spots and places for public functions is what the UP Gau Seva Aayog has next on the agenda. The aim is to bring additional earnings for the shelters to make them self-dependent. There are over 546 ‘gaushalas’ and 4,500 ‘gau-ashray sthals’ registered in UP. Chairman of the Aayog Shyam Nandan Singh presented suggestions to municipal commissioners on Friday to develop shelters into attractive centres of tourism. Not only this, shelters which have huge vacant land can also be beautified into spots and sites where local people can organise birthday parties or family functions or hold ‘havan’ or religious events at a charge. Further, shelters with ponds can arrange for boating and let schools bring students for recreation. This would make them self-dependent through public participation. Besides, the Aayog has taken several initiatives to help shelters earn extra income. One major initiative is using cow derivatives (dung, urine) to develop products like pots, lamps, idols, logs and cleaners. Shelter managers and keepers and women SHGs have also been trained in making these products and popularising them. The Union petroleum ministry has also launched a ‘SATAT’ scheme under which compressed biogas plants will be set up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/parties-religious-events-to-help-cattle-shelters-earn-money/articleshow/86496700.cms||Neha Shukla

The highways authority has sought permission to fell trees on around 27-km stretch. It includes trees on private land, which has been acquired to widen the road. Around 40 hectares of land have been acquired on the stretch. As errors on species and girth of trees have been cropped up in the list, the social forestry has asked NHAI to submit a new list. “Social forestry fixes the timber cost of tree with girth above 70cm. There is error in species and girth of trees in the list. So, we have asked them to submit a new list. The agency which approaches us for felling trees should plant 10 saplings for every tree cut. But there is no need to submit the details, along with the application, of the area where they are going to plant these saplings. We receive many requests from various agencies and local bodies to cut trees,” said a social forestry official. However, an NHAI official said space crunch in Kerala is posing hindrance to the plan of planting saplings for every tree cut. “We have some more projects to be implemented in the state. As more trees will have to be felled for the new projects, we need to equally distribute the planting of saplings. As per the Indian Road Congress rule, trees should be planted in every three-metre distance. As against other states, availability of land is an issue in Kerala. We will plant maximum saplings in Kerala and the rest in other states,” said an NHAI official. There is no mechanism to ensure that the agency or department which fell trees will plant saplings and protect them. C M Joy, who was part of the tree committee of panchayats in Ernakulam, blamed inefficiency on the part of forest ministers in the state for the last 10 years. “When Binoy Viswam was the forest minister, the tree committees were strong. It became a toothless body later. Instead of bringing down the number of trees to be felled for development projects, the committees has started looking for felling more trees,” said Joy. He fell out with the committee after he refused to give permission to fell more than 2,000 trees for expansion of the refinery in Ambalamughal.  Later, the committee gave permission to cut trees with the support of another person in the committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nhai-seeks-nod-to-fell-789-trees-for-road-widening/articleshow/86490810.cms||T C Sreemol

Earlier, while hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the kin, high court had ordered the police to present the woman. Khushboo Banskar, 23, a resident of Jhanda Chowk in Ranjhi police station area was reported missing on May 31, 2021, said additional superintendent of police, Sanjay Agarwal. “During investigations it surfaced that the woman had a four-year-old friendship with Akash Ben, 24, who too resided in the same locality,” he said. “Further investigations revealed that just before the woman went missing, she had a telephonic conversation with Akash for more than half an hour. Police summoned Akash several times but he never appeared for questioning,” he said. “Hearing a petition filed by the father of the woman, court had directed to produce the woman few days ago. Akash was again rounded up and during interrogation he broke down. He admitted to killing the woman with a sharp-edged weapon and then dumping her body in a deserted house. He was taken to the spot and the remains of the deceased were recovered on the information provided by the accused,” he added. “Akash informed that he had a dispute with the woman as he suspected that she was ‘talking to other men’. Later the woman told the accused that her parents have fixed her marriage with someone else and so she does not want to continue the friendship with Akash. Hearing this, the accused got angry and killed her,” Agarwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/four-mnths-on-missing-womans-remains-found/articleshow/86492821.cms||---

Former BSP member and UP minister Swami Prasad Maurya hit out at BSP chief Mayawati, saying that while she had expelled multiple OBC members from her party over the past few years, she was trying to show “fake concern” for OBCs over the census. “It is intriguing that the BSP leader has the audacity to ask questions about OBCs while she did nothing for them while she was in power. It only shows the double character of Mayawati who is eying votes of the OBCs but has always treated them badly,” Maurya said. Referring to the Prabuddha Sammelans that BSP is currently holding to reach out to the Brahmins ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, Maurya said that while Brahmins seemed to be BSP’s priority at one level, at another there was artificial sympathy for OBCs. “Her political designs have already seen her thrown out of power and BSP stands no chance of revival. When she was in power, she cared about mafia like Mukhtar Ansari and used to call him ‘Robinhood’. She patronised him at the cost of the welfare of SCs and OBCs and people have not forgotten that,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mayas-former-aide-calls-her-concern-for-brahmins-fake/articleshow/86496724.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Delhi||Delhi HC stays 3-year jail to Supertech MD, directs Rs 50 lakh be paid to homebuyer||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Friday granted protection from imprisonment to realty firm Supertech’s managing director in a case of failure to hand over a flat to a homebuyer, but said the company must pay Rs 50 lakh to the harassed consumer within a week to show its bona fides. The court stayed a recent order of National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) sentencing Mohit Arora to jail for three years and issuing an arrest warrant against him for non-compliance of an earlier order in the case. “In order to show bona fides to court, the petitioner company is directed to pay a sum of Rs 50 lakh to the respondents within one week from today,” Justice Amit Bansal directed, adding that the NCDRC order on imprisonment would remain stayed till the next hearing on October 4. The court decided to ask Supertech to deposit the substantial amount with the homebuyer, Kanwal Batra, after being informed that Rs 1.79 crore was due to the consumer. Justice Bansal also directed both Supertech and Batra to place on record the statement of the amount due as per the NCDRC order. Senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, representing Supertech, argued that NCDRC’s September 20 order was beyond Section 27 of Consumer Protection Act and there was no provision that cast vicarious liability on the MD who was sentenced without even conducting a trial. “So the man goes to jail if the company does not comply with the order in seven days,” Sethi contended. However, advocates Shailesh Madiyal and Vrinda Kapoor, appearing for Batra, highlighted that the company was in repeated default of the NCDRC order and had gone back on its undertaking to it. Batra’s complaint was for delay in giving possession of a villa in a Supertech project in Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Area. During Friday’s hearing, Supertech offered to deposit Rs 40 lakh with the high court registry, but the court directed it to pay Rs 50 lakh to Batra. In April 2019, NCDRC had ordered the company to either give possession of the villa within six months, along with compensation and costs, or refund the entire amount received by it along with the compensation. TOI had reported that on July 20, the MD assured NCDRC compliance in 60 days. But on September 20, NCDRC noted that Supertech reneged and failed to implement its order. The commission said the company was “evading the implementation of the decree” and issued the arrest warrant against the MD and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment subject to the implementation of the order in a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-stays-3-yr-jail-to-supertech-md-directs-rs-50l-be-paid-to-homebuyer/articleshow/86497074.cms||Abhinav Garg

However, consumers need not worry as Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) has ruled out power cuts. An MSPGCL official said coal production at Bhusawal and Chandrapur plants, which produced 210 MW of power a day, had been stopped. The installed production capacity of the seven thermal generation plants is 9,750 MW, per day, and they are presently producing 4,000 MW. “We have stock that would last for another couple of days. However, all efforts are being undertaken to procure enhanced supply from coal companies,” an official from MSPGCL told TOI. According to the official, supply of coal has declined by about 50% of daily requirement at around 1.30 lakh metric tons to operate the seven thermal plants. “The erratic coal supply started about a month ago, following heavy rainfall, which has affected coal mining activities. Moreover, transportation too has been impacted due to the showers,” added the official. State energy minister Nitin Raut is in touch with the union government on the issue to boost coal supply for thermal power plants.  MSEDCL has ruled out any possibility of resorting to load shedding for now. “The per day power requirement in the state is around 16,000-17,000 MW. But, we are able to meet the demand. There has been no load shedding in the state as we are buying power from other entities to cater to consumers,” added an MSEDCL official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/coal-crisis-hits-power-generation-across-state/articleshow/86488610.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Garba enthusiasts began making plans to ensure that this year’s Navratri made up for last year’s heartburn when Navratri celebration were cancelled in the state. Permission has been granted to host garbas in residential societies and private groups with a maximum of 400 people. “I am going shopping tomorrow as the government has finally allowed small garba functions. I will thoroughly enjoy shaking a leg and grooving to garba which I missed last time,” said Puja Patel, a Vejalpur resident. Because of Covid-19 pandemic, Navratri celebrations were not allowed last year. “Commercial events being banned will certainly come as a big blow to the events industry, which is already badly affected due to the pandemic. Further relaxation in restrictions will certainly go a long way in boosting business for food and retail sectors,” said Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA) – Gujarat. This time around, no garba will take place in clubs, which used to be a major crowd-puller. “Clubs won’t host Navratri and this has dampened members’ mood. While it is a huge source of revenue for the club, it is also one occasion through the entire year when all the members get together and socialise over dance, music, and food,” said Jayesh Modi, vice president, Karnavati Club.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ae-halo-amdavadis-get-ready-to-twirl/articleshow/86492846.cms||---

The court was hearing the petition filed by Ponraj and S M S Subramanian. The case of the prosecution is that when a team of police officials were on regular patrolling, the petitioners along with a few others unlawfully assembled near Kottai Vinayagar temple at Seithur in Rajapalayam taluk on September 12, 2017. They had raised slogans against the former CM and burnt his effigy. Following this incident, the Seithur police had registered a case against the petitioners and others under several sections including Section 285 of IPC. Justice G Ilangovan observed that in the case on hand, the police neither in the FIR nor in the final report had stated that the petitioners negligently acted in a manner endangering human life while dealing with the fire and combustible matter. Therefore, the offence under Section 285 of IPC cannot be invoked in this case as the petitioners alleged to have burnt the effigy as an act of protest. Taking into account the fact that this court had earlier quashed the FIR registered against a co-accused in this case, the judge observed that continuation of criminal proceedings against the petitioners will become an abuse of the process of law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-quashes-final-report-in-eps-effigyburning-case/articleshow/86492876.cms||Kaushik Kannan

A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar was hearing the public interest litigation filed by I Mohamed Razvi, an advocate from Madurai district. The petitioner stated that Navodaya Vidyalaya is one of the biggest educational schemes implemented by the central government. The main objective of the scheme is to provide the best educational environment for the children in the rural areas and children of weaker sections of people. The residential schools provide quality modern education to the students, free of cost with several infrastructure facilities such as classrooms, laboratories, and libraries. Though the central government is ready to establish Navodaya Vidyalayas in Tamil Nadu, political parties in the state are opposing the same under the guise of education policy as Hindi is taught to the students in these schools. The state government should permit the implementation of this scheme and should also take steps to allocate land for the functioning of these schools in all the districts. Since no steps were taken on his representation, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-for-navodaya-vidyalayas-in-tn/articleshow/86492893.cms||---

(Come get vaccine.. first dose, second dose… everyone has taken it, don’t miss this opportunity).” Jagadish Shah, 33-year-old multi-purpose health worker working on a contract basis with Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has an emotional story to tell when asked what made him approach people in this unique manner for vaccination. “I lost my father to Covid. He was just 63-year old. My father was my icon and I couldn’t save him from this epidemic. When I see people taking this epidemic lightly I feel very sad. I would do anything to convince people to get vaccinated,” says Shah whose father Mahesh, a retired state government official, passed away in December last year. On Thursday, Shah was felicitated by AMC commissioner Mukesh Kumar for his dedication towards mega vaccination drive launched by the civic body from September 17. On Thursday, the commissioner had tweeted the viral video from his official twitter handle, saying, “Jagdish Kumar Shah, Health Worker with Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation mobilizing for vaccination in unique way..” “I am posted at Paldi AMTS vaccination booth. On the 17th,day when AMC launched mega vaccination drive, many commuters who were there were just ignoring us. I asked people if they had taken the first dose, and many of them had not even taken their first dose which pained me. I wondered how they can be so reckless about their own health. Not only themselves but they pose a threat to their family members too. That is when I went on the road and started calling out people like vendors,” Shah told TOI. Shah, father of two daughters, said that after the video showing him reaching out to people went viral many people started coming to get vaccinated. “I am happy that my video encouraged people to get vaccinated.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati slams BJP for Centre’s refusal to hold OBC census||LUCKNOW: The political war over a census for the other backward classes (OBCs) has heated up after the Centre submitted in the Supreme Court that inclusion of the category in ongoing census at this stage was not possible. BSP chief Mayawati hit out at the BJP on Friday, a day after the Centre’s submission, saying that the refusal to have a census shows that BJP continues to remain against the community and the backlog in government jobs reserved for the category would remain pending. The long-pending demand of the community has been gathering steam in the recent months with several states, including BJP allies, and Opposition parties in UP bidding to outdo each other for the OBC vote bank ahead of the 2022 elections. In response to the Centre’s affidavit calling the OBC census at this point “administratively extremely complex” which will “not yield accurate information” and adding that the “raw data of 2011 socio economic caste census is also flawed”, Mayawati said: “The outright refusal by the Centre to carry out an OBC census is extremely serious and very worrying. It exposes BJP’s electoral interests in the OBC politics and shows the difference between what they are claiming and what they are doing.” She added like SCs and STs, the demand for separate census for OBCs had been gathering steam in the country but the Centre’s stand had dashed their hopes and because of that, the backlog in appointments to government jobs under reservation for OBCs would continue to get delayed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-slams-bjp-for-centres-refusal-to-hold-obc-census/articleshow/86496727.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Noida||Greater Noida township to get 24-hour power supply by mid November||NOIDA: To provide 24-hour power supply to IITGNL (Integrated Industrial Township Greater Noida Limited) — a joint venture of DMIC (Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor) and GNIDA (Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority) — additional power supply will be provided from a 400 kV substation in Bulandshahr’s Sikandrabad in October end to mid-November. Currently, the zero-waste, smart township is being provided power from one line through a 765 kV substation at Jahangirpur. For this, 220 kV and 33/11 kV gas-insulated substations have been built at IITGNL, which have a total capacity of 240 MVA. In case the supply trips or gets damaged from Jahangirpur-side supply line, an alternate arrangement from Sikandrabad can be sourced. According to officials, IITGNL has been set up as an integrated industrial township on 750 acres. Several major companies are planning to invest in the region. So far, Haier Electronics, Formi Mobiles, Satkriti Infotainment, Chenfeng (LED company) and J World Electronics has set up their plants. Many others, including those from Taiwan, Japan and Korea, are willing to invest in this township that boasts of smart technology and state-of-the-art facilities such as zero waste disposal, LED lights, cycle-to-work culture and a well-connected transport network. Given the interest of investors in the region, GNIDA launched an industrial plot scheme earlier this week. “The smart facilities will be available to the allottees only when the township will get 24x7 electricity. In view of this, IITGNL has made a plan where the 220 kV and 33/11 kV power stations built in the township will also be linked to 400 kV substation at Sikandrabad,” said GNIDA CEO Narendra Bhooshan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gr-noida-township-to-get-24-hr-power-supply-by-mid-nov/articleshow/86496731.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The woman was admitted to the hospital near Huda City Centre on September 15 and the doctors declared her ‘brain dead’ the next day. On September 21, her family gave a nod to her organ donation. While the woman was a Gurgaon resident, all the recipients belong to Delhi. A hospital official told the TOI, “It was possible after the family of the patient consented to donate her organs. National Organ & Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) allocated the organs to three separate recipients.” Dr Om Prakash, consultant (neuro-anesthesia), Fortis hospital, said: “The donor was admitted to the hospital on the night of September 15. She was found unconscious. Upon evaluation, we found evidence of major bleeding in the brain. Despite best efforts of the neurosurgical team, she succumbed and was declared brain dead.” The family, despite their hour of grief, decided to donate her organs and corneas. “One kidney and liver were transplanted at FMRI to a 38-year-old woman and 52-year-old man, respectively. The second kidney was allotted and transplanted to a 43-year-old woman in Delhi. Both corneas were sent to an eye bank,” said Prakash. Dr Avnish Seth, principal director, gastroenterology & hepatobiliary sciences, Fortis and director, Fortis Organ Retrieval & Transplant (FORT) said, “In 2019, over 700 families across India had agreed to donate organs of their loved ones. Meanwhile, there has been a 70% fall in organ and tissue donations worldwide due to the pandemic.” According to the doctors, the current organ donation rate in India is less than 1 donor per million population as compared to more than 30 donors per million in most western countries. There is a shortage of organs and the gap between the number of organs donated and the number of people waiting for transplants is ever increasing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/brain-dead-womans-organs-save-lives-of-3/articleshow/86440636.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

President of the association B Priya said they had done a study on the importance of having the LCC in workplaces. In a recent study conducted by them including 20 working women from Kodaikanal, Oddanchathiram, Sivakasi, Sattur, Thirumangalam and Vadipatti, 90% said that they were aware of what is workplace sexual harassment. Of them, 12 said that they were not willing to file complaints and the rest did not know where to file complaints. TNLRF conducted a state-level study to assess the level of awareness among women in the unorganised sector about sexual harassment and LCC. Priya said that data for the study had been collected in three different ways: Study from October to December 2020, case study from June to July 2021 and RTI applications. The data showed that 15.3% of the women faced sexual harassment at workplace, 80.5% said that they had not faced any and 4.2% chose not to respond. Among those who had faced harassment, 57.3% did not wish to make a complaint, 11% did not know where to complain, 18.3% reported to the supervisor or co-worker and 4.9% complained to the police and only 8.5% made their way to LCC or internal complaints committee (ICC). RTI applications on the presence of LCCs were sent to Madurai, Virudhunagar and Dindigul districts. Madurai and Virudhunagar district has not responded yet and Dindigul district information officer had given the requested information that the LCC had been formed with five members but no nodal officer, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/posh-act-call-to-set-up-plaints-panel-in-dists/articleshow/86492917.cms||---

He also asked the CM to allocate Rs 27,500 crore and waive farm loans up to Rs 1 lakh, claiming that KCR had failed to deliver his promises made to farmers. Sanjay said the state government should withdrawaw its call to farmers to not to cultivate paddy. “The state government should release Rs 413 crore as its part of crop insurance scheme being implemented by the Centre,” he said. He said the government should immediately resolve the Dharani portal issues and distribute pattadar passbooks to farmers. “The BJP will fight to protect the interests of farmers,” he said. Union minister of state for railways Raosaheb Dadarao Danve said the TRS government was not focused on development of the state and the fact that neither the chief minister nor any of his ministers met with him for any railway project reflected their negligence. Speaking at a press conference in Chikodu village of Gambhiraopet mandal in Sircilla district, he said the state government lacked focus and clarity on railway projects. “The central government is providing funds liberally to the state government for various welfare and developmental projects. But no utilisation certificates have been given so far,” he said. He participated in the Praja Sangrama padayatra along with BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bandi-seeks-rs-27500-cr-for-farmer-loan-waiver/articleshow/86492915.cms||---

The demonstration against the ruling BJP’s “anti-people” policies is a fallout of the joint meeting of 19 opposition parties held under the leadership of AICC president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi in August. The Congress national president told the Opposition parties that there is no other alternative but to come together for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. A joint press conference of opposition parties in the state was held on Friday at the state Congress headquarters here. It was addressed by PCC vice-presidents Ashok Singh and Bhupendra Gupta, state CPI’s secretary Shailendra Shaili and Satyam Pandey, CPM state secretary Jasvinder Singh and NCP’s Raju Bhatnagar. Saturday’s protest will focus on Covid deaths in the country and state, the truth regarding vaccination numbers, the deepening economic crisis, the `loot’ of national assets, attack on the democracy and increasing injustice on Dalits, tribals and women. “We, the leaders of 19 political parties invite the people of the country to listen to the need of the hour and come forward to strengthen and defend the secular, socialist democratic system of the country,” the opposition party leaders said, speaking at the press conference. “People need to come forward, protect the country for a better future,” they added. One of the main demands of the opposition parties is to increase MNREGA work to 200 days and double the wages of beneficiaries. They also demanded a law for an urban employment guarantee scheme. “Teachers, education institution employees and students should be given priority for vaccination. This will ensure the opening of educational institutions soon,” the joint opposition leaders said. They also demanded a judicial inquiry into the Pegasus spying allegations under the direct supervision of the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cong-opposition-protest-against-anti-people-policies-of-bjp-today/articleshow/86492916.cms||---

He said that they could not identify the origin of the waste using the batch number as vaccines with similar batch numbers have been supplied to various places. An inquiry is still underway to find out the people behind the act, he added. Meanwhile, president of IMA Coimbatore chapter Dr V Rajesh Babu said that he has not received the notice so far.

With one more day to go, officials say that they can surpass 200km. With the northeast monsoon season fast approaching, the civic body is preparing itself to meet the challenges ahead. The state government had announced a week-long mass cleaning drive between September 20 and 25 to clean all the storm water drains to prevent waterlogging and inundations, a corporation official said. The city is known for water stagnation at many points causing traffic snarls and vehicular diversions when there is heavy rainfall. The city’s storm water drain is estimated to be in a stretch of 1,500km. Officials said they had focused on areas prone to waterlogging and inundation. “A huge quantity of soil was removed from the drains and shifted to designated places through trucks. We will continue to clean channels even after the mass cleaning week to minimize the impact if there is heavy rainfall,” an official said. The corporation received many complaints from residents to clean up drain in their area during the mass cleaning week. “We took up their complaints and cleaned drains in their areas on priority basis,” the official added. “Many residents thanked us after the issue raised by them was resolved. Some complaints are yet to be addressed. Soon, they will be taken up too,” an official from the engineering wing said. As many as 1,200 employees from the corporation are working to clean the drains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-cleans-up-storm-water-drains-to-a-stretch-of-156km/articleshow/86495230.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Bhujbal, who held a meeting with the MLAs on Friday at the collectorate, said that snapping of power supply was uncalled for given that the farmers are in distress – both due to scanty rainfall in some areas and flooding in other parts. MLAs Manik Kokate (Sinnar), Saroj Ahire (Deolaligaon), Hiraman Khoskar (Igatpuri), Nitin Pawar (Kalwan), Dilip Bankar (Niphad), Suhas Kande (Nanadgaon) raised the issue. “They don’t have money nor the produce in their hands. This is a trying situation for them. Hence, the MSEDCL needs to handle the issue compassionately. The MSEDCL may first issues notices to the farmers for several times, understand the situation and then go for power disconnection if the notices fail to yield any response,” Bhujbal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-irked-at-msedcl-for-snapping-supply-to-tillers/articleshow/86488680.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Campaigning for party candidates in the local body elections at Palayamkottai in Tirunelveli on Friday, he said Tamil Nadu is making great strides and is a developed state because of AIADMK’s visionary schemes implemented in the 31 years of its rule. The AIADMK governments made the largest allocation for education helping the state to develop in terms of education. Crop loans to the tune of Rs 12,110 crore had been waived during the previous regime, yet farmers are unsure of their future, he said. He said chief minister M K Stalin had made 525 poll promises and he (EPS) was sure that none of them would be fulfilled, like the promise to reduce the price of fuel. It is said that over 43.5 lakh people had obtained gold loans in cooperative banks, but now only five to six lakh would benefit from the gold loan waiver scheme announced by DMK. He claimed that DMK did not have qualified people for various posts. The fact that eight ministers in the present cabinet and 15 DMK MLAs were former AIADMK members justified this. Meanwhile, some members from AMMK joined AIADMK in the presence of Palaniswami when he arrived in Madurai in the morning enroute to his campaign in Tirunelveli and Sankarankoil. There was a quarrel among AIADMK cadres at Sattur in Virudhunagar district when they went to welcome him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dmk-never-keeps-poll-promises-eps/articleshow/86492934.cms||---

With this, at least one in two citizens, aged above 18 years, have received one dose of the vaccine at minimum in Aurangabad. On the other hand, the total number of fully vaccinated citizens have increased to 2,64,668, which is around 25% of the total target beneficiaries, shows official data. Stating that the civic administration has been getting doses of vaccine in sufficient numbers, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s health officer Dr Neeta Padalkar said the remaining citizens should come forward to get inoculated without any fear or hesitancy. “Aurangabad has not witnessed any major case of Adverse Events Following Immunization after Covid vaccination. Therefore, those who still have vaccine hesitancy should shed their fears. The civic administration has sufficient stock of both Covishield and Covaxin doses,” Padalkar said. While 39 state-run vaccination sites have been offering vaccines to citizens, nine private hospitals are also engaged in the immunization drive, where doses are given as per charges fixed by the government. The population aged between 18 and 44 years has received maximum first doses (2,76,120) and second doses (70,689).

The tender worth Rs 4.60 crore was awarded to them earlier this year. East zone has the highest number of LED streetlights of 16,923, followed by the central zone (12,627), north zone (9,905), west zone (8,319) and south zone (4,932). A corporation source said the resolution to cancel the work order was approved at the council meeting on August 31. The work order was issued to KCP Engineering Private Limited, RVG Metal Industries, R&N Electricals and Sabari Electricals after the successful bidding of tenders. The firms had agreed to maintain at least 98% of the streetlights in working condition at any point of time. However, in the first three months it was noticed that only 90% of the lights was working. There were several other lapses too, said a source with the corporation engineering department. “As per the agreement, they should have installed control rooms and introduced helpline numbers, enabling the public to raise complaints about non-functioning streetlights. But they failed to do so.” Pointing out that the firms were duty-bound to address complaints within 48 hours of receiving them, the source said they hadn’t failed in that area too, as they hadn’t deployed enough workforce. “Then corporation commissioner had on June 6 sought an explanation from the four firms for their lapses. Since their responses were not satisfactory, the work orders were cancelled,” the source said. The city corporation would now float fresh tenders.

Many of the corporation workers bring two bins, green and yellow, in their battery-operated vehicle and collect the waste separately, but the final place of collection near dumper bins continues to be a mess. Pandi, a worker, in Anna Nagar said that they segregate the garbage near the dumper bins, but sometimes it becomes difficult, because people are now throwing a lot of plastic bags with food in it. Centre for Environmental Services founder S V Pathy, who has 30 years of experience in solid waste management, said people think newspaper and coconut shells would degrade easily, but newspapers are toxic and coconut shells take a hundred years to degrade so they should be disposed of properly and recycled, he said. The corporation should stop accepting inorganic waste or charge like in Bangalore city, which would ensure that people handover only organic waste that could be used for manure manufacture, he said. City health officer, S Raja, said that they expect this problem to be solved when all the micro-composting units in the city start functioning. “Now, 20 have started functioning and 10-15 are expected to be activated soon,” he said. Meanwhile, Kamala, a resident of Sathamangalam, said that the corporation should ensure that the sanitary workers do not burn the garbage like they do near the Master Bakery behind the Aavin wall. “Sanitary workers would be told to refrain from burning garbage and this would be checked,” Raja added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dry-and-wet-waste-overflows-from-dumper-bins-in-madurai/articleshow/86492949.cms||---

A new publication from the Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre revealed that the bell curve of Covid-19 in Gujarat was a bit different from other states which also experienced the deadly second wave. “While all fear a possible third wave, our hypothesis indicates that inherent design of the variant helped develop antibodies in host body even when the person was not severely infected. Even those in proximity of infected persons got seropositivity according to surveys at national and state level,” said a researcher. “The ORF8 protein in the virus played a major role. Compared to earlier variants, this protein did not have two amino acids Asp119 and Phe120 critical for bondin with other cells. The mutation reduced bonding with MHC-1 protein on host cell,” said a researcher. This means body’s immune response was triggered by MHC-1 – the cell surface molecules that alert the immune system – when it detected the presence of the virus, which resulted in antibody production.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/delta-variant-mutation-holds-key-to-understanding-future-of-ncov/articleshow/86492980.cms||---

This followed DGP C Sylendra Babu’s instructions to officers to conduct a massive storming operation which saw cops apprehending active criminals. Meanwhile, the number of people arrested in connection with the beheading of P Nirmala Devi, 70, of Valluvar Nagar in Dindigul on Wednesday morning climbed to eight as five of the accused surrendered before a Trichy court on Friday and were sent to judicial custody. The woman was named as the fifth accused in the murder of C Pasupathy Pandian, founder of ‘Devendrakula Vellalar Kootamaipu’ in 2012. During the statewide searches, police questioned at least 870 history-sheeters and rowdy elements. Apart from the 450, another 181 were arrested for their pending non-bailable warrants. Three countrymade guns and 250 deadly weapons such as machetes and knives were seized from them. In Chennai, cops rounded up about 100 rowdies including a woman. A senior police officer said “the idea is to give a warning to the anti-socials resurfacing in the city and the state.” In the ten southern districts, 174 people were arrested and remanded on Thursday and Friday. IGP south zone T S Anbu said a total of 201 deadly weapons were recovered from them. Four beheadings had happened in Tirunelveli and Dindigul in 10 days. Among the three people arrested on Thursday night were accused P Ayyanar, 21, of Chembatti whose bike was used by the duo who hacked the woman to death, P Natarajan, 45, the southern zonal secretary of ‘Devendrakula Vellalar Kootamaipu’, and autorickshaw driver M Boobalam, 21, of Seevalsaragu. On Friday, Ramesh Kumar, 23, and Sangili Karuppan, 28, Tamilselvan, 22, and Alex Pandian, 18, and Muthu Mani, 23, surrendered before judicial magistrate – 4 in Trichy. The police said they would be moving the court seeking custody of those who surrendered. Dindigul police have also picked up a few men for questioning in connection with the murder and beheading of Stephen, 38, of Hanumantharayankottai on Wednesday night. The police teams have also gone to neighbouring districts based on a tip about the movement of suspects in those regions and that some of them are trying to surrender before the court on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/450-held-in-state-wide-crackdown-on-rowdies/articleshow/86492951.cms||---

With the exception of January when 4,285 erring motorists were issued challans for illegal or wrong parking, challans issued to erring motorists for the offence dropped considerably between February and June. From July 7, the city police deployed two cranes and three tempos to pick up illegally parked vehicles after which cases increased drastically. As per available data, the city traffic branch booked 4,285 motorists in January for illegally parking, in February the number dropped to 1,211. In March, 1,850 motorists were issued challans, 433 in April, 227 in May, 2,013 in June. In July, when the towing vehicles were deployed, the challans increased to 5,196 and in August 4,723 motorists were issued challans. ACP Seetaram Gaikwad of the city traffic branch said the traffic police has been issuing challans to erring motorists even in the absence of towing vehicles. With the exception of April and May, when the Covid-19 norms were strict there were fewer vehicles on the streets which saw an overall drop in the number of challans issued to erring motorists. However, the action against motorists for illegal parking got an impetus after two hydraulic cranes were deployed to tow four-wheelers and three pick-up vehicles were used to lift illegally parked vehicles. Currently, the action is focused around the district collectorate, Central Bus Stand area, College Road and Gangapur Road. The police plan to increase the number of towing vehicles in other areas like Nashik Road, Cidco-Ambad and Satpur soon, said Gaikwad. Currently, the police are taking action against motorists in these places by clicking photos on the special devices and sending them e-challans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/police-crack-down-on-erring-motorists/articleshow/86488861.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Juhu marriage broker fined for ‘matchfaking’||MUMBAI: Bringing to book a Juhu-based matchmaker, who advertised herself as ‘The Match Maker-For Well Educated Elite Class & NRI members’, a district forum ordered her to refund Rs 55,000 to client for failing to fulfil her promise to provide 15 “suitable matrimonial matches per month.” The matchmaker, Priya Shah, will also have to pay Rs 5,000 as compensation to the client, the father of a Parel-based woman . The forum passed the order ex parte, as Shah did not respond to the complaint. The complainant moved the Mumbai Suburban District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum on April 29, 2013, against Shah for not finding a suitable matrimonial alliance despite taking service charges. It was alleged that Shah had promised an average of 15 suitable matrimonial matches, including e-mailing prospective profiles, photographs as well as negotiating with the groom’s parents and taking all steps that would be required to finalise the marriage. The complainant’s father had given Shah a cheque for Rs 55,000 on July 16, 2012. The complainant alleged, however, that Shah did not send the promised number of profiles. She and her father sent several emails to Shah between July and September 2012, expressing their displeasure and urging her to improve her service. However, there was no change of service quality. Therefore, on October 25, 2012, the complainant sent a legal notice terminating the services and seeking a refund. When Shah did not respond, the complainant moved the consumer forum. “From the e-mails on records it can be seen that complainant and her father have been in touch with the opposite party with respect to their requirements constantly but she has chosen not to reply to the said e-mails,” the forum stated. It further said that from Shah’s visiting card, it can be inferred that she was indeed providing the service of finding matrimonial alliances for clients. However, as the complainant’s allegations went unchallenged, the consumer court opined that Shah was deficient in providing the services promised. The forum said that Shah has to make the payment within a month, failing which she will be liable to pay interest at a rate of nine percent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-juhu-marriage-broker-fined-for-matchfaking/articleshow/86498068.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Delhi||Language barrier: Hard of hearing signal for help||New Delhi: When 21-year-old Mohd Bilal, who is hard of hearing, leaves his house, he always carries a pen and a notepad. Communicating with people has always been a struggle for him. Like him, many hard of hearing people suffer when they go to hospitals or other public places. “At a mall, I can easily purchase things through hand gestures. However, if I want to know about their exchange policy or any other scheme, it takes a long time to communicate as they don't know sign language. Using pen and paper is time-consuming as my English is not good,” said Bilal, a student of Class X. National Association of the Deaf (NAD) has demanded from the government that people should be taught basic sign language. It has also sought inclusion of Indian Sign Language as an option for mother tongue in the population census 2021. AS Narayanan, NAD president, said, “In offices or other places, people do not include the deaf in conversations, which creates a divide. Most television news or series or other events do not offer translation in sign language. Though changing technology, like video calls and YouTube, has helped, it’s necessary to teach basic sign language to the general public.” For GV Reddy, whose entire family is deaf, the major challenge is to communicate properly with doctors. “As I cannot hear and doctors cannot understand sign language, it’s very difficult to explain the illness to them. My wife and I once had a cough and cold, but as the doctor couldn’t understand us, he gave us the wrong prescription. I want hospitals to have an interpreter to help people like us,” he said. Siddharth Gautam, a government employee, said he felt bad when his colleagues avoided him due to the communication barrier. “At times, we made some errors due to the communication gap, which caused tension in office. It’s difficult to understand important workshops or conferences as there are no interpreters or someone with knowledge of basic sign language. Though hiring an interpreter for a few hours is an expensive affair, I still involve them to sort out major differences,” he added. Gautam wants to create awareness on the plight of hard of hearing people through International Week of Deaf People and hopes to see some positive changes. Monika and Bharat Garg, a deaf couple, find it tough to communicate with family members as they don’t know sign language. “If there is a gathering in the house, we just greet guests and avoid communication. My husband and I have become habitual of only talking to each other,” said Monika (41), a housewife. The pandemic has aggravated their problems. Anuj Jain, NAD executive director, said, “Hard of hearing people rely on facial expressions of people during interaction. However, as most people wear masks now, the clarity has reduced to some extent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/language-barrier-hard-of-hearing-signal-for-help/articleshow/86497141.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Agriculture officials will communicate directly with farmers to determine the overall amount of produce they get, how much will they retain for their internal consumption and how much they intend to take to the market for sale. The survey began on Friday and will go on till September 27. The harvest of paddy is expected around October 15 and it is set to reach the market by November. According to officials, the government may purchase the produce locally and it will also ensure that local produce does not travel to other locations. Paddy output, this rainy season is going to be an issue for government and farmers, with a 43 per cent rise in cultivation compared to previous year. While FCI has announced only 60 lakh tonnes will be procured, a yield of 1.38 crore tonnes is projected. Interestingly, paddy extent has decreased this season to 52 lakh acres compared to 53 lakh acres in 2020 monsoons. However, output will be larger at 1.38 crore tonnes when compared to 96 lakh tonnes last time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/survey-on-paddy-cultivation-begins-in-t/articleshow/86492986.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Was being pushed to file false rape FIR’||AHMEDABAD: A 35-year-old woman from Motera on Thursday filed a complaint with Women’s police station (west) alleging that her husband used to force her to have sex and was also pressuring her to file a false rape case against his brother-in-law. The woman stated that she married the accused, who works for a private company, in 2006, after which they stayed in their native place, Bhilwara in Rajasthan. She said that her in-laws and husband demanded money from her parents soon after the wedding. She alleged that whenever she objected to their dowry demands, her husband used to thrash her. “We moved to Nashik in February 2014 for a while and then came to Ahmedabad city, where my in-laws lived with me,” she said. She alleged that her husband’s sister had a quarrel with her husband. After this the complainant’s husband and his elder brother pressured the complainant to file a false rape complaint against his brother-in-law to teach him a lesson, she said in the FIR. She also alleged that her husband used to force himself on her. “Even though I did not want to have sex, he used to forcibly have sex with me until I started crying,” she said. The woman said that her husband threatened her to leave if she refused him sex and said he would go to another woman. She said that her husband later had a relationship with another woman, for whom he even liquidated a fixed deposit. The woman alleged that he had thrashed her badly in October 2020 and left her at her parents’ place with their children, 13 and seven. She finally approached police and filed a complaint under the Domestic Violence Act against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/was-being-pushed-to-file-false-rape-fir/articleshow/86493007.cms||---

Principal secretary (Namami Gange) Anurag Srivastava said clean drinking water has been made available to 10,89,844 houses spread across 5,000 villages in 65 districts. Srivastava said nearly 11 lakh households included 92,358 in Muzaffarnagar, 78,657 in Kushinagar, 14,553 in Kannauj, 45,363 in Gorakhpur and 32,865 in Deoria which have started receiving pure drinking water. “The state government spent Rs 1,033 crore on this project in 2017-18, Rs 1,192 crore in 2018-19 and Rs 1,058 crore in 2019-20. The department is in the last stages of finalising the plan to connect thousands of villages of Bundelkhand and Vindhya with water supply from December. Projects under Jal Jivan Mission are being rolled out and water should be available in these regions within three months,” Srivastava said. He said the goal of the government is to supply pure drinking water to every household in rural areas and to achieve that target, departments were working at a fast pace. An official at Jal Jivan Mission said the government’s focus in prioritising supply was on districts where clean drinking water was not available in rural areas and disease were being reported as a result of contaminated water. “Not only are new schemes being implemented but the government is renewing old schemes which had been left incomplete under previous governments. As part of that, old infrastructure is being repaired and refurbished, older channels are being de-silted and re-boring of tubewells is being done. In the next few days, we will be able to connect the villages of Bundelkhand and Vindhya regions with water supply,” the official said. He said new water treatment plants were also under construction where water from nearby dams would be supplied to villages in Bundelkhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/11l-families-got-piped-water-supply-in-4-yrs/articleshow/86496751.cms||---

Pointing out that both Narain and the businessman, K Prithvirajkumar, were owning adjacent farmlands at Keel Chithirai Chavadi, a police officer said the two were already in a dispute over a piece of land containing the pathway and had moved the district civil court, where the case was pending trial. The officer said Narain had reportedly blocked the pathway to the businessman’s farmland by erecting a wire fence around the disputed land on September 18 and Prithvirajkumar had lodged a complaint with them in this regard on Thursday. The Thondamuthur police subsequently registered a case against the F1 racer under Section 339 (wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Meanwhile, Narain’s accountant D Gokulnath, a resident of Peelamedu Pudur, lodged a counter police complaint against Prithvirajkumar the same day, stating that the businessman had damaged the wire fencing with the help of a few others and trespassed into Narain’s land. Based on Gokulnath’s complaint, the Thondamuthur police have booked Prithvirajkumar under Sections 447 (punishment for criminal trespass) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/police-book-narain-for-blocking-way-to-farmland/articleshow/86495322.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While the forest range officer was remanded in judicial custody till October 7, members of the Tamil Nadu Forest Staff Association gathered outside the office of the district forest officer, Pollachi division, on Friday morning and boycotted work to register their protest over Jayachandran’s arrest. A Manikandan, president of the association, ATR branch, said he had shot off a letter to the ATR field director on the day, demanding to constitute a committee to probe the incident. “A false case is foisted on Jayachandran. The judiciary power is misused against him. To condemn the forest range officer’s arrest, more than 250 frontline staff, including forest guards, watchers, foresters, rangers and anti-poaching watchers with ATR have boycotted work. The fake case registered against the ranger should be withdrawn,” Manikandan said. He said the association’s executive committee meeting would be held in Salem on Saturday morning to take a stand on the issue. Jayachandran’s advocate had moved a bail application before the Valparai district munsif and judicial magistrate court on Thursday itself. Much to the disappointment of the frontline forest staff, the bail petition didn’t come up for hearing on Friday. The petition is now expected to be heard on Saturday. Meanwhile, 33 forest range officers, who were undergoing training at Mettupalayam for the past two days, staged a protest on Friday night when they came to know about Jayachandran’s arrest. They also raised slogans and condemned the misuse of power against the forest range officer, who they said should be released immediately. They threatened to take out a state-wide protest if the ranger was not released. The Valparai police had arrested Jayachandran on Thursday night after registering a case against him under Sections 294b and 506(1) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4(1)(j) of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act. In a related incident, M Nazir, retired assistant conservator of forests, Coimbatore, and former president of Tamil Nadu Forest Staff Association, have shot off letters to the chief wildlife warden and principal chief conservator of forest on the day, demanding justice should be done to the forest ranger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/anger-brews-over-valparai-forest-range-officers-arrest/articleshow/86495296.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Dharmender had challenged the May 2019 judgment of a metropolitan magistrate whereby he was convicted under Section 377 (unnatural offences), sentenced to undergo imprisonment for three years, and directed to pay Rs 50,000 compensation to the victim. Upholding the decision, Principal District and Sessions Judge Dharmesh Sharma said the testimony of the minor victim was of a 'sterling quality' and that there is nothing to suggest that the child witness was tutored or had an ulterior motive to falsely implicate the man. The judge noted that it is a case where the convict “sodomised the minor boy and subjected him to extreme physical and mental pain”. “I find no merit in the appeal and same is accordingly dismissed and the conviction under Section 377 IPC is upheld,” the judge stated in an order dated September 8. The court then passed the order on his sentence on September 23. The judge, however, lowered the jail term noting, “Keeping in mind that the appellant was about 19 years of age at the time of the incident, and he is an illiterate person, the sentence of rigorous imprisonment for three years is reduced to a period of 18 months.” pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-reduces-term-of-illiterate-man-convicted-of-sodomising-kid/articleshow/86497181.cms||---

The accused believed that she was tarnishing their image.” Due to heavy rain, the body was not noticed as it was left in an isolated spot. During interrogation, the accused duo broke down and admitted to have killed the girl.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/teen-girl-killed-by-kin-her-boyfriend-in-bhavnagar/articleshow/86491746.cms||---

The Centre on Thursday allowed door-to-door inoculation for people with disability, special needs or any physical challenges that may be impeding accessibility to Covid vaccination centres and asked states and UTs to facilitate jabs for them at home under supervision. Special needs include persons who are bed-ridden or with restricted mobility. KMC had earlier rolled this out two months ago. In the first week of August, the KMC Board of Administrators had announced a doorstep vaccination plan for the bed-ridden, elderly, and infirm residents who can’t move out of their houses. But, the special scheme didn’t take off as there was no official approval from the Centre. Before that, in July, KMC ward coordinator Ashim Bose had introduced a vaccination at home in several Bhowanipore neighbourhoods. However, the special vaccination scheme for the bed-ridden and terminally ill patients had to be called off as the scheme had no official sanction. “We have no dearth of vaccinators. But we need more doctors to be present at the time of vaccination of critical patients at home. These patients should remain under the supervision of a medical practitioner for at least half an hour after getting the jab at home,” said a KMC health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-policy-tweak-kmc-ready-with-doorstep-vax/articleshow/86493098.cms||Saikat Ray

The panel of seven men and five women began deliberating racketeering and sex trafficking charges against the R&B superstar Friday afternoon, ending the day without reaching a verdict They are due back in court on Monday to resume their work.  A couple hours into the deliberations, the jurors sent the judge a note asking to review a transcript of testimony and evidence regarding a woman who claimed Kelly sexually assaulted her in 2003 when she was a 21-year-old radio station intern. She testified she was kept locked up in a recording studio for days and drugged before the assault.  Prosecutors and defense attorneys finished their closing arguments this week. The 54-year-old singer is accused of running a Chicago-based criminal enterprise that recruited his accusers for unwanted sex and mental torment.  The witnesses said Kelly subjected them to perverse and sadistic whims when they were underage. He has denied any wrongdoing.  Kelly "believed the music, the fame and the celebrity meant he could do whatever he wanted," Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadia Shihata said in federal court in Brooklyn in a fiery rebuttal to the defense's closing argument that portrayed Kelly as a victim of false accusations.  But, she added, "He's not a genius, he's a criminal. A predator." She added that his alleged victims "aren't groupies or gold diggers. They're human beings."  The 54-year-old Kelly, perhaps best known for the 1996 smash hit "I Believe I Can Fly, " has pleaded not guilty to racketeering charges accusing him of abusing women, girls and boys for more than two decades.  He is also charged with multiple violations of the Mann Act, which makes it illegal to transport anyone across state lines "for any immoral purpose."  Prosecutors say their evidence proves how Kelly, with the help of some loyal members of his entourage, used tactics from "the predator playbook" to sexually exploit his victims.  The tactics included isolating them in hotel rooms or his recording studio, subjecting them to degrading rules like making them call him "Daddy" and shooting video recordings - some seen by the jury at trial - of them having sex with him and others as a means to control them, prosecutors said.  In his closing, defense attorney Deveraux Cannick told the jury that testimony by several accusers was full of lies, and that "the government let them lie."  Cannick argued there was no evidence Kelly's accusers were ever forced to do anything against their will. Instead, Cannick said, Kelly's girlfriends stuck around because he spoiled them with free air travel, shopping sprees and fancy dinners - treatment that belied the predator label.  "He gave them a lavish lifestyle," he said. "That's not what a predator is supposed to do."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/r-kelly-fate-now-in-jurys-hands-at-sex-trafficking-trial/articleshow/86498125.cms||---
---||Mumbai||No proof that Chhagan Bhujbal got kickbacks in Maha Sadan deal: Court||MUMBAI: In a detailed 107-page order granting state cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal, his son Pankaj, nephew Sameer and five others discharge in the Maharashtra Sadan scam case, a special court had held that there is not an iota of evidence showing that Rs 13.5 crore was paid by developer K S Chamankar as illegal gratification for awarding it the contract. The court said that there is no cogent and substantial evidence showing that certain illegal means were adopted in the contract. “The material on record is not satisfactory and substantial to even suggest that Bhujbal got any illegal gratification in any kind directly or indirectly,” it said. The case concerns a contract Bhujbal, then PWD minister, allegedly gave K S Chamankar Enterprises in 2005 without inviting tenders. The builder got the development rights of a slum on RTO land in Andheri, with the condition that Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi, the RTO building in Andheri and a guest house on Malabar Hill be constructed in return. The firm is said to have entered into a deal with another company for the work and later sold the development rights of the RTO land to a construction company. The court, in its order, denied payment of furniture work of Maharashtra Sadan that was made to a company without any negotiation by the developer and thereby a kickback of around Rs 6.03 crore has been given to Bhujbal. It said that the developer was only going to get the FSI as against the construction work of Rs 100 crore of the state government. The court said Bhujbal and others did not have exclusive domain over any property. It held that prima facie offences related to corruption and criminal breach of trust were not made out. “The 22 months spent in issuing the NOC to the developer goes to show that there was no personal interest of Bhujbal in allotting the work of construction of the RTO building to the developer. It is difficult to accept that due to issuing the direction to the officers concerned to take action on the proposal of the developer, any favor was made to the developer,” it observed. The court further said that it did not appear that Bhujbal misusing his official position had compelled the relevant committee to take a decision in favour of the developer. It added that the FIR was based on the improper and incorrect report of the architect and the improper calculations of the ACB officer and was also incorrect in respect of alleged illegality and irregularity of the contract. The court said from the chargesheet and papers, it appeared most calculations had been made by informant Narendra Talegaonkar, ACP in the ACB Mumbai division. “Neither, he is an architect nor an engineer. He is not an expert.” It said that the PWD had concluded there was no illegality in the contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-no-proof-that-bhujbal-got-kickbacks-in-maha-sadan-deal-in-mumbai/articleshow/86498212.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Coimbatore||Merger of villages not required to upgrade 4 panchayats: Collector||Coimbatore: District collector GS Sameeran has recently shot off a letter to the commissioner of municipal administration (CMA) with a request to upgrade Karumathampatti, Madukkarai, Gudalur and Karamadai town panchayats to municipalities without merging adjacent village panchayats into them, as the latter had objected to the (merger) move. Pointing out that the four town panchayats had a population of more than 30,000 each as per the 2011 census and they were earning more than Rs 10 crore revenue each per annum, he said they were fit to be upgraded to municipalities without merging more villages into them. On August 24, municipal administration minister KN Nehru had in the assembly announced the decision to upgrade Karumathampatti, Karamadai, Gudalur and Madukkarai town panchayats in the district to municipalities. Subsequently, a public hearing was held at the district collectorate on September 14, when representatives of some village panchayats adjacent to the four town panchayats raised objections to merge their areas into the municipalities, as the people won’t get work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act schemes and benefit from the Green House Scheme and a few other schemes. In his letter to the CMA, the collector has made it clear that there weren’t any objections to upgrade the four town panchayats to municipalities in the public hearings. He said Karamadai town panchayat was spread across 19.827sqkm with a population 43,521 population and it was earning Rs 14.37 crore revenue per annum, while Karumathampatti town panchayat was spread across 27.000sqkm with a population of 45,286 population and it was generating Rs 15.08 crore revenue yearly. “Gudalur town panchayat is 29.980sqkm big with a population of 65,753 and capacity to generate Rs 14.1 crore revenue per annum. Similarly, Madukkarai town panchayat is spread across 21.470sqkm with a population of 34,401. It is generating Rs 10.57 crore revenue per annum. Resolutions were passed at the four town panchayats to upgrade them to municipalities. The four town panchayats can be upgraded to municipalities without annexing any village panchayats,” he said in the letter. As per the Section 3(b) of The Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act, 1920, the governor may notify or classify and declare every local area comprising a revenue village or villages or more revenue villages with a population of not less than 30,000 as municipalities based on the revenue generated for local administration, percentage of employment in non-agricultural activities, economic importance or such other factors he deems fit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/merger-of-villages-not-required-to-upgrade-4-panchayats-collector/articleshow/86495410.cms||A Subburaj

Stating that the number of such students will vary in each college, senior DU officials said the varsity would ask for details from each college and consolidate a data. “In any given college, it is unlikely that the number will exceed 20 students. It is a small number and colleges should be able to waive the tuition fees on humanitarian grounds. Ultimately, it is up to the governing bodies of each college to grant permission and approve it,” said Balram Pani, DU’s Dean of Colleges. An official added that students who had lost a single or both parents to reasons apart from Covid-19 would also be considered for a fee waiver. “Students who are about to take admissions in the upcoming academic session will also be considered for the fee waiver. If they produce relevant documents and period of death, their tuition fees will also be waived,” Pani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-to-seek-data-from-colleges-on-fee-waivers/articleshow/86493147.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Speculations rife as Akhilesh meets expelled BSP leaders||Lucknow: Expelled Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) heavyweights Lalji Verma and Ram Achal Rajbhar called on Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Friday. The meeting was followed by reports that the two will formally join the SP soon, putting an end to speculations that they may float a separate political entity and enter into an alliance with the SP for 2022 polls. Highly placed sources said the two would formally join Samajwadi Party at a mega rally where Akhilesh would be the chief guest. The rally is likely to be held in Ambedkarnagar – the stronghold of the two leaders – in early October. While Verma is a five-time MLA from Katehari seat, Rajbhar happens to be the MLA from Akbarpur seat -- both in Ambedkar Nagar district. However, Akhilesh Yadav tweeted a photo of the meeting which he described a “courtesy call” by the two leaders. Once seen as close confidants of BSP chief Mayawati, Lalji Verma was the Legislature Party leader when he was expelled in June this year along with Ram Achal Rajbhar. The latter has been the state president, a joint national general secretary of BSP and a minister in Mayawati cabinet. Both are known for their strong hold over the OBCs in their region. If sources in SP are to be believed, some more important names associated with the BSP might join SP along with Verma and Rajbhar. The list of probables include some from the band of BSP legislators led by MLA Aslam Rainee who had earlier mooted the idea of forming a political entity and entering into an alliance with the SP for the 2022 assembly polls. At least seven expelled BSP MLAs had met Akhilesh within a fortnight of Lalji Verma and Ram Achal Rajbhar’s expulsion on June 3 this year. The list includes names of Sushma Patel (Jaunpur), Chaudhary Aslam Ali (Hapur) and Hakim Bind (Prayagraj).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/speculations-rife-as-akhilesh-meets-expelled-bsp-leaders/articleshow/86496784.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

This was decided at a meeting held on Friday attended by nodal officers of all higher education institutions and officials from higher education department and family welfare department. Officials have stressed that the drive among students must be completed before Puja vacation starts. The health and family welfare department issued a notice on September 22 saying all DMs will look after the arrangements of vaccination according to the institutions’ requirement. Subsequently, higher education department has asked all colleges and universities to submit students’ data related to the vaccination. CM Mamata Banerjee had announced that the government was keen to reopen educational institutes after Puja. Jadavpur University has given a proposal to organize first dose vaccination on September 30 and October 1 and second dose on October 4, 5 and 7. Registrar Snehamanju Basu said, “We have already submitted data to higher education department.” VC of Calcutta University Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee said, “We have all data related to vaccination.” Presidency University registrar Debajyoti Konar said, “The state’s comprehensive initiative will be highly beneficial for the health of students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/october-8-deadline-for-campus-vaccination/articleshow/86493130.cms||---
---||Mumbai||UK travel: Quarantine if no DOB on vax certificate. CoWIN gives only birth year||The vaccination certificate generated from CoWin currently displays the beneficiary’s name, age based on the year of birth, gender, ID, unique health ID, vaccine name, date of first dose, date of second dose, vaccinator, vaccination centre’s name and city/state. A senior official from the ministry of health and family welfare told TOI: “No changes are required in the current CoWin certificates as the format is in sync with WHO standards. The new feature can be opted for by those who want to travel abroad.” An issue with DOB came up as the UK issued relaxed travel rules to come into force from October 4. “You must be able to prove that you have been fully vaccinated (plus 14 days) with a document (digital or paper-based) from a national or state-level public health body that includes, as a minimum, forename and surname(s), date of birth, vaccine brand and manufacturer, date of vaccination for every dose, country or territory of vaccination and/or certificate issuer. If your document from a public health body does not include all of these, you must follow the non-vaccinated rules. If not, you may be denied boarding,” the UK’s rules said. “We have been having detailed technical discussions regarding certification with the builders of the CoWin app and the NHS app. They are happening at a rapid pace, to ensure that both countries mutually recognise the vaccine certificates issued by each other,” said Alex Ellis, the British high commissioner to India. National Health Authority (NHA) chief executive officer Ram Sewak Sharma said there was no concern at any point expressed by the government of UK about India’s certification process. Sharma, who is also the head of the CoWin platform, said: “As per WHO Covid vaccination certificate template, there is a ‘date of birth’ column, which is optional. At CoWin, we collect only the year of birth of the beneficiary, as per which his/her age reflects on the vaccination certificate. Hence, the new feature will be introduced only for those travelling internationally. Such users can download their updated certificate after putting in their month and day of birth as per their passport. The downloaded certificate will contain the full date of birth of the beneficiary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/uk-travel-quarantine-if-no-dob-on-vax-cert-cowin-gives-only-birth-yr-in-mumbai/articleshow/86495548.cms||Neha Madaan

Most of the colleges have tested the online platforms on which they will commence teaching initially and then shift to hybrid and thereafter classes on campus. Nearly all colleges have lined up virtual induction sessions on first day in which teachers and students will introduce themselves. A senior faculty member will give a brief background of the college and also lay out the rules and regulations. Some plan to dive straight into online classes. A few are, however, unsure about starting on October 1 and are more comfortable if they are able to do the introductory session on October 3. Among the colleges that will hold an introductory session on the inaugural day include Maulana Azad, Seth Anandaram Jaipuria College and Surendranath College. At Maulana Azad College, the time table for classes is ready. On October 1, individual departments will organise an introductory session in virtual mode and online classes will be starting from October 3 after the Gandhi Jayanti holiday. Surendranath College will get its alumni involved in the introductory session on October 1. “Last year, a few departments asked the alumni to participate in the online session and it worked,” said college principal Indranil Kar. Scottish Church College principal Madhumanjari Mandal Choubey said: “We will start virtual mode from October 1 and our faculty is absolutely prepared to teach on the online mode,” said college principal Lady Brabourne College, Vidyasagar College and Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri College will dive straight into academics from first day itself. “We are hoping the government will allow offline classes after Durga Puja. But there is no time to waste,” explained principal Siuli Sarkar. Jogesh Chandra College will also start online classes from October 1. Vidyasagar College principal Goutam Kundu is concerned about science students and the lack of scope to undertake laboratory-based practicals. New Alipore College principal Jaydeep Sarangi is also worried about students in science streams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ug-classes-colleges-ready-online-platforms-for-oct-1/articleshow/86493153.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Puja clubs discuss road, flooding & electrocution issues with KMC, cops||KOLKATA: The poor condition of roads and waterlogging after heavy rain have become major causes of concern for Puja organisers this year. Many organisers like Telengabagan in the north, Beliaghata 33 Pally in eastern suburbs, College Square in central Kolkata and Behala Club in southwest raised the issues of waterlogging and battered roads during a coordination meeting held with the representatives of Kolkata Police, Kolkata Municipal Corporation and various utility providers on Friday evening. The annual meeting, which is being held before Puja for more than three decades, helps the agencies coordinate with themselves and work on the issues raised by the organisers. The KMC officials, who attended the meeting, said that the two days of sunshine — Thursday and Friday — helped them with the road work. They sought a week’s time to finish the patchwork if the weather is good. The organisers of 33 Pally spoke about broken pavements while those from Behala Club sought the intervention of CESC to ensure that there is no case of electrocution if the road near their pandal gets waterlogged due to rain during the festival. The organisers of College Square sought the intervention of the civic body, stating that their pandal work cannot progress due to the accumulation of water at the spot. A few clubs of Taltala, along with the Telengabagan organizers, requested for patchwork on the approach roads to their pandals before the inauguration of their Pujas. A few organisers, especially from the Deshapriya Park-Lake zone, have requested cops to give them some idea about the possible Covid steps that need to be followed. They also wanted to know if visitors would be allowed inside pandals this year. The cops told the organisers that they need to follow the government and court guidelines. Meanwhile, senior cops are likely to begin their inspection from Monday onwards. The divisional and local police level coordination meetings will continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/puja-clubs-discuss-road-flooding-electrocution-issues-with-kmc-cops/articleshow/86493187.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The district administration has planned to vaccinate 69,200 senior citizens, who have not yet received any dose of Covid vaccine. Also, the vaccination of the second dose of the senior citizens who have completed 84 days after taking first jab will be carried out on the same day. The administration said the district had 5.69 lakh potential beneficiaries above 60 years age , of whom 82% had received the first jab and 60% were fully vaccinated. Yogesh Sale, district health officer said, “The mortality rate among senior citizens is high as compared to citizens of other age groups. The senior citizens face inconvenience in the form of registration to get the jabs. We have adequate doses for vaccination and the turnout is less. We want to vaccinate the maximum number of senior citizens as early as possible and have accordingly planned the special sessions.” The administration is planning to reach out to the senior citizens through multiple outreach campaigns. Also, the authorities have approached the senior citizens’ groups or welfare associations to get the maximum non-vaccinated senior citizens to the centres for the jabs. The authorities claimed that proportion-wise, the turnout of senior citizens for vaccination in Kolhapur district was one of the highest in the state in comparison to other districts. “Many senior citizens have not yet vaccinated due to their health issues. We have started vaccinating those who are bed-ridden. We are going to clear the confusion or misunderstandings about the vaccination,” Sale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/special-vax-drive-for-the-elderly-in-kolhapur/articleshow/86488994.cms||---

The police said they have identified at least two culprits, and are looking for them. The victim had a criminal record, and while it is not yet clear why he was attacked, the cops think his criminal history might have been a factor.  The victim was at Janta Colony in Laljipada on Wednesday, where he was thrashed to death. The Kandivli police have formed multiple teams to track down the culprits. “Given the victim’s criminal history, the accused may have mistaken him for a thief. Alternatively, there is a theory that one of the accused was acquainted with him and held a personal grudge against him. The exact motive will be clear only after the arrests are made,” a police official said. A murder case has been registered under Section 302 of the IPC at Kandivli police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/man-beaten-to-death-in-slum-cops-probe-motive/articleshow/86493250.cms||---

He was speaking at the seventh day of the week-long tribute programme held to mark the death anniversaries of Mahant Digvijaynath and Manant Avaidyanath at Gorakhnath temple. Yogi said no one could doubt Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Gorakshpeeth for re-establishing national values and national benefits. “People have chosen a capable government. The glory of the nation could be seen worldwide unlike during the previous governments when cases against terrorists were taken back. Today, no one could glorify terrorists.” He added, “Everyone knows about the successful leadership of PM Modi. Under his leadership, the home minister abrogated Article 370 in J&K and gave citizenship to harassed Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh through law. Besides, Indians stuck in foreign land were also welcome. The previous governments didn’t have the courage to take such decisions.” The chief minister also mentioned the ‘Deepotsav’ in Ayodhaya Dham during Diwali. “Under the guidance of PM Modi , Deepotsav in Ayodhya represents the feelings of all seers. This included even those seers who are not in their physical bodies... they would be happy with it.” While appreciating the work done by both the mahants of Gorakshpeeth, he said, “Both Mahant Digvijaynath and Mahant Avaidyanath established high values and ideals in religion and society. Mahant Digvijaynath laid the foundation and Mahant Avaidyanath made it a building. Those who have seen Gorakhpur and Gorakshpeeth fifty years ago, know whatever is here is because of their blessings.” Gorakshpeeth promoted Ayurveda in the 60s. During the corona age, the entire world agreed to the strength of Ayush and Yoga, he said. “I met an American who used to mix two drops of Tulsi in a glass of water. When I asked him about it, he said that America understands the strength of Tulsi. During corona time, people in New York used to stand in a queue for ‘haldi’ (turmeric) water,” he elaborated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/previous-govts-took-back-cases-against-terrorists-cm/articleshow/86494806.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Internet may be suspended in Rajasthan for REET tomorrow||JAIPUR: The state government on Friday gave permission to division- and district-level officers to suspend the internet, if required, in their jurisdiction to check question paper leak and spreading rumours related to the Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teachers (REET) which is to be held on Sunday. The permission has been granted by the state home department citing a notification by the department of telecommunication, under the ministry of communication, related to 'public safety' and 'public emergency'. The decision has been taken despite the Rajasthan High Court asking the state government to avoid suspending the internet to conduct exams in the past as it causes inconvenience to other residents utilising services such as booking cabs, ordering food and other essentials online. The state government wants to make the upcoming REET a “spectacle” as it sets its eye on setting a record of sorts. While it has already been hailed as the “biggest exam being held in the state”, the government’s attitude towards inconveniencing common man is like, “for something good, people have to bear with a little inconvenience”. Education minister Govind Singh Dotasra, who is also the chairman of the high power committee conducting the REET, told the media on Friday that over 31,000 grade III teachers would be appointed based on REET scores. Since it is being conducted after nearly three years, the number of candidates is much higher (over 16 lakh) than expected. He agreed that this kind of massive gathering of people would cause some inconvenience to the public, but said it was unavoidable and a challenge to the state government. The exam is being held in two shifts on Sunday. Even officials such as collectors and SPs will not be allowed to take their mobile phones to the examination centres while visiting them, he said . The state has arranged free travel for candidates by private buses hired by the transport department. The government had earlier announced free travel in Roadways buses from September 20 to 30, according to the Budget announcement made by the chief minister this year. Besides, 19,000 private buses are being hired to make up for the shortfall of Roadways buses, considering the huge number of candidates travelling to take the exam. The government will bear the cost of private buses and toll tax. On being asked why the exam was not staggered, Dotasra said different exams for the same post could cause problems. But the RPSC had organised the sub-inspector exam on different days. Shops and business establishments have been forced to close on the request of the district administration to dissuade the general public from venturing out to shop on a holiday. “Generally shops are closed on Sundays,” Dotasra said. Shopkeepers in Jaipur have decided to keep their establishments shut to avoid law and order problems by unruly crowds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/internet-may-be-suspendedfor-reet-exam-tomorrow/articleshow/86495514.cms||---

The number of active cases in Nashik district this week was 1,035 out of which the city has 279 cases. Last week, the number of new cases in the district stood at 951, including 286 infections in the city. “It is good that new cases in urban areas are reducing. In rural areas only some pockets are witnessing rise in cases. The spike in new cases can be due to Ganeshotsav, but we need to deal with this strictly,” Bhujbal said. The positivity rate has also increased from 2.4% to 3%, but fatality rate was better than the state average. It should be noted 11 deaths due to Covid-19 were reported last week while two weeks ago the number was seven. “Installation of Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants in Harsul and Zodge was delayed a bit, while the work for plants across the rural areas of the district was completed on time,” he said. About availability of ambulances with the primary health centres (PHCs) in rural areas, he said at least 35 more ambulances will be made available to the PHCs as the state government has allotted funds for them. Talking about vaccination, Bhujbal said the district had gathered good pace in inoculation as so far 35% of the eligible population has been administered the first dose and 12.5 per cent have been fully vaccinated. “We have the capacity of administering 1 lakh doses per day. With availability of vaccines we can increase the pace,” Bhujbal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-cautions-people-against-rising-covid-cases/articleshow/86489081.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Active Covid case count remains plateau after Ganeshotsav||PUNE: The state Covid task force members on Friday iterated that there was no scope to be complacent despite a significant decline in active cases in most districts after the Ganeshotsav because the Delta variant was still in circulation. “We shall assess the situation two weeks after the Ganesh festivities though we did not register a significant rise in daily cases in the first week after the festival. Overall, there has been a slight decrease in cases in many districts, but the state’s active case count continued to be about 40,000. There has been a significant decline in cases in many parts of the country, but Maharashtra is going through a plateau. So, we can’t afford to be complacent,” said state task force member Dr Shashank Joshi. The post-Ganeshotsav Covid review meeting is scheduled to be held after October 2, two weeks after the festival. Joshi said the thinning of the Covid second wave tail was visible in most districts, but the state should not let the guard down with more festivities ahead. The health department officials felt that utmost caution should be exercised during Dasara and Diwali also. Joshi explained that whenever the waves waned, the cases dropped. The proportional drop registered was a good sign, but the trend should continue amid following all public health measures and Covid protocols, he said. The chairman of the state task force, Dr Sanjay Oak, told TOI that they were keeping their fingers crossed and arms flexed for vaccination. “Covid appropriate behaviour is a must when we are hoping to open schools, colleges and other establishments. Bad habits die hard and people should adhere to norms. If the cases do not explode 15 days after the festival, opening of schools adhering to protocols laid down by the paediatric task force may be considered.” Many experts feared a rise in the state’s weekly positivity rate (WPR) after the Ganeshotsav with the Delta variant in circulation and low testing. But the data put out by the health department pegged it at 2.28% for the week after the festival. WPR of only nine of the 35 districts was higher than the state average and nearly 17 districts registered less than 100 active cases. The declining trend of WPR in Pune district continued this week also. It registered an overall WPR of 3.8%. Pune civic limits’ WPR was 2.9% and in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation areas, it was 3.1%. WPR in Pune rural was 4.5%. Pune district health officials said they were focusing on rural areas this week also because of the increased movement of people during the festivities. The testing would be ramped up further in the rural pockets, they added. Senior health department officials stressed on more testing and contact tracing so that asymptomatic patients were isolated at the earliest. Many rural areas continued adding to the increasing WPR in some districts. They have been told to ramp up testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/active-case-count-remains-plateau-after-ganeshotsav/articleshow/86493280.cms||Nisha Nambiar

It hopes to cross the 50,000-mark by early next year and over a lakh by early 2023, an official said on Friday. After a smart meter is installed, you need to log in to a mobile app or consumer portal of the utility firm to get a real-time picture of energy consumption. You can check consumption on hourly, daily or monthly basis. You will also be able to know your projected monthly usage and compare your monthly usage with that of the last 12 months, and compare your consumption with your neighbours. The official said that to ensure good quality and tamper-proof meters, Tata Power’s smart meter testing lab received National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) accreditation. Tata Power president (T&D) Sanjay Banga said, “Our NABL accredited meter-testing lab is equipped to test smart meters on a real-time basis. This accreditation serves as a seal of approval for the quality of our smart meters.” You can get alerts for abnormal electricity usage at home so that you can optimise power consumption. Such meters prevent power thefts and ensure minimum electricity distribution losses, sources said. “If someone tries to steal power by tampering with meters, a message will be sent to the server,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tata-power-installs-20k-smart-meters-eyes-1l-by-2023/articleshow/86498282.cms||Somit Sen

The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday decided to implement a three-member ward system. Patole, after his arrival at the city airport, was addressing the media. “It’s responsibility to apprise the government of public sentiments about its decisions. During our meeting in Mumbai on Thursday, we decided to oppose the three-member ward system. We requested the government to have a two-member ward for the polls. Our senior minister Balasaheb Thorat would convey our feelings to the CM and other members of the cabinet in its next meeting,” he said. On his election petition against Union minister Nitin Gadkari, which is currently pending in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, the former assembly speaker said that many similar cases were dismissed in the entire country, “but his has continued till date as it had a lot of facts that exposed alleged irregularities committed by Gadkari in nomination papers”. Patole alleged that while filing an affidavit with the returning officer before the 2019 general elections, Gadkari had suppressed many things in his nomination papers. “We moved the judiciary to expose such wrongdoings. It is up to the court to decide the future course of action,” he said. On his much speculated meeting with leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai, the Sakoli MLA said it was regarding elections for Rajya Sabha seat where Congress wanted its candidate to be elected unopposed. “No discussions took place on revoking the suspension of 12 BJP MLAs as speculated. When some elected member expires, it is a tradition to elect the next member unopposed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cong-to-oppose-3-member-ward-system-for-civic-polls-patole/articleshow/86493300.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Ajit Pawar said the vaccine supply had improved in most districts but there had been few takers because of this huge gap between the first and the second dose of Covishield. “We shall seek a fresh directive in this regard from the central government to speed up vaccination in the state,” he said. The deputy chief minister said the issue was discussed in the cabinet and a proposal would be tabled before the Centre. Recently, the Karnataka government also wrote to the Centre seeking a reduction in the gap between the two doses of Covishield to complete the vaccination of the eligible population at the earliest.

Also, no deaths have been reported in the city due to both the infections. Trimbake said 174 people were fined over Rs 62,000 by various NMC squads for accumulation of water on their premises — residential and official. The bulk of the offences were at construction sites. The civic body has also served notices to 736 people, directing them to remove water that has accumulated on their premises.

Police have learned that one occasion there were 15 men who assaulted her. A team probing the case on Friday tracked down four more involved in the case. The total number of suspects apprehended is now 29 out of total 33. Two of them are minors, who were sent to the Bhiwandi remand home. The rest have been remanded in police custody till September 29. Assistant commissioner Sonali Dhole, who is leading the investigation, said, “Four different teams are searching for the remaining accused. We are sure we will be able to nab them soon.” Police have seized the mobile phones belonging to the arrested accused. They have said all the phones will be sent to the forensic team to retrieve data. The main accused, Vijay Fuke, had befriended the minor on a social networking platform. He raped her and made a video which was used to blackmail her and coerce her into sexual acts with his friends. Many of the accused to whom Fuke had sent the video, have deleted it from their phones along with the social media app through which they were trying to contact the rape survivor. Police have learned that the minor’s ordeal began on January 29 this year when Fuke took her to a friend’s residence. They served her juice with a sedative in it and recorded a video, which was used to blackmail her on several occasions. The victim has told Manpada police in Thane that whenever she tried to avoid calls from Fuke, he would pass on her number to others who would then call her from unlisted numbers and threaten to make the video viral. It was her aunt who discovered the situation she was in after she noticed the number of calls the minor was repeatedly receiving on her phone. Most of the accused are from Dombivli; three are from Rabale in Navi Mumbai. Sources said most of the arrested accused have confessed to sexually assaulting her, some on multiple occasions. Opposition leader Pravin Darekar on Friday visited Manpada police station. He demanded that Maharashtra government call an all-party meeting to discuss rising crimes against women. The girl has been admitted at Kalwa government hospital. Her condition was reported to be stable.  Minister for fast-tracking: Mumbai's guardian minister Aslam Shaikh visited Manpada police station. After meeting officers probing the gangrape case, Shaikh said the incident was an unfortunate one and demanded that the accused be punished as soon as possible by prosecuting the case on a fast track. "We want to send a message to the nation," said Sheikh.

---||Pune||1 in 2 persons in Maharashtra has received at least 1 Covid jab||PUNE: Nearly six months after the Covid vaccination programme started, every second person aged over 18 years in Maharashtra has received at least one dose and nearly one-fourth of the eligible beneficiaries have been fully inoculated. Latest data from the state health department revealed that over 5.36 crore people aged above 18, or 58% of the target population, have received the first dose of the vaccine till September 21. The data revealed that 2.13 crore people, or 23% of the target population, have received the second dose as well. Mumbai and Pune districts lead in administering the first dose of the vaccine (over 80%) while Hingoli and Nanded districts in Marathwada have the poorest record (less than 40%) in the category. Mumbai, Pune and Sindhurdurg districts ensured full vaccination of more than 35% of their respective populations, the data revealed. Health authorities across the state were trying to expand the coverage. Nashik’s Covid vaccine coordinator and deputy collector Ganesh Misal said the local administration was striving to fully vaccinate its 51.75 lakh beneficiaries by the end of this year, provided the supply of vaccines was smooth. “There were days when we vaccinated over 80,000 beneficiaries on a single day. Vaccines were available then. Our target is achievable since there is no more vaccine hesitancy among the beneficiaries,” added Misal. Stating that the Aurangabad civic administration has been getting sufficient vaccine doses, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s health officer Dr Neeta Padalkar said citizens should come forward to get inoculated without any fear or hesitancy. Kolhapur district authorities said their lead in vaccination has helped in reducing the number of Covid cases. “We have observed that the areas where the vaccination turnout was the highest now have very few Covid cases. Almost 70% of the population have received at least the first dose of the Covid vaccine,” said Kolhapur zilla parishad health officer Yogesh Sale.

---||Nagpur||Youngsters join hands against unsustainable development||Nagpur: Responding to state environment minister’s Aaditya Thackeray's call to youth’s contribution in combating climate change, over 100 city youngsters came together on Friday to agitate against unsustainable development leading to destruction of the green cover. The energy was at its peak on Friday morning at Ajni Vann, the city’s lush green mini-forest where over 40,000 trees are facing the axe from a multi-phased project of Inter-Modal Station (IMS). Holding banners and placards with bold messages regarding environment conservation, youngsters participated in the global climate strike which was called by the Delhi-based organization Youth for Climate India. The global climate strike is a follow-up of Fridays for Future movement started by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. The main aim was to draw the attention of policy-makers to save age-old trees at Ajni Vann. Though the protest was silent, the message was loud and clear – Save the trees at Ajni Vann and shift the project at Khapri. Recreating the Chipko movement, the youngsters also did a ‘tree-hugging’ campaign for around 30 minutes to express the significance of the age-old trees. “Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has also released a report underlining the importance of protection of nature and the harmful effects of pollutants in the air. The trees of urban forests like Ajni-Vann are lungs of the city which help in cleaning this toxic air. The youngsters of the city have vowed to continue this fight and raise the bar till their voices are heard everywhere. We have not inherited this earth from our forefathers,” said environment activist Kunal Mourya. A day ago, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray announced that policy-makers should get acquainted with the youth. “There is a lot of awareness about climate change because they are seeing it around us. Seeing erratic weather events causing damage, the youth has begun to rally together and speak about climate change, getting into protests or even action in many ways. That is very crucial for us that the youth has a good standard of living. They also realize that climate change could cause a lot of economic and social damage as well,” the minister had said. Stating that local administration and politicians should pay heed to Thackeray’s appeal, young activist Shreyas Pande who has also been a part of the Save Aarey campaign in Mumbai said, “Our politicians need to listen to the demand of citizens as well as concerns of experts. Rather than causing relentless destruction, a decision should be made after considering all aspects.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/youngsters-join-hands-against-unsustainable-development/articleshow/86493345.cms||Manka Behl

In one of the meetings, Rahul Gandhi directed the party to launch an “aggressive campaign” to ensure the defeat of BJP in the elections to be held in early 2022. State Congress president Girish Chodankar and opposition leader Digambar Kamat were closeted with former Union minister P Chidambaram and Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao as Congress deliberated on several issues including damage control in the event of desertions due to TMC’s plan to contest the forthcoming assembly elections. Chodankar and Kamat, who were summoned to Delhi on Thursday evening, held at least three marathon meetings where along with poll preparations, the entry of TMC in the 2022 elections battlefield was also discussed. Congress leadership also deliberated on the likely impact on the party if any of its senior functionaries or MLAs quit and joined TMC. Several aides of Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro indicated that the former chief minister could sever his several decades long relationship with the party. However, Kamat denied that the issue came up for discussion during the meetings with the AICC top brass. “The meetings were regarding election preparations, details such as the campaign, block reconstitution, control room for elections and where to set it up,” Kamat said. On Friday, AICC appointed Chodankar, Kamat and South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha on to the election coordination committee headed by Faleiro.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-discusses-tmc-entry-poll-prep-at-marathon-delhi-meets/articleshow/86495717.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, he asked me to change the will (dated August 29, 2011) and name Anand Giri as his successor,” said Dwivedi, a resident of Allahapur locality of Prayagraj. “He changed his will again in 2020 replacing Anand Giri with Balbeer Giri again, saying he would look after the Math and the temple in a better manner,” he said. On being asked why the mahant made a will so early (in 2010), Dwivedi said the practice was common for seers as they believe death could come anytime. The lawyer said he doubted that the signature and the handwriting in the “so called suicide note” was that of Mahant Narendra Giri. “Although it is for the police to decide but I have seen his handwriting for over a decade. He never wrote such long letters and to the best of my knowledge, it is not his handwriting,” Dwivedi claimed. He said on the fateful day (September 20), Narendra Giri called him around 12.45pm from a new number and said he wanted to discuss something very important, but did not disclose the matter over the phone. “There were differences between mahant Narendra Giri and Anand Giri over a portion of land on the premises of Baghambari Math. Narendra Giri had earlier given a piece of land, measuring about 400 square feet (on the right side of the entrance of the Math), on lease to Anand Giri. He wanted to cancel the lease and open a petrol pump so that the money could be used to meet the expenses of the Math. However, Anand Giri opposed the move which led to differences between the two,” he added. Dwivedi said irrespective of what was written in the suicide note of Narendra Giri, his last would stand and as per the law of the land, Balbeer Giri should be the mahant’s successor. Asked about the allegations made by Anand Giri that his guru made a lot of property in the name of his relatives and disciples, Dwivedi said: “These are false claims. The fame and prosperity earned by the Math under Narendra Giri is matchless. Whatever he did, it was only for the Math.” TOI also spoke to Man Singh, a 76-year old lawyer of the lower court in the district. Singh, who is one of the two witnesses of the last will of Narendra Giri, said: “The will (dated June 4, 2020) was signed by Narendra Giri in my presence and it was his last will which is registered”. The second witness of the will is another lawyer, RK Upadhyay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/giri-made-his-1st-will-in-2010-changed-twice/articleshow/86496822.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Pay Rs 500 more for jumping signal, riding without helmet||NAGPUR: Beware! traffic violators, especially those jumping red signals, using mobile phones while driving/riding, riding without helmet and not wearing seat belts while driving four-wheelers. The Nagpur traffic police have started imposing section 179 of Motor Vehicle Act, whereby violators will now be fined Rs 500 more for each of these offences. DCP (traffic) Sarang Awad said those caught riding without helmet will be fined Rs1,000 as against Rs500 earlier. Sadar traffic zone’s senior PI Jagvendrasingh Rajput said his zone has already started imposing this section. About section 179 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (disobedience of orders), Rajput said the traffic police has been applying it since the beginning of the year. “But now we have decided to add section 179 of the MVA (disobedience of orders) for six offences including driving at breakneck speed, jumping signals, using mobile phones while driving and driving without helmets,” said Rajput. Currently, as per MV Act, the penalty for driving without helmet is Rs500, Rs200 for signal jumping and Rs200 for using mobile phone while driving. Henceforth, the violators of these offences will have to pay Rs500 additional fine. Already in September, the traffic police has imposed section 179 on 2,370 violators, collecting Rs11.85 lakh fine from them, as per the traffic police data. In this calendar year (from January 1 to September 22), the traffic police have penalized 1,51,337 two-wheeler riders without helmet as against 1,18,493 during the corresponding period last year. Police stations penalizing violators City police stations will help Nagpur traffic police to penalize traffic violators, especially two-wheeler riders without helmet. “The decision has been taken following directives of commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar. Cops from police stations will focus on internal roads,” said Awad. Awad said all police stations have been provided with one card reader machine. The move is aimed at curbing road accidents involving two-wheeler riders. On day one of the joint drive, the traffic policemen from 10 zones and cops from 33 police stations, caught around 1,300 two-wheeler riders without helmet. Traffic police have also decided to approach the regional transport office (RTO) for suspending driving licence of repeat offenders. “Citing a Supreme Court order, the state home department had issued a notification regarding enforcement of section 19 of MV Act, 1988, and 21 subsections of Central Motor Vehicle Act, 1989, and directed the enforcement agencies (traffic police and RTOs) to suspend driving licences of repeated offenders. So, the traffic police will intensify this rule,” the senior PI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pay-rs500-more-for-jumping-signal-riding-without-helmet/articleshow/86493389.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Posting a video of him expressing his wishes in sign language on the occasion of ‘International Sign Language Day’ on September 23, Balakrishnan said, “We will start a training soon on sign language for willing police personnel in central zone to create a reserve who can communicate with persons with hard of hearing.” The idea to train the police personnel in sign language sparked after witnessing the difficulties faced by minor girl victims with hearing impairment in communicating sexual offences and other complaints to the police. “Such complainants could not convey what exactly happened to them in case of absence of people trained in sign language. This initiative will solve the issue,” Balakrishnan told TOI on Friday. Police personnel particularly from the armed reserve in Trichy rural, Karur, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapatinam and Mayiladuthurai districts will be selected based on their willingness. Personnel form the stations will not be interviewed as they will be transferred to the other places at regular intervals. The month-long training will be conducted by professional resource persons from the American Sign Language (ASL). The trained police personnel will then be asked to help in cases where their help is required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cops-in-central-zone-to-be-trained-in-sign-language/articleshow/86495626.cms||---

The RoB has been hanging fire for over five years awaiting a land transfer from the defence ministry.Instead of continuing to wait for the defence land measuring about 0.66 acres to complete the Chennai arm of the RoB, the council said the state highways can realign the arm and commission the facility. “State highways can perhaps conduct a study to find alternative plans without waiting for the defence land. If required, the state government can acquire land on the opposite side of the RoB, near Postal colony to complete the arm connecting Trichy-Chennai NH,” S Pushpavanam, secretary of the council, said. The council plans to approach the Madras high court with a petition seeking a specific directive within a timeframe to fetch a solution for the long-pending project. When the council approached the court earlier to expedite the project, it had directed the state highways to resolve the dispute in 10 weeks. However, a solution is yet to materialise even after more than 16 weeks. “Defence ministry cannot be responsible for the delay, the state highways should have completed the land acquisition in the first place before launching the civil work,” Pushpavanam added. The consumer protection council also urged the state government to relocate Gandhi market to the outskirts. The council passed a resolution requesting the commissioner, civil supplies and consumer protection department, to provide alternate means of verifying a person’s identity at PDS outlets as the scanning of fingerprints causes hardship to senior citizens whose fingerprints have disappeared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/plea-to-go-for-alternative-plan-to-complete-rob-arm-in-trichy/articleshow/86495666.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Daughters made guardians of mom with dementia||MUMBAI: In an interim order, the Bombay high court on Friday permitted the daughters of a woman with progressive dementia to act as her legal guardians so that they can pay mounting medical and other bills. A bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar directed that “having regard to the urgency of this situation, we permitted the petitioners to act as guardians and managers of the person and property of (their mother) including to operate her bank accounts for the limited purpose to meet her medical and other expenses”. They told the daughters to submit a statement of expenses after two weeks. Senior advocate Iqbal Chagla assured they would. “Because of the emergent situation, we have passed this order,” said Justice Bhuyan. The 84-year-old mother, a former resident of Colaba, has been in a Navi Mumbai care facility since February 2019. The daughters’ petition said in 2017, she found it increasingly difficult to attend to her day-to-day affairs and her condition steadily deteriorated. “She started to become unaware of her surroundings, began losing her memory, had difficulty in recognising family, friends or staff members, refused to eat or take medication… on several occasions had to be stopped from attempting to jump from her 5th floor flat.” The bank, with which she has substantial savings and term deposit accounts, initially released payments for medical expenses but stopped. On HC’s direction, a JJ Hospital panel certified that her dementia has advanced and impaired judgement. The state opposed the plea, saying there is an alternative remedy before the authority/committee under the Mental Health Care Act, Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act and National Trust Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-daughters-made-guardians-of-mom-with-dementia/articleshow/86495692.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Nagpur||Illegal hawkers, vendors shouldn’t be allowed to run business on roads: HC||Nagpur: Reiterating that illegal hawkers should be completely prohibited from operating their business from the roads or encroached area, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has stressed on the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to ensure that rule of law is upheld at any cost in such cases. “By issuing directives to NMC, this court has only sought to ensure that rule of law is upheld. No encroacher, illegal vendor and person through illegal structures is allowed to carry on their business on the street or in any encroached area,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor ruled. The directives came while hearing a petition filed by lawyer Nitin Lalwani and five other residents of Jaripatka through Shyam Dewani claiming inconvenience due to the encroachment by poultry, meat and vegetable vendors. The HC’s tough stand came as an eye-opener for the civic body which has failed to remove rampant encroachments on every major road and footpath across the city, which are occupied by thousands of illegal hawkers and vendors. This leads to congestion in majority of city areas. Despite repeated complaints, officials failed to act against them. The civic body’s action sometimes turned out to be a ‘farce’ as the next day the encroachers reoccupy the same place, said the lawyers. Earlier, an intervention was filed through counsel Mohammed Ateeq contending that hawkers or vendors from Jaripatka were adversely affected by NMC’s drive to remove them as per the court’s orders. He pointed out that poor persons have been carrying on their business of street vending for over 25 years and initially they were also granted licenses for carrying on their business. Quoting Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, Ateeq argued that NMC’s action had affected their fundamental right to carry on the business. So far no proper steps as per the Act have been taken by NMC and therefore, their fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution of India has been adversely affected. NMC counsel Jemini Kasat countered by informing that when the hawkers or vendors filed their applications for renewal of vending licenses, those were not decided on the ground that the Town Vending Committee (TVC) was yet to receive approval from the Maharashtra government. He added there is not a single hawker or vendor, who possesses a valid licence to carry on the business in Jaripatka. “We are conscious of the difficulties being faced by various unlicensed hawkers or vendors, but this court is also required to see that no person in the name of street vending or hawking is permitted to carry on business in violation of the provisions of law,” the judges said. They granted liberty to hawkers or vendors to raise grievances before appropriate courts and forums, including NMC. “Their grievance cannot be raised in this petition, as it is only about removal of encroachments and stopping of business carried on by illegal establishments, encroachers, unlicensed hawkers or street vendors,” the bench said before disposing of the plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/illegal-hawkers-vendors-shouldnt-be-allowed-to-run-business-on-roads-hc/articleshow/86493458.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The delegation, led by state NCP president Jose Philip D’Souza, also discussed the need for an alliance to take on BJP in the poll-bound state. D’Souza has pressed for an alliance with Congress and other like-minded parties on the lines of Maharashtra’s Maha Vikas Aghadi. “I want the Goa assembly elections to be fought together so that the secular vote is not divided. That is why we are putting pressure,” D’Souza said. Pawar reportedly took stock of the ongoing poll preparations, the chances of NCP in Goa and the likely constituencies where it stands a chance in the 2022 assembly elections. Pawar was also briefed about the All India Trinamool Congress’ foray and the arrival of TMC leaders in Goa. D’Souza said he is not worried about reports that TMC has contacted lone NCP MLA Churchill Alemao. “I heard that TMC called Alemao, but they are calling all politicians. I am not worried because I trust our MLA,” he said. In 2014, Alemao resigned from Congress and joined TMC. He subsequently contested the Lok Sabha election from South Goa and though he lost, he ate into Congress’ vote share. Pawar is also learnt to be keen for a ghatbandhan to defeat BJP. He urged the party functionaries to expedite their preparation for the assembly polls||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-ncp-moots-mva-like-alliance-with-sharad-pawar/articleshow/86495778.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Trichy||They dig at will to put up telecom poles||Trichy: Rampant digging and improper erection of metal poles for private telecommunication firms on numerous residential roads in Trichy city have been putting residents to much difficulties. Apart from affecting mobility in the long run, the unprofessional manner in which the poles are erected for transmitting telecommunication cables impacts underground pipelines for water and drainage in these residential localities. Residents complain that the urban local body has dismally failed to regulate the telecom companies which are on an overdrive in installing metal poles.While most of the cable and pole installation work carried out by the companies have the permission of Trichy corporation, there are deviations in the execution. At Selvanagar, residents were clueless as to why the space adjacent to the roads was dug up at multiple locations, which points to a lack of transparency in the way the work is carried out. Poles awaiting erection are first placed horizontally along the roads 50-60 feet apart. Next, to position them, workers deputed by the private firms dig the ground for about a feet to raise a concrete base. On several occasions, residents said that underground water pipelines were disturbed resulting in overflow of potable water to the drains or severing of water supply pipeline to the households. The poles were placed unscientifically too in a way that they shrunk the existing width of the narrow residential-cum-commercial roads. In Thillai Nagar cross streets, almost eight months after the streets were dug and closed after installing the cables, poor workmanship in filling the trenches has been causing inconvenience to commuters. “In certain areas, the telecom companies without consulting us are digging and disturbing water pipelines. We make the companies rectify the damages incurred,” an official with Trichy corporation said. The workers digging the ground and placing poles were not involving technical assistants and plumbers with the civic body and avoid such inconveniences, the official said. K P Rangaprasad, joint secretary of Satta Panchayat Iyakkam, said the city corporation must constitute ward sabha comprising residents to protect public properties. “Officials must monitor the work closely or monitoring should be done through the residents to avoid damages,” he added. Responding to the charges, Trichy corporation said that it will plan a meeting with representatives of telecom firms to raise awareness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/they-dig-at-will-to-put-up-telecom-poles/articleshow/86495651.cms||Deepak Karthik

The department invoked the emergency prohibition power to stop the outlet from functioning as it was caught and penalised twice earlier.Officials said the stall was caught selling gutka and pan masala on April 28 and August 9 when a penalty of Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 were levied separately. Since the offence was repeated, food safety officer Dr R Rameshbabu recommended to the commissioner of the food safety department, Dr P Senthilkumar, to permit lock and seal action earlier this month. As the commission approved the request and issued the emergency prohibition order, the department locked and sealed the shop functioning at Trichy corporation’s commercial complex near EVS street in Srirangam.“We will take the same action against tea stalls selling banned tobacco products, but general stores have stopped selling the banned products. We have no powers to allow the shop to reopen. The shop owner can approach courts or our department’s headquarters,” the district food safety officer told TOI. Shops caught and penalised more than once are likely to face a similar lock and seal action. Tea stalls were selling the banned products secretly by mobilising contraband on demand. Food safety officials said the sale of contraband happens with one of the shop workers bringing the banned product stored at a different location. On Friday, the food safety department in Thuraiyur town seized 115 kg of banned tobacco from a private godown. Residents with complaints pertaining to food safety can lodge a complaint at 94440-42322 (WhatsApp).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tea-stall-sealed-for-selling-banned-tobacco/articleshow/86495673.cms||---

The new feature may go live by the next week. A senior Union government official with CoWIN said the introduction of the new feature stems from the technical discussions between India and the UK on the certification. A senior official with the portal told TOI, “We believe that the UK wants the date of birth format in the CoWIN certificate as per the WHO standards in the dd-mm-yy format for international travellers. Hence, the same feature will be introduced in the CoWIN certificates for those going abroad.” CoWIN vaccination certificate displays the beneficiary’s name, age based on the year of birth, gender, ID, unique health ID, vaccine name, date of first dose, date of second dose, vaccinator, vaccination centre’s name and city/state. A senior official from the ministry of health and family welfare told TOI, “No changes are required in the current CoWIN certificates as the format is in sync with WHO standards. The new feature can be opted for by those who want to travel abroad.” National Health Authority chief executive officer Ram Sewak Sharma, who is also the head of the CoWIN platform, said, “As per WHO Covid vaccination certificate template, there is a ‘date of birth’ column, which is optional. At CoWIN, we collect only the year of birth of the beneficiary, as per which his/her age reflects on the vaccination certificate. Hence, the new feature will be introduced only for those travelling internationally. Such users can download their updated certificate after putting in their month and day of birth as per their passport. The downloaded certificate will then contain the full date of birth of the beneficiary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cowin-to-add-date-of-birth-for-fully-vaccinated-going-abroad/articleshow/86493463.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Ramjanmabhoomi ‘owner’ & Ram Lalla’s fast friend Triloki Nath Pandey no more||AYODHYA: Triloki Nath Pandey, who was bestowed with the ownership of Ramjanmabhoomi by the historic Supreme Court decree of November 9, 2019, by virtue of his stature as ‘Fast Friend of Ram Lalla’ passed away late Friday. He was 75. A key Hindu litigant in the Ayodhya title suit, Pandey had moved Supreme Court after he was given the sanctum sanctorum (middle part) in a three-way division of the then disputed land by a three-judge bench of Allahabad High Court in August, 2010. Triloki Nath Pandey was the third in the line of ‘Friends of Ram Lalla’ after Devaki Nandan Agarwal and TP Verma. Pandey was considered as the real liberator of Ramjanmabhoomi for his decades-old legal battle, which finally he won. He was not high-profile leader of Ram temple movement, but he devoted his entire life to a legal battle for Ramjanmabhoomi. Despite his long association with Vishwa Hindu Parishad, he believed in a harmonious relationship with his Muslim brethren, particularly Muslim lawyers pleading the Babri Masjid case. Pandey's younger son Amit Pandey, a Delhi-based software engineer, confirmed Pandey's death to TOI. Amit said, his father passed at 8pm at Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow, where he was hospitalised a fortnight back. His mortal remains will be brought to Ayodhya late night and then his last rites will be performed at his ancestral village in Ballia district. In an interview to TOI, a month before the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict, he had said, “It was Lord Ram, who inspired us to fight for his rights in court. To represent God is a glorious job and to think I was chosen to do this job from among millions of Hindus made me proud and joyful.” Iqbal Ansari, Muslim litigant in the Ayodhya title suit, said, “He was a close friend of my father late Hashim Ansari, the oldest litigant of Babri Masjid case. He always visits us on Eid and continued the practice even after the Ayodhya verdict. He strengthened communal harmony in the temple town.” Talking to TOI, Acharya Satyendra Das, chief priest of Ramjanmabhoomi temple, said, “It’s a big loss to the Hindu community. Pandey ji was a warrior of the Ram Mandir movement and was always confident of victory for the deity.” Secretary of Ayodhya Mosque Trust, Athar Husain, said, “Pandey was a living example of Ganga Jamuni tehzeeb. He regularly visits Muslim households on Eid to greet them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rjb-owner-ram-lallas-fast-friend-no-more/articleshow/86496842.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

Given the developments so far, it is expected that the plant may start production by December end. A team of MADC is visiting the site every week and photographing the development as part of the review of the project. Lately, the company also brought the pre-cooling machine at the plant. The raw material which includes fruits and other agricultural products will be preserved in the machine. The cooling machine is one of the core equipment of the plant. “Once the machine is installed, it can be expected that the project may finally be started by December 31 as assured earlier,” said Deepak Kapoor, the vice chairman and managing director of MADC. The company will now start with products made after processing the local orange apart from flour, tooth paste and other items. “They have also agreed to employ local workforce in the plant,” said Kapoor. The MADC has allotted 2.5 acres land to another food processing company, Cosgrow Agro Med in the special economic zone (SEZ). The company is expected to use raw material procured from the region and create 100 direct and indirect employment jobs clubbed, said a press release issued by MADC. In another development, Anjani Logistics, a company from Nagpur, has emerged the largest bidder offering Rs6,001 per square metre for a four acre land parcel in Mihan. Three bidders in all had taken part in the auction process. The sale will get around Rs10 crore for the MADC. Anjani Logistics had earlier emerged as a bidder for setting up a hospital in Mihan. The idea is to create more facilities in Mihan so that it develops as a city within the city. The plot will have residential and commercial units both. Once such facilities come up it is expected to attract more investment in the area. The entire area should remain bustling rather than bearing a desolate look once the factory hours are over. MADC, which is a state government agency, is the developer of Mihan project which includes SEZ and a domestic tariff area (DTA). Patanjali has acquired over 200 acres land in the DTA through a bidding process in 2016. The project could not be completed in time. Patanjali had plans to come up with the world’s biggest food processing zone at Nagpur. As the delay continued, MADC had set a deadline for Patajali to start the project by December 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/watchful-madc-hopes-patanjali-starts-mihan-unit-by-dec-end/articleshow/86493466.cms||Shishir Arya

Compared to other varieties, it would be of superior quality with pest resistance, he told reporters here on Friday. “The new variety would be of fine grain with good cooking quality. It will be a pest-and-disease-resistant one. Most probably, it will be released before Pongal festival,” he added. Around 350 eminent scientists from various organizations across the country are participating in the two-day global rice conference jointly organised by TNAU and Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (IIFPT) in Thanjavur. They have been discussing crop management and improvement at the meet and are presenting about 300 research papers. Kumar said though the government is keen on expanding the area of cultivation every year, it faces challenges like drought, submergence, pests and disease. Scientists discussed introduction of tolerance varieties and adopting new technologies at the conference, he said. TNAU has been significantly contributing to rice research by giving 27% weightage to it among all its research programmes. The university has played a major role in developing high-yielding varieties of rice and introducing and popularising varieties since 1960 as part of the green revolution, he added. He said farmers in general have incurred losses whenever they cultivated BPT rice for its returns unmindful of risks like pest and disease. In his address, director of Indian Agricultural Research Institute AK Singh recalled the recently developed herbicide-tolerant rice mutant ‘Robin’ in memory of the scientist who worked in TNAU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tnau-to-release-pest-resistant-rice-variety-before-pongal/articleshow/86495701.cms||---

The woman was alone at home as her family had gone to Mumbai when she delivered the stillborn fetus in the seventh month of pregnancy. The fetus was buried by her paramour, who is already married with a son from his second wife. In her statement to the police, the rape victim said her paramour had forced himself upon her on more than 50 occasions since 2016 at different places. The paramour, Sohail Wahab Khan, is now in custody of Yashodhara Nagar police station after being arrested on charges of rape on Thursday. When she became pregnant, the woman was forced to abort by Khan, a driver, citing his inability to marry her immediately as he was already married with a son. Police said the woman was told by Khan to follow the steps shown in the YouTube video to detach the fetus from the body by cutting the cord. The woman is learnt to have risked her life by cutting the cord with whatever equipment she could manage in her home and kitchen. Though the incident had taken place a few weeks back, the family approached police after coming to know about it now. On Friday, police summoned a forensic team from Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital and the subdivisional magistrate to exhume the remains of the fetus from Taj Nagar burial ground. However, the police were unable to trace it. On Thursday, Yashodhara nagar police registered an offence of rape against the woman’s paramour Khan after the survivor’s family approached the cops. “The family of the victim felt that Khan had ditched her with false promises as he was already a family man with a child and did not have enough income,” said senior inspector Sanjay Jadhav of Yashodhara Nagar police station. It’s learnt Khan and the woman have been in a relationship for around six years. Khan, a driver, is married twice earlier in the past. After divorcing his first wife, Khan had married for the second time a few years back and also had a son. Despite being married twice earlier, Khan had befriended the woman around six years ago and repeatedly exploited her promising marriage. Police said the woman claimed that her paramour had forced himself upon her after spiking drinks and had been repeatedly exploiting her. She claimed the abortion had taken place after a fall when the rest of the family was away. Senior inspector Sanjay Jadhav of Yashodhara Nagar police station said the fetus could not be traced despite excavating the place where the accused paramour had buried it. “We were trying to exhume the remains of the fetus for DNA sampling but unfortunately it could not be traced. We are still trying to find the remains of the fetus,” he said.

---||Pune||Pune: Woman pushed off bike & robbed||PUNE: A 21-year-old woman suffered injuries on her fingers in a fall after a man intercepted and kicked her scooter before snatching her smartphone along the road that links Vishrantwadi with Lohegaon airport in the early hours of Thursday. The suspect drove away from the spot on a motorcycle, police said. Sub-inspector Vishal Patil of the Yerawada police told TOI, “The woman works in a private company in Kalyaninagar. The incident occurred when she was on her way home around 5am after completing her night duty.” No arrest was reported till Friday evening as the Yerawada police were looking for some definite clues to zero in on the suspect. “We had detained one person on suspicion, but his questioning barely revealed anything. We had to let him off,” a police officer said. “We are now collecting CCTV footage from some of the auto service centres in the vicinity to see if we can get some worthwhile clues,” he said. “The spot where the incident occurred is relatively isolated and is not covered by CCTV cameras,” he added. The police are trying to trace the robbed cellphone handset through technical surveillance. However, no breakthrough has been reported till Friday evening. Citing the victim’s statement recorded with the police, Patil said, “As the woman reached the spot near an auto service centre, a motorcyclist overtook and intercepted her scooter, forcing her to stop. The man started removing the ignition key of her scooter, but the woman resisted. The man then kicked her scooter, resulting in the woman falling down on the road because of the sudden jerk.” He said, “All of a sudden, the man started kicking her. The woman screamed for help, but there was no one to come to her rescue.” “She then took out her cellphone to call the police. The man, however, snatched it. He threatened the woman not to follow him and drove away from the spot,” the officer added. The injured woman registered a complaint with the Yerawada police late on Thursday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-pushed-off-bike-robbed/articleshow/86493518.cms||---
---||Lucknow||BJP-NISHAD party alliance to continue for 2022 UP elections||LUCKNOW: Ending wild speculations about their blow-hot-blow-cold ties, the BJP and Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Apna Dal (NISHAD) on Friday formally announced that their alliance would continue for the crucial UP assembly elections due in the next few months. The development that marked saffron party’s strategy to amalgamate the electorally significant Nishad community which accounts for around 15% of the OBC bloc — came about in the presence of Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan during his first visit to UP after being appointed as BJP’s UP election in charge. Pradhan himself happens to be a prominent OBC face in the Narendra Modi cabinet. “We reiterate our being together for the forthcoming UP elections,” announced Pradhan, while addressing a press conference at UP BJP office. Flanked by UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and NISHAD party chief Sanjay Nishad, Pradhan said that the seat-sharing formula with the ally partner has already been finalised and would be announced “at an appropriate time”. BJP vice-president and party’s UP in charge, Radha Mohan Singh and cabinet minister Sidharthnath Singh, who is learnt to have been acting as a bridge between Sanjay Nishad and the BJP leadership, were also present. While Pradhan refused to give further details, speculations were rife about BJP agreeing to give anything between three to four seats in east UP where the Nishad and associated 15 sub-castes community have a substantial electoral presence. The BJP could further accommodate Sanjay Nishad by nominating him to the UP legislative council. Sanjay, as a matter of fact, has been demanding many more seats while making claims about his party having a significant electoral base in at least 60 seats. Pradhan said that the BJP was in touch with other smaller parties too and would bring them on board. “Politics is a dynamic process and requires assimilation of different political groups,” he said, while speaking to TOI. He further asserted that the BJP would groom leaders of various caste groups within the party while following the principle of “Samajik Samrasta” (social harmony). The coming together of the two parties, comes after days of consistent parleys between Sanjay Nishad and senior BJP leaders including party national president JP Nadda and Home minister Amit Shah in Delhi. As Sanjay flexed political muscles to bargain hard with the BJP -- he once demanded being announced as deputy CM candidate of the alliance -- the saffron outfit held on to its nerves. Notably, Nishad’s aggression diminished dramatically following a purported sting operation which portrayed him in a bad light vis-a-vis a senior BJP leader. The coming together of BJP and NISHAD party is also seen as a sharp counter to a SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar — a former ally of BJP — who is learnt to be attempting to cobble up an alliance with Bihar’s Mukesh Sahni-led Vikassheel Insan Party (VIP) which, too, has its politics centered around Nishad community. Sahni, who is a minister in Nitish Kumar government in Bihar, has been sensing the pulse of politically crucial UP and has been coming to the state frequently. In 2017 assembly elections, NISHAD party had contested 72 seats but managed to win just one — Vijay Mishra won from Gyanpur — while garnering 3.58% vote share of the total seats contested. Sanjay Nishad managed to register his presence when his 31-year-old son, Praveen, contested as a BSP-backed SP candidate during 2018 bypolls in Gorakhpur, the seat vacated by Yogi Aditynath after taking reins of UP as its CM, and defeated the BJP candidate Upendra Dutta Shukla by a margin of 21,961 votes. The BJP, however, managed to win over the NISHAD party and successfully fielded Praveen Nishad as a BJP candidate from Sant Kabir Nagar during 2019 Lok Sabha elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-nishad-party-alliance-to-continue-for-2022-up-elections/articleshow/86496843.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Nagpur||Objectionable post on Hindu God: HC ‘no’ to quash FIR against man||Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court rejected an application for quashing an FIR against a 58-year-old man over posting a highly objectionable message against a Hindu deity in a religious WhatsApp group. The resident of Parsheoni in Nagpur district, had deleted the offending message from his mobile handset after the police complaint, which the prosecution claimed was done with an intention to “destroy the evidence”. “We have carefully considered allegations in the FIR and reply filed by the investigating agency. On scrutiny, we are of the prima facie opinion that the message posted by the petitioner, as stated in the FIR, is objectionable. Whether there was malicious intention on his part is a matter to be considered by the agency during the probe,” a division bench comprising justices Vinay Deshpande and Amit Borkar said. Petitioner Jafar Ali Sher Ali Sayyad was a member of a WhatsApp group comprising complainant Manish Singh and other members from the area. It was created for the purpose of celebrating Durga Puja and other related programmes during the nine-day festival. On October 9, 2019, Sayyad allegedly posted an abusive and disrespectful message about Goddess Durga in the group to create disturbance in the locality and hurt public sentiments. Subsequently, Singh lodged a police complaint against him at Kanhan police station. After preliminary investigations, the police booked Sayyad for offences punishable under Sections 295A and 153A of IPC. He challenged the police action in HC, praying for its quashing while denying his role in the crime. While issuing notices to the respondents, including Kanhan police and the complainant on December 22, 2019, the HC directed both to file replies. The cops later confirmed the petitioner had posted a seriously abusive message in the WhatsApp group meant for religious purposes. Justices Deshpande and Borkar observed that at this stage, the investigating agency’s right to investigate into the offence cannot be throttled. “The discretion conferred by CrPC section 482 is to be exercised judiciously and in consonance with well-established principles set out by the Supreme Court. Whether the message’s contents are malicious or intended to outrage religious sentiments of the community, cannot be considered at this stage.” The judges noted that the power to quash FIR cannot be invoked to scuffle legitimate prosecution. “It would not have been proper to express conclusive opinion on the nature of the offence or investigation to be carried out. It would be advisable to leave it for the agency to consider whether there is sufficient material available against the petitioner, in relation to offences alleged against him are fulfilled or not,” they said. WHAT HC SAID * Prima facie opinion is that message posted by petitioner is objectionable * Whether there was malicious intention is to be considered by agency * Investigating agency’s right to probe into offence cannot be throttled * Discretion conferred by CrPC’s Section 482 is to be exercised judiciously * Power to quash the FIR cannot be invoked to scuffle the legitimate prosecution||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/objectionable-post-on-hindu-god-hc-no-to-quash-fir-against-man/articleshow/86493551.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The court of judicial magistrate first class Sachin Nyaharkar on September 21 directed Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta to supervise a fresh investigation into the rape case, after making some strong observations against the investigating officer (IO) ACP Nishikant Bhujbal, who had filed the `B' summary report. "The conclusion drawn by the IO on the basis of records is not sufficient to accept the `B' summary report filed by him," the court said and added, "In the present case it appears that IO has not investigated the present offence lawfully." “It also appears that the investigation carried out by the IO is victim oriented and not accused oriented," the court said.  A fresh probe will now be done by the inspector in-charge of Cidco police station, where the case has been registered, under supervision of the police chief, the court stated. When contacted, police chief Gupta told TOI, "I would not like to make any comment on the matter now."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/court-asks-top-cop-to-supervise-fresh-probe/articleshow/86489419.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Patna||Katihar’s Shubham tops UPSC civil services exam||PATNA: Katihar’s Shubham Kumar has topped the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) civil services examination 2020, the results of which were declared on Friday. Apart from Shubham, two more students from Bihar – Jamui’s Praveen Kumar and Samastipur’s Satyam Gandhi – have made it to the list of top 10 rank holders. While Praveen has secured seventh rank, Satyam has bagged tenth rank. Shubham, who hails from Kumheri panchayat in Kadwa block, had cleared the UPSC exam last year as well and secured AIR 290. He is presently undergoing training in Pune. Born to Devanand Singh, a cashier at Uttar Bihar Gramin Bank, and Punam Singh, a homemaker, Shubham had done engineering from Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay in 2018. “Proper guidance is necessary to crack the UPSC exam. Some basic books can help students clear the exam. Motivation, self-study and analysis will make anyone successful in the exam. My sources were always limited, but I thoroughly read everything I came across. I always self-analyse myself and identify my weak points,” Shubham told reporters after the declaration of results. He added, “It is not necessary for the UPSC candidates to go outside the state for preparations. They can do so even at their own place. The students can use internet to seek guidance. Last year, at least 40 students from Bihar had cleared the exam.” Shubham had done his matriculation from Vidya Vihar in Purnia and Intermediate from Chimaniya Vidyalaya, Bokaro. His mother Punam said, “My son was a meritorious student since he was studying in Class I. Becoming an IAS officer was his goal.” Head of civil engineering department at IIT-Bombay, Deepankar Choudhury, said Shubham was a good student, very focussed and humble. He graduated from IIT-Bombay’s BTech course in 2018 and bagged a CPI of 8.37 out of 10. After graduation, he started preparing for civil services exam. Shubham’s father said, “My son did hard work and it is also the blessing of Lord Shiva that a poor man’s son has succeeded in life. We are getting congratulatory messages and good wishes from everywhere.” Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, who is also from Katihar, tweeted, “Hearty congratulations to Shubham for making Katihar and Bihar proud. Your success will become a source of inspiration for lakhs of students of Bihar. I wish you a bright future (sic).” Nitish congratulates Shubham Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday congratulated Katihar’s Shubham Kumar on topping the UPSC civil services (main) examination 2020. “After securing the top position in the 2020 civil services examination, Shubham Kumar, a native of Katihar district, has not only raised the prestige of Bihar but also made the whole country proud. His achievement will inspire other youths of Bihar to do more good things. I extend my congratulations and best wishes to Shubham,” Nitish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/katihars-shubham-tops-upsc-civil-services-exam/articleshow/86493651.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Students complain of discrepancies in MBA entrance exam||Nagpur: MBA aspirants from Maharashtra have complained of several discrepancies in the questions asked in the Common Entrance Test (CET) conducted by the State CET Cell . According to them, the exam conducted for admissions to various management colleges across the state had failed to follow the pattern of previous years as many questions were “out of course”. The Maharashtra Student Welfare Association (MSWA) rushed a letter to state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant requesting him to immediately institute an inquiry and take favourable decision in the interest of the students. MSWA president Vaibhav Edke warned the government of approaching the Bombay High Court to seek justice for students, who he said were made to unnecessarily suffer for no fault. Joint director for technical education in Nagpur Manoj Daigavhane refused to comment while diverting all queries to the CET Cell officials. “The entire responsibility of conducting the entrance exam and centralized admission process (CAP) is looked at by the CET,” he told TOI. According to the students who flooded social media with their complaints, the MAH MBA CET is usually conducted in March every year but due to the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, it was delayed by six months. It was held on September 16, 17 and 18 in six slots in which over 1.32 lakh candidates appeared. As per the pattern mentioned in the exam brochure, the aspirants were supposed to be tested on the questions related to logical reasoning (75 marks), abstract reasoning (25 marks), quantitative aptitude (50 marks), and verbal ability/reading comprehension (50 marks). Each of these sections have one mark question each. However, students said the pattern was not followed in some slots, “as they were asked 50 questions in logical reasoning while the section carrying 50 marks had over 90 questions”. For all these years, all four sections used to be separately provided in the question paper, but this year it was jumbled into a single section. “A lot of questions were ambiguous and out-of-syllabus. A couple of questions were on subjects like chemistry and general knowledge. As per the exam pattern, some questions like on passage and puzzles were asked in a certain format where they were clubbed together. This year, however, several of us received these questions randomly leading to total confusion,” the students said. According to them, they had prepared hard for this exam throughout their graduation years with an aim to get a seat in a good college. “However, with such goof ups in the exams, our dreams have shattered. We prepared for this day, as per mock test and planned strategies accordingly. Some of us have even left jobs to focus on this exam. Now we have lost all hopes,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/students-complain-of-discrepancies-in-mba-entrance-exam/articleshow/86493605.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||No power cuts, says MSEDCL amid coal crisis||NASHIK: Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Ltd (MSPGCL) is facing acute shortage of coal, impacting thermal power production across the state. However, consumers need not worry as Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) has ruled out power cuts. MSPGCL officials said that coal production at Bhusawal and Chandrapur plants, which produce 210 MW of power a day each, has stopped. The installed production capacity of the seven thermal generation plants is 9,750 MW, per day, and they are presently producing 4,000 MW. “We have stocks that would last for another couple of days. However, all efforts are being made to procure enhanced supply from coal companies,” an official from MSPGCL told TOI. According to the official, supply of coal has declined by about 50% of daily requirement at around 1.30 lakh metric tonnes to operate the seven thermal plants. “The erratic coal supply started about a month ago, following heavy rainfall, which has affected coal mining activities. Moreover, transportation too has been impacted due to the showers,” added the official. State energy minister Nitin Raut is in touch with the union government on the issue to boost coal supply for thermal power plants. MSEDCL has ruled out any possibility of resorting to load shedding for now. “The per day power requirement in the state is around 16,000-17,000 MW. But, we are able to meet the demand. There has been no load shedding in the state as we are buying power from other entities to cater to consumers,” added another MSEDCL official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-power-cuts-says-msedcl-amid-coal-crisis/articleshow/86493668.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Nagpur||Standing panel nod to reappropriate Rs41.5cr to improve tar roads||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) standing committee on Friday gave a nod to reappropriate Rs41.50 crore for improving condition of tar roads across the city, said panel chairman Prakash Bhoyar. Addressing media persons, Bhoyar said that funds have been deducted from 12 heads. He said standing committee member and senior BJP corporator Sanjay Balpande had submitted the proposal in Friday’s meeting. Now, the proposal will be tabled before the general body which is scheduled to meet on September 27, he said and added that after the House’s nod, the administration will have to reapproprirate funds from the current budget within a week. The panel also gave its nod to construct a double-decker elevated reservoir — first of its kind in the country — in Omkar Nagar, claimed Bhoyar and executive engineer (water works) Shweta Banerjee. Banerjee said that earlier the NMC had proposed to construct two ESRs at different places. However, due to non-availability of land in Mhalgi Nagar, the NMC had to scrap the plan, she claimed. Later, it was decided to construct a double- decker ESR in Chakrapani Nagar in east Nagpur. A brainchild of former water works committee chairman Vijay Zalke, the NMC will spend Rs14.45 crore for this project which will have twin ESRs with a capacity of 20 lakh litre water storage capacity. To a query, Banerjee said that the NMC had also conducted soil bearing capacity of the land through GeoTech, which gave a positive report. “So, we will now go ahead with this project,” said Bhoyar. The panel also approved the health department’s proposal to earmark funds for health infrastructure in view of the projected third wave of Covid-19. Rs 5.39 crore will be spent for operations and recruiting staff for dedicated Covid hospitals and vaccination centres. Covid-19 cases in the city are under control but chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said, “We need to be cautious as cases are slowly increasing.” Dr Chilkar said the NMC has already approached the state and central governments for providing funds to run hospitals. To combat the pandemic, in 2020-21 the NMC had received Rs1.94 crore from central government and Rs9 crore from state government. This year, the civic body had received Rs15 crore from the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/standing-panel-nod-to-reappropriate-rs41-5cr-to-improve-tar-roads/articleshow/86489403.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Pune||Land for Pune airport expansion to soon get infrastructure committee nod||PUNE: Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday said the Centre’s infrastructure committee would soon approve a proposal to sanction 13 acres of defence land for the expansion of the city airport. Gadkari, speaking on the sidelines of an event in the city, said the committee — which he chairs — was likely to approve the proposal in its next meeting. “The Air Force requires some land in Chandigarh. We told the airport authorities to submit a proposal suggesting that land in Chandigarh be handed over to the IAF in exchange for land in Pune. The proposal has been sanctioned and will come before the infrastructure committee. I will see it gets through,” Gadkari said after breaking ground for a flyover project on Sinhagad Road. Gadkari expressed his satisfaction with the pace of work on the city’s three vital projects — Metro, airport and Mula-Mutha pollution reduction. Further, Gadkari said toll has been abolished on the Pune-Satara Road. “The stretch had become problematic as many accidents were occurring. We have terminated the toll on this route. The pending work on this road is likely to finish by December, February at the latest. We will allot Rs50 crore,” he said. Gadkari also said that a safety audit of the road will be carried out with the help of an expert agency. He said a multi-layered road network, with a provision for Metro service, could be developed on the Talegaon-Shikrapur-Shirur-Ahmednagar-Wagholi road circuit at a cost of Rs.50,000 crore. The Union government can develop the project if the state government waives GST and provides concession in royalty over use of sand and other material, Gadkari said. Gadkari also said his ministry was ready to develop the proposed ring road around the city if the state government acquires and hands over land. He further said that his ministry was working on a new expressway between Pune and Bengaluru, via Phaltan-Satara-outer Belgaum, at an estimated cost of Rs 40,000 crore. “About 70% of the work on the Delhi-Mumbai expressway is complete, but the work on three packages in Maharashtra is left,” Gadkari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/land-for-airport-expansion-to-soon-get-infra-committee-nod/articleshow/86493616.cms||---

The activists have formed a group called ‘Taljai Bachav Abhiyan’ and have planned a signature campaign on Sunday to raise environmental concerns. The project’s announcement had led to a controversy two years ago but now, the issue resurfaced after the detailed project report was submitted to the standing committee for approval. The members of the group held a meeting on Thursday to plan the future course of action. “We do not support this project as it will cause environmental hazards. Soil erosion will occur and ground water recharge issue is evident,” said Ketaki Kulkarni, an environmentalist. The project will hamper the natural habitat and ecology, she said. “The project will cause infrastructure issues. There will be traffic jams as the area is already congested,” said Amit Sathe, a resident of the area.

The victim, Gururah Gopalrao Kulkarni was found dead in the morning on Friday after he was reportedly hit in the night on Thursday by his neighbour Pavan Jahagirdar. Members of Kulkarni’s family said that Jahagirdar was often in the habit of hurling stones at the former’s dog when it barked. The dog’s behaviour often brought members of the two neighbours’ families into conflict. A few days ago, Kulkarni had lodged a complaint accusing Jahagirdar of breaking his brother’s leg in a fight. A member of Kulkarni’s family alleged that Pavan had not been arrested and was absconding. On Thursday night, Jahagirdar, along with a few of his friends arrived at Kulkarni’s house, and hurled a huge stone aimed at the latter’s head and fled the scene. Members of Kulkarni’s family are understandably upset with the cops for their failure to arrest Jahagirdar despite a complaint being lodged against him. Meanwhile, Kalaburagi rural police have registered a fresh case and have spread their net to apprehend Jahagirdar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/neighbour-dies-after-man-hurls-stone-at-his-head/articleshow/86490765.cms||---
---||Vadodara||‘Rape accused CA, friend may have fled India’||VADODARA: In what could be a setback for the investigations into rape of a law student, either both or one of the accused is suspected to have fled the country. Crime branch sleuths began searching for accused Ashok Jain, a well-known chartered accountant and Raju Bhatt, trustee of Pavagadh temple on Thursday night. “We have received information that Bhatt has already fled the country and Jain has probably left too. We are verifying the information from the concerned authorities. The five-day delay in tracking down the accused helped them escape,” said a crime branch official. The detection of crime branch (DCB) has formed a four-men team to track Jain and Bhatt. Initial investigations by the crime branch revealed that the 24-year-old girl was first raped by Jain. He then allegedly sent Bhatt to her and asked her to ‘co-operate’. “Matters worsened when Jain asked the girl to have physical relations with one more person. When she objected, the accused assaulted her,” crime branch sources said. The girl, who studies law in a private university, has accused Jain of first molesting her by spiking her drink at a guest house. She said that Jain also came to her flat and raped her later. Bhatt has also been accused of raping the girl and threatening her with dire consequences. “It was Jain who sent the girl’s private photos to her friend Alpesh Vadhwani alias Alpu Sindhi who is a notorious criminal. From that, it seems that Jain had installed spy cameras in the girl’s room,” crime branch officials said. Jain has also written a letter to the state DGP and home minister claiming his innocence. He has said in the letter that he is being framed by the girl’s Alpu Sindhi who is a historysheeter.

The Pune division forest officials, who have sounded a caution against venturing into the dam waters, have said the hatchling only indicated the presence of at least two crocodiles, a male and a female, in the dam waters. Rear admiral Sanjay Vatsayan, the NDA’s deputy commandant, said, “Our personnel regularly patrol the lake to keep a watch for the crocodile(s). Adequate armed sentries are at the site to tackle any eventuality.” “We are in contact with the forest officials and are getting updates about the animal regularly. The last sighting was reported in 2016,” an NDA officer said. Range forest officer Pradip Sankpal, said the village-level local response teams had been actively visiting the dam site to locate the nesting of the animal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/naval-training-with-safety-measures-amid-croc-threat/articleshow/86493609.cms||Sandip Dighe

Protests were held in Nalgonda town, Narketpally, Ramagiri, Chunduru and other towns. They said since police have gathered enough evidence, it should be put before the court in a scientific manner to ensure that the accused get capital punishment. Several representations have been made to DIG and SP of Nalgonda district AV Ranganth by groups of people. “Bring the culprits to the village and leave them to us and we will give them the punishment they deserve if police cannot,” a villager said, demanding the accused be eliminated in an encounter. “They will have to be hanged,” a woman said. Nalgonda DSP Venkateshwar Reddy said the accused were drunk when they committed the heinous crime. Telangana State Women’s Commission chairperson Sunitha Laxma Reddy, who visited the house of the woman, assured her family that she will pursue with the government for quick justice. The 54-year-old woman was on her way to a kirana store when she was dragged into a house and raped by the two accused. When she resisted, the assailants banged her head on the floor and to the wall, resulting in her instantaneous death. After cleaning the house, the duo placed the body outside and informed her family members that they found her lying unconsciously.

---||Surat||Surat: IPS officer Kartik Jivani grabs 8th rank in UPSC||SURAT: Already an IPS officer of Gujarat cadre, Kartik Jivani (26), a mechanical engineer has made his Diamond City proud by securing the eighth position in Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exam, results of which were announced on Friday. In his third attempt to crack the exams, Jivani made a record of sorts by securing the highest rank from Gujarat in the history of the civil service exams in the state. Jivani had cleared UPSC exam twice in the past and was selected for IPS in his first attempt. In 2018, Jivani secured the 94th rank and was selected for IPS. Nurturing IAS dreams, he, however, appeared in the exam again in 2019 and got 84th rank in the results announced in August 2020. Jivani drew inspiration from the epidemic that Surat battled in 1994 — the plague. As a young boy, he grew up reading about the untiring work of S R Rao, an IAS and former city municipal commissioner, who restructured the city after the plague and wanted to become an IAS officer like him. Rao garnered nationwide recognition for his efforts as he brought the city on top of cleanest cities in the country after the plague. “Kartik is currently under training for IPS at Hyderabad and he appeared in the exam during 15 days’ special leave. He wanted to become an IAS officer and hence, he appeared again and secured the highest rank ever by any candidate from Gujarat,” said Dr Nagjibhai, a pathologist and father of Jivani. Jivani spent 10 hours daily for his preparation and studied mostly during night hours. Hailing originally from Gariyadhar village in Bhavnagar district, the Jivanis settled down in the city for many years now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/ips-officer-kartik-jivani-grabs-8th-rank-in-upsc/articleshow/86491586.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Rajkot||Millers want govt to raise import duty on edible oil||RAJKOT: With ample rains raising the prospect of the market being flooded with oilseeds like groundnut and cotton, the oil millers of Gujarat want the government to increase import duty on edible oils and impose restrictions on the import of refined palmolein oil. Oil millers fear that continued import of edible oil will adversely impact the domestic trade. The Gujarat State Edible Oils and Oil Seeds Association (GSEOOSA) on Friday addressed a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi raising their concerns. With the prices of the edible oils hitting the roof, the central government had reduced import duties on the import of palm, soya and sunflower oil twice in 2021. The move was taken so as to bring the edible oil prices under control. The recent duty cut was announced this month. In June the government also removed the restriction on the import of refined palm oil till December 31. India imports edible oil to meet 60% of its requirement. The palmolein oil is widely used for cooking purposes in restaurants and manufacturing of ‘namkeen’. The availability of imported edible oil at low prices puts pressure on domestic manufacturers. On the other hand, if the price difference between imported oil and domestic groundnut and cotton oil is not much then many bulk consumers, like restaurant owners, prefer the former category. In its letter to the PM, the GSEOOSA requested to raise the import duty. “We very well understand that these are political decisions (to reduce import duty) and were unwillingly taken by the government. But now, when a huge crop of oilseeds is about to hit the market, it is necessary to raise the duty on imported edible oils,” the letter states. “The unrestricted import of refined palm oil is also harming the business of domestic refineries that used to import crude palm. The rain in September has changed the crop picture and we are expecting a good crop of groundnut and cotton,” said Samir Shah, president of GSEOOSA, said. The oil millers are also expecting that the market price of groundnut will remain low against the minimum support price. The government will procure around 33% of the crop but the rest will come into the market directly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/millers-want-govt-to-raise-import-duty-on-edible-oil/articleshow/86491783.cms||---

The Swargate-Katraj underground extension was recently approved with revised funding by Pune Municipal Corporation, while the Pimpri-Nigdi proposal is with the Union government for final approval. Both routes — with three stations each — will cover 9km and are considered natural extensions of the two corridors coming up. The Pimpri-Swargate route already has a depot at College of Agriculture in Shivajinagar, which officials said will handle the maintenance and repairs of the rakes. Officials said the construction of the extensions would be easier as their alignment was in line with the existing alignment of the Metro corridors. “The Metro’s last station at Swargate is underground. The proposed Swargate-Katraj route is also underground. So, the construction of a tunnel to Katraj will be easy. Similarly, Pimpri is the last station on the elevated route and the extension proposed till Nigdi is elevated. This will save cost and time,” an official said. Sources in PMC and MahaMetro said that it was necessary to begin work on both the routes at the earliest to avoid cost escalation. Metro work is already underway on two corridors in the city. The existing machinery and setup can be utilized for the construction of both the extensions, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-separate-depots-rolling-stock-for-proposed-extensions-mahametro/articleshow/86493647.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Dehradun||DA of govt employees raised by 11 per cent; Cabinet ends ranker exams for constables||Dehradun: The state cabinet on Friday okayed a hike in the dearness allowance (DA) of government employees by 11%. Earlier, the DA was 17%, which now has been increased to 28% (with effect from July 2021). This will cost the state government Rs 150 crore monthly and around Rs 1,800 crore annually. Around 3 lakh employees and pensioners will benefit from the move. Government spokesperson and the agriculture minister said the cabinet also ended the ranker exam for constables. Earlier, constables used to be promoted through ranker exam, direct recruitment or departmental promotion. “Now, the cabinet has decided to end the ranker examination and opt for direct recruitment and departmental promotion. Many a time, a constable, even after serving for years, retired as a constable only. The decision will give them the chance to get promoted during their service period,” he added. In accordance to the guidelines of Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS), the cabinet decided to divide district-wise medical units into five categories of Type A primary health center, Type B primary health center, community medical center, sub-district medical center and district medical center. Keeping in mind the ongoing developments and future possibilities, the cabinet approved the municipal corporation status for Srinagar, municipal council statuses for Lohaghat and Nagla; and nagar panchayat status for Tapovan. Further, the cabinet decided to ease norms for setting up of petrol pumps, given the tough geographical locations of the Himalayan state. It brought down VAT on aviation turbine fuel from 20% to 2%. Providing relaxation in the procurement manual for works at Kedarnath and Badrinath, the cabinet has confirmed that works up to Rs 75 lakh can be carried out through single bid. Rules for one-time settlement of stone crushers and illegal mineral deposits will be amended. Also, there will guidelines with regards to penalties imposed on stone crushers, plant owners, screening plant owners and illegal miners. The matter will have to be disposed of in two months and after the rules are framed, it will be effective for two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/da-of-govt-employees-raised-by-11-per-cent-cabinet-ends-ranker-exams-for-constables/articleshow/86491796.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Fare hike okayed for Mumbai-Pune and airport prepaid cabs||MUMBAI: The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Transport Authority (MMRTA) has approved hikes in prepaid taxi fares for domestic and international airports in Mumbai and for AC/non-AC cabs plying daily from Mumbai to Pune. The revised AC taxi fare from Mumbai to Pune is Rs 525 per seat, a Rs 100-hike over the existing cost. And the non-AC taxi fare has been increased to Rs 450 per passenger from Rs 350. The hike will be implemented from this weekend. Nearly 400 licensed taxis operate daily on the Mumbai-Pune route. Officials said that at the T2 international airport, the minimum revised fare for prepaid kaali-peeli taxis is Rs 127 for 6km and at the domestic airport, Rs 85 for 4km. Beyond the minimum distance, the fare will increase every two kilometres at both terminals. Welcoming the hike, taxi union leader A L Quadros said: “I have written to transpo-rt authorities to coordinate with airport officials and im-plement the revised fares at the earliest from next week.” At the international airport, the fare for a 10-km trip will be Rs 211 (25% incentive to the driver) and for a 20-km ride, it will be Rs 406 (20% incentive to the driver). The incentive for drivers reduces as the distance increases; it is in the range of 10-25%. The overall passenger fare is also telescopic, which is in compliance with the B C Khatua panel recommendations for fare hikes. The panel had also suggested that kaali-peeli taxis be allowed to offer AC rides to passengers for extra fare. The MMRTA has ap-proved a 10% hike in fare for kaali-peelis offering AC service although this will be entirely the passengers’ choice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fare-hike-okayed-for-mumbai-pune-and-airport-prepaid-cabs/articleshow/86497556.cms||Somit Sen
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man found with fake notes gets six years in jail||MUMBAI: A special court on Thursday convicted and sentenced a now 27-year-old man to six years and one month of imprisonment, the period of detention he served as undertrial, in a fake currency case where he was found in possession of 160 fake notes of Rs 1,000 in 2015. The court, however, acquitted the accused, Rafiqul Shaikh, of the charge of committing a terrorist act by damaging the monetary stability of India by way of possessing high-quality counterfeit Indian currency under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. “But the entire prosecution evidence on record does not specifically prove the fact that the act of possessing counterfeit currency notes committed by the accused was a Terrorist Act for damaging the monetary stability of India. Unless such evidence is given by the prosecution, the charge relating to ‘Terrorist Act’ as per that definition could not be proved,” the court said. The court instead found him guilty under sections of the Indian Penal Code. The court refuted the defence argument that the accused did not know the currency was counterfeit. “The evidence here has established that the appearance of suspected currency notes here is such that even an unknowledgeable person could have easily realized that notes were of sub-standard quality... The accused cannot raise doubt to the case of prosecution that the accused here had no knowledge of his possession (sic) over counterfeit currency notes,” the court said. It was submitted by the prosecution that Vakola police station received a tip-off from an informer that a person would arrive at a spot at Kalina for trafficking counterfeit notes. Therefore, the police team went to the spot at 4 pm on August 24, 2015. Two police teams were formed at the spot by including the informer in one of the teams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-found-with-fake-notes-gets-six-years-in-jail/articleshow/86496055.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Delhi||7th Survey Starts, Expected To Show Sero-Prevalence Of 80%||New Delhi: The seventh serological survey kicked off in Delhi on Friday and will see around 28,000 blood samples being collected in the next fortnight to seek the prevalence of antibodies against Covid-19 in the population. The last serological survey in Delhi, carried out in April this year, had to be cut short as the national capital started witnessing an exponential growth in Covid-19 cases during the second wave. Although less than half of the planned 28,000 blood samples could be collected, the results showed a sero-prevalence of around 56%, which was close to the 56.1% samples found with antibodies among people screened during the fifth survey in January, 2021. The district authorities have constituted around 15 teams of sample collectors, in proportion with the size of the district’s population. According to sources, the survey will be completed by October 5 and Delhi government has also roped in three NGOs to help with the survey. All the samples will be tested at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences to ensure that there are no variations in the results. For the first time, a section of the samples collected from those who have been vaccinated will also be tested to see if they have developed antibodies. The teams will ensure that at least 100 samples collected from each of the 272 municipal wards in the city and also that all age groups are proportionately represented, apart from people from all socio-economic strata of the city. The teams will collect 20% of samples from people who are aged 50 years or above, 55% samples from those in the age bracket of 18 to 49 years and 25% samples from those aged below 18 years. As the devastating second wave of Covid-19 cases swept through the national capital in the months of April and May, officials believe that a large number of Delhi’s population are likely to have antibodies, apart from the fact that a large section of the adult population has been vaccinated. Officials expect the latest survey to reflect a sero-prevalence of up to 80% or more. The survey has started at a time when nearly 1.7 crore vaccine doses against Covid-19 have been administered in Delhi. Currently, 77.7% of all Delhiites who are eligible for vaccination have received at least one dose of vaccine and every third adult Delhiite is fully vaccinated. As part of the seventh serological survey, the district teams will also seek information on vaccination and infection from people whose samples would be collected. The first sero survey conducted by the Delhi government between June-end and first week of July last year in association with National Centre for Disease Control had revealed the presence of Covid-19 antibodies in around 24% of the total 21,387 samples collected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/7th-survey-starts-expected-to-show-sero-prevalence-of-80/articleshow/86493718.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||Special auto service at Pune railway station||PUNE: A special autorickshaw service, boasting of security and safety, besides ensuring that drivers travel only by the meter, was launched at the Pune railway station on Friday. The first day saw 125 passengers availing of the service. However, many autorickshaw drivers operating outside the station continued to demand astronomical fares and refused to ply by the metre. “This is a soft launch, and we will check all aspects of how the system is working. The service can become a major success provided help comes from all quarters. There are no additional charges and a commuter needs to pay by the metre.  Additionally, passengers can feel safe as all the details of drivers are in noted down by officials,” an official of City Glide, the company running the service in coordination with the Pune traffic police, told TOI. Another official said that stress was on ensuring safety of passengers. “Once a passenger approaches us, we feed the name, contact details and destination into the system. The autorickshaw driver, who will ferry the passenger, is asked to produce his driving licence, Aadhaar card and contact number. We keep the photocopies of these documents along with the registration number of vehicles. A passenger receives a text message with the name of the driver, his mobile number and the destination. The fare has to be paid to the driver at the end of the trip,” the official said. A pre-paid service, on similar lines, was started at the station in 2019, but had to be stopped due to the outbreak of Covid-19 last year. Following the gang rape of a minor, in which many autorickshaw drivers were involved, the city police decided to resume a similar service again for safety purpose. Police sources said that the drive against autorickshaw drivers was set to become stricter. “Refusal to ply by the metre is an offence. The idea is to bring all drivers plying from the station under the pre-paid service so that the illegal ones are automatically identified,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/special-auto-service-at-pune-railway-station/articleshow/86493672.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Chorus to start classes from Std I to bridge learning loss||Pune: Activists, experts and teachers said schools from all areas must reopen from Std I onwards if the state hopes to compensate for the immense learning loss in students in the primary classes. The last month’s report by the State Council of Education Research and Training shows that of the total 46,365 schools with Std VIII to XII catering to over 1.03 crore students, 17,701 schools started physically and over 15.12 lakh students started attending them. This means, 38.18% of the schools were already functioning in rural areas which were attended by 14.67% of the total students. ZP teacher Vinodkumar Bhong said the government must not differentiate between urban and rural areas and allow reopening of physical schools from Std I onwards as primary students across the state were suffering. Nitin Khandale, another ZP teacher, compared the trend with last year when the schools were reopened in a phase-wise manner starting from higher classes, but by the time the lower primary class reopening was on the anvil, the second wave of Covid-19 cancelled the plans. Vasant Kalpande, former director of education, said a decision must be taken immediately to start Std I to IV too. “The students of these classes are most in need of physical schools. Moreover, the risk of Covid-19 is very low in children in this age group. Primary schools, middle schools and high schools were given the same priority when reopening physical schools in the US, Canada and European countries. We do not need to imitate them. But we must also put into practice the good things they have done,” he said. Bhau Gawande, a retired joint director of education, said the state government’s decision shows a lack of perception of the need on the ground. “Covid cases are almost nil in rural areas. The lower primary class students have not even seen the school since last year and their numbers are also very less. Online education is a farce in this age group. It was crucial to take a decision on reopening the schools for these children. Health experts have also said that younger children are at lesser risk of contracting the Covid-19 virus. It seems like the government does not realise that there is a world beyond cities,” he added. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who was in Pune on Friday said speeding up of vaccination for teachers and non-teaching staff will be a priority considering the opening of schools and colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/chorus-to-start-classes-from-std-i-to-bridge-learning-loss/articleshow/86493688.cms||Ardhra Nair

The convict has been identified as Sachin Shinde (24), a resident of Shinde village in Nashik Road. A release from the prosecution cell of the city crime branch said that the case was registered in June 2017. The convict had been harassing the minor girl from October 2016 till the date of registering the complaint in June 2017 near a primary school and wedding hall at Nashik Road. Shinde would follow the girl until her school. On June 3, 2017, he stopped her at a wedding hall and told her that he loved her. He further told her that he wanted to marry her and threatened that he would kidnap her if she rejected his proposal. Subsequently, based on the complaint of the girl, Shinde was booked under Section 354 A and D (sexual harassment and stalking) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The case was investigated by sub-inspector A S Handore, who collected strong evidences against the accused during the course of the investigation and named him in the chargesheet in the district and sessions court. The hearing of the case took place in the court of additional joint district judge and additional sessions judge (POCSO Court) DD Deshmukh. The additional sessions judge, after checking the statements of the complainant, witnesses, panch and circumstantial evidence submitted by the investigating office, held Shinde guilty of the offence and convicted him. Shinde was sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment and slapped with a fine of Rs 2,000. On not paying the fine, he would have to spend an additional month in simple imprisonment. The additional public prosecutor in the case was Deepshikha Bhide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/man-gets-3-yrs-jail-for-sexually-harassing-girl/articleshow/86462259.cms||---

The message said only Rs 500 notes with the green strip near the governor’s signature were real. However, when examined by the panel of experts with the ‘Times Verified’ initiative of The Times of India, the claims in the message were found to be fake. In fact, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has clarified that the message was completely fake and baseless. According to the details with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), both the types of Rs 500 banknotes are valid, irrespective of the location of the green strip. It was also found that the message had first appeared in 2017, a year after the new series of Rs 500 currency notes were released. The message has reappeared at a time when counterfeit bills of Rs500 are gaining traction. The RBI’s annual report for 2020-21 stated that there was a 31.3% increase in counterfeits of the new Rs 500 notes, compared to the previous year. There was a decline in counterfeit notes of other denominations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/viral-message-on-rs-500-note-security-thread-debunked/articleshow/86493721.cms||---

The 40-year-old accused woman, Queency Chilutya Sakeli, has been booked under the NDPS Act and remanded to custody. Sakeli travelled from Zambia via Addis Ababa to Mumbai was arrested after a search of her baggage resulted in recovery of 3.6kg of heroin concealed in pouches. Sakeli is the fifth woman to be arrested by the AIU in the past one week with contraband. The contraband was to be delivered to her contact in Delhi. Officials suspect that the heroin smuggled in these cases is meant for European countries using India as a transit route . They suspect that after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, the smugglers are looking for other routes. The contraband would have been shipped by India concealed in containers declared to be carrying genuine goods. On Wednesday, the AIU had arrested Annie Kuchete and her accomplice Vaidya May, holding a passport of the Republic of Malawi ,who arrived from Doha with 5kg of heroin worth Rs 25 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-heroin-worth-rs-18-crore-seized-at-mum-airport/articleshow/86493730.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Business||Sensex at sixty||MUMBAI: In November 2017, Ridham Desai, one of the top equity strategists at global financial major Morgan Stanley, told a business channel that he expected the sensex to touch the 100,000-point mark in 4-5 years. This was at a time when the index was hovering around the 33,500-level and almost every fund manager worth his roar was finding it difficult to make money on Dalal Street. Desai had said the Indian market was on the cusp of a big rally as the drivers for the same were in place. Market players then were a divided lot on Desai’s comments. For most it was either an audacity of crystal gazing or temerity of stupidity. For a small lot, it was an expression of hope. But none could stick their neck out and support such a bullish call. Since memes were not in vogue then, Desai was spared from being trolled for his predictions. Almost four years to the date since Desai made that prediction, as the sensex scaled the 60k mark in early trades on Friday, investors on Dalal Street now believe that the 1-lakh mark is within their reach. They also believe India’s market capitalisation could soon go above the $5-trillion mark, from about $3.6 trillion now, and front-run the GDP to hit that magic figure. They see a smooth glide path for the Indian market as several tailwinds are visible. According to A Balasubramanian, MD & CEO, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, continuing flow of funds, sectoral rotation in the market and the gradual opening up of the domestic economy as we enter the festive season are helping keep the market’s momentum steady. The top fund manager, who manages about Rs 1.2 lakh crore in equity schemes, also feels that when interest rates go up, at least during the initial period, it’s a sign of return of growth in the economy. Of late there have been concerns among analysts and investors that when the US central bank starts raising interest rate from its current near-zero level, stock prices could correct. On Friday, the sensex opened above the 60k mark at 60,159 points, up over 200 points from its previous close, scaled a life-high mark at 60,333 and closed at 60,048—a gain of 163 points. Driven by a statement from the chief of US central bank that indicated that easy money from the world’s largest economy would continue at least till mid-2023, investors globally pushed stock prices up. As a result, in two sessions, the sensex gained nearly 1,100 points. On the NSE, the Nifty gained 30 points to inch closer to the 18k mark as it closed at 17,853 points. The rally in the last few months has been aided by a steady, though at times slow, rollout of Covid vaccines around the world. It’s also been helped by some shift of funds from China to India by global fund managers after the government in the world’s second largest economy cracked down on several large companies as it aimed towards more equitable distribution of wealth. In the last one year, most Indian companies have also been trying to reduce their debt, which has also helped the rally in the domestic market, dealers and analysts said. The strong market rally in 2021 has also made investors richer by Rs 75 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 263 lakh crore. So far this year, the index has rallied from a sub-50k level to its current peak mostly on the back of strong buying in the top software majors (TCS and Infosys), the Bajaj and HDFC twins, Reliance Industries and Bharti Airtel. Lately, after being rangebound for most of these months around the Rs 210 level, ITC too has rallied strongly, leading to another meme fest about this Kolkata-based cigarettes-to-FMCG major. On the sectoral front, stocks of metals and basic materials companies raced ahead of most other sectors. As the pandemic forced users of these ingredients to realise their excessive dependence on China and look for an additional source of procurement, companies from these sectors saw their fortunes turn, analysts said. Foreign and domestic funds have also poured money into the stock market in 2021. While FPIs have net infused nearly Rs 65,000 crore, mutual funds have net bought stocks worth Rs 18,249 crore, official data showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-at-sixty/articleshow/86498340.cms||Partha Sinha

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Monsoon retreat may skip normal date of October 5||PUNE: The monsoon is unlikely to begin withdrawing from North Maharashtra from the normal date of October 5, the latest extended range forecast from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) indicated. As per IMD’s criteria, three conditions complete the withdrawal of the monsoon. These are cessation of rainfall activity over an area for five continuous days, establishment of an anticyclone in the lower troposphere, and considerable reduction in moisture content over the region. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, said more rain is in store for the state even in the first week of October, and so far it seems that the monsoon’s withdrawal from parts of Maharashtra may not begin till then. Normal dates for monsoon’s retreat from Mumbai and Pune are around October 8-9, respectively. As per the latest extended range forecast models, the monsoon trough is very likely to be active and near normal, south of its position during most days of the week during September 30-October 6. Kashyapi said as per the extended range forecast, south central Madhya Maharashtra is likely to get just near normal rain during September 30-October 6 period, while the rest of the state may get above normal rains. IMD’s forecast for the next two weeks said, “A low pressure area is likely to form over central parts of the Bay of Bengal during the first half of the week from September 30 to October 6. Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall activity with isolated heavy falls are very likely over northwest and central India during most of the days of the week. Overall above normal rainfall activity is likely over the country during this period.” In view of the expected synoptic systems during the next two weeks, conditions are not likely to be favourable for the monsoon to begin withdrawing from parts of northwest India before the September 30 to October 6 period. Kashyapi said this withdrawal may begin only from the middle of September 30-October 6 period. Hence, it could naturally be delayed from Maharashtra too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/monsoon-retreat-may-skip-normal-date-of-october-5/articleshow/86493743.cms||Neha Madaan

The development comes after the "pending rehabilitation issues of the project were resolved by Tehri Hydro Development Corporation" with support from the central and state governments. Last month, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had allowed the Tehri reservoir level to be raised to 830 metres. Prior to that, authorities were not allowed to raise the Tehri reservoir to its maximum level. Thus, the reservoir level never went beyond 828m. The multi-purpose Tehri dam hydro project on Bhagirathi is being used for power generation, providing drinking and irrigation water, flood moderation, fishing, and tourism, among others for the past 15 years. The dam project can store about 2,615 million cubic meters of surplus flood water during monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-a-first-tehri-dam-achieves-its-full-potential/articleshow/86491833.cms||---

The new warehouse, which Amazon calls “fulfilment centres”, is located at Varale. A spokesperson called its investment in the state “significant”, while not disclosing the amount. In a statement, Amazon claimed that the new centres will also help MSMEs units expand their customer base. The fulfilment centres stand on top of the distribution chain in the Amazon network, with the company also operating seven sorting centres, 200 delivery service partner stations, and on-ground shops for last-mile operations. “Amazon India has created more than 1.10 lakh seasonal job opportunities across its operations network, ahead of this festive season.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur man main accused in NEET scam: CBI||NAGPUR: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has named a Nagpur man, Parimal Kotpalliwar, as the main accused in the case of proxy candidates in National Entrance cum Eligibility Test (NEET) held on September 12. Kotpalliwar, director of a career guidance centre in Nandanvan, is not new to exam rigging controversies as he had been arrested in 2015 too for his alleged involvement in the now defunct All India Pre-Medical Test (AIPMT). CBI’s FIR, registered in New Delhi soon after the exam ended, mentions that Kotpalliwar promised students admission in top government colleges by adopting “fraudulent means and unfair practices”. The premier investigating agency alleges that Kotpalliwar would take post-dated cheques (PDCs) from parents and also kept some original academic documents as a surety, till the payments were realized. The amount mentioned in the FIR is up to Rs50 lakh, though it’s not clear whether that is per candidate or the total amount for which CBI has got information. Once the PDCs were in hand, Kotpalliwar collected the user IDs and passwords of the NEET candidates, claimed CBI, adding necessary modifications were made for getting desired examination centres as planned. The scamsters also morphed photographs to facilitate use of proxy candidates for appearing in the examination, the agency alleged. e-Aadhaar of the candidates was collected to make forged ID cards, the FIR states. It further adds that Kotpalliwar also “assured candidates of providing answer keys and manipulating OMR sheets”. The FIR mentions names of five candidates who “have used the services of proxy candidates provided by Kotpalliwar”. These five candidates had been allotted exam centres in Delhi and Jharkhand. Proxy candidates for these five were arranged by Kotpalliwar through the other accused Diwakar Singh and Munna, states the FIR. Unconfirmed reports mention that proxy candidates for the above mentioned five persons did not show up on the exam day, and were marked as absent. However, this could not be ascertained independently nor through the contents of the FIR. CBI has registered a case under various sections of IPC and IT Act involving criminal conspiracy, cheating by impersonation, cheating, forgery of valuable security, forgery for the purpose of cheating, using forged document as genuine, tampering with computer source documents, identity theft and cheating by impersonation by using computer resources. Kotpalliwar’s brush with the law involving rigging of medical exam is not new. On June 10, 2015, TOI had reported Kotpalliwar’s arrest by Rohtak police in Haryana after his name surfaced in the AIPMT cheating case wherein hi-tech gadgets were used, followed by another report on August 1. Kotpalliwar is said to be close relative of a former MLA from Nagpur district, with some other extended family members being active in politics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-man-main-accused-in-neet-scam-cbi/articleshow/86493786.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The dead guard was identified as Shivkumar Rai (56), a resident of Pandaul in Madhubani district. He died on way to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). The daylight robbery has left the police red-faced. Madhubani SP Satya Prakash and other senior police officers rushed to the spot soon after the incident. The borders of the district were sealed and combing operations launched to arrest the criminals. The SP said at least three suspects were detained for interrogation. “Raids are on at several locations to arrest those involved in the crime. At least five criminals had committed the crime. The incident was captured in a CCTV camera,” he added. Prakash said the looted cash, brought from LIC office, was to be deposited at the Axis Bank branch. “The staff of the cash van were about to take the money to the bank branch when the criminals targeted the vehicle. They fired several rounds and fled with the cash. None of the criminals entered inside the bank branch,” the SP added. Prakash said the guard was initially rushed to Madhubani sadar hospital from where the doctors referred him to DMCH. SHO of Madhubani’s Town police station, Amit Kumar, said at least five to six rounds were fired by the criminals. “Several empty cartridges were recovered from the spot. The guard was armed, but he could not do anything. It seems the criminals were waiting for the cash van to arrive at the spot,” the SHO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs39l-looted-from-cash-van-in-madhubani-guard-shot/articleshow/86493799.cms||---

Police claimed that this was not only an “unprecedented preventive action” against chain-snatchers in the city, but also the first instance of invocation of MPDA against any such criminal in the state. Crime branch senior inspector Avinash Aghav said, “Though the 30-year-old man is from Bhusawal in Jalgaon, he has a track record of committing a series of chain-snatchings across Maharashtra and as well as in some neighbouring states.” The officer said the accused has this year alone robbeted people and snatched chains in the Osmanpura, Satara and Jawaharnagar areas of Aurangabad city, Shirpur of Dhule, Mondha area Parbhani and Bazarpeth area of Bhusawal. Commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta said the action against Jawed was the result of police taking concrete steps to keep a check on habitual offenders committing street crimes, especially robberies and chain snatchings. The accused was arrested and sent to the Aurangabad central prison at Harsul on Thursday. An officer from the crime branch said the police had earlier started tried initiating preventive actions in the forms of externing robbers and chain snatchers. “But such actions did not yield the desired results. As chain snatching and robberies by the suspects involve one or two accused at a time, their acts fail to attract sections of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, compelling us to come out with a solution to the menace,” said the officer. The officer said following the action against Jawed, police teams have started compiling data of other bike-borne chain-snatchers for imposing MPDA on them. The officer said,,”The aim is to prevent them from getting bail for a period of at least one year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-slap-mpda-on-serial-chain-snatcher/articleshow/86489549.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||Char Dham yatra sees drop in footfall; bad weather, broken tracks to blame||DEHRADUN: Bad weather and damaged tracks continued to play a spoilsport, with the first week of the Char Dham yatra witnessing only 12,271 devotees. Still, issuance of 69,619 e-passes in the first five days is being seen as a sign of hope for the government as well as locals. According to the authorities, the footfall is less than the limit put on pilgrims visiting the shrines daily. Speaking to TOI, the authorities as well as locals attributed incessant rains to the drop in footfall. On Friday, the Badrinath highway was blocked following heavy rain and landslides. When contacted, tourism minister Satpal Maharaj told TOI, “Heavy rain has caused extensive damage this year. We have identified over 5,000-km roads, which need to be repaired by October-end.” “As weathermen have predicted rain in the last week of September, I would like to request all pilgrims to make their travel plans accordingly,” the minister said, adding that the yatra would gain pace once the weather improved. The HC has allowed 800 pilgrims daily for Kedarnath, 600 for Gangotri, 400 for Yamunotri and 1,000 for Badrinath. As many as 2,800 devotees can offer prayers in the four shrine on a given day. On Friday, 385 pilgrims visted Badrinath, 549 Kedarnath, 383 Gangotri and 400 Yamunotri. Rudraprayag resident Ajay Negi said certain patches, like Tota Ghati, on the pilgrimage route, were a matter of concern. “The yatra is the main source of livelihood for many people in Garhwal. We hope the weather improves soon so that the repair work can be carried out,” Negi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/char-dham-yatra-sees-drop-in-footfall-bad-weather-broken-tracks-to-blame/articleshow/86491851.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Goa||State set to use barren land to install solar plants to create power||Panaji: The state government has decided to set up solar power plants on barren and uncultivated lands to generate solar power in Goa. The Goa Energy Development Agency (GEDA) invited expression of interest from bidders to set up a minimum 500kW and maximum 2mW capacity grid connected ground mounted solar PV power plants on barren or uncultivable lands. A plant should be within a 10km radius of the 33kV/11kV network of the electricity department (EDG) to facilitate easy supply of solar power. The state wants to set up solar power plants under Component-A of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha (PM-KUSUM). The ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE), government of India, has issued guidelines for setting up decentralised ground mounted grid connected renewable power plants under Component-A of PM-KUSUM scheme and further allocated 50mW to the GEDA under this component for pilot implementation. Individual farmers, group of farmers, cooperative societies, panchayats, farmer producer organisations (FPO), water user associations (WUA) all of whom can be collectively referred as landowners hereinafter, can collaborate with EPC contractors or system integrators or developers to set up 500kW to 2 mW capacity grid connected ground mounted solar PV power plants on barren / uncultivable lands located within 10km radius of the substations notified by the GEDA. Land owners can collaborate with empanelled EPC contractors or system integrators for setting up the grid on turnkey basis or operate and maintain the plant during the PPA tenure. The EDG will enter into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with land owners for a period of 25 years at predetermined terms and conditions. Land owners unable to arrange their own funds for setting up solar PV power plants can lease their land parcels to developers, who will in turn set up, own, operate and maintain the plant. Electricity department will sign a PPA with the developer for purchase of power at predetermined terms and conditions. The land owner will get lease rent as mutually agreed between the parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-set-to-use-barren-land-to-install-solar-plants-to-create-power/articleshow/86493800.cms||Murari Shetye

Over the past year and a half, with the pandemic, the department has hardly received any proposals. Currently, the application to hold Sunburn is still pending with the government. “Due to the pandemic situation, we are seeking permission from the government,” an official said. “Under normal circumstances, the proposals are first placed before the state-level permission committee, and its suggestions are forwarded to the government. Thereafter, a final decision on a mega-event is taken,” the tourism official said. “Only if the government grants permission will the application be placed before the state-level committee,” he added. The official said that they have not received any other proposal for holding mega-events for December. However, the department would go the same route for any new proposal received, he said. The state-level committee can give suggestions about traffic arrangements and other aspects. The organisers of Sunburn are keen to hold the event this season. They have also announced that they would sell tickets only to those who have been fully vaccinated and promised that protocols would be complied with. The government has permitted almost all tourism-related activities since last week but has not hinted yet whether or not it is in favour of having the event while tourist flow has increased. Footfalls are likely to go up on weekends and extended weekends. Recently, tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar told TOI that they were very much in favour of permitting Sunburn, but not at the cost of the safety and security of the people of Goa. The state reports around a hundred fresh infections every day. A trader in North Goa said that with permission or no permission, many would hold small or moderate gigs in November and December if the situation remains the same — that is, no alarming rise in Covid cases warranting restrictions. “Some of my friends are preparing for December as they estimate Goa will see a stupendous rise in arrivals. People want to have fun as they are bored sitting at home,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourism-dept-skips-nod-panel-goes-to-govt-for-permissions/articleshow/86493825.cms||Bindiya Chari

Neelkamal (Nymphaea nouchali) flowers can now be seen at Vasuki Tal near the Kedarnath shrine after nearly a decade while Saussurea atkinsonii — a flower belonging to the family of Brahmakamal (the state flower of Uttarakhand) — has been recorded for the first time in Kedarnath, said Kedarnath divisional forest officer Amit Kanwar said. The forest department spotted the species earlier this month and said they could be blooming since there had been no disturbance to their habitat in the recent past. “Human activity in the area has been limited over the last year and a half. No trekker or pilgrim has visited the area as a result of which we are seeing very rare flowers in the region,” the DFO said. A forest official said four types of kamal species are found in Uttarakhand. “These include Brahmakamal, Neelkamal, Fenkamal and Kasturakamal. They grow at high altitudes and are generally inaccessible.” The department is now planning to develop a small trail for tourists to see these flowers. “These flowers can be a major tourist attraction. We want nature enthusiasts to visit this place and are planning a trail here,” he said. Last year, a team of forest officials had found Brahmakamal blooming in lower elevations in Pithoragarh district. The flower, which grows at elevations between 3,500-4,800 meters, was spotted blooming even at lower altitudes of 3,000 meters. Conservationists had suggested that absence of tourist activity during lockdown helped keep pollution away which could have led the flowers to expand their territory and move lower into the hills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rare-flower-from-brahmakamal-family-blooms-for-1st-time-in-kedarnath/articleshow/86491871.cms||Prashant Jha

He belonged to Harsidhi market. Bipin is the second RTI activist after Rajendra Singh to be killed in the district during the past one year. Police sources said two criminals shot him dead when he was entering the block premises. Bipin was taken to a private nursing home at Motihari where the doctors declared him brought dead. East Champaran SP Navin Chandra Jha told this reporter that an SIT team headed by ASP Abhinav Dhiman has been formed to investigate the case. He said the family members of deceased have not filed any case in this connection so far. The police were investigating the case from all angles as he had enmity with several persons in the Harsidhi market. A murderous attack was also made on Bipin last year, but he had escaped. A mob had attacked his house and assaulted the family members there. That case is pending in a Motihari court. Bipin had revealed through RTI last year that 99 persons had encroached the government land in Harsidhi market. The local administration had swung into action against the land mafias after that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rti-activist-shot-dead-in-champaran/articleshow/86493870.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad bird’s signals crash in Afghanistan-Pakistan zone||AHMEDABAD: A crane from Ahmedabad district flew into the dangerous Af-Pak region and since April, its radio collar has stopped transmitting its location data. The crane is named ‘Vadla’, after the area in Ahmedabad district where it was tagged in March 2020. Vadla and five flamingos were fitted with radio collars by the experts of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII). The WII has now decided to tag five more common cranes in Nalsarovar, near Vadla, when the birds arrive in winter this year. A senior official of the Gujarat forest department said: “Either Vadla’s radio collar has stopped working or the bird is way out of range for its collar to send signals.” The official added: “Or it could have been poached on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.” Suresh Kumar, a senior scientist at the WII, who was a key member of the tagging project, said: “We have good data from Vadla and hence have decided to tag five more common cranes when they come to Nalsarovar.” He went on to say: “Tagging will help us understand the migratory pattern of the birds and their habitat. Tagging will be carried out once the Gujarat forest department’s permission is received.” Vadla’s flight path indicated that it travelled to Kazakhstan where it stayed till the breeding season (March to October) and returned in October to Vadla. The bird covered 4,300km in 12 days to come back to Ahmedabad district, Kumar said. If the bird is alive and comes back within signalling range, a wealth of flight data will be available for researchers studying bird behaviour. The flamingo trail Officials of the Gujarat forest department said that five flamingos were tagged along with the crane. Three of the flamingos are in Gujarat and one is in Rajasthan. The officials said that two lesser flamingos have been tracked to the Little Rann of Kutch, where they are nesting. The officials said that when signals were received from one area, staff was sent on a recce and both the birds were found nesting. The other flamingo is nesting in Mithi. The Rajasthan flamingo is near Ajmer, the officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abad-birds-signals-crash-in-af-pak-zone/articleshow/86493857.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

According to police, the accused are close affiliates of hardened criminal Shaikh Jawed alias Tipya and have been identified as Arjun Pawar-Patil, Deepak Daspute-Patil and Sheetal Chavan.The accused were produced before the court on Friday that remanded them in three-day police custody. As per complaint lodged by Satish Ubarhande, currently posted at Latur central prison, he had applied for a loan of Rs 15 lakh in the name of his wife for starting a small scale business. After the said proposal reached the final stage, the accused woman, who is currently working as a contractual staff at the financial institution, allegedly said she has spent over Rs 4 lakh for getting his file sanctioned. She then made Ubarhande transfer Rs 2 lakh to her digital wallet and was also forcing him to pay the remaining amount. On September 18, the accused called Ubarhande on pretext of some work and took him to a hotel, where the trio threatened him of dire consequences and robbed him of Rs 15,000 cash. They also made him sign a bond paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/woman-among-3-held-for-extortion-of-prison-staff/articleshow/86489583.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Police informed that Mavila Satheesan, hailing from Muyipra near Eruvassery, hacked his infant son Dhyan Dev and later attacked his wife Anju (28) before committing suicide by slitting his throat with a machete around 9am inside their house. Anju has been admitted to the intensive care unit of a private hospital in Kannur with grievous injuries. Kudiyanmala SI said that Satheesan attacked the child and mother after locking the door of the bedroom from inside. Though Satheesan’s mother was also present at the house at that time, she could not prevent the attack as the door of the room was locked. Neighbours came to know about the shocking incident on hearing the cries of Anju. They broke open the door of the house and saw the child and woman soaked in blood. The child, who had injuries on the back of his head, died at the spot while Anju – who sustained multiple injuries, was moved to a hospital in Kannur. Relatives said that Satheesan was mentally disturbed and they had scheduled an appointment for him with a psychiatrist on Friday. District police chief (Kannur rural) Navneeth Sharma said that Satheesan had sought psychiatric treatment last November and the violent episode could have been an effect due to his condition. “We have not been able to find any other issue or motive. We have registered a murder case and a case of unnatural death and all aspects will be investigated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/man-kills-self-infant-son-wife-badly-hurt/articleshow/86493920.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Choke points that slow down Mumbai||Mumbai was the second most-congested city in an urban congestion worldwide ranking by TomTom Traffic Index last year. And it appears that the city may find a repeat mention high up on the Index in 2021, with traffic on streets mounting since the easing of restrictions and carriageways whittled down by infrastructure work, repairs and potholes. When additional director general of police Sanjay Kumar recently ranted on Twitter about "four hours a day, 100 hours a month and 50 days in a year being spent just commuting for work," it echoed the daily struggle of every MumbaikarAuthorities have blamed the pandemic for slowing down infrastructure work – workers left for hometowns and supply chain of materials was disrupted. MMRDA also attributes delays to encroachments and land acquisition issues. TOI looks at problems faced at the big choke points which add 20-30 minutes on an average to the commute. In many cases, the situation can be resolved if repairs on certain bridges and flyovers are speeded up. TimesViewBig infra projects have long gestation periods and there are limits to how much government can speed up issues such as litigation and land acquisition, which slow down the pace. But when it comes to smaller works which require coordination between departments or fast-tracking tenders and ensuring rigorous time-bound supervision to achieve deadlines, the state needs to do more. The prolonged time spent in commutes has severely compromised quality of life in the city. It is time the administration redoubles its efforts to clear up the choke points.The JVLR-Eastern Express Highway (EEH) intersection at VikhroliThe speed has now dropped to less than 5 kmph, and it takes about 20 minutes to half an hour to navigate this stretch in peak hours. The reason is barricading near the intersection for the Metro 6 corridor which will eventually merge into the carshed being constructed further ahead near the highway.  "The road next to the flyover on EEH has almost narrowed down to accommodate a single vehicle or maximum two small vehicles, which leads to a backlog till JVLR," said Kushal Gokhale, a Mulund resident who commutes to SEEPZ. Traffic cops find it difficult to manage the congestion here. At times, there are fights between auto drivers and BEST bus drivers as they try to overtake each other and the arguments lead to further jams, said eye-witnesses. "Out of three lanes, two have been taken up for Metro work. If work on one of the pillars is completed by next month, one lane could be freed for traffic," said Hussain Jagtar, senior inspector, Vikhroli traffic division. Sources said the completion of pier installation and other Metro work could take anywhere between a year or two. Gokhale and Oshiwara nullah bridges and RTO junction, AndheriAfter the partial demolition of Gokhale bridge and narrowing of other East-West connectors due to Metro work and delayed repairs on small bridges and flyovers, residents in Andheri have been spending enormous amounts of time in traffic jams. Dhaval Shah of the Lokhandwala Oshiwara Citizens' Association said, "Major connectors like Gokhale bridge are only partially open, Link Road (north bound) is shut for Metro Line 2A and access to Ram Mandir flyover is shut for two months. Also, the Oshiwara nullah bridge has been only partially open for three years. BMC is showing no urgency on the Thackeray flyover extension work which has been delayed for years." Activist Karan Jotwani added that it takes more than 45 minutes in the evening to cross Gokhale bridge; a ride from Oshiwara to Marol can be a nightmare. Local resident Amrish Vora recently tweeted how his mother-in-law was at risk of losing her life due to the gridlock at the RTO junction. The site sees hour-long jams due to a pipeline project of BMC. Vora's mother-in-law had a heart valve failure and had to be rushed to Kokilaben Ambani Hospital Vora thanked the assistance by a police van which escorted them swiftly through the maze of vehicles.  BMC, in reconstructing Gokhale bridge, has claimed railways have now asked them to construct the portion which falls under the latter’s jurisdiction as well. Satish Thosar, chief engineer, bridges (BMC), said Gokhale bridge would be ready in 1.5 years if railways gives approvals quickly. BMC is raising its height and spending Rs 103 crore on it as against Rs 87 crore initially estimated by BMC "On Oshiwara nullah, we had asked BMC to construct a temporary steel bridge like they had done in Juhu near SNDT College. But this proposal is just stuck,” said BJP corporator Sandeep Patel. Dahisar check nakaSnaking queues at Dahisar check-naka prompted cabinet minister Aditya Thakeray to sit up and take notice. He tweeted that he had received complaints and had held review meetings to devise a plan. A key reason for snarls here is potholes and the absence of FASTag lanes. "Backlogs go up all the way to Mira-Bhayander at times. It's frustrating especially when one is paying toll money and is still delayed," said Aniket Verma, a regular motorist. MSRDC said its plan to roll out FASTag in all lanes is held up because of Metro work as toll gates have to be demolished. Operators currently use handheld scanners to validate FASTag. BMC officials said they are planning a bypass that will run parallel to the service road on the south-bound lane. But the stretch is stuck in litigation. “Shiv Sena controls the BMC and minister Eknath Shinde who heads MMDRA and MSDRC is from the same party. So, all these authorities must stop passing the buck. Commuters are not concerned with jurisdictional issues and which agency is responsible. They want pothole-free roads with less traffic snarls," said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. Hans Bhugra Marg-Western Express H’way (WEH) intersection, Santacruz Repairs on a bridge at Hans Bhugra Marg has led to its partial closure since December 2019: traffic from WEH can no longer move up towards Kalina University. As a result, there is congestion on the parallel Vakola Road. What makes matters worse is potholes on the WEH section. "An average of 15 minutes is needed to cross a short distance from Kalina University to WEH via Hans Bhugra Marg. There's a backlog stretching upto half a kilometre sometimes," said Charles D'sa of Voice of Kalina ALM. A traffic police official said they had asked the concerned agency to fill up potholes but work was not up to the mark and potholes re-emerged. Hans Bhugra Marg is expected to partially open in December. But another two-lane portion of the bridge will take more time to open. MMRDA has asked for acquisition of defence land which comes in the way of the alignment of this bridge. Amar Mahal flyover, Chembur towards Sion The traffic jam just after Amar Mahal flyover in Chembur is due to the Metro-4 work with barricades occupying a major portion of the road. "From Chheda Nagar, it doesn't take long to drive up to the Amar Mahal flyover but on its landing (towards Sion), one faces massive congestion especially in morning peak hours. The snarls extend up to Kurla," said a motorist. The Metro 4 is an elevated corridor from Wadala to Kasarvadavli. Its construction is divided into five packages with the first one from Wadala to Amar Mahal Junction. This causes a choke-up, delaying travel by 20-40 minutes compared to what it was some years ago. Traffic police officials said Metro work has also led to bumper-to-bumper traffic at Suman Nagar junction ahead. The Metro work construction here will take at least a year and so this problem may continue for a longer time. BKC- Kapadia Nagar junction on CST roadTraffic snarls at the BKC-Kapadia Nagar junction are a result of Santacruz-Chembur Link Road (SCLR) extension work on CST road that connects LBS road in Kurla to Kalina. "There are times when traffic snarls stretch up to 2 km. Auto mechanics on this road near Kapadia Nagar are also blocking smooth movement of traffic," said Abhay Samant, a frequent commuter. Traffic police said potholes have formed under SCLR bridge, which is adding to the snarls. "Congestion is worse on working days when office-goers are headed to BKC. We have written to the concerned agency to fill up potholes," said Milind Jadhav, senior inspector, Kurla traffic police. MMRDA had expected the work to be completed by March 2022. But now, the deadline will be pushed ahead after a girder span of an under-construction flyover — weighing over 250 metric tonne — tilted and collapsed while work was on recently. The flyover is part of the SCLR extension project. Delisle bridge, Lower ParelDelisle Road Over Bridge (ROB) at Lower Parel has been shut for almost three years because the new one is under construction. While railways are executing work above the track portion, BMC will build the approaches. The target was to open this bridge by May 2022 but it may get delayed as WR has been behind schedule in completing work above the tracks. The bridge connects Lower Parel, Worli and Prabhadevi to to Currey Road and Byculla. Due to the closure of this bridge, congestion builds up all the way to Parel, Dadar TT Bridge and Mahalaxmi railway station bridge. Office-goer Hemant Borade, who works at Lower Parel said, "I have to take a detour of 3km via Byculla to go to Currey Road which was just across Delisle bridge before it got demolished. Also, the Parel-Elphinstone ROB gets badly congested as all motorists that used to take Delisle bridge converge on this route."

---||Delhi||Delhi: Past record shows why security is big challenge at courts||NEW DELHI: With over 60 courtrooms and a footfall of over 10,000 people, the Rohini court has been Delhi criminals’ playground for years. The security apparatus at city courts has hardly been any deterrent for gangsters, with around a dozen incidents or attempts to settle rivalries taking place in the last few years across Delhi. A few years ago, Delhi Police had drafted a special security plan to secure courts, but it has evidently had little impact. The plan involved steps like equipping the naib courts and court policemen with firearms and increasing the number of security personnel. It incorporated the threat perceptions to courts, ranging from violence involving undertrials to drone attacks. The enhanced security, sources said, was mooted after multiple gunfights at court complexes. Special teams were to be divided into sections. Half of the team was to be deployed for armed response, as quick reaction team, mobile strike party and for patrolling. The other half was to be deployed for intelligence collection. A risk-assessment system was also to be set up and used for hearings involving gangsters and hardcore criminals. There had been a spurt in court-related violence between 2014 and 2017 in the city with a majority of them taking place at Rohini. In 2017, two deadline shootouts were reported. In April, a 38-year-old undertrial was shot by his rivals. The deceased was identified as Rajesh Durmut. The shooter was one Mohit from Jhajjar. Durmut was a member of the Neeraj Bawana gang and was wanted in more than 16 cases of robbery, murder and dacoity. He was arrested in December last year in a murder case in Agra, and was lodged in Jhajjar jail since then. Haryana Police was taking Durmut to the Rohini court for a hearing. As soon as he got down from the Bolero, a police vehicle, one of the two men on a motorbike opened fire at him with a country-made pistol. In November that year, another undertrial was shot by gunmen near the court canteen. Cops had said it was a case of mistaken identity. The hired shooter, Abdul, had come to the court complex to eliminate Rajesh Bawania, a rival of gangster Neeraj Bawana. Instead, they killed Vinod by mistake. Just last month, a 44-year-old man was arrested at Rohini courts for allegedly impersonating a lawyer. Other courts have similar stories. In 2019, a criminal named Prince was gunned down near the Saket court. In 2015, Delhi Police head constable Ram Kumar, who was escorting an undertrial, Chhenu Pehelwan, for a hearing in the court was killed, and three others, including Pehelwan, injured when a group of juveniles hired by their rivals opened fire. In 2018, an undertrial was injured on Tuesday when a juvenile gangster opened fire at him at north Delhi's crowded Tis Hazari court. The shooter, who was a minor, belonged to Tillu gang. He was apprehended after being chased on the road outside the court. The accused fired one shot at Dinesh Karala of Gogi gang when the latter was sitting in a Haryana Police bus near Gate Number 2 of the court. Dinesh Karala was brought by Haryana Police from Rohtak jail to be produced at the court. He was the prime accused in the murder of Haryana folk singer Harshita Dahiya, which had taken place in October 2017. The trend of rivalry being settled in court was first noticed in Mumbai when a shooter dressed as a navy officer had shot Bada Rajan at the Esplanade Courts in the 80s, an incident supposedly inspired by the Bollywood film, Andha Kanoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/past-record-shows-why-security-is-big-challenge-at-courts/articleshow/86493908.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Oil mills stop crushing for want of raw materials||AHMEDABAD: Around 80% of edible oil mills across Gujarat have temporarily stopped crushing activity for want of groundnut and cottonseed. These are mainly small- and mid-size mills and primarily engaged in producing domestic oils such as groundnut and cotton seed oil. “There are over 1,000 edible oil mills across Gujarat and 80% of them have temporarily halted crushing due to non-availability of good quality groundnut and cottonseeds,” said Sameer Shah, president, Gujarat State Edible Oils and Oil Seeds Association (GSEOOSA). “Whatever raw material currently available for crushing in the market is inferior quality, which cannot be used to produce quality edible oil,” Shah said, adding: “However, the crushing at bigger mills which process and refine imported oils such as sunflower has not been affected.” The groundnut stocks have exhausted, and new crop has not yet started arriving in the market as farmers are not harvesting fresh crop due to rain. National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) has some stock of groundnut but its price is high and oil millers cannot afford it, said industry players. Cotton season has also been delayed due to rain lashing most parts of the state in September. Moisture in cottonseed makes it unsuitable for crushing as dried seeds are used for producing cottonseed oil, said cotton traders. “Around 80-85% edible oil mills across Saurashtra have stopped crushing. While most of the old stock of groundnut has been consumed, the farmers are not harvesting the fresh crop and bringing it to local mandis due to persistent rains over the past few weeks,” said Kishor Viradiya, president, Saurashtra Oil Millers Association(SOMA). However, temporary shutdown is not unusual. Oil millers do take voluntary closures at the end of the season when availability of raw material drops. According to oil millers, groundnut used to be available till the end of the crushing season until a couple years ago. However, this year stock depleted fast and there are issues of quality as well. On the other hands, crushing at bigger mills which process and refine imported oils such as sunflower has not been affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/oil-mills-stop-crushing-for-want-of-raw-materials/articleshow/86493900.cms||Kalpesh Damor

The bus was plying passengers from Jalna to Ashti. The offence against the bus driver has been registered at Ashti police station after Partur depot chief Digambar Jadhav lodged a complaint. MSRTC authorities said soon after the accident took place, the driver stepped out of the bus and without informing the authorities or helping the passengers to evacuate from the bus, fled the scene. Ashti police said the suspected driver has been booked on the charges of rash driving on a public way, causing hurt to any person by doing any act rashly or negligently and for mischief causing damage. In addition to this, the driver has also been slapped with sections of the Indian Motor Vehicle Act. Apart from this, the MSRTC has initiated an internal inquiry into the incident. Inspector Shyamsundar Kauthale, who was among the first to reach the spot, said the state transport bus while passing a low lying overflowing bridge, which does not have any safety grills on either side, fell in the river. “The water was about four feet deep due to which there was no loss of life,” said Kauthale. The villagers with the help of police managed to rescue all the passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/msrtc-bus-falls-into-river-driver-booked/articleshow/86489767.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Delhi: Gang rivalry goes back a decade; shootout was waiting to happen, say investigators||NEW DELHI: Friday’s shootout at Rohini court was waiting to happen, seasoned investigators of Delhi Police said, citing the fierce rivalry the two gangs involved have been nurturing for years. “It was either Gogi or Tillu,” said a cop, who has watched the rivalry unfold between the two for over a decade. “An incident of this scale was bound to happen sooner or later.” Many cops also suspected that the bloodletting between the gangs was from over. “The Gogi gang will hit back in vengeance. Deepak Boxer, who will now be the man-in-charge, is already learnt to have vowed to seek revenge on Friday evening, as per our informers,” said a cop who did not wish to be named. The rivalry between Jitender Maan alias Gogi, who was in his late twenties, and Sunil Tajpuria alias Tillu started during elections at Shraddhanand College years ago as they supported opposing candidates. However, the rivalry turned bloody as Gogi murdered one of Tillu’s associates, Deepak, for allegedly harassing his cousin. Tillu then killed Gogi’s friend, Arun Commando, in 2015, triggering an all-out gang war. Gogi went on to kill another associate of Tillu, Ravi Bhardwaj, and singer Harshita Dahiya, who witnessed a murder in which his aide Dinesh Karala was accused. Tillu sent a juvenile shooter to kill Karala at Tis Hazari court, but he had a narrow escape. More than two dozen incidents comprising firearms have been reported in this gang war till now. Gogi fled from custody in 2016. He was caught along with his aides, Kuldeep Fajja and Rohit Moi, in April 2020 in a dramatic fashion, even as he released a video announcing his surrender before the police. Fajja was killed in an encounter by the cell after escaping following a shootout at GTB Hospital in March. With Friday’s incident, Gogi and Fajja, toppers of their class, are now dead. While Deepak Boxer has become the natural commander of the Gogi gang, Moi has become the deputy gang leader. The cops suggested keeping an eye out on Delhi jails in the coming weeks. “The gangsters have a clear division now. Kala Jathedi, Lawrence Bishnoi, etc will continue to support the Gogi gang. At the same time, Neeraj Bawana, Naveen Bali, Rahul Kala and others will occupy the other side, and Tillu will continue to seek their support for survival,” the cop said. The police officer also suggested that it was imperative that the criminals were segregated adequately and those from other states be sent out of the capital with the judiciary’s nod.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gang-rivalry-goes-back-a-decade-shootout-was-waiting-to-happen-say-investigators/articleshow/86493950.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: First year Inter exam from October 25 for promoted second year students||HYDERABAD: The first year Inter examination of 2020-21 academic year would be conducted from October 25, the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE) announced on Friday. These Inter students, who are now in the second year, were promoted last year without exams being held due to the pandemic. But back then the government had made it clear that first year examinations would be held whenever it was possible with at least 15 days’ notice. The Board said that examinations would be conducted as per the earlier announced 70% syllabus. “The education minister has now permitted the Board to hold the Intermediate public examination from October 25 for regular first-year students of the academic year 2020-21, who are now studying in the second year,” read a release. The exams would be held from 9am to 12pm and only vaccinated personnel would be preferred for conducting the examinations, the Board announced. As per the schedule released, the first year exams would be held between October 25 and November 2. The dates are applicable to vocational students as well but a separate time table would be released for them. The board said that all Covid-19 protocols would be followed at every centre, there would be two isolation rooms for students suffering from suspected symptoms and an ANM/staff nurse would be present throughout the exam days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/first-year-inter-exam-from-oct-25-for-promoted-2nd-yr-students/articleshow/86493930.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat to get its first woman speaker||GANDHINAGAR: Nima Acharya, the Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Bhuj in Kutch district, is set to be Gujarat’s first woman speaker. After the BJP formally nominated : Nima Acharya for the post of speaker of the legislative assembly on Friday, the Congress supported her nomination, paving the way for her being elected unopposed, when the assembly meets on September 27 for the two-day monsoon session. The post of speaker fell vacant as Rajendra Trivedi quit earlier this month and was inducted into the new council of ministers. Trivedi and BJP chief whip Pankaj Desai submitted the nominations of Acharya as speaker and Jetha Bharwad as deputy speaker. “The assembly secretary has checked and accepted the nomination papers of both Nimaben and Jetha Bharwad. Leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani also supported Nimaben’s nomination for the post,” Trivedi said on Friday. The Congress, while supporting the nomination of Nima Acharya, opposed Bharwad’s nomination as deputy speaker. “The BJP has broken the tradition of the opposition candidate being the deputy speaker,” Dhanani said, adding that the Congress will field a candidate for the post of deputy speaker. With both BJP and Congress naming candidates for the post of deputy speaker, an election seems inevitable when the house meets on September 27 for the monsoon session. The BJP enjoys a comforatble majority with 112 MLAs in the182-member house, while the Congress’ strength in the assembly is 65. Acharya began political career with Congress Nima Acharya won the Anjar assembly seat in the 2002 election on a Congress ticket, but later joined the BJP after her husband and six councillors of the Gandhidham municipality switched to the BJP from the Congress. A doctor, Acharya won the 2007 assembly election from Anjar constituency in 2007 on a BJP ticket. She has been representing the Bhuj assembly constituency as an MLA for the last two terms — 2012 and 2017 — on a BJP ticket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-to-get-its-first-woman-speaker/articleshow/86494081.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Secunderabad: Merger plan gains traction, to be back on table soon||Secunderabad: With the cry for a merger growing louder by the day, Secunderabad Cantonment MLA, G Sayanna, is planning to table the proposal under ‘short notice’ in the ongoing assembly session. Speaking to TOI, he said: “The TRS government is in favour of merging the civil areas of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). I have decided to take it up in assembly following discussions on the procedure to raise an issue under short notice.” But this is not the first time that Sayanna has decided to float this proposal. In 1998 too, the MLA — then holding the same post with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) — had made a similar move. In fact, based on his representation, the then chief minister, N Chandrababu Naidu, had even written to defence minister George Fernandes to approve the merger. “While the then principal secretary of municipal administration and urban development (MAUD), N S Hariharan had asked the special commissioner of erstwhile MCH to pass a resolution in the Cantonment board accordingly, it never happened,” Sayanna said while highlighting other problems that arise from the current arrangement. For example, the MLA said he had to wait for two months and get clearances from multiple offices to open Annapurna Canteens (they offer Rs 5 meals) in Secunderabad Cantonment to feed poor and deserted people — on the lines of those existing in GHMC. “This shows the difference between the civic body (where such permissions are given easily) and Cantonment. That’s why a merger is necessary,” he added. So far, two of the 64 Cantonments in India have merged with local civic bodies. In 2019, the Khasyol (popular as Yol) Cantonment in Himachal Pradesh was given the go-ahead from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to be abolished. Earlier, in 1986, the Ambala Cantonment (partially) merged with a civil area. Now, the Nasirabad Cantonment in Rajasthan is in the process of being de-notified as a civic body by MoD. A majority of SCB residents too want the same. “Not just high water tariff and property tax, even civic issues will get resolved on priority basis if the merger happens,” said Kamala Devi, a retired teacher living in Picket. “But it can only become a reality if the matter is taken seriously and gets support from the people, politicians and MoD. Else, it will only remain a dream,” G Prabhakar, a 75-year-old, who was born and brought up in the cantonment area, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/merger-plan-gains-traction-to-be-back-on-table-soon/articleshow/86493917.cms||Sunil Mungara

Of the 761 appointments made by the UPSC, close to 40 are from the two states. With an all India rank (AIR) of 20, P Srija emerged as the Telangana state topper followed by Rallapalli Jagat Sai (AIR 32), Aneesha Srivastava (66), Devagudi Mounica (AIR 75) and Challapalle Yashwanth Kumar Reddy (AIR 93). This year, many who cracked the examination are first-timers. “I completed my BTech in 2019 and decided to focus completely on the UPSC exams. I am happy that I cleared it in my very first attempt. My preference is the foreign services,” said Richa Kulkarni (AIR 132). For many others, success graced them after multiple attempts. “This was my third attempt at the UPSC exams. In the first attempt, I couldn’t even go up to the interview. However, in second attempt, I went till the interview but missed it by five marks. My preference is administrative or police services in that order,” said Sanjana Simha (AIR 207). According to experts, many have cleared the examination amid massive pressure due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Students who have qualified this year have prepared for the exam under a scenario of psychological and physical stress due to Covid-19. They deserve all the praise for their efforts,” said Gopala Krishna, director, Brain Tree Hyderabad, which has trained many toppers. This year, total 761 candidates have been recommended for appointments. Of them, 263 were from general category, 229 from other backward class (OBC), 86 from the economically backward section, 122 from Scheduled Caste (SC) and 61 from Scheduled Tribe (ST).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/40-from-telangana-ap-crack-civils-this-year/articleshow/86493959.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Hyderabad||He gave Hyderabad its intellectual watering hole, was mentor to many businesses||When Ehsan called on Thursday evening to deliver the devastating news, it felt like the Hyderabad that we lived and thrived in had suddenly darkened. It felt horrible that the promise of the man — I knew for the last 39 years — and who had kept discovering new things and wanted to do even greater things going forward, was not to be. Though many know of Ajay Gandhi as the man who transformed Manthan and the Hyderabad Literary Festival (HLF), fewer know that he was also a mentor to many businesses, including mine. From the first time I walked into the offices of Gandhi & Gandhi as a 16-year-old, selling PCs (Yes, I walked out with a client) to the last month when I sought his advice for my new venture, he was ready with considered, informed advice. Several chartered accountants owe their careers to him, several businesses would never have seen the light of day without his advice. From Dr Reddy’s to Lamakaan, he was the advisor we all sought. When he and Mamidipudi R Vikram started Manthan (they were co-founders) in 2005, they didn’t know what they had unleashed. Over the years, it grew in intellectual strength. It provided speakers with a chance to talk, without any constraints or fear of reprisals. This in itself was a big deal. As for the curious and inquiring people of Hyderabad – they found an intellectual watering hole. Manthan then launched the Samvad — a one-day event that drew people from across India and the world. It blew Manthan sky-high. With complete freedom, Supreme Court judges and rebel activists, writers and businessmen, athletes and scientists followed each other in quick succession to talk, educate and inform us and each other. It was the biggest day in the cultural calendar of Hyderabad. At this point Ajay (I called him Ajay bhayya in private) turned his attention to the HLF, where he brought together diverse groups, people and resources to deliver the most independent, unencumbered literary festival of India that continued to speak Truth to Power. Under his guidance, it became the most sought-after festival for writers and performers as an alternative to the more conventional and conservative festivals. What made Ajay achieve all this in his tragically cut-short life? I can only delve into my personal space and answer this – he had my back as he did everybody else’s. He made us fearless and ready to tackle the most ambitious of projects. From launching satellites to setting up businesses to organising protests: he was there, helping, building teams, resolving arguments, bringing in resources. With him gone, emptiness that resounds in our personal, cultural and social lives can easily cripple us. The conversation must continue, the microphone must be kept turned on. Our greatest tribute to him will be to nurture and build on what he has founded. We must do it not just for him but for ourselves.

Police said Pradeep Meghwal, a 4th year student studying BSc (Agriculture) and a resident of Karkedi village of Kuchaman City in Nagaur district, jumped before a speeding train near the university campus on Wednesday night. Police recovered a suicide note that said he took the extreme step after being harassed by his classmates — a girl and four boys. Ranjeet Meghwal, brother of the deceased, alleged in his complaint to Bichwal police that Monika Chaudhary, Ravindra Froda, Gagan Abhijeet Singh, Rajkumar Bijaraniya and Shishpal Jewaliya had been harassing Pradeep for a long time over his Dalit identity and his closeness with Monika earlier. “Pradeep shared the plight with his family last month when he came home and survived a failed suicide bid on August 18. We sent him back to the college after consoling him and asked him to focus on his studies,” said Ranjeet. Ranjeet told TOI over phone that a complaint of harassment was filed with the college authorities describing the chain of events and a committee was formed by the college to investigate the allegations. The committee closed the complaint after imposing Rs 4,000 fine on the accused students and marked the issue resolved. “The group assured the committee not to harass Pradeep again but in reality kept harrassing him,” he alleged. “I am a Dalit and the accused are influential persons of higher caste. I am afraid that police will not take any lawful action. The accused are still at large,” Ranjeet added. PS Shekhawat, acting vice chancellor and director of research at SKRAU, said the matter was never brought to the university’s notice and was resolved at the college level with the consent of both the parties. Several calls to Bichwal SHO Manoj Sharma and circle officer Pavan Kumar Bhadouria as well as to college dean IP Singh remained unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/harassed-by-classmates-dalit-student-kills-himself-in-bikaner/articleshow/86494044.cms||---

Earlier this week, a 16-year-old had fled from the same remand home, following which an offence was registered.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Students can return to schools from October 4||MUMBAI: The path has been cleared for reopening of all secondary and higher secondary schools in the state, with CM Uddhav Thackeray approving the restarting of physical classes from October 4. A decision on Mumbai schools that have been shut since the March 2020 lockdown will be taken by the municipal commissioner. Across districts, collectors will take a call on reopening educational institutions. A circular with standard operating procedures for schools was issued on Friday. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said rural schools, where physical classes for Stds 8 to 12 had restarted earlier, can welcome back students of Stds 5 to 7, while urban schools can hold classes for Stds 8-12. A decision on reopening residential schools has not been taken. Schools must have health clinic and keep online classes goingCM Uddhav Thackeray has given his nod to physical classrooms from October 4. The academic year 2021-22 began in online mode on June 15. A month later, 35% schools in rural areas, including those in Thane and Palghar districts, opened for classes 8-12, with around 10% students attending. In August, the state education department gave its nod to reopen classes 8-12 in urban areas and classes 5-7 in villages. Thackeray put the decision on hold after the state Covid task force expressed concerns about the third wave targeting children. An official in BMC’s education department said the file to reopen schools in the city will be put before the municipal chief on Monday. “A decision will be taken soon as schools and junior colleges have to lay down SOPs before October 4,” said the official. The BMC on Wednesday allowed non-state board schools to conduct board and practical exams from September to November. School and college principals said the short notice to reopen will make it difficult to put all SOPs in place. “All schools and colleges will be holding first semester exams next month. Most will want to have it in online mode,” said the principal of a city school. He added schools should open in after Diwali, when second-term lessons begin. Among the new SOPs is that schools will have to set up a health clinic on the premises. As in-person attendance will not be mandatory, schools will have to keep the online learning process going. Teaching and non-teaching staff will have to be vaccinated, and parents’ consent will be a necessity for sending students to schools. Gaikwad said a meeting with the task force last month and an exhaustive SOP has cleared the path for reopening schools. Masks, social distancing, three to four hours of daily school, and one student a bench as chalked out in the first SOP are among the rules that will have to be followed. There will be no recess or sporting activities initially when schools reopen. Classroom teaching will have to take a backseat for at least two weeks to allow students to get comfortable in their physical schools. “It won’t be easy to move students from online to offline. We have started having meetings on how to make children comfortable in classrooms,” said a teacher. Parents said that they will adopt a wait and watch policy before sending children to school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-schools-must-have-health-clinic-and-keep-online-classes-going/articleshow/86494121.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Kochi||Kerala high court files case on prosecutors’ incompetence||KOCHI: The high court has raised a suo motu case regarding the incompetence of prosecutors leading to acquittals, including in Pocso cases. A division bench of Justice K Vinod Chandran and Justice Ziyad Rahman, which is considering cases on offences against women and children, raised a suo motu case after noticing that prosecution is continuously failing in properly ascertaining the age of the victim, which is required under Pocso Act for conviction. The court revealed its decision to raise a suo motu case in the judgment dealing with the appeal filed by a priest accused of repeatedly raping a minor girl. On the question whether the age of the victim was proved, the prosecutor had argued that a birth certificate issued from the school is sufficient to prove the age as per Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015. The bench noted that the offence in the case was committed prior to 2015 and cited the high court’s recent decision (Rajan vs State of Kerala, 2021), in which it was held that admission register of a school cannot be a valid proof of date of birth. While deciding to raise a suo motu case, the bench said prosecutors are becoming increasingly lethargic in determining the age of the victim in most juvenile cases, which is resulting in offenders going scot-free. In the present case, prosecution did not elicit the age of the child from the father even though he was examined, the court pointed out. The accused was acquitted under Pocso Act as the age of the victim was not proved by prosecution. However, he was imposed with life imprisonment as the offence of rape was proved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/high-court-registers-suo-motu-case/articleshow/86494238.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Post-surgery recovery: Sachin Waze seeks house custody||MUMBAI: Dismissed cop Sachin Waze’s lawyer has moved a plea seeking his “house custody” for a period of three months to help him recover from a heart surgery. Waze recently underwent a cardiac surgery at Wockhardt Hospital where he is currently recuperating. The defence said that this is to enable him to recover in a safe, sterile and stress-free environment albeit in custody. Waze was arrested on March 13 in connection with the Antilia bomb scare case and the connected businessman Mansukh Hiran murder case and was lodged at Taloja jail until his surgery. The court has directed the prosecution to submit a reply. Advocate Rounak Naik in his plea said that the eight-hour bypass surgery on Waze was performed on September 13 and the sutures were expected to be removed on September 27.

---||Jaipur||HC asks Rajasthan to stop Punjab, Haryana from dumping bodies in IG canal||JAISALMER: Hearing a Public Interest Litigation seeking to stop bodies from Punjab and Haryana being dumped into Indira Gandhi canal, a division bench of Justice Sangeet Lodha and Justice Vineet Kumar Mathur has issued notice to the state government. Jaisalmer resident Baburam Chauhan filing the PIL said that unidentified bodies keep coming from Punjab and Haryana to Indira Gandhi canal. As these keep flowing in the water for a long time and distance, they get badly decomposed due to which they cannot be identified and are cremated here. This is also a violation of human rights of the unidentified bodies. According to information derived using the Right to Information Act, from 2010 to 2019, around 1,822 bodies were found in Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Ganganagar and Hanumangarh, of which only around 260 bodies could be identified, whereas 1,562 could not be identified. In the petition, it was said that there is a strong possibility that there could be missing or criminal cases registered against the 1,562 bodies in the concerned states and police could be searching for them, but as the bodies could not be identified their family members remain deprived of justice. Only 15% bodies could be identified and this shows that there are a lot of chances of improvement in the system. The petitioner has requested directions to put lattice gates in Indira Gandhi canal in Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana state borders and to form special police stations in the concerned districts. The petitioner said that the lattice gate would prevent the bodies from flowing further into the canal. After the initial hearing, the bench issued notice to the state government’s home department principal secretary, Indira Gandhi canal department principal secretary and the other concerned officers and directed them to submit a reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-asks-raj-to-stop-punjab-hry-from-dumping-bodies-in-ig-canal/articleshow/86494077.cms||---

Congress party state president Nana Patole has voiced some concern over the decision and demanded ‘two member per ward’ system. Patil said Congress ministers will hold discussions with the party members to clear the confusion. “We put our views in the cabinet. The issue was discussed for half an hour. Finally, all reached consensus to hold civic elections on three member per ward basis. Party can have its view. Party and government are separate entities,” he said. Patil added that all Congress ministers were present in the cabinet meeting and they agreed unanimously. Patil said the multi-member ward system will bring party policies to the centre. “In the long term, the multi-member ward system will be beneficial. The party policies will now be in focus instead of anyone’s clout. The candidates will have to fight election together as they will need each others votes to win,” added Patil. Patil said that in case of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation, which is ruled by Congress-NCP-Sena alliance, the number of corporators will increase from 81 to 90. He added that the exercise of ward demarcation and reservations will be carried out afresh. Civic polls are likely to take place in February next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/multi-number-ward-good-in-long-run/articleshow/86489942.cms||---
---||Delhi||Rohini Court shootout: Eyewitnesses recount how shots after shots were fired||NEW DELHI: As gunshots rang inside room number 207 of Rohini Courts Complex on Friday afternoon, a stampede-like situation was witnessed as people ran for cover. Many litigants and lawyers said they had never witnessed something of this scale, though such incidents had occurred before. Several videos of the incident shot by onlookers showing the chaos went viral on social media. “Initially, we thought crackers were being burst, but later we realised that they were gunshots,” said a lawyer. Mukesh Chandra, a lawyer who was present when the firing started, told TOI, “I had some work in room number 205 and was walking back. When I reached just ahead of room 206, I heard the gunshots. I immediately ran towards the courtroom and saw a policeman firing constantly. I then took cover behind a pillar. I heard 25-30 shots being fired in succession.” “I saw an intern standing near the gate after she escaped from the courtroom. Once the firing stopped, I entered the courtroom and saw Gogi and two others on the ground. Gogi was alive till then,” added Chandra. The lawyer further said, “Because of the pandemic, only litigants and lawyers should be present inside the courtroom. This was a major security breach. This is the third incident to take place here. It’s a relief that despite so many people being present no one was injured.” Advocate Sunil said the two accused were already present inside the courtroom. “There were three matters before Gogi’s hearing and the courtroom had around 17 people inside. The moment Gogi entered, they started firing. The judge was immediately moved to his room. There was chaos and people tried to hide. Some sat down, while others covered their heads with their hands,” he added. SN Sharma, another lawyer, claimed, “I was present in room 207. Hearings of bails were on and I was also there for my matter. The moment the hearings ended, two people dressed like lawyers started firing. Police immediately retaliated. The judge was barely a few feet away. This incident has highlighted the security lapse in the premises. Earlier, too, an undertrial was shot dead while being brought down the court stairs.” An alleged eyewitness said gangster Jitendra Gogi was shot at soon after entering the courtroom. He claimed he witnessed the incident from courtroom number 206, which was just in front of the scene of the crime, while he was appearing in one of his matters. Around 25 security personnel were accompanying Gogi during his production. “The incident took place between 12.30pm and 1pm. The judge was reading a file and the court staff were present too. As Gogi entered the courtroom, policemen accompanying him asked him to remove his white cap. As soon as he removed it and started wearing a mask, the two assailants fired at him,” the witness told TOI. The witness further claimed, “My client was sitting outside waiting for his case to be heard. He was immediately taken inside the adjoining courtroom. A woman advocate was injured in her leg. The courtroom was riddled with bullets. The security was tightened in the morning as Gogi was to be produced. But if such an incident took place despite this, then it is a huge lapse in security.” (With inputs from Usha Das)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rohini-court-shootout-eyewitnesses-recount-how-shots-after-shots-were-fired/articleshow/86494169.cms||---

The states have been given three months to submit their action taken reports. The court was hearing a petition on Wednesday regarding illegal construction in ‘gair mumkin pahar’ of Aravalis hills in three Haryana districts — Faridabad, Nuh and Gurugram— and Alwar in Rajasthan. A copy of the order was uploaded on Thursday. NGT chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel directed the Haryana and Rajasthan chief secretaries to depute competent officers to oversee compliance of the order. “The officer should be of the rank not below that of additional secretary and may monitor compliance by clearly understanding the scope of action to be taken so that this tribunal is not in the dark about the stand of the state. The nodal officers may file a compliance report after ascertaining all the facts within three months before the tribunal,” the NGT order said. The next hearing in the matter is slated for January 28, 2022. In an affidavit filed on June 22, Rajasthan had mentioned the extent of encroachments and remedial action taken. For Haryana, several departments in Gurugram, Nuh and Faridabad had similarly filed action taken reports on illegal construction in Aravalis. However, the NGT court said it expected a “consolidated reply” for the three districts “with details of further action”. On illegal encroachment and violations in Ankhir and Mewla Maharajpur villages of Faridabad and in Nuh district, the tribunal said: “We find that action taken is not adequate nor is the information furnished complete. It is not clear whether the illegal constructions have been demolished, which is an important step in addition to initiating prosecution and issuing show cause notices.” The court added that in their next affidavits, Haryana and Rajasthan can give details of proceedings pending in the Supreme Court. In a recent drone survey by the forest department, it has been estimated that there are more than 1,000 illegal structures in the Gurugram Aravalis, including farmhouses, nurseries, slums and clusters. The structures are concentrated in areas like Gwalpahari, Gairatpur Bas, Sohna, Raisina and Manesar. In the Faridabad Aravalis, illegal structures in Khori village were recently demolished during a drive by the municipal corporation. The matter in pending in the Supreme Court, with the next hearing scheduled for October 22. Meanwhile, encroachments were also razed in Nalhar, Biwan and Ferozepur-Jhirka in Nuh and the forest area has been restored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ngt-asks-raj-hry-to-act-on-aravali-encroachments/articleshow/86494147.cms||Ipsita Pati

Sharat Chandra is Sudheer Reddy’s son. KCR had earlier asked TRS working president KT Rama Rao to resolve any contentious issues among them. Malla Reddy, who represents Medchal constituency, has also differences with Sudheer Reddy, who represented the assembly seat between 2014 and 2018. The TRS leadership denied ticket to Sudheer Reddy in 2018 elections and fielded Malla Reddy. Since then, both the groups have been at loggerheads.

Rallying with the benchmark equity index, 14 Gujarat-based companies’ share prices have also risen by over 100% this calendar year. As many as seven Gujarati companies have seen their share prices rise by more than 200% from January to September. It was during this period that the sensex made its journey from 50,000 to its record closing of 60,048.47 points. The companies that have more than trebled the wealth of their investors include names such as Ganesh Housing Corporation Limited, R&B Denims, Adani Total Gas Limited (ATGL), Monarch Networth Capital Ltd, Adani Transmission Limited (ATL), PG Foils Ltd and Gujarat Fluorochemicals Ltd. Seven other companies’ share prices have risen in by between 100% and 197%. Prominent among them are Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL), Nandan Denim Limited, Deepak Nitrite Limited and Gujarat Themis Biosyn Limited. This list also includes companies that came out with initial public offers. The new entrants of 2021 such as GR Infrasprojects Limited, Ami Organics Limited and Tatva Chintan Pharma Chem Limited have yielded more than 100% returns over their issue prices. Additionally, the share prices of eight companies from the state have surged by between 50% to 99% this year. On the market rally, Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services, said, “The weak global market did not affect the upside momentum of the domestic market as it hit record highs boosted by realty and IT stocks. India is seizing a sweet spot in the global equity market with the increase in domestic investors.” According to him, realty stocks continued to outperform other sectors due to an increase in property registrations and the cut in home loan rates. “However, profit-booking was noticeable in mid and small-cap stocks, which were under pressure, and this could can continue in the short-term,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/14-gujarat-cos-share-prices-up-100-in-2021/articleshow/86494130.cms||Kalpesh Damor

---||Chandigarh||Impurities in O2 during 2nd Covid wave led to deaths: Study||Chandigarh: Since oxygen was in high demand during the second Covid surge, there were chances of impurities in oxygen during refill. Increase in demand for medical oxygen resulted in impurity and contamination, leading to deaths. This has been highlighted in a recent editorial published in ‘Environmental Science and Pollution Research’ journal by Drs Vivek Malik, Meenu Singh and Ravindra Khaiwal from the ICMR Advanced Center For Evidence-Based Child Health, department of paediatrics and department of community medicine and school for public health, PGIMER. To avoid this, ICMR and PGI doctors have recommended oxygen audit and other regulations. “Impurity sources can arise due to production and delivery systems and from environmental pollution. There may be issues in refilling cylinders which can have helium, hydrogen, acetylene, argon gases,” said Dr Vivek. During the second wave, there were allegations of deaths due to lack of medical oxygen. Oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, liquid oxygen and membrane separator oxygen enrichers have been commonly used. “In the current Covid pandemic, long-term oxygen therapy is required at both hospitals and in-home settings. The respiratory physician should supervise for optimal treatment. Unprecedented production of oxygen and refilling of cylinders can give rise to the risk of impurities, which could lead to an increase in hidden mortality,” the published article said. Box: Study recommendations Monitor gas testing facilities, laboratories and calibration facilities at the site Ensure compliance and procedures of finished gas for quality Purity and grade (ultra-pure, 99.999% minimum) should be maintained Random check of tankers and especially cylinders for chemical analysis of oxygen gases Impurity parameters certificate should be provided (i.e., carbon monoxide/carbon dioxide, moisture, arsenic, oil, halogen, oxidising substances, acidity or alkalinity, argon, hydrocarbons) Test results can be cross-checked by the local authority for any foreign materials, moisture, and contaminants Any misuse of other cylinders (i.e., helium, hydrogen, acetylene, argon) for refilling oxygen without proper cleaning and conditioning should be monitored Monitoring for sanitisation of oxygen supply (pipeline and tubes) for unwanted fungal growth Special attention should be given to test mucormycosis infection among recovered patients||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/impurities-in-o2-during-2nd-covid-wave-led-to-deaths-study/articleshow/86492032.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Leopard videos on prowl, cages set up||AHMEDABAD: Once again the buzz about the presence of a leopard and a cub created scare in Visalpur village. The village is just 3km from Sanathal where the leopard pugmarks were found on September 10. Two videos have been doing the rounds on social media since Thursday. In the videos, shot by a car driver, a leopard and a cub can be seen with vehicles parked around. The driver is chasing the cub in one of the videos. However, the state forest department officials said that the two videos are not from Visalpur. The sarpanch of Visalpur panchayat, Arvind Patel said that there is no confirmation of leopard-sighting in the area. “Two videos are viral on social media purportedly about the presence of a leopard and a cub, but so far we have not got any information about any kill by the leopard,” Patel said. “We have around 900 bighas of gauchar land which has a good population of neelgai and their calves. Even in gauchar area, there is no report of killing of any animal,” Patel added. The forest department had installed some cages in the area to trap leopards after the Sanathal incident. On Friday, additional cages were places at strategic locations after reports of leopard presence in Visalpur. “The video of the adult leopard appears to be of Banaskantha where a forest team had released a leopard that was rescued,”said R Sakkira Begum, deputy conservator of forest, Ahmedabad. “However, we are not taking any chances and have placed more cages in the area,” she said. The forest officials involved in the operation said that they have not found any pugmark in any of the fields. “We have inquired from the farmers and other persons in the area but so far no one has admitted to seeing the big cat in the vicinity. None of them admitted to hearing roars of any big cats,” said an official. “The cub in the viral video doesn’t resemble the features of a leopard cub. It’s ears are slightly bigger in size than that of the leopard cub,” the official added. In February this year, the carcass of an 8-year-old male leopard was found on a bridge near Sanathal Crossroads in Sarkhej.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/leopard-videos-on-prowl-cages-set-up/articleshow/86494166.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

While all the occupants were hurt, no one was severely injured. The driver and the co-driver had their seatbelts strapped on but cops could not specify about the three others on the back seat. All of them are under treatment. Witnesses said the New Town-bound car was moving at a very high speed and had failed to negotiate a small bend and rammed straight into the Metro pillar. Locals have told traffic cops that the car was possibly racing as immediately after the accident two other cars reached the spot and rescued the injured persons out of the car. They took them to a hospital even before traffic cops on morning duty could reach the spot. Cops said they will intensify vigil to put a curb on the practice of racing. The 10-year-old car, which was remodelled to give it a sports look, is registered in the name of a reputable real estate firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-focus-on-racing-after-car-crash/articleshow/86492041.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

What makes matters worse is that the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) has announced to hold unit test for these students from October 18 to October 27. “Many schools from Ahmedabad and Vadodara have written to the Gujarat State Board of School Textbooks about the issue and are awaiting a response from them,” said an education expert. How can the students prepare for the exams if they do not have textbooks, said a trustee of an Ahmedabad-based school. In July, about 30,000 schools in the state were forced to cancel social studies exam paper for Class 6 to Class 8 after the state education department failed to deliver them the textbooks. This time too, a similar situation is likely to arise if the government does not address the issue on time, said sources. The education department has in the past claimed that textbooks will be delivered to students at their doorsteps keeping in view the Covid-19 situation. However, it turns out that the administration is unable to deliver the books even at the school level, sources said. For the unit test to be held in October, question papers will be prepared by GSHSEB. Schools will have to conduct the examination accordingly and as per the schedule laid out by the board. The first test will have objective questions of 20 marks and descriptive questions of 80 marks in Class 9, Class 10, Class 11 and Class 12 (general stream). In the case of class 12 science, the question paper will have 50 marks of MCQ and 50 marks of descriptive questions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/students-left-in-lurch-exams-ahead-but-no-textbooks-yet/articleshow/86494196.cms||---

Over 1.8 crore doses have been administered so far this month. The improvement in supply of vaccines has also prompted a shift in the allotment strategy: districts are being asked about their requirement rather than the state allocating them based on use. For Mumbai, a demand for 3.5 lakh doses has been made, the highest since the drive started in January, said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “If the doses arrive, we will hold another special drive only for women next week. There will also be special sessions for students, international travellers and people waiting for their second shots,” he said. Mumbai has given at least one shot to 81.7 lakh people out of the estimated adult population of 92 lakh. With average daily vaccinations touching 7.6 lakh, the state hopes to breach the 2-crore milestone before the end of September. In July and August, the state had given 1.2 crore and 1.4 crore doses, respectively. Overall, the state has administered 7.7 crore doses as on Friday, immunizing 5.5 crore people with at least one dose and 2.2 crore with both shots. N Ramaswami, commissioner, National Health Mission, said at the current pace, the state can hope to give a single shot to all by the end of the year. “Unless there is hesitancy, most people who are willing should be able to get shots in the coming few months,” said Ramaswami. There are plans to increase the number of sessions to 10,000 daily from the existing average of 5,000-6,000. “We want to be able to vaccinate 15 lakh people on a regular basis,” said Ramaswami. Till now, the state has managed 15 lakh vaccinations in a single day only once. Over 10 lakh doses in a single day have been given in seven days this month. A senior state official said finally in September, vaccine supply has managed to keep pace with demand. “We are able to allow districts to tell us how much they want. All these months, we were allocating based on whatever stocks we were receiving from the Centre. There was always a huge gap between what they needed and what we could provide,” said the official. State officials said the spotlight has now been put on low-performing districts like Hingoli, Nanded, Nandurbar, where single dose coverage is hovering around 40%, compared to the state’s 60%. They are being nudged to improve coverage, particularly in the civic areas. Some districts have blamed the termination of services of nearly 16,000 contractual workers by the public health department since Covid cases have reduced for the slowdown in vaccination. The senior official said these districts have adequate manpower and the additional appointments were mainly for Covid centres that are empty now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-targets-2cr-shots-in-sept-wants-to-inoculate-15l-daily/articleshow/86494249.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Kolkata||‘Bunty-Babli’ on the run after 3 carjackings across Kolkata in 11 days||KOLKATA: A young couple — sweet-talking, suave and friendly — has been duping app-cab drivers in various ways after drugging them in and around Kolkata since September 12. Much like the Bunty-Babli pair on screen, the couple has been using innovative methods to swindle money from their victims. Police are scanning CCTV footage to identify the duo who have so far eluded them. In 11 days, the couple has duped at least three drivers across three commissionerates. The drivers have woken up at hospitals two days after being sedated, only to find their belongings gone and their cars damaged. Cops have registered three cases between September 12 and September 23. The pair has been scanning the mobile phones of the victims and calling up their relatives after drugging them. “They asked the relatives to send some cash to the accounts of the victims claiming they had met with an accident. They said they would use the ATM card of the driver and withdraw money to pay to the hospital. They did not succeed but the attempt on all three occasions were identical,” said an investigator. Cab driver Mohd Shahnawaz was contracted for six hours from Nagerbazar on September 14. He had barely reached Lake Town when he was offered a cold drink by the couple. Shahnawaz said he did not remember what happened next. He found himself at a Dum Dum hospital two days later. Over Rs 2,500 was missing from his purse. “The car was damaged and parked in a nearby area,” said an officer. The same had happened with Abhijit Ghosh who had reached Ultadanga on September 21 and informed his family that he had picked up a young couple and was heading south. His phone had been switched off since then. He was finally traced to Baghajatin hospital on Thursday. His car — damaged — was found in Behala. Ghosh told cops he was offered juice on the way. A third similar incident took place on September 12 when another app cab driver picked up the young couple from Kamalgazi.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Kasba strongman Sona Pappu in police net||KOLKATA: The detective department on Thursday arrested one of the most wanted strongmen from Kasba — Biswajit Poddar alias Sona Pappu (40) — from a gated apartment complex in Kaikhali. Pappu, who has been in news for the past two months after being spotted running around with his revolver, was allegedly involved in a bombing incident in the area and planning the audacious attack on his rival Munna Pandey outside Presidency jail with 25 of his associates. The arrest finally brought an end to the two-week-long hide-and-seek he was playing with the cops ever since his name emerged in the gang war outside the Presidency jail. The anti-rowdy squad had earlier arrested 25 of his associates but had missed him by a whisker. “We have arrested him in relation to the attack outside the jail. He has been charged with attempt to murder, rioting and Arms Act,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. The cops produced him at Bankshall court on Friday and sought his police custody.  Pappu became a name to reckon with after his involvement in a clash to control the Ballygunge rail yard in 2015. His next big move came in a murder case in 2017 in which he was named in three separate FIRs. He has 17 cases against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kasba-strongman-sona-pappu-in-police-net/articleshow/86492044.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

In his complaint, the manager, Golu Singh (41), said that on Wednesday noon, when the train departed from Thane station, he saw Bablu Raeen selling chips, biscuits and snacks to passengers. Raghvendra Singh, assistant manager of the catering contractor, confronted Raeen and an argument ensued. Raghvendra complained to the TTE who made Raeen get off the train.

Victim Hiren Kakadia’s body was fished out by the fire brigade men on Friday morning. Preliminary investigation suggested that Kakadi ended his life as he had suffered heavy business losses during Covid-induced pandemic.  His family members told the police that Kakadia ran a lathe machine unit in Rajkot city. He was under debt after facing losses in business over the last one year. On Thursday evening, he left his house without informing the family members. After some time, he called two of his friends and told them that he is under debt and that he knows what to do.  Later Kakadia, who was unmarried, called his maternal uncle and asked him to look after his family. His family tried to call him but Kakadia’s phone was switched off. On Thursday night, they approached the Bhaktinagar police station and filed a missing persons report. On Friday morning, Kakadia’s family got a call that a body had been found from Aji Dam.

---||Delhi||‘Fundamental Right Of Expeditious Trial Is To Be Tempered With Ground Realities’||New Delhi: The fundamental right of expeditious trial is to be essentially tempered with ground realities, a court has said while dismissing the bail plea of a man arrested in 2017 for allegedly being related to a module of terrorist outfit al-Qaida in India. Syed Mohd Zeeshan Ali had sought bail on the ground that a chargesheet had already been filed and the case was at the stage of recording prosecution evidence. The trial, Ali pleaded, is likely to take considerable time and, hence, no fruitful purpose will be served by keeping him behind the bars. Article 21 of the Constitution confers an inviolable fundamental right of expeditious trial to the applicant, his counsel said. Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana said there were about 651 cases pending in his court, which was specially designated for dealing with cases under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Electricity Act, Official Secrets Act, Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Sebi Act, besides the ones being probed by Special Cell of Delhi Police. The court added that there were about five cases in which directions were issued by the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court for expeditious disposal, and one had been disposed of. “Time is essentially consumed in trial of an intricate case requiring analysis of voluminous evidence... but it cannot be contended that the requisite time consumed in trial of that case is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.” The court noted that around 14 witnesses had been examined and the evidence could not be recorded due to suspended functioning of the courts because of the pandemic. It further said crucial witnesses were yet to be examined and one of them had told police that he was not aware that the accused was allegedly a terrorist. Advocate M S Khan claimed Ali had no connection with any terrorist organisation. As per police, a tip-off was received about the al-Qaida module, which was busted with the arrest of four accused, and their planning for terror activities in Delhi-NCR and other parts of India was thwarted. The cops have alleged that Ali, along with his brother Syed Mohd Arshiyan and brother-in-law Sabeel Ahmed, was declared proclaimed offenders. The prosecution said Ali, along with them and others, was allegedly providing logistics/financial aid. Sabeel was also the brother-in-law of Kafil Ahmed involved in a 2007 suicidal attack at the Glasgow airport, claimed police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fundamental-right-of-expeditious-trial-is-to-be-tempered-with-ground-realities/articleshow/86494266.cms||Usha Das

---||Mumbai||11,000 sanctioned MPSC posts in 20 departments but 4,000 requests sent||MUMBAI: A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his deputy Ajit Pawar expressed strong displeasure over the failure of several departments to submit requisition for recruitment on vacant posts to the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC), it was found that against 11,351 sanctioned posts in 20 departments, requisition for only 4,264 posts was submitted to the commission. After the weekly cabinet meeting on Wednesday, it was brought to the CM’s notice that several key posts were vacant and 20 departments did not submit the requisitions to MPSC for filling them up. Then Thackeray had asked bureaucrats to conduct a review on vacancies in all departments and send their requests to the MPSC by September 30. “Prima facie, it appears to be dereliction of duty at all levels. Why was there a need for the CM and deputy CM to intervene? It was the responsibility of the bureaucrats to take a review and submit the requisition to the MPSC; in fact, it should be routine activity...in view of the inordinate delay, the CM should fix the responsibility on erring bureaucrats and initiate stringent action against them,” a former chief secretary said. From the data compiled by the general administration and finance department, it was found that the medical education department, led by Congress leader Amit Deshmukh, has maximum number of sanctioned posts—11 of dean, 238 of professor, 555 of associate professor, 1,765 of assistant professor and 33 of administrative officers—but no requisition had been submitted to the MPSC. The situation is similar in the excise department (569 sanctioned posts), higher education department (965 sanctioned posts) and public health department (370 sanctioned posts). In the FDA department, key posts of food safety officer, technical officer and statutory officers have been lying vacant for long. In the water resources department, 1,624 posts of assistant engineer have been sanctioned, but requests for only 180 posts submitted, and in the industries department, against the 155 sanctioned posts of industries inspector and 36 of industries officer, only 103 requests were submitted. “The CM will have to fast-track the entire recruitment procedure for providing result-oriented administration,” said the former CS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-11k-sanctioned-mpsc-posts-in-20-depts-but-4000-requests-sent/articleshow/86497880.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Chandigarh||Even one false complaint is matrimonial cruelty: Punjab and Haryana HC||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that even one defamatory complaint filed by a wife in an agitated mood to falsely implicate her husband and his family amounts to cruelty and the man in the case is entitled to divorce on this ground. “Filing of the complaints for the initiation of criminal proceedings, which were found to be baseless and false, causes harassment and torture to the husband and his family. One such complaint is sufficient to constitute matrimonial cruelty,” observed a division bench comprising Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Archana Puri. They passed these orders while upholding the decision of a family court in Rohtak and dismissed the woman’s appeal against the dissolution of her marriage. “It stands established as detailed aforesaid that the appellant-wife, after leaving the matrimonial home in less than three months of the marriage, indulged in the filing of the applications/complaints against her husband and his family members, while being in an agitated mood, she had made defamatory complaints against her husband and his family members and the same were found to be false and the police did not find it fit case to be tried.  Considering the same in totality, the act and conduct of the appellantwife definitely caused mental cruelty to the husband,” the bench held. In this case, the marriage of the couple was solemnized in February 2012 in the Rohtak district of Haryana and they had a son together. According to the husband, the woman was of quarrelsome nature and her family members started interfering in their matrimonial life after their marriage. She was not happy to live in her husband’s joint family of husband in the village and started pressuring him to arrange separate accommodation in Rohtak town, far away from his parents. When he was unable to arrange separate accommodation, his wife became annoyed and started extending threats to implicate him and his family members in a false dowry case. In order to pacify the matter, the man’s parents arranged a rental accommodation in Rohtak, so that the couple may live peacefully. However, the wife’s family members started frequently visiting the house and when he objected to the same, she became more arrogant and started causing cruelty, harassment, and torture to him and his family members, on one pretext or the other. She had not given any breathing time to her husband and his family members, to try to rehabilitate her. Rather, she had filed complaints, one after the other, and the same were found to be false and baseless and the police never thought it appropriate to initiate an investigation on the basis thereof. Some complaints were also filed thereby trying to implicate menfolk of her in-laws’ family in sexual harassment cases but in the same also, her version was disbelieved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/even-one-false-complaint-is-matrimonial-cruelty-hc/articleshow/86492047.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Dehradun||Hunt for Giri’s successor uphill task as major akharas stay away||Haridwar: Finding a successor to Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) president mahant Narendra Giri will be an uphill task for the apex body with three major akharas refraining from voting in the election to the post. Until now, two representatives each from the 13 akharas participated in the selection process of the parishad president, but with the Bairagis having distanced themselves from the Akhara Parishad, uncertainty hovers over the process. The Bairagi Vaishnav Akharas — which include Nirmohi, Digambar and Nirvana Akharas — had announced their own parishad in Kumbh in Haridwar this year. The akharas were upset with Narendra Giri and had alleged that he was discriminating against them. Giri was president of ABAP when he was found hanging at Baghambari Mutt in Prayagraj (UP) on September 20. A suicide note purportedly handwritten by the mahant said that he was forced to take his own life as he was being “blackmailed” by his disciple, Anand Giri, and two others over a “morphed photo with a girl”. The note also said that Balbeer Giri should be appointed his successor as mahant of Baghambari Mutt. The post of ABAP president is an elected post. The seers had earlier told TOI that mahant Devendra Shastri of Nirmal Akhara, the vice-president of ABAP, would be the acting president until an election to the post is held. But there is no clarity on when that may be. Seers said the key role of ABAP is to look after Kumbh arrangements. Niranjani Akhara secretary Swami Ravindra Puri said there has been no consensus on elections yet but since Prayagraj Kumbh is to be held in January 2024, there was “plenty of time to hold elections”. Meanwhile, seers from the Bairagi camp, who formed the Akhil Bharatiya Vaishna Akhara Parishad earlier this year, said time would decide if they would "return" to ABAP. A seer told TOI that Ravindra Puri of Mahanirvani Akhara is likely to be in the running for the president's post. “He is a strong contender and on good terms with the Bairagis. If he becomes the president, then the general secretary's post may go to the Bairagi Akharas if they return to ABAP,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hunt-for-giris-successor-uphill-task-as-major-akharas-stay-away/articleshow/86492046.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

---||Delhi||‘Security Loopholes Need To Be Plugged To Avoid Repeat’||New Delhi: The shootout inside a courtroom at Rohini District Courts Complex has opened the floor for discussions on steps that need to be taken to ensure the safety of judges, lawyers, court staff and litigants and rectify the “serious lapses” in security arrangements within the premises. The incident has not only brought to light the lackadaisical approach of security agencies, but questions are also being raised on the “arrogance” of lawyers who allegedly do not cooperate with frisking or checking. In a meeting held by Rohini Court Bar Association (RCBA) with judicial officers and coordination committee members, it was discussed how the security model of Delhi High Court could be adopted at district courts complexes. In a statement, RCBA said it was decided that security checks would be strictly enforced at the entry and exit gates throughout the day. The members, advocates, court staff and litigants shall cooperate with the security checks by showing ID cards and also allow their vehicles to be checked thoroughly. The coordination committee of all district court bar associations issued a circular saying the working in courts would be suspended due to revision of security norms on account of Friday’s “unfortunate” incident. “All members are requested to cooperate and abstain from work on Saturday,” it added. Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa said the incident was “extremely shocking”. “The assailants were allegedly dressed like lawyers and carried guns inside the courtroom. It’s high time that the security is strengthened and everyone is frisked at the entry gates. These kinds of incidents give a bad name to the judicial system. It speaks volumes about the lackadaisical approach of security agencies towards court complexes.” Advocate Pradeep Khatri, additional secretary of RCBA, said there were many lapses in security at district courts complexes. The security model at Delhi High Court includes paramilitary forces. District courts bar associations were discussing with senior police and judicial officers whether it was feasible to engage paramilitary forces along with Delhi Police personnel at the seven trial courts. Khatri said there were about 20 metal detectors at Rohini Courts Complex, but most of them were not in a working condition. The same was the case at Saket court premises, as per advocate DS Kasana. “Being a member of the bar, the committee members and I have intimated Delhi Police about metal detectors not working. There is no proper checking of ID cards of lawyers and litigants entering the premises,” added Khatri. Kasana claimed most of the time the security personnel were not present at the gates and, instead, sat inside without carrying out proper checks of people entering the premises. Advocate Arpit Bhargava said the shootout was a “warning” that today’s gang war could become a terror attack tomorrow. He added that the high court must step in to check security. “Since lawyers take it on their ego to undergo frisking by security personnel, the best way is to adopt the Supreme Court method and entry/exit should be on the basis of a proximity card,” said Bhargava. Advocate LK Verma said, “The arrogance of a few lawyers led to lax security. All lawyers need to cooperate with the security agencies and allow them to frisk them for safety purposes.” Another advocate suggested that lawyers be given ID cards, which they should hang around their neck when they enter the court premises. Nagendra Kumar, secretary of New Delhi Bar Association, said, “The incident has raised a serious security concern for lawyers, judiciary, staff, litigants and public. Security must not be compromised and should be taken up on priority.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/security-loopholes-need-to-be-plugged-to-avoid-repeat/articleshow/86494255.cms||Usha Das

---||Ahmedabad||Fear of Sri Lankan agencies forced heroin ship to change route||AHMEDABAD: The alertness of Sri Lankan agencies following two big drug seizures in the Arabian Sea, including 600 kg of heroin seizure on September 1 and another 290 kg of heroin seizure in August, forced the drug peddlers to keep the boat with 30 kg of heroin mid-sea. The drug peddlers — two Iranians Imam Bakhsh and Khan Sahab as well as Ghulam from Pakistan — reportedly told the seven Iranian crew members not to move towards Sri Lanka as there was some problem. “A man named Ali Mohammed was supposed to take the heroin from these seven crew members at sea somewhere near Kochi. He was equipped with a boat with a Sri Lankan flag and after receiving the drugs, he was to go to Sri Lanka,” said an ATS officer. The officer said that the Sri Lankan navy would open fire if the man did not have the Sri Lankan flag. “Even after this arrangement, they had feared that Ali Mohammed’s ship would also be caught by Sri Lankan agencies as they were alert after the two big seizures,” said the officer. “The seven crew members were told to share their latitude and longitude with Ali Mohammed when they reach Kochi. After which, Ali Mohammed was supposed to reach there and receive the drugs,” he said. The ATS officer said that the seven crew members were told to stay till the further order.“They were trying to get some safe space in Maharashtra and Gujarat to land. Later, the drug was supposed to be sent to Punjab. But before that ATS came to know about the ship and the seven crew members were nabbed in a mid-sea operation along with the Indian Coast Guard,” he said. Now, the cops are probing about the whereabouts of Ali Mohammed and the three men known as Imam Bakhsh, Khan Sahab and Ghulam who sent the drugs towards Sri Lanka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fear-of-sl-agencies-forced-heroin-ship-to-change-route/articleshow/86494310.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Justice Devan Ramachandran said in a judgment, “I cannot see how the operators of autorickshaws can insist that they be allowed to unauthorizedly park in any area on the strength of their assertion that they have been doing so for the last several years.” The court was considering a petition by a shop owner in Erumeli in Kottayam alleging obstruction to ingress and egress of his customers by unauthorized parking of autorickshaws. Even though the area has not been notified or reserved as an autorickshaw stand, various autorickshaws are being parked on a constant basis, he had contended. A counsel representing some autorickshaw owners intervened and submitted that they have been parking at the spot for more than 30 years. Though the court asked under what authority they were doing so, the counsel could not give an answer. The court said if the autorickshaw owners have a case that they have been parking at the space for many years and have a right to do so, or if they need an alternate parking space, they should approach the secretary of Erumeli grama panchayat with an application, the court said. Until they get necessary permission to park their vehicles, police should ensure that no such parking is allowed in the area, the court directed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/unauthorized-parking-of-autos-cant-be-allowed/articleshow/86494303.cms||---

Shaktiman, then 13, had been allegedly beaten with a stick by Joshi and others participating in a BJP protest at the assembly in 2016. It was injured badly and one of its hindlegs had to be amputated. A month later, it died. Videos and photos of the incident had been circulated at the time. In its order now, the court said there was a lack of credible evidence because of "carelessness and unscientific" testimonials, the prosecution had “not been able to prove the accusation beyond reasonable doubt”, and acquitted Joshi and four others — Pramod Bora, Jogendra Singh Pundir, Abhishek Gond and Rahul. “The photos and videos on social media show what actually happened. We don’t understand how there was not enough evidence,” said Rubina Nitin Iyer, a member of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The case had bigger implications, activists added. “Horses like Shaktiman are still sold to tonga drivers when they are too old to serve the police … More important than pinning the blame on Ganesh Joshi or the police is to discontinue the colonial mindset of using animals for crowd control,” said Gauri Mulekhi, trustee of NGO People for Animals. “We would have been able to understand the judgment better had we been able to find Section 11 (6) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 which has been repeatedly referred to.” Public prosecutor Girish Pancholi refuted the latter line of argument, saying that “the court certainly gives judgement after a thorough analysis of corresponding laws.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/shaktiman-case-how-did-videos-photos-not-prove-attack-ask-animal-rights-activists/articleshow/86492089.cms||---

---||Delhi||Rohini court shootout: Police chief Rakesh Asthana orders review of security steps at courts||NEW DELHI: Friday’s shootout in a Rohini court has prompted the Delhi Police brass to review the security apparatus in courts afresh. Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana is learnt to have asked senior officers for reports regarding existing security steps and a fresh set of measures is likely to be released next week. In a review meeting on Friday, steps like having two-member armed teams deployed on each floor of court buildings and improving CCTV surveillance and frisking was contemplated, sources said. However, can shooting incidents in courts be prevented? Seasoned investigators said effective surveillance and use of a strong information network could indeed make it possible to avert such incidents to a large extent because of the planning involved to execute such bids. A few years ago, Special Cell had intercepted calls made and received by hitmen and averted a similar bid at Rohini Courts Complex at the last moment. Ten henchmen belonging to the Neeraj Bawana-Naveen Baali gang were arrested in that operation in 2014. The main shooter, Vikas Dabas, was disguised as a lawyer, just like Friday’s incident, and had come to kill Pradeep Bhola, a member of the rival Neetu Dabodia gang. Others were to provide cover. Special Cell sleuths spread across the court, many dressed as lawyers, nabbed them. The incident that occurred on Friday was waiting to happen. “A threat to Gogi’s life from his arch rival was imminent and the fact that Tillu would be planning a hit was also not hidden. There were only two places where the incident could have happened, in jail or in the court on the hearing date,” said an investigator. Trials of criminals like Gogi or Tillu could be conducted through videoconferencing, a retired senior cop suggested, given the fact that gangsters habitual of attacking rivals also posed a risk to lives of bystanders, lawyers or judges present in courts. According to police, the lawyer’s attire provides a convenient camouflage for miscreants. So, while cops are strict and lawyers compliant with security measures after any incident, things go back to square one after some time as policemen go easy to avoid a confrontation. “The judges and police need to work out a foolproof plan with steps like single entry and exit points to avert such incidents. A simple process like frisking can do wonders if followed religiously at all times,” a veteran investigator said on anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-chief-orders-review-of-security-steps-at-courts/articleshow/86494296.cms||Raj Shekhar

Jagga Reddy expressed his disappointment at not being informed about the cricket match between Azharuddin XI and Revanth Reddy XI held in Zaheerabad. “Is this Congress party or a private limited company,” he wondered. “It is being held in my home district of Sangareddy and I am not even informed. Is it an intentional move to inflict humiliation on me and make it clear that there is a rift between me and Revanth. Courtesy demands that minimum protocol be followed,” he said. Taking strong objection to Revanth’s ways, he said: “If a loyal Congress leader like me is being subjected to such an insult, one can imagine the fate of other seniors in the party. He said no one can stop him, if he takes a decision to join ruling TRS. However, he asserted he is a loyal Congress worker. “I have served as a three-term MLA even before Revanth became TPCC president,” he said. Jagga Reddy said he was not even given an opportunity to speak at Gajwel Dalita Girijana Dandora public meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jagga-reddy-spits-fire-at-revanth/articleshow/86494288.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Cong: Shah has failed to check crime||New Delhi: Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Anil Kumar Chaudhary on Friday said the law-and-order situation in the national capital — the seat of power in the country — was such that criminals had become emboldened to commit brazen shootouts and murders inside Rohini Courts. He said Union home minister Amit Shah had totally failed in checking crimes in Delhi, where no one seems to be safe under the “jungle raj”. He claimed that there had been a 57% rise in cases of murder and crimes against women between 2015 and 2019. Kumar said assaults and attacks on women and children had become a common occurrence, and snatching and robbery did not make news any more. The Congress member said, while crime rate was unchecked, there seemed to be more focus on prosecuting the public for violating Covid-19 guidelines.

Doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, assistants and sanitary workers at hospitals were honoured as Covid warriors. But pharmacists, one of the main pillars of the healthcare system and unsung heroes of the pandemic, still feel neglected. On the eve of World Pharmacists Day, which celebrated on September 25, TOI spoke to leaders of associations of practising pharmacists. “Pharmacists are respected in most of the countries, especially the developed ones. In India we do not enjoy the same respect. The Covid-19 pandemic brought to fore the pivotal position of pharmacists in the patient treatment system,” said Kailas Tandale, president of Maharashtra Practising Pharmacists Association (MPPA). According to him, pharmacists were rarely mentioned as Covid warriors and their efforts were neglected globally. “Yet we continued to work on the frontline every day, providing essential healthcare services throughout the pandemic,” he said. Dr Vinayak Ghayal, president of Pharma D Association of Maharashtra, said that they are still waiting for acceptance of their “just demand of getting recognized as clinical pharmacists in hospitals”. “Despite pharmacy council directing the state to appoint Pharma D degree holders on clinical pharmacists positions in government and private hospitals, Maharashtra is yet to follow the directive,” said Dr Ghayal. The issue of pharma D holders using the Dr prefix is still mired in controversy. During the second wave, pharmacists holding this degree had repeatedly requested the state to allow them provide frontline health services to deal with shortage of doctors, but to no avail. Many pharmacists who own medical stores in the city told TOI that against the general perception that they made huge money, many suffered major losses during the Covid-19 period. “It’s biggest misunderstanding that business of retail pharmacists boomed during the pandemic. In fact, we suffered major losses. FDA restrictions and controlled sale of many medicines made us professionally weak,” a retail pharmacist told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pharmacists-feel-they-are-the-most-neglected-covid-warriors/articleshow/86494299.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Nagpur||HC allows 40% discount to girl who can’t pay school fee due to pandemic||NAGPUR: Coming to the rescue of a poor girl who scored 85% in Std X, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court directed a reputed school group to immediately release her transfer certificate (TC) and original marksheet. According to the petitioner, the documents had been withheld as her father, a flautist, had failed to pay the fee due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While allowing the 15-year-old girl’s plea filed through her father Babarao Bagde, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor further asked the school at Hiwri Nagar to grant her 40% discount in fee. The bench, however, asked the girl’s father to deposit Rs11,000 as first instalment towards the fee and offered him facility to pay the remaining amount in six months from the date of judgment. “The school management will give appropriate discount to the petitioner on the outstanding amount of the fee payable by her. This discount, in our view, may not be less than 40% of the outstanding balance of fee, as a special case. Considering the facts and circumstances peculiar to this case, this concession shall not be treated as precedent for future cases,” the bench clarified. Petitioner Sharvari Bagde had knocked the HC’s doors through her counsel Gauri Venkatraman who informed that her school had refused to hand over her TC and marksheet “on the ground that she failed to pay the fee”. According to Venkatraman, the management also stopped her online classes for the same reason. The girl was forced to study on her own, as she could not afford tuition due to her family’s poor financial condition that worsened after the pandemic struck, as per the petition. The girl managed to secure an impressive 85% in Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Std X exam and secured a seat in a good junior college through the common admission process (CAP). Though she was granted provisional admission, the junior college asked her to submit TC and original marksheet immediately. Sharvari contended that her father used to play flute in marriages to earn a living but due to Covid-19 pandemic, his earnings stopped due to restrictions imposed on functions. She pointed out that though they were facing severe financial constraints, her 52-year-old father would be able to pay the balance fee if granted some time for it. Her father also offered to pay Rs11,000 as first instalment and the remaining in six months. He requested to adjust Rs18,000, taken as deposit by the school during admission of his daughter in Std I, against the outstanding fees. The school management assured the court that after receiving the first instalment, it would release the TC, but the marksheet would be issued after receiving it from the CBSE. It also agreed to provide an appropriate discount to the petitioner considering the fact that her father is a ‘flute artiste’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-allows-40-discount-to-girl-who-cant-pay-school-fee-due-to-pandemic/articleshow/86494425.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Police said that the man, Chaterpati, was paralyzed and was alone at the time when the incident took place. He lived with his wife and a son. The fire department received a call around 11am about a blaze in a house near Sethi Dharamshala. Three fire tenders were rushed to the spot. The firefighters broke the door to enter the third floor of the building and found an unconscious Chaterpati. “He was taken to a hospital and declared dead on arrival. Chaterpati’s son, Chirag, had gone to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in the morning along with his mother, Anju, and no one was present in the house.

---||India||IIT-Bombay graduate from Bihar tops civil services exam, 12 of top 25 women||NEW DELHI: The final result of Civil Services Examination (CSE) 2020 was declared on Friday with Shubham Kumar from Katihar, Bihar emerging as the topper and No 2 rank going to a woman, Jagrati Awasthi from Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. Of the 761 recommended by UPSC, which conducts the annual exam for selection to civil services including IAS and IPS, 216 or 28.3% are women. In fact, just like in 2019, 12 among the top 25 rank-holders are women. Among the successful women candidates is also Ria Dabi, sister of Tina Dabi, the topper of Civil Services Exam 2015. The percentage of women recommended for the civil services this year is better than the last three years, having risen from 24.2% in 2017, 23.9% in 2018 and 23.7% in 2019. The recommended candidates this year also include 25 persons with benchmark disability. Delhi bagged 5 places in the Top 20 and Bihar three including the Number 1 rank. Three positions in the Top 20 have gone to candidates from Kerala. Shubham Kumar, the No. 1 rank-holder, is an alumni of IIT, Powai. This was his third attempt, after having been selected to Indian Defence Accounts Service in the second attempt. Shubham told TOI that while he was expecting to figure in the merit list this year, he never imagined that he would ace the exam. Having sought Bihar cadre as his first preference, Shubham, a civil engineer, wants to work in areas like flood relief, food-processing, health and education and also improve the economic condition of the people of his state. “I give credit to my family, especially my parents, and my close friends for encouraging me. It was my dream to be a civil servant right from my childhood. But it was when I was at IIT, Powai that I had a chance to be in leadership positions. That is when I realised how making a change can give you satisfaction, and I started seriously looking at a career in the Civil Services. I started preparing for the exam in my final year and would study 7-8 hours a day, on an average,” he told TOI. Jagrati Awasthi, a B.Tech in electrical engineering from MANIT Bhopal, said it felt great to be the topper among woman and also No. 2 rank-holder. “If given equal opportunity, what is it that women cannot do? With the support of family and others, they can do wonders,” she said. Jagrati, who worked for two years in BHEL before quitting her job to prepare for civil services, said she would like to work for rural development in Madhya Pradesh, which happens to be her first choice for cadre. Jagrati said her parents delayed buying a TV for four years, as first her brother, a MBBS, was preparing for NEET, and then for her own preparation for the civil services entrance. “I thank my parents for believing in me, including even when I quit my job, and giving me a supportive environment,” she said. Incidentally, Jagrati had failed to clear the prelims exam in her first attempt, this being her second. An ecstatic Ria Dabi, who has a degree in political science from Delhi’s LSR College, cleared the civil services exam in her first attempt, much like her sister Tina Dabi who had aced the 2015 exam. She told TOI that while Tina did guide her during her preparation, she would give the credit for her success to her parents, especially her mother who had always wanted her daughters to join civil services. “I chose civil services as it gives you an opportunity to connect with the people. One gets a sense of satisfaction by working for the welfare of citizens,” Ria said adding that she wants to serve in Rajasthan like her sister. “I would like to focus on women empowerment, health and education,” she said. As many as 10,40,060 candidates applied for civil services exam 2020, of which 4,82,770 appeared. Only 10,564 qualified for appearance in the mains examination and 2053 underwent personality test based on which 761 candidates were recommended for appointment to various services. Educational qualifications of top 25 successful candidates range from graduation in engineering; humanities; commerce and medical science from country’s premier institutions such as IIT, NIT, BITS, NSUT, DTU, JIPMER, St. Xavier’s College, University of Mumbai, Delhi University etc. The top 25 had opted for subjects like anthropology, civil engineering, commerce & accountancy, economics, geography, mathematics, mechanical engineering, medical science, philosophy, physics, political science & international relations, public administration, and sociology as their optional choice in the Written (Main) Examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iit-bombay-graduate-from-bihar-tops-civil-services-exam-12-of-top-25-women/articleshow/86498379.cms||Bharti Jain

---||Delhi||CJI N V Ramana expresses serious concern over shootout in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India N V Ramana on Friday expressed serious concern over the firing incident at Rohini Court complex in Delhi in which two assailants in lawyers attire gunned down gangster Jindra Gogi, who was in judicial custody. CJI Ramana wanted to visit the scene of the incident and take stock of the security arrangements inside the court complex but was advised against visiting the crime scene. The CJI, however, conveyed his deep distress over the incident to Delhi high court Chief Justice D N Patel and asked him to take all necessary measures, in consultation with the Union government, for arranging foolproof security arrangements in all court complexes within the national capital territory. CJI told the Delhi CJ that this is not the first firing incident inside the Delhi court complexes and desired that the Delhi police and other authorities should be taking adequate measures and installing equipment at appropriate places inside the court complexes to ensure that the courts functioned without any violent incident. The CJI was told by the Delhi HC CJ D N Patel that he is in touch with the Delhi police on the incident. The Delhi police informed the Delhi HC CJ that one of the major security threat to the court complexes arises because of the apparent reluctance and refusal of lawyers to get frisked physically by the police personnel deployed at the entry points of court complexes. The CJI was informed that during the firing by assailants that killed Gogi and the retaliatory firing by the Delhi Police personnel, in which the two assailants were neutralised, a stray bullet had hit the dais of the judicial officer at the nearby courtroom but luckily without hurting anyone. The CJI said judicial officers, judges and lawyers as well as litigants must feel secure inside the court complexes to enable smooth dispensation of justice. The SC had taken suo motu cognisance of the inadequate security cover provided to the judges and court complexes after the murder of Dhanbad judge in July. It had asked the state government to give details of the security inside court complexes as well as to judges at their residences. On August 17, the SC had read the riot act to major states for disregarding deadline to file affidavits detailing security measures for judges and court complexes and imposed Rs 1 lakh cost on each. The Rohini incident will force the CJI to expedite the hearing on the issue of judges and lawyers' security. It is expected that the suo motu matter would be listed next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cji-expresses-serious-concern-over-shootout/articleshow/86494441.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Chandigarh||Crop residue management machinery available online on rent||Mohali: The department of agriculture has decided to provide crop residue management machinery online on rent to prevent incidents of stubble burning. Deputy commissioner (DC) Isha Kalia said that the department had launched the “I-Khet Punjab” app to make the machinery easily accessible to all. Farmers can register themselves as custom hiring groups or cooperative societies on the mobile app and get or offer such machinery on rent. The DC said the initiative would benefit small and marginal farmers, who would be able to hire the machinery free of cost and manage wheat cultivation by mixing stubble in the fields. Chief agriculture officer, Mohali Rajesh Kumar Raheja said 567 machines have been made available in the district, out of which 84 were owned by farmer groups, 303 by cooperative societies and 179 by individual farmers. He said details of all these machines have been uploaded on the I-Khet Punjab app. Farmers, custom hiring centers and co-operative societies will also be able to make a profit by renting out the equipment. Raheja said the district has 38 Happy Seeders, 72 Super Seeders, 102 Zero Drills, 64 Super SMS, 35 Straw Choppers, 32 Mulchers, 55 Reversible Ploughs, 30 Rotavators, 4 Balers, 4 Racks and 1 Cutter-Cum-Spreader. He said online approvals have been issued by the department to provide 176 new machines on subsidy and urged farmers to refrain from purchasing expensive machines, but get them online from farmer groups and cooperative societies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/crop-residue-management-machinery-available-online-on-rent/articleshow/86492147.cms||---
---||Meerut||Gogi shooter from Meerut campaigned for sis-in-law in UP panchayat polls||Meerut: Lined across the walls of Phaphoonda, a small village in Meerut’s Kharkhoda, are posters of “Nitin KK”, with folded hands, seeking votes for his sister-in-law in the panchayat election. She lost, though his name carried heft and inspired a careful esteem reserved for outlaws in these parts. But Nitin KK, who went by Rahul Tyagi in the criminal underworld — one of two sharpshooters of the Tillu gang who posed as lawyers, killed rival gangster Gogi in Delhi’s Rohini court before being shot themselves on Friday afternoon — “never committed a crime” in his own village. “He belonged here but did mind his own business. Whatever he did outside, he never brought it here,” said a Phaphoonda villager who did not want to be named. His family does not live there anymore. But it is where he grew up, the son of a mason and, until Friday, a criminal wanted for murder and extortion in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. He was 28. UP STF sources said he carried a Rs 50,000-reward in Delhi. “But he was not criminally active in this region,” said STF circle officer Brajesh Singh. Closer home, police said they did not know much. “Never heard of him,” said Sanjay Sharma, SHO of Kharkhoda police station, under whose jurisdiction the village lies. Tyagi’s name has come up several times in Tillu gang killings. In August this year, two members of the Tillu gang arrested for killing a man (whose elder brother is in jail with Gogi) over a gang rivalry in northwest Delhi had named Tyagi along with two others as murder accomplices. In December last year, two other members of the Tillu gang arrested for killing a man suspected of being Gogi’s informer had also said they, Tyagi and two others had been asked to “eliminate” the man.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/gogi-shooter-from-meerut-campaigned-for-sis-in-law-in-up-panchayat-polls/articleshow/86490177.cms||Sandeep Rai

The final-semester undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students have been left in the lurch, due to an unprecedented delay in conducting examinations. Now they will have to wait till the end of November to get their results. According to the pre-pandemic calendar of events of Mangalore University (MU), the examination and results of final-semester or sixth-semester undergraduate and fourth semester postgraduate courses should have been announced by August. “I am in a dilemma as I have a job offer from an MNC in Bengaluru. However, I cannot take it up, since my course and examinations are not over. I am clueless at the moment about my future,” said a student pursuing MSc. Another worried UG student said that she is anxious whether she would be able to pursue higher education or not. P L Dharma, registrar (evaluation), Mangalore University, admitted the odd-semester examination, that was started in April, was delayed due multiple reasons, including the second wave of Covid-19 and KSRTC bus strike. It was scheduled from August, but the district administration stopped it due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. The postgraduate examinations that were planned in April, took place in August, and were completed a few days ago. Finally, both UG and PG examinations got over in the first week of September. Dharma maintained that MU has planned to conduct sixth-semester UG and fourth semester PG examinations from September 30. It will be over by the third week of October. MU has made provisions for those final-semester backlog students to apply for the exam. On the delay in evaluation of odd semesters, Dharma said they had plans to carry out the evaluation and examination simultaneously, when UG and PG examinations were on. However, there was opposition from teachers, as they could not carry out evaluation and invigilation duties simultaneously. “We have decided to start evaluation from September 27. If all goes well, results of PG/UG odd semester exams will be declared by the end of October,” he said. The teaching faculty is again unhappy with MU’s decision to carry out exam duty and evaluation work at the same time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/delay-in-exams-evaluation-affects-future-of-mu-students/articleshow/86490161.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Opposition leader VD Satheesan said it is mystery that government is taking no legal action or slapping a fine for the delay on the part of Adani Group that failed to complete the project on time. Satheesan said government has given full freedom to the firm even when it failed to complete it by 2019. He added that as per the agreement, the group can further avail three more months to complete the project after the stipulated time and thereafter, the company has to pay the government Rs 12 lakh/day. But, government hasn’t invoked any of these measures that were stated in the agreement, he said. The government could not do anything more than handing over land, which was acquired by the previous UDF government, to the group. It could neither complete the railway line to the project site nor finish the 3,100-m breakwater. Only 850m was completed, Satheesan said. He asked the government and Adani Group not to sabotage the project and complete it in a time-bound manner. The government had entered into an agreement with Adani Vizhinjam Port Pvt Ltd for the construction of a deep-water multipurpose seaport, Vizhinjam International Multipurpose Seaport Project, on Aug 17, 2015. The scheduled day of completion of the project (as per the agreement) was the 1,460th day after signing the agreement, which fell on Dec 03, 2019. But, the project could not be completed on time due to multiple reasons.Now, the company has sought time till Dec 2023 to complete the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-adani-group-in-collusion-says-oppn/articleshow/86494492.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Man kills self, wife critical in suicide bid||LUCKNOW: A petty dispute over low earnings to run a household snowballed into a death wish for a newly-wed couple in Hanskheda area in Para police limits with the man hanging himself from the ceiling and his wife battling for life after a suicide attempt. Police attributed the incident, which took place late Thursday, to a flare-up over money that spun out of control. Three months ago, Suhail, 22, resident of Kanshiram Colony, got married to Shaziya, 20, a resident of Siddharthnagar. He worked in a shop and barely managed to meet two ends. When Suhail returned home on Thursday, Shaziya began nagging him for not earning enough triggering a spat, said police, based on a neighbour’s statement. “When sparks flew, Suhail confronted her with a poser whether he should dacoity to raise his income. Shaziya hit back, saying he should not have promised her a kingsize life before marriage. Rather, he should not have married her at all,” police said. Then there was a brief lull, before screams rent the air. Neighbours rushed into the flat to find Suhail hanging with a dupatta from the ceiling, said a neighbour, who wished not to be named. When others tried to console Shaziya, she suddenly ran out and jumped off the balcony, suffering multiple injuries. Assistant commissioner of police, Kakori, Ashutosh Kumar, who immediately reached the spot, brought down Suhail’s body and took him to the hospital. While Suhail was declared dead, Shaziya was referred to Trauma Centre. “Autopsy revealed asphyxia as cause of death due to hanging. Shaziya has sustained multiple injuries, but is out of danger,” said Kumar. The couple’s family members have been informed about the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/man-kills-self-wife-critical-in-suicide-bid/articleshow/86496419.cms||---

She was unhappy with the chaos, mismanagement and public rush at such centers. The DC visited various service delivery counters of Farad Kendra, Suvidha Kendra, RTI office, Tehsil and other offices, where she talked to people and took feedback from them. She also reviewed various phases of citizen-centric services, from issuing a token number to service delivery. The DC found that services were not being delivered in a smooth and time-bound manner. She said that applicants were seen waiting for hours. They told her that officials at the windows were not polite or helpful. Taking serious note of this, the DC warned officials against such behaviour. She asked members of the management at the Sewa and Suvidha Kendra to ensure that every operator on the counter briefed people about requirement of documents for services in detail so that people did not have to run from pillar to post to avail the service. Services, she said, must be provided to people within the stipulated time frame after getting token, adding that this norm must be implemented in earnest. She also directed officials to ensure that more chairs were made available for people. Accompanied by ADC (G) Komal Mittal, ADC (D) Dr Himanshu Aggarwal, AC (G) Tarsem Chand, the DC said Sewa and Suvidha Kendras were opened to facilitate people and no laxity would be tolerated on the part of officials. She said surprise inspections would be conducted regularly to keep an eye on the working of these kendras.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dc-conducts-surprise-check-at-admn-offices/articleshow/86492200.cms||---
---||Delhi||Organiser of Jantar Mantar event gets bail||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Friday granted bail to Preet Singh, an organiser of the Jantar Mantar event where communal slogans were allegedly raised last month, saying his custodial interrogation in the hate speech case was not required. Justice Mukta Gupta directed that the accused be released on bail on a personal bond of Rs 50,000 with two sureties of the like amount. The court noted that, according to the record, the accused had left the venue at 2pm, while “the main provocative words/slogans were raised by the co-accused at 4pm. “At this stage, 'it would not be appropriate' to express any opinion on whether the 'words spoken by the petitioner make out an offence under Section 153A IPC (hate speech)' as it would be gone into at the stage of charge or during trial,” it added. The court further dealt with the prosecution’s claim that Singh gave provocative interviews. “The interview by the petitioner was not an isolated one and was part of simultaneous conversation with number of speakers. Further, many people gathered at the spot due to petitioner co-organising the protest and, therefore, he would be liable for any offence committed in furtherance of the common object of the assembly,” it noted. Singh, who was remanded in judicial custody on August 10, is accused of creating enmity between groups and inciting youth to propagate against a particular religion at a rally at Jantar Mantar on August 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/organiser-of-jantar-mantar-event-gets-bail/articleshow/86494506.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||State seeks six more months to finalise coastal mgmt plan||Panaji: The state government has approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) seeking a six-month extension for finalising the coastal zone management plan (CZMP). In its application, the state government asked the NGT to extend the time period till February 28, 2022. The NGT had directed the state government to complete the CZMP by August 30. The state submitted that the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority would require an additional 60 days to complete the entire exercise of physical verification and ground truthing of all objections and suggestions, which will be forwarded to the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) for finalisation and verification. “Once the draft CZMP is received by the state from NCSCM, the same will be sent to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change for approval and the final notification, which will require another 60 days,” the state government said. The mangroves committees of both North and South Goa have started site inspections with respect to the objections or suggestions received by them taluka-wise, and scheduled site inspections till the end of September. Similarly, the water resources department and fisheries department have also started their site inspections and scheduled their site visits in the upcoming weeks. In South Goa, the mangroves committee carried out an inspection of four objections and suggestions in Quepem taluka on August 26. In North Goa, the mangroves committee inspected 14 objections and suggestions in Bardez taluka on August 31, and five on September 21, also in Bardez. The tribunal had passed an order in November 2017 directing all states and Union territories to submit their CZMPs by August 31, 2018. But when Goa’s plan was prepared by the Chennai-based NCSCM, citizens found several errors in the draft plan. This led to widespread protests across the state, following which the Goa government agreed to seek an extension in the deadline to prepare the CZMP for Goa. Though the extension was granted three times, Goa missed each deadline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-seeks-six-more-months-to-finalise-coastal-mgmt-plan/articleshow/86496469.cms||---

Search teams comprising forest department personnel from Dharwad, Haveri and Gadag districts were deployed across the village, members of which are watching closely for any sign of the leopard. Cages have been placed across the village to trap the big cat. Yashpal told TOI that the search teams looked for the leopard throughout Thursday night, but the big cat had managed to elude them by fleeing into a sugarcane field. “We have confirmed that the leopard is in the field, and we are watching for any sign of the big cat. We have found pug marks of the leopard. We have found the excreta of the animal, which we have sent to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad, to ascertain if this is the same leopard that was spotted in Hubballi. We respond without delay when the villagers alert us about a leopard. Video captured on a drone camera confirmed the big cat’s presence,” Yashpal said. On Friday morning, a member of the Govanakoppa gram panchayat informed the search team that she spotted a leopard entering a banana plantation owned by Basavaraj Hubballi, but when the search team tried to verify her plaint, it was found that it was a hoax.  On Wednesday evening, members of Shivappa Uppar’s family in Kavalageri spotted the big cat outside their farmhouse and intimated the forest department. Uppar’s son Maruti said that he spotted the leopard around 4.30pm on Wednesday outside the family’s farmhouse. “The animal was standing near our sugarcane field not very far from our farmhouse. The big cat was looking at our cattle, our sheep. Our children were playing in the frontyard. I took the children inside the house, and immediately informed my father. When he came out, the leopard was still there, and it rushed inside the field when he raised an alarm,” Maruti told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/foresters-intensify-search-for-leopard-in-sugarcane-field/articleshow/86490602.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

Member of Parliament Ramesh Bidhuri said that owing to modern lifestyle, cases of diabetic nephropathy are on the rise, which subsequently lead to end stage renal diseases (ESRD). “Nearly 2.2 lakh new patients of diabetic have been surfacing every year; this means an addition of 3.4 crore dialysis every year. Since the facilities providing dialysis appear overcrowded, SDMC’s newly inaugurated dialysis centre will help in facilitating patients undergoing dialysis,” he said. The centre has been set up with the cooperation of Nipro Medical Corporation (a subsidiary of a Japanese company). The state of the art centre will have a 10-bedded dialysis facility. The civic agency will start a similar facility next month at five-storey Tilak Nagar Municipal Hospital. SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan said that whereas the cost of each session of dialysis costs anywhere between Rs 3,500-Rs 6,000 in private hospitals, the same will be made available at Rs 1,400 at Purnima hospital. SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said that the unit will have ultramodern dialysis machines with Japanese technology and German double pass RO to give ultrapure dialysis water ensuring high quality dialysis.

The minister inspected the area along with the river following demands from the locals alleging grave inconvenience due to delay in development work of the river.  “JDA should take action against Tata Consultancy Services, which is giving consultancy for the project, and officers concerned for the delay in completing the development of the river,” said the minister, who assured locals of raising the issue with CM Ashok Gehlot and UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal. Accusing the local civic bodies behind the delay, the minister said open drains and placing of sewerage lines in the area must be done by the JDA. “The JDA cannot pass the onus of the work on the municipal corporations. If there is any issue, both the civic bodies should discuss and provide immediate relief to the people living in the colonies nearby,” said Khachariyawas. Taking a dig at the former BJP government, the minister said they had only renamed the Amananshah Nalla (drainage channel) to Dravyavati River which remains a drainage channel till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/min-act-against-errant-officers-for-delaying-dravyavati-river-project/articleshow/86494547.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||PGI doctors perform complex brain tumour surgery||Times News Network Chandigarh: A team of PGI doctors led by neurosurgeons Dr Dhandapani S S and Dr Rijuneeta have performed a complex brain tumour surgery. The tumour was close to critical blood vessels. The surgery was performed from the nasal passage despite the tumour being close to neurovascular structures. “It is perhaps the first such surgery in the region as we have not found any published medical literature regarding this,” said Dr Dhandapani. A 48-year-old man and a 46-year-old woman were referred to PGIMER with complaints of decreased vision. Their MRI revealed planum meningioma, a tumor of 3cm at the base of the skull. It was surrounded closely by critical vascular structures such as anterior cerebral and internal carotid arteries on both sides, as well as neural structures such as both optic nerves and pituitary stalk. “These tumors are usually operated on through open surgery and the remaining part is treated with radiation. Over the last few years, simple tumours are being removed through the nose endoscopically by neurosurgeons teaming with ENT surgeons. However, endoscopic removal through the nose is highly challenging in complex meningiomas close to neurovascular structures,” said Dr Dhandapani. Dr. Dhandapani chose the endonasal corridor to avoid blood loss and to go through the optic nerve. The patients’ vision was affected due to the location of the tumour and the optic nerve was thus avoided. The team studied the patients in detail using CT angiography navigation and planned for endoscopy. A 4K endoscope system, installed recently in the Neurosurgery department of PGIMER, was utilised. The tumors were very firm and had to be dissected meticulously from blood vessels of the brain and could be finally removed totally through the nose. “As endonasal endoscopic surgery of brain tumor can cause brain fluid leakage through the nose, the vascularised flap taken from inside the nose was used to seal the operative corridor along with fascia and glue. After a six hour long surgery, the blood loss was less than 400ml. Patients were kept in the ICU and are recovering well. Vision has improved in both patients, with CT scans showing almost complete removal,” said Dr Dhandapani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-doctors-perform-complex-brain-tumour-surgery/articleshow/86492244.cms||---

The state received the award for providing the highest number of free treatments across the country under the Karunya Arogya Suraksha Padhathi (KASP). The award for the hospital that provided the highest number of free treatments was bagged by government medical college, Kottayam. The Pradhan Mantri Arogya Mitra award for providing the highest number of cards under AB PM JAY-KASP was bagged by A Aswathi of Vandanam medical college, Alappuzha. Health minister Veena George said that the award is a recognition to the state that undertook the activities through the KASP. In the last three years, about 2 crore people were given free treatment in the country. Of this, 27.5 lakh people, which is 13.66% of the total number, are from the state, the minister said. The minister added that the implementation of KASP in the state has been entrusted to the state health agency (SHA) that took care of the programme even during the pandemic. Even Covid-19-affected patients, who are not beneficiaries under KASP, have received free treatment from private hospitals in the state. Under KASP, a family is offered free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh in a year, and under the Karunya Benevolent Fund (KBF), free treatment up to Rs 2 lakh is offered once in a lifetime. All families with annual income less than Rs 3 lakh and are not included under KASP, are offered benefits under KBF. Presently, the benefits under these schemes are offered in 192 government hospitals and 569 private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-institutions-bag-3-health-awards/articleshow/86494555.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, only 16% of this group has been fully vaccinated so far with the two doses. Further, 43% have not taken any dose yet. The district’s adult population is about 36 lakh, including 26 lakh in the 18-44 age group. All aged above 18 years are eligible for vaccination. The mass immunisation drive was rolled out on January 16, but inoculation of the 18-44 age group started in May. In five months since then, a total 19.1 lakh doses have been administered to people in this group. About 8.6 lakh doses were utilised in inoculating 4.3 lakh people (17%) in this group with two shots, thus fully vaccinating them with the two-dose course. About 10.5 lakh (41%) people in this category have been partially vaccinated with a dose so far. They are waiting for their gap period to be over to take the second dose. This means that 14.7 lakh people in the 18-44 years age group have taken at least a dose, which is 57% of the total population of this category. However, this also means that 11.3 lakh (43%) people in this group have still not taken even a single dose. District immunization officer Dr MK Singh said, “Though vaccination of the 18-44 years age group began late, their turnout was huge. Hence in five months, such a large number has been vaccinated. We are trying to cover the remaining as early as possible.” 85% of 45+ have taken a shot Over 85% of the 10 lakh population aged 45 years or above in the district has received at least a shot. Of these, a micro analysis shows that 47% have been fully vaccinated with the two doses, while 38% have taken a dose and are waiting for the second. About 15% have not taken any dose so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/every-2nd-person-in-18-44-age-group-has-taken-1-shot/articleshow/86496462.cms||---

The Congress has already invited applications from aspirants from the coastal districts. Former mayor Shashidhar Hegde, former vice-president of KPCC Manjunath Bhandari and Dakshina Kannada District Congress Committee (DCC) vice-president Prasad Raj Kanchan have submitted applications. The party will receive applications till September 30. According to Congress sources, applicants will have to donate Rs 1 lakh for the KPCC building fund. Dakshina Kannada DCC vice-president Sadashiva Ullal told TOI that more aspirants from the party are expected to submit applications before the deadline. “We have received only three applications from Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts so far. All applications will be forwarded to the KPCC, and a final decision will be taken by the party high command,” he said. On the electorate, he said that a final voters’ list is yet to be prepared by the Election Commission. “The electorate comprises elected members from zilla panchayats, taluk panchayats, gram panchayats, MLAs, MLCs and MPs of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts. However, zilla panchayats and taluk panchayats have been dissolved. Hence, only gram panchayat members, MLAs, MLCs and MPs are voters. Within six months, elections to zilla panchayats and taluk panchayats should be conducted,” Sadashiva said. Dakshina Kannada district BJP president Sudarshan Moodbidri said that the party is in no hurry to commence the candidate selection process, since the Election Commission has not announced dates. “We will announce the names of candidates only after the declaration of election dates,” he added. Aspirant from Congress, Shashidhar Hegde, said though there were nearly 6,500 voters, the number has reduced due to the non-existence of elected bodies in taluk and zilla panchayats in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/cong-begins-candidate-selection-process-for-mlc-poll/articleshow/86490258.cms||---

The vaccine supply had improved in most districts but there had been few takers because of this huge gap between the first and the second doses of Covishield, the mainstay of India’s vaccination drive, he said. “We will seek a fresh directive from the central government to speed up vaccination in the state.” The deputy CM said the issue was discussed in the cabinet and a proposal would be tabled before the Centre.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Train thief yanks woman, others stare as commuter pulls her in||MUMBAI: A plucky local train commuter rushed to the rescue of her co-traveller who was being mugged in a women’s compartment at Borivli on Wednesday, pulling her out of harm’s way. A robber had climbed onto the train while it had halted at a signal and tried to drag the victim, Reshma Khatoon (21), overboard, after having stolen her phone. But Neeta Bhosle grabbed the victim inside and kept pulling her till the robber let go. He was later tracked down and arrested. Around 7.15 pm, Khatoon got into a second-class compartment which had about two dozen women on board. Moments later, the train halted near Poisar nullah where a man climbed in. He pulled a cellphone from the pocket of Khatoon who was standing in the passage. He then hit her and began to drag her towards the door. “I jumped out of my seat and rushed to her defence,” said Bhosle, who was not acquainted with Khatoon. “I grabbed her and pulled her towards myself inside the train but the robber wouldn’t let go. Both of us were yelling for help but, to our surprise, all the other commuters had recoiled into a corner and just looked on,” said Bhosle. Minutes later, one of Khatoon’s colleagues, who was also in the same compartment, joined Bhosle. Someone pulled the alarm chain, but the train, which had started moving by then, did not halt. “The robber must have panicked and eventually he jumped off. I had seen a blade in his hand and feared what he planned to do to Khatoon,” said Bhosle. At Kandivli station, Khatoon, Bhosle and a few others approached the police and registered a complaint. “A police team combed the stretch of the railway tracks between Borivli and Kandivli stations and nabbed the accused within an hour,” said senior inspector Anil Kadam of the Government Railway Police. The police said that the accused, Pradeep Jaiswal, hails from Uttar Pradesh and had come to Boisar in Palghar district to visit his uncle. The police said he appeared intoxicated and could have slipped onto the railway premises through slums along the tracks. “We were able to trace Jaiswal quickly as he couldn’t switch off the stolen phone while our team kept dialling her number,” said Kadam. The railway police felicitated Bhosle for her courage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-train-thief-yanks-woman-others-stare-as-commuter-pulls-her-in/articleshow/86497901.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Delhi||First IAS in family, Delhi University alumna hopes to work for women, kids, education||NEW DELHI: Mamta Yadav, an alumna of Delhi University, has become the first in her family to become an IAS. She has stood fifth in the all-India Civil Services Examination, the result of which was declared by Union Public Service Commission on Friday. This was the second attempt of the 24-year-old who has been undergoing training for Indian Railways Personnel Service as per her previous rank in the 500s last year. “I had expected that my rank will improve, but the fifth rank is quite a surprise, and I am very happy,” Yadav, a resident of Kalkaji, told TOI. She completed schooling from Balwant Rai Mehta Vidya Bhawan at Greater Kailash and did her bachelors in physics from Hindu College. “It was during my college days that I realised I wanted to get into administration. Now that I have been selected, I would like to focus on issues concerning women, children and education,” she said. At Jamia Millia Islamia’s Residential Coaching Academy (RCA), 23 candidates have cleared this year’s examination. While 15 of them were from RCA run by Centre for Coaching and Career Planning, five were external students trained for interview. Shreya Singhal, who has ranked 176, said more than three years of hard work had paid off. Singhal, who is from Sarsawa, a town in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur district, said, “As I belong to a small town, I have seen how public amenities are not up to the mark. There is a scope for improving these facilities, including education. As a woman, I will be able to empathise with a lot of issues in the country and can work positively towards them.” Singhal, who is aiming for a berth in Indian Administrative Service, joined RCA after completing her graduation in chemical engineering in 2018. “I took admission for full-time preparation as I realised that this is something I would like to pursue,” she pointed out. Congratulating the candidates, JMI vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar attributed the success to the hard work of the students and the faculty and other staff. Sara Ashraf, who came to RCA for mock interviews, has secured the rank of 316. “I am getting IPS and may get IAS, my first preference. I was inclined to join the service as this is one place where we can really work at the grassroots level. A lot of respect is also attached to these services.” Funded by University Grants Commission, RCA provides free coaching and residential facilities to scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, minority and women aspirants. The university said the entrance test for this year’s admissions to RCA would be held on October 20. “Once admitted, the aspirants will get facilities like free hostels, classes for general studies and optional subjects, special lectures by experts on national and international issues, library and mock interviews by a panel of civil servants and academicians,” Jamia said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/first-ias-in-family-du-alumna-hopes-to-work-for-women-kids-education/articleshow/86494608.cms||Shradha Chettri

Last month, the ED asked for Parab’s appearance in the case after controversial police officer (now dismissed) Sachin Waze, in his statement to the agency, had alleged that he had overheard that Parab had received Rs 20 crore through deputy RTO officer Bajrang Kharmate in the controversial transfer of 10 DCPs last year. Parab had sought two weeks’ time for Ganeshotsav and the ED had accepted his request. The agency on Friday issued the second summon to Parab for September 28. Earlier, the ED had recorded Kharmate’s statement in the case to confirm Waze’s allegation after searching his premises in Pune. In July 2020, then Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh had issued an order for transfer of about 10 DCPs at one go, but Deshmukh and Parab had got the order reversed. In his statement to the ED, Waze had said, “...I came to know that Rs 40 crore had been collected from police officers listed in the order of which Rs 20 crore each was given to Deshmukh through his private secretary Sanjeev Palande and Parab through Kharmate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-summons-minister-parab-on-tuesday-in-deshmukh-case/articleshow/86497921.cms||Vijay V Singh

Their results, however, would remain subject to the permission of the high court. A division bench of justice Sangeet Lodha and justice Vinit Kumar Mathur gave these directions in view of the exam on September 26. “We consider it appropriate and accordingly direct that the candidates holding the qualification of B.Ed. and D.El.Ed. (NIOS) only and have applied for appearance in the REET-2021 Level-I Examination pursuant to the amended notification dated 8.2.2021 issued by the co-ordinator REET up to 20.2.2021, shall be provisionally permitted to appear in REET[1]2021 Level-I examination scheduled to be held on 26.9.2021 subject to decision of the writ petitions. However, their results shall not be declared without permission of the court,” the order said. It may be noted that some aspirants had challenged the decision of the state government to restrict B. Ed. degree holders to appear in REET Level 1 despite the NCTE allowing them vide an amendment in its guidelines in June 2018 on the condition of undertaking a bridge course. Before this, the NCTE had reserved the REET level 1 for BSTC students only and REET level 2 for BEd. students. But it amended this rule in June 2018 and permitted the BEd. students also to appear for level 1 examination along with the BSTC applicants. But the state government again barred the BEd. students to appear in REET 2021 (level 1) in its examination notification leading some of the aspirants to challenge this notification in the high court. Parallelly, some BSTC students had also challenged the constitutionality of the amendment in rule of June 2018 by the NCTE protesting permission to BEd. students to appear in the REET level 1 examination. In February, the high court had passed an interim order on the plea of BEd. students directing the Board of Secondary Education to accept the applications of the BEd. degree holders irrespective of the fact whether they possess the requisite eligibility or not. One of the counsel for petitioners Nikhil Dungawat said in view of the facts and circumstances of the case, the high court has given this interim relief to the BEd. degree holders and diploma in elementary education holders to appear in the REET level 1 examiantion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/raj-hc-allows-bed-holders-to-appear-in-teacher-exam/articleshow/86494658.cms||---

A native of Karyavattom in the capital, Minnu is currently a clerk handling petitions in the NRI cell at the police headquarters. She made it to the service in her sixth attempt, which began in 2015. She joined the government service in 2012, on compassionate grounds after her father Paul Raj, who was a policeman, died while in service. “Last time I could not make it due to 13 marks shortage. This time I was confident of making it and finding a place somewhere in the rank list,” says Minnu. “I had heard about civil services as my father was in the police service. But I was not passionate about civil services when I joined the service in 2012,” she said. She began her civil services preparation in 2015. A post-graduate degree holder in biochemistry, she said that her original idea was a doctorate in her subject. She initially applied for a leave to pursue higher studies. It was after she cleared her preliminary and mains examinations that she sought a no-objection certificate to attend the civil services interview. She was also attached to former state police chief Loknath Behera’s office, and he encouraged in her attempts, Minnu added.  She expressed gratitude to senior police officers, including ADGP (headquarters) Manoj Abraham, DIG (armed police battalion) P Prakash and AIG (headquarters) Harishanker, for motivating her and providing help to achieve her dream.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/police-hq-clerk-makes-it-to-the-rank-list/articleshow/86494636.cms||---
---||Delhi||North corpn has stopped providing primary edu, 70k dropped out: AAP||New Delhi: AAP legislator Saurabh Bharadwaj on Friday claimed that North Delhi Municipal Corporation had stopped providing education to primary students by firing 687 teachers and 70,000 students had dropped out over the past one and a half years. “Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan is a central government-led initiative wherein the central and state governments collaboratively pay the teachers’ salaries at municipal schools. On September 7, 2020, the corporation’s education department wrote to Delhi government that they were firing their primary school teachers because the schools were shut during the pandemic and they were not educating children during the pandemic. Subsequently, it fired 687 teachers,” the MLA alleged. Bharadwaj claimed that the teachers were not even able to get ration because their salaries were stopped by the corporation. “Just imagine the state of the children and their families who are being deprived of education for so long.” The AAP functionary said only a few Delhi government schools offered primary education. “Primary education in Delhi is in the hands of the municipal corporations. Because of this step, all these teachers are now unemployed. We have met them. We said we would inform the education minister and try to find a solution,” said Bharadwaj. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the corporation’s primary schools, like all other primary institutes, had not been opened for physical attendance as Delhi government had not permitted them to reopen. In almost all schools, online classes are being regularly conducted, he claimed. “The Kejriwal government stopped paying the salary of 687 contractual teachers from May 2020 and the corporation had no option but to suspend their contracts,” Kapoor said. The corporation has written to Delhi government for funds to reinstate them, but nothing was released, he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corpn-has-stopped-providing-primary-edu-70k-dropped-out-aap/articleshow/86494661.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was speaking at an ‘Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav’ programme held at the Business Development Centre (BDC) building of the New Mangalore Port Trust (NMPT) at Panambur on Friday. Earlier in the day, the minister dedicated the new BDC Building of the NMPT, laid the foundation for modernisation of the Mallya Gate, and initiated the work of a new truck terminal near KK Gate of the NMPT. The project will enhance the capacity of NMPT, and the port will earn its own identity, he said, adding the government is committed to develop a fishing harbour at Kulai in Mangaluru, and steps will be taken to implement the project at a fast pace. “The government of India will extend support for all the projects that the Karnataka government proposes. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai had visited me recently, and placed several proposals before the central government on behalf of the state. We will give special considerations for all the proposals the chief minister presented,’’ Sonowal said. “Over the years, the port has grown from the level of handling less than one lakh tonnes of traffic to 36.5 million tonnes last year. Over the span of 47 years, the port has crossed many milestones. The port is renowned as the most sustainable port of the nation, achieving the coveted target of 100% solarisation and 100% self-sufficiency in water requirements. The port is the biggest exporter of coffee, and second-largest importers of LPG in India. Being the only major port of Karnataka, the port has catered to the trade emerging from this vibrant hinterland, for close to half-a-century. Now, on the occasion of Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav, the port is ever ready to take on new challenges in realisation of the aspiration of the nation, and thereby, the people of India,” he said. To a query, he told reporters that all problems related to fishermen and NMPT will be solved amicably. Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel said that plans are afoot to construct a flyover between Kulur and Baikampady, which will reduce the traffic congestion on the national highway stretch near the NMPT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/rs-3200cr-gas-terminal-at-tannirbavi-in-pipeline-sonowal/articleshow/86490381.cms||---

I will put maximum effort to achieve the best results in all my assignments,’’ said Meera, who is the daughter of Ramadas and Radhika from Kolazhy, Pottore. Meera was schooled at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Pottore and has a degree in mechanical engineering from Government engineering college, Thrissur. “Even in engineering college, social issues used to dominate our discussions, rather than our subjects. I always wanted to contribute something to society in my own way. That is how I started developing interest in the civil service exam. Of course, my mother was motivating me to attempt the exam even before that,” she said. Meera succeeded in her fourth attempt. She said she had attempted the exam first when she was working for L&T in Bengaluru, just to know how it would be. “I couldn’t get through the prelims. Then I attempted it again after preparation and reached the interview stage but lost with a shortage of 1 mark. In the third attempt I lost at the prelims stage and one mark was the difference then. I won the fourth time. I’m happy and will strive hard to do something good,” she said. Teachers and students of BVB and her engineering college are excited by her success. Revenue minister K Rajan, district collector Harith V Kumar, Wadakkancherry MLA Xavier Chittilappilly visited Meera’s home to congratulate her.

---||India||Supreme Court bars Kerala high court from testing validity of law on EWS quota||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the proceedings before the Kerala HC on a PIL challenging the validity of the 103rd Constitution Amendment Act, 2019 providing for 10% reservation in jobs and admissions to government educational institutions to economically weaker sections. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed a bench headed by CJI N V Ramana that when the SC is seized of the issue, it would not be appropriate for the Kerala HC to proceed with the same exercise in parallel proceedings. The bench issued notice to PIL petitioner Nujaim PK and stayed the proceedings before the HC. On November 5 last year, the Ernakulam bench of the HC had admitted for consideration Nujaim’s petition challenging the validity of the 103rd Constitution Amendment Act, 2019, and the corresponding amendment to the state rules done by the Kerala government on October 23 last year. On August 5 last year, a three-judge bench of the SC had accepted the Centre’s request to transfer all similar cases pending in various HCs challenging the 10% EWS reservation to the Supreme Court and also referred the matter to a five-judge bench, saying that the petitions raised a substantial question of law having great importance. Even after more than a year, the SC is yet to constitute a five-judge Constitution bench to hear the nearly three dozen petitions. The Centre sought the transfer of the case before Kerala HC to the SC. The petitioners had challenged the 10% EWS quota in government jobs and admission to educational institutions on the ground that it breached the 50% ceiling on reservation put by the SC in its 1992 judgment in Indra Sawhney case (Mandal case). However, the Centre has maintained that the argument about 50% cap on reservation is “fallacious” as the ceiling laid down by the apex court is not binding and in view of the constitutional amendment to provide quotas in jobs and education meant to socially uplift nearly 200 million poor people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-bars-kerala-high-court-from-testing-validity-of-law-on-ews-quota/articleshow/86498452.cms||---

The official release stated, “There is a possibility of communal atmosphere getting vitiated in some places. Expressing concern over the situation, the government has directed the DGP, all district magistrates and SSPs to take precautionary steps to address the problem. They have also been told to set up district-level committees, which will give suggestions on the issue.” Apart from this, the release added, the government has called for the formation of peace committees in various areas, saying “meetings of these committees should be organised from time to time.” “Police and district authorities have been told to mark such areas in their respective districts and ensure strict action is taken against anti-social elements residing there. They have also been asked to prepare a district-wise list of persons who have come from other states and have a criminal history,” the government’s communication said. It added that district magistrates have been asked to keep a check on illegal purchase and sale of land in their areas. “The officials should also ensure that no person sells his/her property under any fear or pressure. District authorities should identify people of foreign origin residing in their area with fake voter or identity cards.” When queried about the implications of the government communication, DGP, Uttarakhand, Ashok Kumar told TOI, “We do issue orders to our district teams from time to time to prevent any illegal activity in their respective areas.” Meanwhile, BJP leader Ajendra Ajay said, “I wrote to the CM on this issue in July this year. I told him that people from a particular community were not only setting up their places of worship but were also buying land in bulk, which was resulting in migration of people. Acting on the letter, the CM has directed the home department to look into the matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/fearing-communal-tension-ukhand-govt-puts-police-admin-on-alert/articleshow/86490483.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Kochi||Govt will have to accept farmers’ demands: Yogendra Yadav||THRISSUR: Social activist Yogendra Yadav on Friday said the ongoing farmers’ agitation will be recorded as landmark development in the democratic history of India, and eventually the ruling regime will be forced to concede to their demand. Talking to reporters here, Yadav said the prolonged agitation is historic on three important dimensions; first of all it has restored the self-respect of the farmers, who were looked down upon for years together. The agitation has made the farmers recognise their political clout and thirdly it has created an unprecedented unity among them. The proposed Bharat Bandh will be an impressive demonstration of the massive people’s support to the farmers’ agitation, said Yadav. On the road ahead for the agitation, and if the government will be forced to accept the farmers’ demands, Yadav said, “That is bound to happen, it is only a matter of time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ego is the main obstacle in resolving the farmers’ agitation. More than discussions between farmers and government representatives, what is vital is that the PM should sit in front of a mirror and hold a dialogue with Narendra Modi, the human being. Then he will realise that his ego is less important than the agonies of farmers.” Asked whether the farmers will have an influence in the ensuing assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Yadav said, “That is not our focus now. Our focus is to broaden and strengthen the farmers’ movement, make it into an all-India movement, for which the ensuing Bharat bandh will be a landmark development.” Earlier, Yadav visited farmers’ houses in Pudukkad and Chalakudy assembly segments, who were killed and suffered loss of properties in attacks by wild elephants straying into human habitations. Yadav, who is at the forefront of the farmers’ movement and founder of the Kisan Andolan movement, was here to mobilize support for the Swaraj India party which is exploring alternative political programmes and policies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-will-have-to-accept-farmers-demands-yadav/articleshow/86494759.cms||T Ramavarman

Corporator Ambarnath Kamble from New Sangvi immediately transferred Rs6,500 to him through his wife’s e-payment app. After some time, when the man requested Rs10,000 more, Kamble went to the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial hospital in Pimpri, where the caller claimed that his daughter was being treated. On inquiry, the corporator found that no one by that name was being treated there. Kamble then filed a complaint with the Sangvi police. Kamble told TOI, “The same fraudster had called many corporators in PCMC. Five more corporators had transferred money to him.” Sunil Tonape, senior inspector, Sangvi police, told TOI, “We have received a complaint from one corporator so far. We have registered a case under relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act.” Kamble said that on September 19, around 6pm, he received a call from an unknown person, who claimed to be a resident of Samarthnagar at New Sangvi, which comes under Kamble’s ward. “The person was crying inconsolably. He told me that his eight-year-old daughter had been run over by a truck and was in the YCMH for treatment. He told me to transfer Rs6,500 for medical tests,” he said. Kamble said that he believed the man as he gave him references of his three friends. Kamble said that after 15 minutes the person called him again and sought Rs10,000 more. “He even made me talk to a ‘doctor’ who told me that the cash was needed for purchase of medicines. I told him to tell the pharmacist in the hospital to give the medicines. But he told me that the pharmacist was not giving the medicines without bill payment,” Kamble said. The corporator then went to the hospital. “I even reprimanded the pharmacist for not giving medicines to the patients. When the patients’ list was checked along with the hospital dean, it was found that no patient by that name had been admitted there,” Kamble said. He said that later he came to know that two more corporators had received similar calls. “I then found that five more corporators had already transferred money to him,” Kamble said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-plays-sympathy-card-dupes-pcmc-corporator/articleshow/86492466.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Delhi||Delhi: Meharchand Market revamp plan stuck, again||NEW DELHI: Traders’ wait for redevelopment of Meharchand Market is not going to end anytime soon as South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has decided to make changes in the layout plan despite the project being approved by the standing committee last year. The key commercial hub is located near Lodhi Colony and all existing structures, as per the last plan, were to be demolished to make way for new construction. An SDMC official said an updated layout plan would be presented before the standing committee soon. “Though we got the standing committee’s approval last year, shopkeepers later pointed out certain issues with the design. We have incorporated their suggestions to an extent,” said the official. Three years ago, a Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee ordered sealing of 135 of the 152 shops for violating building norms and constructing beyond the permitted FAR of 150. “Since the matter of desealing the shops is still being heard by the monitoring committee, the issue will anyway need to be sorted out before any redevelopment work starts,” said the official. Ashok Sakuja, president of Meharchand Market Association, clarified that the plan had left 8ft for common space out of the shop area. “But our shops are just 40ft long and it would mean only 32ft would be left, including space for stairs,” he said. Sakuja added that traders were simultaneously requesting the monitoring committee to allow desealing. “It is asking us to pay misuse charges, but we have said SDMC is already taking conversion and redevelopment charges.” A member of the monitoring committee said, “If traders fulfil the condition, we will permit desealing.” Under the project approved last year, 90% ground coverage with 350 FAR was accepted while the marketplace was to be declared a “pedestrian shopping street” due to the unavailability of parking space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/meharchand-market-revamp-plan-stuck-again/articleshow/86494750.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Chandigarh||Passengers stopped from boarding Sharjah flight protest||Mohali: Passengers who were stopped from boarding the Sharjah flight on September 23 staged a protest outside Chandigarh International Airport on Friday. They raised slogans against Air India Express as well as immigration officers. They were denied to board the Sharjah bound flight due to some discrepancies in their documents. However, they alleged that their documents were in order and that officials had stopped them from boarding the flight without giving them a proper reason. Sonali, a Jalandhar resident said, “We had visitor’s visa of 30 days but immigration officials misbehaved with us and said that we are going to Sharjah with malafide intentions.” Another passenger Jagdish Singh said, “We have valid visitor’s visa but immigration officials still stopped us from boarding the flight saying that visitors are not allowed to Sharjah. If visitors were not allowed then why did UAE give us visas?” Satam Singh, another passenger, demanded an apology from immigration officials, accusing them of misbehaviour. He warned that they would intensify their protest if the demand was not met. Immigration officer Sanjeev Kumar did not respond to repeated phone calls and messages. Airport CEO Ajay Bhardwaj said, “The passengers refused to pay rescheduling charges, which immigration officials demanded hence they were denied boarding the flight. As far as misbehaving allegations are concerned, we will verify the same.” Immigration check officials stopped 30 passengers from boarding the Sharjah flight at Chandigarh International Airport on September 23. Police was called after passengers created a ruckus. International flight operations at Chandigarh International Airport were resumed after almost two months with the departure of the Sharjah flight. Air India Express, AXB188/187 arrived at 2:55pm from Sharjah and departed for Sharjah at 6pm. Air India Express submitted that the international flight would operate every Thursday and Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/passengers-stopped-from-boarding-sharjah-flight-protest/articleshow/86492422.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The high court had ordered medical termination of the unwanted pregnancy on September 14 to relieve the minor girl of lifelong mental torture and trauma. The young girl will be under observation for the next 24 to 48 hours at the hospital before being discharged. “The girl safely aborted the foetus late on Thursday night after medication was given to her. The expelled tissue has been handed over to police as per court order to preserve it,” said QMH medical superintendent Dr SP Jaiswar. The girl was admitted to QMH late on Tuesday night after lawyers sought court intervention to get the unwarranted pregnancy terminated. At the time of admission, the pregnancy had complications due to being in the second trimester. In fact, the pregnancy was revealed only in August when the girl complained of stomach ache and the family took her to a doctor. The rape accused, a relative of hers, is currently behind bars. “The girl is doing fine and is relieved. She will be discharged by Saturday if her mental and physical health remains well,” added Dr Jaiswar. “The girl has demonstrated extreme strength in these circumstances. We have collected clothing and food for the mother-daughter duo who are financially unstable. Legal aspects of her case are also proceeding. We are hopeful that she will get justice,” said her lawyer Haider Rizvi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/minor-rape-survivors-22-week-pregnancy-terminated-doctors/articleshow/86496616.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police said they will now put of the matter under the ‘case officers scheme’ to ensure early prosecution of the accused. According to police, accused Dinesh (25) knew the family of the girl as he always claimed that he considered the mother of the child as his sister. “He was drunk and asked the family to send the girl along so that streetdogs don’t hassle him. The family sent the girl who was later raped and murder,” said a senior police officer. Nagaur SP Abhijeet Singh said, “Our investigation is over and hopefully we are going to file the charge-sheet against the accused on Saturday. We have also taken up the case under case officer’s scheme and we will request the court for early hearings and faster prosecution in the case.” On Thursday, more than 4,000 people had taken out a peace march in the area demanding capital punishment for the accused. “It is of course the rarest of the rare case in which little girl was raped and killed,” said a senior police officer who is part of the investigation.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Uday Samant says medical college approved, NMC says not yet||MUMBAI: Days after higher education minister Uday Samant announced that approval has been granted to a new government medical college (GMC) in Sindhudurg, his constituency, the National Medical Commission (NMC) has pointed out deficiencies in the proposal. It has given the government three weeks to fulfil the requirements. The medical college is among the four new ones expected to start this academic year. NMC reports on the other three colleges in Alibaug, Satara and Pune, too, are awaited. There is no clarity on whether the Sindhudurg college will get an approval for this academic session. A government official said the NMC sent a report after its first physical inspection. “They have pointed out some technical deficiencies in their report, not related to the college’s infrastructure. They have given three weeks for compliance, after which they will carry out a second inspection and submit their report,” said the official. An official from the medical education department said the authorities are looking into the shortcomings and will comply with all the norms. “It is a government college and all efforts will be taken to ensure it is available for students at the earliest,” said the official. Before the NMC’s formal approval was released, Samant, who is also guardian minister of Sindhudurg district, jumped the gun and announced the approval in a press conference earlier this week. He later tweeted that the college with 100 seats would be available for aspirants from this year. BJP MLA Nitesh Rane had responded that the government could have sought help from his family since they already run a medical college. The Rane family runs SSPM College (private college) in Sindhudurg, which started operations last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-samant-says-med-college-approved-nmc-says-not-yet/articleshow/86492748.cms||Yogita Rao

Maharashtra reported 3,286 cases and 51 deaths on Friday, while the city reported 446 cases and 6 deaths, taking the total count of cases to 7,40,305 and casualties to 16,074. Meanwhile, after a decline in the number of daily cases prior to the Ganesh festival, the NMMC area has reported an upswing in fresh cases in the last few days. The total active cases have climbed to 647 from an all-time low of 525 recorded on September 14 and 15. The weekly average cases too have leaped to 65 per day from 51 a fortnight ago. On the other hand, the fatality rate has dropped now, and there were zero deaths recorded in the last few days. Meanwhile, Mumbai additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the average cases detected in Mumbai has remained consistent between 300-400 even a month after local trains were started. Besides, in the past month, nearly 2 lakh people have entered the city. “These are cases of reverse migration that we have tracked at the ward level. The point is there has been no spurt despite heavy mobilisation of people,” Kakani said. A ward-level exercise is being undertaken to track people who have returned from their native places post-Ganpati. Kakani said he has reviewed such cases and tests are being done where people have symptoms. “In certain wards, up to 8,000 returnees have been traced, and they would be followed up for symptoms,” he said. In terms of deaths, Mumbai has reported less than 100 fatalities in September, accounting for fewer than 7% of deaths in Maharashtra. State officials said the situation is under control, but the festive season and further opening up of sectors could lead to a surge if care is not taken.

This was revealed when the team members of the second probe stumbled upon the documents of the inquiry conducted earlier. The first inquiry had found two other private hospitals prima facie guilty of overcharging patients and the CMO office was not aware of it. “The report of the first inquiry has been sent to the nodal officer. Legal opinion will be sought on the action that can be taken against the hospital,” said deputy chief medical officer (CMO) and Integrated Covid Command Centre’s (ICCC) complaints redressal officer. Complainants, however, alleged that the entire episode exposed the lackadaisical attitude of the district health authorities. The matter related to the Utrethiya hospital is of a railway employee, Manoj Mishra, whose wife died of Covid-19 while undergoing treatment in May. He lodged a complaint against the hospital alleging overcharging medical negligence. When no visible action took place, Mishra lodged complaints at various platforms, including the chief minister’s office and the chief development officer (CDO). It was only after the CDO sent two reminders, the CMO’s office instituted a probe on September 18 which found that an inquiry had already been done in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/clueless-about-1st-probe-cmo-office-forms-fresh-panel/articleshow/86496626.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Traders oppose closure of markets for REET||JAIPUR: Shopkeepers living outside the Walled City are not happy with the decision to close markets on Sunday due to Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teacher (REET). However, all market associations within the city have voluntarily decided to keep their shutters down on September 26. As majority of the shops in Walled City area are closed on Sundays, they have no objection to the decision. Kundan Lal, a sherwani merchant in the Walled City area said that they do not mind keeping it shut for one more day. “Since it is pitra paksh (Shraddh) these days, most customers are not willing to buy any wedding paraphernalia or new clothes. On Sundays, 80% of the shops are closed, so when the request came from the Jaipur collector to keep the market shut, we agreed. Otherwise there would have been a lot of traffic,” said Kundan Lal. However, the situation is completely different for shopkeepers outside Walled City as majority of the people in Jaipur-Greater get out of their houses on weekends. Arun Kumar (name changed), a toy shop owner in Vaishali Nagar said that on weekends their business doubles as compared to weekdays. Hence, keeping the market shut after pandemic is a difficult decision. Another showroom owner in Mansarovar said that REET should not be the reason to shut down the entire city. “It’s just an exam, why do we have to close the entire city. There are so many who suffered heavy losses during lockdown, now when the time has arrived to revive our business, they want to shut the market,” said a showroom owner on condition of anonymity. Lalit Singh, president of Jaipur Vyapar Mandal said that all the shopkeepers are willing to close shops. “It’s not a compulsion but it is advised to shut the market. We must understand that law and order situation may worsen. Hence keeping the market closed is better,” said Singh. Shopkeepers in support of the shutdown said there have been past incidences when candidates for different exams created ruckus, hence it is advisable to keep it closed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/traders-oppose-closure-of-markets-for-reet/articleshow/86494793.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Neurological disorders found among patients with history of Covid-19||Ranchi: Among the many complications found in patients following their recovery from Covid-19, neurological disorders have been diagnosed in a considerable number of people, according to healthcare experts in Ranchi. Dctors are almost regularly getting patients with a host of such disorders that range from mild cases of fibromyalgia (unexplained body ache) and hyponatremia (sodium deficiency) to serious complications like ischemic stroke (brain stroke) and GB syndrome (when the body’s immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system). The assistant professor of neurology at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), Dr Surendra Kumar, said that instances of brain stroke among patients with a history of Covid-19 have increased considerably after the second wave. “We have noticed that those with ischemic stroke have had a history of severe infection of the SARS Cov-2 virus,” he added. Dr Kumar pointed out that although the number of patients coming to the state-run hospital with such disorders has gone up now, it could have something to do with the curbs on travel being lifted. “Earlier, we were getting fewer patients, particularly when the Covid-induced lockdown and travel restrictions were in place. Perhaps the patients were unable to come to the hospital so the numbers were less but since the restrictions have been lifted now, we are getting more of such patients,” he said. City-based neurologist Dr Ujjwal Roy said, “The problem is cropping up more in those who isolated themselves at home despite being severely infected with the virus. Those who were admitted in ICUs were given anti-coagulants which prevented heart attacks and brain strokes. But those who were in home isolation are now coming to hospitals with complaints of brain stroke. We have also got patients with GB syndrome and brain encephalitis (brain fever).” He added, “Besides the severe neurological disorders, we are also getting mild cases of fibromyalgia, headache, myopathy (tingling sensation on fingertips) and sodium deficiency. Unexplained body ache and complications related to sudden drop in vitamin B-12 or sodium levels have prompted patients to seek medical help. By undergoing simple tests and identifying the underlying cause, these conditions can be treated.” Dr Roy explained that most of these complications are related to the body’s immunogenic response to the virus. “Even patients with mild symptoms of Covid-19 were diagnosed with cytokine storm and the body’s response to it has damaged various organs, including the brain,” he said. A few doctors at Rims have also observed an increase in instances of quadriparesis (temporary or permanent weakness in all four limbs), Bell’s palsy (paralysis of facial muscle due to sudden damage to facial nerve and transverse myelitis), inflammation and damage of the spinal cord. Dr Kumar said that while some of the conditions could have been triggered by the infection, few could be related to the overuse of drugs and medications recommended by semi-qualified people. “During the second wave of Covid-19, people were scared and had gone to semi-qualified people or quacks for treatment and they prescribed medicines that could have caused the damage,” Dr Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/neurological-disorders-found-among-patients-with-history-of-covid-19/articleshow/86494674.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The membership drive aims at making five lakh members and the campaign will start on September 25 which also happens to be the 105th birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya. Addressing media persons here on Friday, BJM president Dharmendra Tiwari said: “Under the guidance of our leader and convenor of BJM Saryu Rai-Ji we will launch a membership drive from September 25. We have set a target of adding five lakh new members from various walks of life and the drive will conclude on December 31.” On being asked who will be supervising the membership drive and who are they targeting as members, Tiwari said: “Our vice president Ram Narayan Sharma, general secretary Sanjiv Acharya and secretary (organization) Rakesh Pandey have been given the responsibility to co-ordinate the membership drive across the state in co-ordination with the district leaders. We are not going for any specific set of people but people from all walks of life are welcome to join who want to fight corruption, want to work for the state and want to contribute towards the development of Jharkhand. They can be environmentalists, doctors and social workers, among others.” He added that they will unveil the official flag of the party on September 25 after celebrating the birth anniversary of Deendayal Upadhyaya. “We have instructed all our district units to organise a program in the remembrance of the Jan Sangh leader and unveil the party’s flag in their respective districts,” he said.

While opposition BJP refused to join, its ally, Ajsu-P, has agreed to be part of the all-party delegation. Talking to TOI over the phone from New Delhi, state rural development and parliamentary affairs minister Alamgir Alam, who is also a Congress MLA, said, “The CM will meet the Union home minister at 4 pm on Sunday and press for the demands. Representatives from JMM, Congress, RJD, CPI, CPI (M), CPI-ML, MCC and Ajsu-P will be a part of the delegation.” The meeting will take place days after the Centre submitted before the Supreme Court that collecting data on backward class citizens in the upcoming population was administratively complex and extremely difficult. Reacting to the the Centre’s response to the apex court, state Congress president, Rajesh Thakur, said, “So what if the Centre had filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court? The Supreme Court is yet to deliver its judgment on the matter and this leaves with the room to press for our demands. Besides, the Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha has also passed a resolution in this regard.” JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said even though the Centre filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court, the delegation will meet Shah in a bid to exert pressure to take up the census. “If the caste-based census is not taken up, we will get into a huddle and decide our future course of action,” Bhattacharya said, stressing that the state government might take up an exercise that will be similar to a caste-based census. Meanwhile, NDA ally, Ajsu-Party, it will join Soren’s delegation on Sunday. Party president Sudesh Mahto said, “We are drawing our strength from the separate statehood movement, which was repeatedly turned down by the Centre before it finally gave in 200. We had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a caste census and we will continue to strive for it. Besides, the Sarna code is an important issue and we will raise our voice for it,” Ajsu-P chief spokesperson Devsharan Bhagat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/unfazed-by-centres-stand-on-caste-census-hemant-to-lead-delegation-to-meet-shah/articleshow/86495271.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The attendance on the first day was around 30 per cent in Ranchi even as girls’ participation was more than the boys in several schools. Principal of Bariyatu Girls’ High School, Rita Kumari said, “Around 30 per cent students attended classes on the first day. Several of them did not have their parents’ consent, but I allowed them to attend classes after taking assurance from their family members over phone. We have divided each class into several sections to maintain social distancing.” Principal of Government’s district school, Deepa Choudary also said that attendance was around 30 per cent in her school. The government middle school Pandra, however, had an encouraging turnout with 385 out of 600 students attending the classes. The school principal, Asok Prasad Singh, said, “Around 60 per cent of the students were girls. There was a general excitement among them to attend school and wanted that duration of the classes be increased.” The number of girls was also more than the boys in Chhotanagpur school in Tharpakna. Education secretary Rajesh Kumar Sharma said, “Though the attendance on the first day was low, it is likely to pick up in the coming days. We hope more students opt for offline classes rather than online.” The school education and literacy department has issued detailed guidelines for ensuring Covid-19 norms inside the school premises. The schools have been asked to ensure thermal scanning of students before allowing them inside the campus. Moreover, the school administration has to make sure that students wear masks, maintain social distancing and also wash their hands.

CMRI’s officials said the proposal was floated with a view to facilitate the patients with knee complaints from the city in their hometown. “We are open to the idea of entering into some kind of an understanding with TMH to help the patients of Jamshedpur and surrounding towns avail a good treatment as far as robotic surgery for the knee joint replacement is concerned,” CMRI’s director and the head of department of orthopaedics, Dr Rakesh Rajput, said. He added that he will visit TMH once every month to offer consultancy to the patients at SAI Centre in Bhalubasa. “Due to the pandemic, many patients with knee ailments did not visit doctors for diagnosis and treatment. So we thought of reaching out to them,” Rajput said. “Due to the increasing use of the robotic-driven surgery in knee joint replacement, the longevity of the replaced knees has increased to 30 years,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cmri-keen-to-tie-up-tmh-for-robotic-knee-replacement-surgeries/articleshow/86495014.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The BDO had demanded a total sum of Rs 90,000 for his approval. The beneficiaries, however, were unwilling to pay and informed the ACB about it. During verification, the ACB found the allegations to be true and laid a trap to arrest the officer. Earlier on August 18, assistant engineer (AE) Varun Kumar Ranjan was nabbed by the ACB sleuths while taking a bribe of Rs 30,000. The engineer who was posted in Bharno block of Gumla district had demanded the bribe for signing on a measurement book related to a well constructed under MNREGA scheme. Sources said as many as 34 government employees have been arrested by the ACB till August this year and a sizeable number of them are officers, including BDO, AEs and sub-inspectors of police. These government employees sought bribes for a wide range of legal and illegal works, including issuance of certificate for claiming insurance, land transaction, submission of favorable report in the court, safety from issuance of warrant in criminal cases and non registration of cases in police stations. ACB SP Kumar Ravi Shankar said, “We are getting increasing number of complaints against higher-ranked officials for the past several months. Earlier, people were apprehensive whether ACB would take action against them or not. Upon receiving complaints, we verify the information according to a standard operating procedure before laying the trap.” He said ACB has often interacted with people through various means and urged them to file complaints against corrupt government employees, including senior officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/acb-nabs-34-govt-employees-this-year-for-taking-bribes/articleshow/86495519.cms||---

The SC set aside the order of a trial court and high court which had refused to allow a plea of an owner for not proceeding on a suit filed by a caretaker seeking that he be not vacated from the premises. The trial judge had dismissed the application on the premise that these are the subject matter of disputes which can be examined only after the written statement being filed at the behest of the owner and is not within the scope of Order VII Rule 11, Civil Procedure Code and that order was confirmed by the high court. Order 7 Rule 11(d) of CPC provides that the plaint shall be rejected “where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law”. Setting aside the order, a bench headed by Justice Ajay Rastogi said, “...the trial court has committed a manifest error in appreciating the pleadings on record from the plaint filed at the instance of respondent No. 1-plaintiff who as a caretaker/servant can never acquire interest in the property irrespective of his long possession and the caretaker/servant has to give possession forthwith on demand and so far as the plea of adverse possession is concerned...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/caretaker-has-no-claim-on-a-property-supreme-court/articleshow/86498512.cms||---

On Friday, Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro’s close aides came out in open dissent against the state’s Congress leadership, accusing them of inducting new members who do not share the party’s ideology. Party general secretary Vijai Pai and secretary Mario Pinto said that senior MLAs such as Faleiro, Pratapsingh Rane and Ravi Naik have been sidelined and Congress supporters who have been members for 20 to 30 years have been left out of the decision-making process. Their outburst came just a day after two other Faleiro loyalists, former MLA Agnel Fernandes and general secretary Yatish Naik, voiced similar complaints. Though Congress functionaries refused to take names, their grievance seemed clearly against state party president Girish Chodankar and opposition leader Digambar Kamat. “I have been in Congress for 28 years, but today for the first time, I don’t see direction in the party. Those who don’t win elections get the big posts and those who win are sidelined,” Pai said. Chodankar contested and lost the Panaji bypolls in 2017 and the 2019 Lok Sabha election in North Goa. Under his watch, Congress had a dismal outing in the zilla panchayat elections too. Though Chodankar has the backing of Rahul Gandhi and Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao, some senior functionaries, especially MLAs, are not happy with him. “It pains me to see that our party, which had good prospects, is sliding down. The party should take Rane and Faleiro into confidence. In Cumbarjua, there are so many who have joined and all of them are saying that they are the candidate. The senior leaders have been sidelined at the local level,” Pinto said. When asked if they would leave Congress, the duo said the “question does not arise.” “I am a loyal Congressman,” Pai said. The two said that they have no problem with the party inducting new members. “We have no problem with young faces joining Congress, but they must work for the party for at least five years and accept the party ideology,” Pinto, a ticket aspirant for Cumbarjua seat, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/older-party-members-being-sidelined-say-luizinho-loyalists/articleshow/86495504.cms||---

Traffic cops deployed at Zero Mile Square and Variety Square admitted that long queues of vehicles are being witnessed at both the junctions. On Friday, TOI visited Morris College T-point and found that the time of traffic signals at this square has been increased by 10 seconds from the existing 96 seconds. This has led to an increase in the waiting period for vehicles coming from three directions — Samvidhan Chowk, Loha Pul and Variety Square. Long queues of vehicles were spotted on the patch between Zero Mile Square and Morris College T-point. Already, the decision of the traffic police to shut the Meetha Neem Durgah Road had increased congestion on the patch between Zero Mile and Samvidhan Square. This new road has added to the woes was the general reaction of motorists. Though very few motorists were found using the new road, still motorists using the patch between Zero Mile and Variety Square did not stop their vehicles even after the signal turned green for vehicles coming from Institute of Science side. “Despite red signals for the motorists from either side of Wardha Road at Morris College square, I had to wait for my turn to cross the junction for at least 15 minutes,” claimed Rohit Meshram, a two-wheeler rider. Motorists pointed out that at least for a few initial days, traffic policemen should be deployed at this junction to man the vehicular movement. “Unless they are deployed, nothing will change here,” pointed out Meshram. TOI also observed that the 600-odd metre road only has a divider constructed outside the Freedom Park Metro station where the 18-metre width patch gets narrower. As a result, motorists coming from Institute of Science wait at the extreme right side of the road. This blocks the free movement of vehicles coming from three roads heading towards this new DP road. According to traffic experts, if the vehicular traffic at this junction is managed properly, congestion between Variety Square and Maharajbagh Square will reduce drastically. DCP (traffic) Sarang Awad said his department is conducting a study of the vehicular traffic criss-crossing this square. “If needed, suggestions will be given to the NMC’s traffic department,” he said. STRETCH OF WORRY * Circle of signals increased by 10s secs * Long queues of vehicles * Non adherence of red lights led to chaos * Motorists demand deployment of traffic cops * Small divider near Freedom Park metro station adds to confusion||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/new-dp-road-adds-to-chaos-on-wardha-road/articleshow/86493234.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

On Friday, Kotwali police arrested the rape survivor’s aunt, who was instrumental in selling off the baby. Police have slapped charges of human trafficking on the aunt and her accomplices. The cops also ensured treatment of the baby, who was unwell after passing through several hands in the last few days after being sold earlier this week. The rape survivor was exploited by a 16-year-old neighbour after which she had became pregnant earlier this year. In May, an offence was registered against the neighbour at Kotwali police station. City police chief Amitesh Kumar, who had been monitoring the case along with Zonal DCP Lohit Matani and Addl CP Navinchadra Reddy, said he would ensure the baby-selling racket was unearthed. The mother-daughter duo was produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) on Friday, which sent them to a government shelter home. Sources said the underage mother had been striving hard to retain the baby and wanted to bring her up. District child protection officer Mushtak Pathan said a comprehensive individual care plan would be prepared for the rehabilitation of the mother and the child. “The plan would be based upon the girl’s preferences and choices of skill which can be nurtured and developed within her,” he said, adding the WCD department would ensure the minor is rehabilitated. Senior inspector Mukund Thakre of Kotwali police station said the minor girl’s aunt would be produced before the court on Saturday. “Police will try to recover the cash Rs90,000 from the aunt and nab the other racketeers involved in the chain of procuring babies through illegal means,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/individual-care-plan-to-rehabilitate-rape-survivor-her-baby/articleshow/86493264.cms||Soumitra Bose

Pacheco, however, didn’t name any politician. “Those who are leaving the party have managed to lead a life of comfort and luxury all these years only because of Congress. The party made them chief ministers, ministers, etc, but they couldn’t do anything for the party’s upliftment. It is precisely because of people like these that Congress has been reduced to such a sorry state,” Pacheco said while speaking to reporters. To a query whether the exit of veterans wouldn’t harm the party’s prospects in the 2022 polls, Pacheco replied in the negative. “Instead of staying with the party and working to inflict damage upon it, it’s better that they leave the party,” he said. Pacheco said TMC’s entry into Goa for the 2022 assembly elections would make no difference to Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/exit-of-cong-seniors-will-benefit-party-pacheco/articleshow/86495581.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The petroleum product has a good demand in the market. The plan came to light after the factory’s administrator Chintamani B Perni requested Deccan Sugar Technologists Association (India), Pune to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for production of ethanol. Perni said that sugar is no longer profitable as there are many producers. On the contrary, ethanol has a huge demand.. “Since there is a 12% deficit in ethanol supply, it would see good demand. It would also enable petroleum companies to get ethanol within the state, which in turn would help reduce fuel cost,” Perni said. The factory is planning to have a 40 KLD ethanol production unit. “We are planning to use local cane for the initial three months from October to December, then cane from Karnataka for the next three months from January to March and molasses for the following three months from April to June, to produce the ethanol,” Perni said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sanjivani-sugar-factory-eyes-ethanol-production/articleshow/86493612.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

The government issued orders asking employees to make own arrangements from November 1. The free accommodation is provided to the employees by the state government since 2016, when the capital was shifted to Amaravati from Hyderabad. The state government had hired several two bedroom and three bedroom flats in Vijayawada-Guntur area as a gesture for moving out of Hyderabad, where most of them had own accommodation or government accommodation. The employees of the state secretariat, heads of departments (HoDs), Raj Bhavan and the high court are provided free accommodation. Most of these staff are currently residing in the flats at Eco Space Residential Complex and Tadanki Ventures in Vijayawada, Tanmayi Residency and Srirama Arcade in Unadavalli, Chillapalli Luxury Apartments and Emarald Park in Navuluru, Skylark Towers and Siva Green Valley in Guntur and Rain Tree Park in Pedakakani. The state government pays Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 per month for each flat, besides paying electricity bills, maintenance charges, drinking water cost and cable TV charges every month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/free-accommodation-for-govt-employees-scrapped/articleshow/86491735.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh HC pulls up police top brass over illegal detentions||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Friday pulled up police officials for repeated cases of illegal detention coming before the court through habeas corpus petitions. The high court observed that it has noticed that in many cases, police are recording the arrest and producing the accused before the magistrate concerned, only after filing of habeas corpus petitions. The high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice J Uma Devi directed the director-general of police (DGP) to take necessary steps to ensure that this kind of incident did not happen henceforth. The high court had earlier directed the DGP to conduct an inquiry under the supervision of ADG, law and order, over the allegations levelled in a habeas corpus petition moved by one Shaik Akthar Roshan. She alleged that her husband, Kancharla Naveen Babu, along with Vasumilli Ashok, was detained illegally by Kothapeta police station in East Godavari district on the night of August 30. She alleged that her husband was subjected to torture, using third degree methods, without producing him before the magistrate. Following the directions of the high court, law and order ADG, Ravishankar Ayyannar submitted a report to the court in which he also mentioned about the action taken against the officer concerned. The high court observed that it is a disturbing pattern wherein many instances of police recording the arrest only after habeas corpus petitions are filed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-hc-pulls-up-police-top-brass-over-illegal-detentions/articleshow/86491733.cms||---

Devendra Biradar and Karthik Narale, studying in Class 10 at the Government High School, has achieved this feat. The department of science and technology (DST), Government of India, has instituted the Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (Inspire) scheme. This is one of the flagship programmes of the department. The Inspire Awards — MANAK (Million Minds Augmenting National Aspirations and Knowledge), being executed by DST with National Innovation Foundation – India (NIF), aims to motivate students in the age group of 10-15 years. For the national award, 60 science models were selected of which five models from Karnataka had made it to the final round. The models prepared by students of Bidar, Davanagere, Ramnagar and Bengaluru rural districts are among the five from Karnatak which have won the award. It was science teacher Shashikala Badiger along with her dedicated colleagues who encouraged the students to prepare the models. Bheema Salaga is a multi-task performing machinery. It can be used for tilling the land, removing weeds, sowing seeds, spraying of water and pesticide, harvesting, grass cutting and pruning the plants among other such works. Shashikala told TOI that the students had registered for the competition in 2019-2020 but due to the lockdown, the project could be completed this year. “We were always thinking of doing something which could help solve the problems faced by the farmers. There are several modern farm machines being used in agriculture but they are all attached to a tractor which is an expensive proposition. We had thought of a multi-task machine and came up with ‘Bheema Salaga’. The two students were experts in collecting the spares required for the machine and assembling them. They have used broken desks, cycle chain, cycle wheels and other waste materials for the machine,” Shashikala said. Additional commissioner of public instruction Siddalingayya Hiremath congratulated the teacher and students for winning the award and said their achievement is an inspiration to other students and teachers.

GIDC chairman Glenn Ticlo said that he would approach chief minister Pramod Sawant and ask the state to decide whether to ask for an extension or to let go of the coal block. The Union coal ministry had granted GIDC a “final” deadline of September 30 to appoint a mine developer and operator (MDO) and commence extraction of coal, and to pay the Rs 163.95 crore performance guarantee. “We have not received any bidders. The one bidder that came forward was not very responsive as per the guidelines. We are going to send it to the government for further action,” said Ticlo after the 376th board meeting. The Dongri Tal-II coal block has been allotted by the Union ministry of coal for commercial mining to GIDC, and as per the terms of the allotment agreement, which was signed in October 2019, at least 25% of the coal extracted in a financial year has to be sold to the MSME sectors in Madhya Pradesh and balance to other buyers across India. The coal mine could have brought significant revenue to GIDC, which values the block at Rs 1,544 crore. This would be the second time that Goa’s ambitious plan to mine and sell coal has hit a dead-end. Though the Dongri Tal-ll coal block was allocated to GIDC in September 2019, major milestones for the coal mine were missed as the state government dragged its feet in complying with norms laid down by the coal ministry, said sources. “The extension depends on the government. The government will take a call and then write to the central ministry and probably they may accept the request,” said Ticlo. The Dongri-Tal II coal mine, at Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh, has a 2.9 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) capacity, but the state’s attempts to exploit the coal mine have been thwarted by “political tussles” between industries minister Vishwajit Rane and chief minister Pramod Sawant, sources said. The GIDC board also accepted the revised layout plans for certain industrial estates and corrections in plot plans under Section 37B of the GIDC Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gidc-puts-coal-block-in-govts-court-wants-sawant-to-ask-for-extension/articleshow/86493700.cms||---
---||Goa||GFP offers to bear auditorium rent charged to tiatrists||Margao: A month after he pledged his support to theatre artistes whose livelihoods have been hit by the Covid pandemic, Goa Forward Party (GFP) president Vijai Sardesai on Friday offered to bear the expenses of the rent of the auditoriums to the extent of Rs 10,000 per show for a maximum of three shows per director of a tiatr or a play. He made this announcement at a press briefing held in the presence of veteran tiatrist Prince Jacob who approached Sardesai with this proposal. “The most affected category of people during the pandemic were tiatrists. Tiatrists have generated many jobs for Goans. It was the duty of the government to provide some relief to them during their times of distress,” Jacob said. Sardesai said that tiatr was a part of Goa’s cultural heritage and that the financial assistance offered by him to directors of tiatr/play was aimed at protecting this cultural heritage which he said was Goa’s identity. Ravindra Bhavan Margao has opened its auditorium for staging tiatrs and plays at 50% capacity of its auditorium from September 1. “While reopening Ravindra Bhavan for staging tiatrs at 50% capacity, the rent of auditorium should have been waived off as theatre artistes have lost their livelihoods on account of the pandemic,” Sardesai said. Stating that he had demanded a stimulus package for theatre artistes, Sardesai criticised the government for treating tiatrists as a “laymen” in so far as the Covid relief scheme was concerned under which Covid-affected persons are eligible for a one-time grant of Rs 5,000. “A tiatr director employs 40-50 people and therefore he shouldn’t be treated as a layman,” Sardesai said. The Fatorda MLA had earlier advocated the need for a change in art and culture policy of the state, and stressed on the need to include performing arts in the academic curriculum with a view to conserving Goa’s rich cultural heritage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-offers-to-bear-auditorium-rent-charged-to-tiatrists/articleshow/86495890.cms||---

The area would roughly be twice the total area of Goa and just a little less than that of Sikkim. The total area encroached upon includes 3,172 sq km of forest land. There are also large tracts of land belonging to Vaishnavite satras and ancient temples that have been encroached upon. Thursday’s clash in Darrang district, which led to police firing in which two civilians were killed, took place when cops were trying to free from encroachers over 7,000 bighas (just a little over 9 sq km) of government land. On Monday, the police had cleared about 4,000 bighas of land nearby without any untoward incident. The numbers presented in the assembly formed the basis of BJP’s 2021 poll promise to remove encroachers. The previous BJP government carried out drives to evict squatters from Kaziranga National Park and from land belonging to Batadraba Than, the birthplace of Srimanta Sankardeva, a 15th-16th century CE polymath. Encroachment of land belonging to government and religious places, mostly by Bangladesh-origin Bengali-speaking Muslim migrants, is seen as a threat to the identity of Assam’s indigenous people. In 2016, the government had set up a panel headed by former Chief Election Commissioner HS Brahma to suggest modifications in laws and policy “for ensuring protection of land rights of indigenous people.” The panel’s report said, “...day in and day out, new areas are encroached upon by thousands of illegal Bangladeshis. Organised swarms of land-grabbing suspected Bangladeshis... equipped with construction materials and arms descend on vacant char areas (riverine islands) to establish illegal villages overnight and efforts of indigenous people to resist such organised invasions are meet with counter-resistance and armed attacks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/twice-the-area-of-goa-under-encroachment-in-assam/articleshow/86498587.cms||Prabin Kalita
