The high court disposed of pleas by schools contesting the government’s diktat ordering a 30% tuition fee cut, by pointing out that the Supreme Court had settled the issue in a petition filed by unaided schools in Rajasthan. In that case, the SC had ordered schools not to charge more than 85% of fees collected in 2019-20 for the academic year 2020-21. D Shashi Kumar, secretary, Association of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka said: “When the government told us to reduce 30% of tuition fee and not charge any other fees, it worked out to a cut of almost 45%-50% of total fees. For many of us, it created a major crisis. The HC order is a welcome one. Many schools have already waived more than 30% fees. If parents are in a financial crisis, they can approach school managements for a waiver.” Recognised Unaided Private Schools Association, another group of private schools, also welcomed the HC’s order. Lokesh T, president of the association, said: “We welcome the HC move. Last year, in rural Karnataka, several parents were awaiting a government order to pay fees. We request the government to find a permanent solution to this problem.” He said schools affiliated to the association are willing to waive fees this year too. “We gave a 30% concession last year and we will continue with it this year as well,” Lokesh said. However, parents were an unhappy lot. Ganesh Poojary, member of Voice of Parents-Karnataka, said: “I can react only after reading the judgement copy. The Karnataka government had ordered schools not to collect anything other than tuition fee and to reduce it by 30%. Now it depends on what the HC order says. If they have kept the Karnataka government order in mind and reduced that 30% to a lower figure, it may not help us, but we are ready to accept it. But if the order says the reduction is on the overall fees [all other heads besides tuition fees], it is unacceptable.” Many parents said the reduction is meagre and only symbolic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/school-fee-high-court-disposes-ofpleas-by-mgmts/articleshow/86273652.cms||---
---||India||Mumbai: Health workers and politicians take to booster Covid dose||MUMBAI: A few dozen healthcare workers, some politicians and their staff have taken a third dose of Covid-19 vaccine at various city hospitals over the past few weeks, either without registration on CoWin or by using a different phone number, TOI has learnt. Third dose is not yet approved in India, with the Centre on Thursday saying that it’s not a priority at the moment. Many are believed to have got antibody levels screened before taking it. A senior physician told TOI, “The list includes doctors, mainly who finished taking both their doses by February and found depletion in their antibody levels on checking”. A young politician, her spouse and staff members too are learnt to have taken the booster jab. Leftover doses given as booster jab to health staff and politiciansA booster shot though offered in several western nations, remains a hotly debated subject and is yet to be approved in India. However, healthcare workers have taken the third shot at various hospitals in Mumbai, multiple sources confirmed to TOI. Covishield has been the choice for the booster dose, said a hospital source, adding that in some cases an eleventh dose has been drawn from the vaccine vial for the purpose. Another hospital head said in other cases, the third dose is drawn from a vial which may have a few doses left but doesn’t have takers at the end of the day’s immunisation drive. “Healthcare workers have seen breakthrough infections among colleagues and are worried about emerging variants,” he said. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), however, called it misguided enthusiasm, saying a third dose could lead to massive life-threatening reactions in some cases. “Let us be scientific and not be driven by emotions,” he said. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “There is a possibility that the extra dose in each vial is being used for this. If one is using that extra dose, there is no need for any registration. But my question to those who are taking it is how do they know it’s useful at all,” he said, adding that the corporation has not received any complaint or intimation about the matter. Globally, several nations have rolled out a third dose, primarily for the elderly, immunocompromised and a few for health workers. NHS staffers in the UK started getting booster shots on Thursday. The US is likely to roll out third shots from September 20, while Israel has published findings that at least 12 days after the booster dose, rate of confirmed infection was lower in the booster group by a factor of 11.3 and rate of severe illness lower 19.5 times. However, two leading US vaccine scientists have written in Lancet that there is no credible evidence that efficacy of vaccines against severe Covid reduced substantially over time. WHO too has asked wealthy nations to hold on to booster shots as it could worsen global vaccine inequity. Indian Council of Medical research head Dr Balram Bhargava said on Thursday that getting a full vaccination with two doses remains the priority. “Antibody levels alone shouldn’t be measured. One can have cellular immunity, antibody immunity, mucosal immunity and that persists.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mumbai-health-workers-and-politicians-take-to-booster-covid-dose/articleshow/86277831.cms||Sumitra Debroy

He’s also accused of supplying the drug to peddlers in major cities across India by concealing it in shoe soles and smuggling it to New Zealand via post or courier. Central Crime Branch (CCB) police said David Joao Malave, a resident of Chamundi Layout, had two passports — one from Uganda and another from Mozambique. Police learnt about Malave’s secret ‘narco lab’ while investigating a case where drug peddlers were caught in east Bengaluru recently. Cops had found a short video (of about 10 seconds) on a mobile phone belonging to a peddler, which shows Malave informing the former that he manufactured MDMA crystals in Bengaluru and was ready to supply. “We questioned the suspect about Malave and were unable to get more information. We zeroed in on Malave using the mobile number he used to send the video to the peddler,” a police source said. A team headed by assistant commissioner KC Gautham and CCB inspector R Virupaksha Swamy rushed to Chamundi Layout and raided Malave’s house. The cops were surprised to find a lab inside a room in the 2BHK house, which Malave had occupied two months ago. He had told the elderly couple that rented out the house that he worked for a private company. Police seized chemicals — acetone, hypophosphorous acid, iodine resublimed 99%, plain acid and sodium hydroxide — Malave used to manufacture synthetic drugs. The seizure also included a measuring cylinder, plastic, heating mantle, flask, face mask, PH measure stick and other equipment used to make the drugs and a pair of shoes. Police have estimated the value of the seized materials at Rs 2 crore and are launching a manhunt for Malave’s close associate involved in manufacturing of drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/narco-lab-used-to-produce-mdma-busted-african-held/articleshow/86278161.cms||---

Medians beneath Namma Metro’s elevated corridors along the Purple and Green lines are often used for dumping waste and debris. As a pilot, BMRCL deployed security guards on CMH Road in Indiranagar. BL Yeshwanth Chavan, BMRCL chief public relations officer, said: “We have been identifying blackspots along Metro corridors. We deployed security guards on CMH Road to educate locals. We’re now working with BBMP to clear garbage from these spots.” BMRCL has also warned of a Rs 500 fine for those dumping garbage on medians. “It’s a collective responsibility to keep our city clean. If they continue to dump garbage, we’ll collect fines from them,” he said. Vasanth Kumar, who stays near CMH Road, said: “Mainly, BBMP is littering this median. Either they should do door-to-door collection or provide bins to dump trash. Many commercial establishments are also dumping garbage here at night. We don’t have any other open space to put waste so we are also dumping it here.” However, a BBMP official said: “This is a common issue on CMH Road towards Ulsoor side as adjoining slum settlements dump waste at night. If night collection of waste can be commenced here with an announcement system, it will have a huge impact.” In 2020, BMRCL signed MoUs with Sparsh Hospital and NGO United Way Bengaluru to beautify medians along both corridors. In fact, BMRCL installed metal barricades along the median of some sections. At present, most medians are filled with garbage and construction debris, especially in areas like Indiranagar, JP Nagar, Ulsoor, Byappanahalli, Yelachenahalli, Peenya and Mysuru Road. While BBMP has been claiming the medians are BMRCL property, the Metro agency used to attribute the poor upkeep to limited resources.  BMRCL had earlier planned to outsource the maintenance of medians to private firms, but the proposal evoked a tepid response after BBMP’s ban on advertisements. Some firms said they are not in a position to take up maintenance without advertising revenue. The maintenance work includes watering and pruning of saplings and cleaning the area. In March 2015, Bangalore Political Action Committee (BPac) filed a complaint with the Lokayukta, submitting 700 photographs of debris and garbage along Metro medians and near stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bmrcl-to-check-waste-dumping-at-medians/articleshow/86278166.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The state assembly on Thursday passed the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage (Amendment) Bill that seeks to make this compulsory for buildings built or to be constructed on an area of 2,325sqft to 10,763sqft. It is required for plots measuring 30x40 to install rain water harvesting plants. However, using harvested water is not a must. Law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy said the amendment is being brought to reduce dependency on Cauvery water or groundwater, contain the flow in stormwater drains and mitigate flooding in Bengaluru city. The amendment also makes it mandatory for buildings standing on an area of more than 10,763sqft to have a dual piping system for the purpose of both usage and groundwater recharging. The buildings on 30X40 sqft sites will also have to provide rainwater harvesting systems. Till now, having rainwater harvesting structure was mandatory for buildings on 40X60ft sites and above, and they were given a choice to use the harvested water either for domestic use or ground water recharge. But the new amendment makes use of harvested rainwater a must.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/assembly-passes-bill-on-mandatory-use-of-harvested-rainwater-in-bluru/articleshow/86278180.cms||---

The confidence, which was dealt a severe blow last year due to the pandemic, is slowly coming back to Bengaluru also because of the strong hiring sentiment and rapidly rising salaries in the technology sector. SBI has announced home loan rates at 6.7% regardless of the loan amount, which could lead to other banks lowering the rates. A research from property consultancy firm Anarock shows that the highest demand is currently in the premium segment, where properties are priced Rs 80 lakh and above. This is primarily the result of homes now doubling as offices and e-learning centres. “Last year, the real estate sector was brought to a near halt due to the lockdown imposed all throughout the country due to the onset of the pandemic. This year looks to be more optimistic with all sectors slowly opening up and picking up with full zest. We have seen 15-17% loan growth over the last year,” said Nand Kishore, chief general manager, SBI Bengaluru. Home loans have been rising as more people decide to buy homes. In cities like Bengaluru , the interest is expected to be more as the tech market is red hot. Kishore Jain, managing director of Jain Heights, said: “Everyone has understood the significance of owning a home during the pandemic. Many are upgrading and looking for larger homes."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/low-interest-rates-boost-home-sales/articleshow/86278182.cms||---

---||World||Explained: Why is France fuming over Australia-UK-US submarine deal?||NEW DELHI: With a growing Chinese influence over Indo-Pacific, the United States, United Kingdom and Australia announced on Wednesday to establish a security partnership for the region, pushing its “traditional ally” Paris aside. Under the AUKUS partnership, Australia will be provided with the technology and capability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines.. However, Biden's decision to form a strategic Indo-Pacific alliance with Australia and Britain has angered France and with a go-it-alone move, they see as a return to the Trump era. Even Australia ditched a multibillion-dollar deal with France for the supply of submarines. France claimed that it was informed only at the last minute that Australia would team up with Washington to secure nuclear-powered subs. Meanwhile, the White House said Thursday that the US officials held high-level talks with Paris before announcing the deal. It is only the second time the US has shared the game-changing technology with another country, after Britain. For France, however, it is the second setback to its defence exports in three months after Switzerland spurned Dassault's Rafale to buy US-made Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters. France lambasts Australia, US after 'stab in back'France accused US President Joe Biden of stabbing it in the back and acting like his predecessor Donald Trump. "This brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision reminds me a lot of what Mr Trump used to do," foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told franceinfo radio. "I am angry and bitter. This isn't done between allies." It is to be noted that French relations with the United States had soured during the presidency of Trump who often demanded from European allies they increase their defence spending to help NATO, while reaching out to adversaries like Russia and North Korea. Diplomats say there have been concerns in recent months that Biden is not being forthright with his European allies. But the White House maintained that senior administration officials have been in touch with their French counterparts to discuss AUKUS, including before the announcement. An official told AFP they will leave it to the “Australian partners to describe why they sought this new technology". "We cooperate closely with France on shared priorities in the Indo-Pacific and will continue to do so," the official added. The French embassy spokesman denied there had been consultations. "We had not been informed before the first news of this deal was published in the American and Australian press, a few hours before Biden's official announcement," the spokesman said. Meanwhile, US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Thursday called France a "vital partner" in Asia. "I want to emphasise that there is no regional divide separating the interests of our Atlantic and Pacific partners," Blinken told reporters. "France, in particular, is a vital partner." What was the France-Australia deal?In 2016, Australia had selected French shipbuilder Naval Group to build a new fleet of 12 submarines worth several billions of dollars to replace its more than two-decades-old Collins submarines. Just two weeks ago, the Australian defence and foreign ministers had reconfirmed the deal to France, and French President Emmanuel Macron lauded decades of future cooperation when hosting Australian Prime Minister Morrison in June. "It's a stab in the back. We created a relationship of trust with Australia and that has been broken," Le Drian said. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, however, said Australia looked forward to continuing to work "closely and positively" with France, adding the country “is a key friend and partner". On the other hand, Australia's defence minister said that the US-backed nuclear submarines were a better choice than France’s. "In the end the decision that we have made is based on what is in the best interest of our national security," defence minister Peter Dutton told a joint news conference in Washington. Daunting questions before FranceNow France faces daunting questions on how to advance its strategic priorities in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. "The decision could prompt a rethink in Paris about strategic partnerships with the anglosphere," said Herve Lemahieu, research director at Australia's Lowy Institute. Since 2018, Macron has been pursuing diplomatic, military and trade ties across the Indo-Pacific, helped by France's territories of New Caledonia and French Polynesia. It has deepened defence relations with Japan and India, with New Delhi recently buying 36 Rafale fighter jets from France. What do experts say?Referring to a French naval defeat in 1805 followed by a long period of British naval supremacy, Bruno Tertrais, deputy director of a Paris-based think tank termed it “a Trafalgar moment”. "This is a clap of thunder and for many in Paris a Trafalgar moment," Tertrais, deputy director of the Foundation of Strategic Research, said on Twitter. He warned it would "complicate the transatlantic cooperation in and about the region” and that “Beijing will benefit". Some analysts also warned France's furious reaction could backfire. "Betrayal is the wrong language and hurts France's position in Australia; it can poison the well," said UK-based defence analyst Francis Tusa, adding France would now be more reliant on selling Rafales to secure its place in the global arms market. Anne Cizel, a specialist in American foreign policy at the Sorbonne University in Paris, termed the row a "minor diplomatic crisis". "The United States is sending a curious message, in that it wants European allies present in the Indo-Pacific, and at the same time it is now the main rival for French submarines sales," she said. Thomas Gomart, director of the French Institute of International Relations, added it confirms that the United States expects its allies to remain docile, and is no longer interested in consultation. Terming it “a very big blow”, Antoine Bondaz at France's Foundation for Strategic Research said it shouldn't stop Macron from imploring European Union allies to realise the importance of ensuring free access to the Indo-Pacific and its key global shipping lanes. Macron has repeatedly said that Europe needs to develop its own defence capabilities to be less reliant on the US. But such a vision will need the strong support of Germany, which faces political uncertainty as Chancellor Angela Merkel exits power in this month's elections. "Paris should look for other partnerships, with Indonesia or South Korea for example," said Bondaz. "Australia, however, remains a key partner in the South Pacific, and you can't change geography." New Australian subs will be banned from New Zealand watersThere was also disquiet in New Zealand whose Prime Minister Jacinta Ardern admitted that she was not consulted by Biden or Morrison on the new pact, saying Australia's new subs will be banned from entering its waters under the country's long-standing "nuclear-free" policy. Australia and New Zealand are locked in the 1951 ANZUS security pact. She, however, said this new group "in no way changes our security and intelligence ties with these three countries, as well as Canada". Leader of the Opposition Judith Collins said the trio of countries forming a partnership without New Zealand "is concerning". "It's disappointing that after many years of New Zealand's co-operation with our traditional allies, the current government has not been able to participate in discussions for AUKUS. It raises serious concerns about the interoperability of New Zealand's defence systems with our traditional allies in the future.” (With agency inputs)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/explained-why-is-france-fuming-over-uk-us-australia-submarine-deal/articleshow/86278226.cms||---

---||Delhi||Critics of Cental Vista spreading falsehoods: PM Narendra Modi||New Delhi: With the Central Vista project kicking into high gear following the inauguration of two office buildings to accommodate 7,000 defence personnel currently having to operate from British era hutments, PM Modi took on the critics of the project for spreading “falsehoods” about the ambitious redevelopment scheme, reports Dipak Dash.  I want to point out that those who had been after the Central Vista project have cleverly maintained silence on these two office building works meant for 7,000 defence personnel. This is because they knew their intent to create confusion, falsehood will be exposed, if all this came out,” said the PM, breaking the silence he had maintained over the Central Vista project even as an intense battle was fought over it inside the courts and in the wider public arena. He said that the completion of the two buildings mark a big step towards construction of a modern defence enclave in the capital, and reflected the priority that his government has always placed on the “honour” of the armed forces. Designed by the architects of central public works department (CPWD) and executed by its engineers, the two state-of-the-art buildings that have come up at Africa Avenue and KG Marg in the national capital, are equipped with modern amenities to meet the requirements of the personnel. They have been built in a record 12 months time by using new technologies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised the land occupied by the two buildings account for one-fifth of the area on which the hutments and barracks were built. He said it was unacceptable that defence personnel dealing had to work from barracks and hutments which the Britishers built factoring in their need to have stables for their horses. Modi said soon after taking charge of the prime ministership in 2014, he felt the need for better facilities for MPs in Parliament and to improve government offices. But he decided to first take up the task of building a National War Memorial for defence personnel who sacrificed their lives for the country. “We begun work in 2014, which should have started soon after independence. After completing that task, we have take up the task of Central Vista development for improving our offices and work efficiency,” the PM added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pm-critics-of-c-vista-spreading-falsehoods/articleshow/86278351.cms||Dipak K Dash

But sources said there could be a time overrun of a couple of months. Earlier, the NHAI had set November 2021 as the deadline, but this had to be extended due to Covid second wave. Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday reviewed the projects and carried out an aerial survey across Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. He directed NHAI to expedite work and meet deadlines to bring relief to commuters and cargo carriers.  The under-construction Delhi-Mumbai expressway passes through Dausa, which is 60km from Jaipur. The NH-21 connects Dausa with Jaipur. “The total distance from Dhaula Kuan to Jaipur via Sohna and Dausa is around 270km and the distance is almost same if one travels by NH-8 (the current Delhi-Jaipur highway). But since the expressway is meant for only high-speed vehicles and one can travel at a maximum permitted speed of 120kmph, the travel time to Jaipur will reduce to three hours. So, commuters can save more than an hour using the expressway,” said an NHAI official. On Thursday, Gadkari rode a car, which carried out a test drive at 120km on the Mumbai expressway in Ratlam stretch. “He checked the riding quality,” said an official accompanying the minister on the two-day review of the project. Earlier in the day, the minister reiterated that the greenfield expressway, which will finally connect the DND flyway in Delhi with JNPT in Mumbai in 2023, will cut travel time by half. He said while cars can cover this stretch in 12-13 hours while for heavy vehicles, the total travel time would be 18-20 hours. “Now a truck takes 48 hours to reach Mumbai from Delhi. Just consider the fuel and time savings that the truck operators and goods carriers will have because of the expressway,” Gadkari said. The minister said expressway would have helipads for immediate evacuation of road crash victims and also for operation of drones. The NHAI claimed that this would be one of the fastest built expressways in the world. “The 8-lane expressway can be expanded to 12 lanes to meet future requirements. We have left enough space in the median, which can be used for laying four more lanes,” said NHAI member Manoj Kumar. The new expressway is expected to generate annual fuel savings of more than 320 million litres as well as reduce CO2 emissions by 850 million kg, according to the NHAI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/by-next-june-drive-delhi-jaipur-in-3-hrs/articleshow/86278354.cms||Dipak K Dash

Dr Sanath Kumar, 30, who works with a private hospital, tested positive for Covid on May 7 and was shifted to ICU after his condition started gradually worsening. Dr Sanath Kumar was admitted to Aster CMI Hospital on May 28 and was put on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a life-support machine, before he underwent a double-lung transplant on June 22. He was discharged on September 7. Sanath’s wife Manjula MJ, also a doctor, said he had not taken Covid jab as he had sinusitis and suffered from allergies. Sanath is currently on oxygen support and undergoing physiotherapy sessions. “When I tested positive and started taking medicines, I thought I’d recover soon. I never imagined I’d end up with a double-lung transplant,” he added. This is said to be the first post-Covid double-lung transplant in Karnataka. Doctors conducted the procedure along with Dr Sandeep Attawar, chair and director, thoracic organ transplants and assist devices at KIMS heart and lung transplant institute. He came from Hyderabad for the procedure. “Sanath was under observation for 3-4 weeks for any signs of improvement in his lungs. Since his lungs were severely damaged, he needed a double-lung transplant for survival,” Dr V Arun, lead consultant (anaesthesia and critical care), Aster CMI Hospital, said. Within four weeks of registering with Jeevasarthakate (the organ transplant and tissues organisation in Karnataka), the lungs of a braindead cadaver donor were found to match with those of Sanath. Attawar said the surgery was “gruelling” since Sanath suffered from a life-threatening combination of lung damage caused by SARS-CoV2, an exaggerated immune response to it, and the body’s failure to properly repair the injury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/double-lung-op-gives-covid-hit-doctor-new-life/articleshow/86278612.cms||---

An IPS officer of the 1990 batch, Rao became the 35th Bengaluru police commissioner on August 2, 2019 and held the position till July 31, 2020. Presently the additional director general of police (ADGP), railways, he still has three years of service left. Rao said he felt the government sidelined him, making it difficult for him to continue in the service. “My conscience doesn’t permit me to continue the service in such conditions. When my services are not considered in the way they should have been, I will be a burden to the government. Hence, I made the decision to call it a day,” he said. Asked if he would join politics, Rao said: “I don’t have any such plans as of now. But I am a firm believer of the saying that God has his own plans for each individual in his own way.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/former-top-cop-bhaskar-rao-opts-for-vrs/articleshow/86278614.cms||---

All four variants, including the deadly D2, are in circulation in different parts of Karnataka but there have been no deaths so far. In 2021, so far, 2,987 dengue cases have been reported in the state, of which 18% (540 cases) are from Bengaluru alone. Udupi follows Bengaluru, with 293 cases, trailed by Kalaburagi (280), Shivamogga (226) and Dakshina Kannada district (190). Of the cases reported in September, 150 (over 25%) are from Bengaluru. District-wise mapping of dengue strains shows that predominantly, three variants — D1, D2 and D3 — are prevalent. The D4 variant is being seen in Hassan and Bengaluru. Doc: All 4 strains seen in Karnataka  The D2 variant, which has proven to be fatal in children in Uttar Pradesh, is prevalent here too, but no deaths have been reported, said Dr Ramesh Kavalgod, joint director of the national vector-borne control programme in Karnataka. “The four strains of dengue are seen variedly in different districts of Karnataka. All four are seen in Bengaluru and Hassan. No deaths have been attributed to dengue so far. There is a rising trend, but it is not out of control,” said Kavalgod. However, he said, surveillance for dengue has come down, due to the focus shifting to Covid. In 2020, the state reported 4,093 cases, of which 1,127 were from Bengaluru. Five deaths were also reported — 2 from Dakshina Kannada and one each from Bengaluru Urban (outside BBMP limits), Dharwad and Haveri. This time round, the case count is expected to rise, said authorities. Doctors said mosquito control measures must be reinforced, by civic agencies and in homes, especially due to intermittent rains. Dr Ramana Rao, a Bengaluru physician and cardiologist, said dengue usually rise this time of the year and subside in a couple of months. “Not only dengue, we are also seeing other viral infections. In dengue, the platelet count declines and that needs to be carefully watched and treated,” he said. At the government-run Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (IGICH), a total of 40 children have been treated for dengue in the past two months. “Dengue cases are increasing, but there are no casualties and all are recovering,” said Dr KS Sanjay, director of IGICH. Dengue data no longer in public domainThe state health and family welfare department’s daily data on dengue, which was earlier uploaded on its website, is no longer publicly available as the portal faced glitches in 2020.

---||Delhi||Govt cites ‘lack of options’ for making Rakesh Asthana Delhi top cop||NEW DELHI: Lack of suitable options in the AGMUT cadre of an officer with "appropriate seniority with balanced experience" to head Delhi Police led the Centre to appoint Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana in "public interest", the Delhi high court was informed on Thursday. The "prime consideration" was Delhi was "witnessing diverse and extremely challenging situations of public order, law and order situation and policing issues, which not only had national security implications, but also international/cross border implications". This required an officer "with exposure to complexities of governance and who had the knowledge of nuances of broad canvas policing", the government said. In an affidavit filed through standing counsel Amit Mahajan, the Centre said no fault could be found in the appointment of Asthana as the city police commissioner that had been done in accordance with and after scrupulously following all applicable rules and regulations. The Centre highlighted that the "best attempt of finding a suitable IPS officer having multifarious and diverse experience of policing in a vast state, central investigating agency, national security or paramilitary force" was made in the AGMUT cadre, but "it was found after thorough examination of available options that the experience of handling the police force" was not available. "It was felt that requisite experience of working and supervising the central investigating agency/paramilitary force and police force of a large state having diverse political and law and order problems was lacking in the present pool of available officers," the affidavit added. Invoking "public interest", the Centre said a decision was made to have an officer who had experience in all the above fields to supervise Delhi Police and to provide effective policing on the recent law and order situation that arose in the capital. "Delhi being the capital of our country has its own characteristic factors that do not exist in any other commissionerate. Any incident happening here has far-reaching impact and implications not only throughout the country, but beyond the borders," the affidavit contended. It also differentiated between appointment of state DGPs according to the SC ruling in Prakash Singh case and appointment of the commissioner, adding that "requirement of a certain minimum tenure has no application for appointment of commissioners/police heads of Union Territories." The affidavit contended that the petition by Sadre Alam, a lawyer, challenging the appointment was an "abuse of process of law and manifestly an outcome of some personal vendetta". It submitted that a PIL in service matter couldn't be entertained. It added that the PIL, as well as intervention of NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation in Asthana's appointment, "deserves to be dismissed with exemplary costs".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-cites-lack-of-options-for-making-asthana-delhi-top-cop/articleshow/86278928.cms||Abhinav Garg

The school, built at a cost of Rs 13.5 crore on 10acre sprawling campus with a forest and a lake in the backdrop, is getting ready to admit students. Provision has been made to admit students for classes VI to X, and it is open for children of police personal and the general public from any part of Karnataka. This will be the first police-public school in central Karnataka, said SP C B Ryshyanth. In all, 220 students, including 60 girls, can get admitted here from 2022-23 academic year. According to a senior police officer, the school comes under the jurisdiction of Eastern police range covering Davanagere, Chitradurga, Shivamogga and Haveri districts. “We are happy that a well-equipped building with hostels is coming up in our village,” Devaraj, a local, said, adding: “Former MP Kondajji Basaappa had opened a training centre for Scouts and Guides over five decades ago. It has hosted state-level training programmes pertaining to Scouts and Guides.” Aqua sporting events, including boating competitions, are held at Kondajji Lake, making Kondajji a popular picnic spot in Davanagere district. The presence of Morarji Desai Residential School and Indira Gandhi Residential School in the region has made Kondajji village an educational hub, said Mudegowdappa, another villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/police-public-school-at-davanagere-village/articleshow/86270817.cms||S A GANGARAJU

Only nine centres from India have bagged a place in the WHO directory, with the PIC in RG Kar being the only one attached with a government-run hospital. Other names on the list include AIIMS New Delhi and CMC Vellore. Set up in April, 2018, the centre at RG Kar had to be operational for at least three years before it could get the WHO recognition. It provides toxicological information and advice on treatment of patients who suffer from poisoning.  The unit operates a toll-free 24x7 helpline that guides patients and doctors in case of poisoning, including from snake bites. In fact, doctors attached with the PIC were roped in to help treat five teachers who took poison in front of Bikas Bhawan a few weeks ago. The helpline used to get about 300 calls a month before the pandemic. Though the number dropped drastically during the first and second waves, it has now increased to around 120 calls a month. “The recognition is a matter of great pride. We now have plans of expanding our work, like setting up a real-time poison detection centre and developing an app that would guide the affected to the nearest centre that has anti-venom. Bengal is endemic to snake bites and we hope such an app will help,” said Somnath Das, professor and head of department, forensic medicine and toxicology. According to Das, the poison detection centre has a two-fold advantage — identifying the poison, helping get precise treatment, and being a handy medico-legal point. The PIC, the only one of its kind in eastern India, also has an app that familiarises users with types of poison, including chemicals, vegetables and snakes in our surroundings, and explains what to do if affected by any of it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-poison-info-unit-finds-place-on-who-global-list/articleshow/86273700.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

BJP MP, Ram Kripal Yadav, who had been supporting the project for a long time, called the Centre’s decision “a big gift for the people of Bihar”. “I am grateful to Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and minister of labour and employment, Bhupender Yadav, for strengthening the medical infrastructure of Bihar and easing the burden on the Patna Medical College and Hospital,” he said. Yadav added, “While waiting for the Centre’s nod, all the arrangements for starting a medical college had been made. The academic session will start soon.” The BJP MP also pointed out that people from Patna, Bihta, Ara, and Bhojpur would also be benefited from the medical college and hospital. Health minister, Mangal Pandey, and BJP MLC, Devesh Kumar, also thanked the Union government. Pandey said the medical college would have 100 MBBS seats. He added, “Classrooms, hostels, and other important buildings have been constructed. Only the faculty members have to be appointed and new equipment purchased for the laboratories.” Once made functional, ESIC will be the 18th medical college and hospital in Bihar, including six private ones. During the first and second waves of the pandemic, it was made a dedicated Covid hospital. Another medical college and hospital in Purnia with 100 MBBS seats is in the pipeline. Pandey said, “A team of the National Medical Commission has already inspected the upcoming medical college and hospital. Now, we are waiting for its clearance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihta-esic-hospital-gets-centres-nod-to-start-medical-college/articleshow/86271646.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Business||T+1, high margin beneficial for investors: Sebi||MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi’s move to a shorter settlement cycle (T+1) and imposition of higher margin are both aimed at making the Indian market safer and are in the interest of investors, chairman Ajay Tyagi said on Thursday. He also said that it was easy liquidity and low interest rates that were among the prime reasons for the current bull rally in the stock market. “Early settlement will be good for all market participants. It is in the interest of everyone,” Tyagi said while interacting with the media at an event organised by industry trade body CII. Recently, a brokers’ body and some foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) had raised concerns about implementation of the T+1 settlement cycle that Sebi intends to introduce from 2022. Currently, India follows a T+2 settlement cycle, meaning trades on the bourses are settled in two working days after the day of trade. With T+1 cycle, trades will be settled on the next working day. However, the T+1 cycle will initially be optional in stocks selected by each of the exchanges. Tyagi pointed out that the Indian market moved from T+3 to T+2 in 2003. In the last 18 years, there have been significant technological developments in the banking system, especially payments and settlement systems. Hence, there is a need to crunch the settlement cycle further. Investors have the right to receive what they purchase as fast as possible and a “shorter settlement cycle is something which is desirable to everyone”, he said. Speaking about the market’s move towards stricter margin norms, Tyagi pointed out that FPIs have been trading in the derivatives segment since 1999, where upfront payment of margins are the norms. And while investing in IPOs, foreign funds have to keep their money blocked for seven-eight days. The Sebi chief said that the new margin norms were in everyone’s interest. For the regulator, one of the main reasons for moving towards stricter margin norms was that it wants to ensure an investor’s money should not be used for paying margins for others or for proprietary trading by brokers. Earlier, during his speech at the conference, the Sebi chairman had said that a robust margining system was a must for ensuring a fair, transparent and reliable trading and, in recent months, the regulator had progressively further strengthened the margining provisions. “These improvements have held the trading and clearing system in good stead in the present scenario of tremendous increase in turnover and individual investors’ participation in the market.” Asked about his reaction to RBI’s comments in its annual report that there was a bubble in the Indian stock market, mainly because valuations were going haywire, the Sebi chief indicated that a record amount of liquidity and very low interest rates were the major driving forces for this unabated bull rally globally. “How excess liquidity in the system would be managed by the central banks, including the timing and pace of unwinding? The level of inflation is another factor to watch,” Tyagi said. In India, managing liquidity and the rate of interest are the responsibility of the central bank and not of Sebi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/sensex/t1-high-margin-beneficial-for-investors-sebi/articleshow/86275751.cms||---

They will also use drones over Maa and AJC Bose Road flyovers to keep an eye on kites being flown during the festival. Special raid teams will be deployed across several parts of the city to ensure that the Calcutta high court order banning use of Chinese manja is upheld. There have been 16 accidents and injuries on Maa and AJC Bose Road flyovers related to Chinese manja in the past four months. A special police team will patrol the flyover on Friday when maximum kites are expected to be flown.  All police stations in the Karaya-Beniapukur-Tiljala-Topsia belt have been alerted by Lalbazar to carry out awareness drives and help has been sought from community leaders and NGO workers as well. The plan was finalized after meetings attended by senior officers at Lalbazar on Wednesday and Thursday. Kolkata Police commissioner Somen Mitra asked the local cops and the detective department to help traffic police stop manja-related accidents.  “We will also carry out special raids through the night to ensure there is no sale of such manja. Those on night checks at the various border areas have been asked to see such thread is not being sneaked into the city from Howrah or North 24 Parganas,” said a source. The police top brass also ordered a number of changes in patrolling. “The divisions have been instructed to reorient their deployment of RCP vehicles and PCR vans to cover the remotest corners at night. Cops have been told to play a leading role if anyone approaches for help. All police vehicles on duty have been asked to use sirens while moving from one place to another so that they are audible and visible from a distance. The top brass also asked senior officers of each division to recheck the placement of nakas and include areas which have reported the maximum violations,” said an officer. Divisional commissioners and OCs have also been asked to play a more proactive role in night policing, especially on the main roads. “Vishwakarma Puja immersions will begin from Saturday and we have been asked to be on alert. Night patrols will begin at 10pm and nakas an hour later, when the restrictions begin. Special focus will be on south Kolkata, since Bhowanipore has a high-voltage byelection on September 30 where chief minister Mamata Banerjee is a candidate. On Wednesday night, DC (South) Akash Magharia himself led the naka at Park Street,” an officer said. Between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, 1,310 vehicles were checked and 361 of them prosecuted. The east guard prosecuted 64 motorists, followed by Ultadanga traffic guard with 40 challans and Sealdah traffic guard with 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/drones-on-manja-vigil-for-vishwakarma-puja-those-using-banned-kite-string-face-arrest/articleshow/86273453.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Maths and language worry in Covid year||KOLKATA: More than half the primary school students in Bengal were struggling to cope with their studies amid the year-and-a-half-long disruption caused by the pandemic, revealed a study by Siksha Alochana, a collective of teachers and educationists. But all children were impatient to rejoin school, the common refrain being “when will our schools open? We want to be back to school”. In the survey that covered 7,204 students of classes I to V, 41.7% performed satisfactorily in a maths assessment and one out of four performed very poorly. In first language and environmental science, they did slightly better with 45.9% and 47.8% scoring satisfactorily. The level of learning seems to have taken the worst hit in West Midnapore, where 35.5% students fared poorly, followed by that in Nadia (28.1%) and Purulia (26.9%). Atudents in 13 districts, including Kolkata, were assessed. Kids in E Midnapore, S Dinajpur and Kolkata fared the best with over 50% performing satisfactorily. Jadavpur University Professor Emeritus Sukanta Chaudhuri, who wrote the foreward to the report, had in an earlier essay written: “Each year, some 2.4 crore Indian children enrol in Class I. Barring a small fraction of the privileged, the batches of 2020 and 2021 have effectively not taken the first step towards literacy and numeracy. A large proportion of those enrolled earlier will not have acquired the skills, or forgotten what they acquired. By a ballpark estimate, 8 to 10 crore children in primary school cannot read or count.” The report prepared by primary school teachers, secondary school teachers and senior academics pointed out online teaching or attempts to alternatively reach out to students were inadequate. The report highlighted the financial hardships of the families, pointing out three out of 369 surveyed households had gone in the ‘no-income’ category. The average consumption of cereals have gone down by 14%, pulses by 22%, fish by 33%, meat by 44% and vegetables 24%. Those who conducted the study said the learning gap could be bridged with certain measures. The first task is to prepare the ground for resuming in-person school. Convincing parents to send the kids to school will be a major task. Another proposal is to serve cooked mid-day meals. And finally, teachers have to pay attention to each student individually to know where they lag. The study has suggested an assessment of students through a baseline exercise. Choudhuri warns the problem will not go away once schools reopen. “It can’t be solved within the normal curricular framework. A special programme has to be created and dynamically adjusted to the vagaries of the pandemic,” he said. Researcher and activist Kumar Rana said primary teaching and learning was impossible to sustain online. “Not only the underprivileged but those who have the devices and internet have also lost socio-emotional touch.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/maths-and-language-worry-in-covid-year/articleshow/86275194.cms||---

While Kotak Mahindra Prime will acquire the passenger cars and two-wheelers portfolios, Kotak Mahindra Bank will acquire the commercial vehicles portfolio of Volkswagen Finance. With this acquisition, Kotak will get over 30,000 accounts with a total loan outstanding with Volkswagen Finance of around Rs 1,340 crore. All these acquired loans are classified as ‘standard loans’ according to RBI guidelines, which means they do not include non-performing assets (NPAs). In addition to the ‘standard loans’, Kotak has also acquired the NPA (non-performing assets) portfolio of Volkswagen Finance. D Kannan, group president (commercial banking) at Kotak Mahindra Bank & director of Kotak Mahindra Prime, said, “The strategic intent behind this acquisition is to further strengthen Kotak’s vehicle financing loan portfolio and expand our market share.” Volkswagen Finance has been operating in the country since 2009. Volkswagen Finance MD & CEO Aashish Deshpande said, “The sale of our retail portfolio aligns with our new strategic focus towards a refined digital strategy through our subsidiary, the digital platform Kuwy. It is a step towards the evolution of the customer journey in the digital space by offering a simplified and agile solution to both our customers and dealerships, while aligning effectively to support the VW India 2.0 strategy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kotak-group-cos-to-buy-vws-entire-finance-portfolio/articleshow/86275927.cms||---

The court also directed the social welfare department’s deputy director and Nalanda block development officer (BDO) to ensure that the mother of the juvenile offender gets connected to social welfare schemes under JEEViKA and earns respectfully, so that neither she nor her minor son would again get involved in illicit liquor distillation and marketing. The court also directed the child welfare police officer (CWPO) to continue to monitor the mother-son duo. Additional public prosecutor (APP) Rajesh Pathak said, “The minor (16), was arrested by excise sub-inspector from a village under Nalanda police station area with two litres of country liquor in his possession which he was going to sell on August 25. He was produced before the court dealing with liquor prohibition violation cases, from where he was referred to the district juvenile court.” Pathak said, “During interrogation, the juvenile said that his mother distilled country liquor and he sold it in nearby villages. He also said that he has passed his matriculation examination in second division from Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) this year and got himself enrolled in Class XI and was interested in perusing higher education and do some respectful job but his mother forced him to sell illicit country liquor.” The APP further said, while delivering order on Thursday, the principal underlined: “Under prevailing circumstances, it appeared the woman’s family did not get any benefit of the schemes including the toddy processing plants for making jugglery and neera, which the state government has started for the benefit people of scheduled caste community.” He said while absolving the minor from charges the court also observed, “As the juvenile and his mother repents for the crime they committed and their written assurance of abstaining from it in future, the court keeping in view the juvenile boy’s proper care, protection, development, treatment and fulfilment of his basic needs, absolves him of all charges filed against him under the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Amendment Act 2016.” Other members of the JJB also consented to the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/liquor-case-juvenile-absolved-of-charges/articleshow/86265159.cms||Farrukh Nadim

At present, only those with proof of double vaccination or with negative RT-PCR test report issued within 72 hours are being allowed in. However, the Belur Math authorities felt that despite these precautions, allowing entry during the pujas would lead to crowding. The pujas will be held in the temple like last time with resident monks participating with Covid rules in place. Kumari Puja will also be held. Like last year, the Kumari and her family will be tested for Covid before they come in for the rituals.

---||Vadodara||Gujarat tops in custodial deaths across India||VADODARA: Cops in the state may have a reason to worry — Gujarat has been placed among the top three states in the country for custodial deaths over the past few years. On Thursday, yet another custodial death was reported from Godhra taluka in Panchmahal district. Qasim Hayat, who was arrested in beef selling racket, committed suicide by hanging himself with a piece of cloth in Godhra police station. Meanwhile, Crime in India in 2020, a report released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has revealed that number of custodial deaths last year in Gujarat were the highest. Fifteen persons, who were in police custody without remand, died in different districts of the state in 2020. Of these, six were suicide cases by accused and six were deaths due to illnesses. According to the report, magisterial inquiry has been ordered into 12 of these custodial death cases while judicial inquiry has been ordered in one case. Cases have been registered only in two of the incidents but no charge-sheet has been filed. In 2019 too, the state was ranked second in custodial deaths across the country. Three accused had committed suicide while five died of illnesses and one from injuries sustained due to the physical assault while in custody, as per the NCRB report. In the custodial death case of Sheikh Babu Nisar, who disappeared from Fatehgunj police custody in Vadodara in December 2019, the CID (crime) is yet to trace his body. Suspected to be a thief, Sheikh was picked up by the cops from Sayajigunj and taken to Fatehgunj police station for questioning. He was never seen again. Six cops were arrested for the custodial death of Sheikh in 2020. While 14 cops were arrested in connection with the custodial death in 2019, not a single cop has been arrested in any of the custodial deaths that happened in 2020. In 2018, Gujarat topped the list of custodial deaths in the country with 14 persons dying in police custody while the number was 10 in 2017. Suicide and illnesses were among the top causes for the custodial deaths in the state in last three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/guj-tops-in-custodial-deaths-across-india/articleshow/86272138.cms||Tushar Tere

Ankita Srivastava, senior corporate communication officer, Barauni refinery, said the blast occurred in the furnace of atmospheric vacuum unit-1 which was being restarted after a fortnight-long shutdown. “Excess pressure built up during the restart process probably caused the blast,” she said, adding those injured were the ones working near the unit. Srivastava, however, said the blast was not very serious and operations were not affected in any other unit due to it. “All the 19 workers received splinter injuries. Their condition is stated to be out of danger,” she said. Barauni refinery executive director Shukla Mistry said the injured people were admitted to Barauni refinery hospital and a private hospital. “We will take all possible care of the injured workers,” Mistry added. As per sources, at least five of the refinery’s permanent employees also sustained injuries in the blast. Barauni refinery is currently undergoing capacity expansion.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata colleges invite ‘genuinely interested’ candidates to register for wish lists||KOLKATA: Several colleges in the city have started turning to the “wish list” or “show interest” option, inviting candidates, who are genuinely interested in studying there but their names are lower on merit lists. Such candidates can register for wish lists—provided they have not already taken admission in any of the courses—following which, the institutes will draw up another merit list with them, placing them according to their academic scores. Colleges have adopted this method to speed up the admission process, which has been progressing slowly thanks to the high scores awarded to Plus-II candidates and the absence of any restriction on the number of applications. With high-scorers blocking multiple seats across institutes, those lower on the lists have not been getting their turn. At the same time, these high-scorers, despite securing admission at one college, have not informed the others about their decision, as a result of which, their seats have remained out of bounds to others. Owing to this curious condition, a few seats are still going vacant despite multiple rounds. The wish list registration date at Lady Brabourne is from Wednesday to Friday noon and at Maulana Azad, Wednesday to Friday 11.59pm. “Some seats are vacant after five rounds of admission. Those whose names are on the provisional list can register for the wish list, showing their interest in taking admission to any of the courses provided by the college,” said Lady Brabourne principal Siuli Sarkar.  At Maulana Azad, vacancies in most subjects are in single digits. “Those who genuinely want to study here can register for the wish list. We will try to give them a chance, depending on marks,” said principal Subhasis Dutta. Bethune College will hold wish list registration from September 22 to 24. “The subsequent admission cycles will be from the wish list,” said an official. Some of the other colleges are Seth Anandaram Jaipuria and Heramba Chandra College.

---||Patna||Bihar: BJP’s mega plan for PM Modi’s 71st birthday||PATNA: As part of its nationwide programme, the BJP will launch a 20-day programme to celebrate PM Narendra Modi’s 71st birth anniversary in the state on Friday.  The party members will visit temples to pray for long life of Modi and also the successful delivery of works to be undertaken for the welfare of the people. “The party workers will visit the temples in their localities on Friday morning and offer their prayers so that the PM continues to work for the welfare of the people,” state BJP spokesman and former MLA Prem Ranjan Patel said. The 20-day celebration has been named ‘Jan Sewa Ke Anwarat 20 Varsh’. The party has planned to carry out a slew of social and other activities across the state from Friday, which will conclude with a state-level function on October 7. “The 20-day celebration will be held at the state and district headquarters, besides down to the level of the polling booth,” Patel added. Parallel with the party’s programme, its art and cultural front is also organizing its separate functions at the state level, said the party’s arts cell president Barun Kumar Singh. While the party has organised an exhibition at Atal Sabhagar on the various policy measures undertaken by PM Modi’s government, another exhibition will be organised near Atal Sabhagar by the art and cultural wing of the party. The exhibition of the latter includes a portrait of PM Modi made with sand from the river Ganga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjps-mega-plan-for-pms-71st-birthday/articleshow/86272811.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Surat||Bhupendra’s balancing act||Surat/Ahmedabad: The brand new Cabinet of chief minister Bhupendra Patel clearly had a stamp of south Gujarat strongman and state BJP president CR Paatil with as many as seven MLAs from the region got ministerial berths. With 2022 elections just 15 months away, the new CM tried a smooth balancing of both caste and regional equations by roping in Patidars, tribals, OBCs and Brahmins in the new government. The challenge clearly for the new ministers is performance given that none of them have any experience in government administration and the short time before the polls. According to sources, this is the highest representation in the state government so far for South Gujarat and observers believe that the veteran Paatil, an MP from Navsari, played a pivotal role for his region. There are three Cabinet ministers, two ministers of state (independent charge) and two ministers of state from the region. Importantly, Purnesh Modi from Surat east got the key portfolio of roads and housing, transport, civil aviation, tourism and Yatradham vikas while Kanu Desai from Pardi got the important finance and energy department. Within BJP cadres, there is a feeling of rejuvenation as many feel that the young faces will give their heart and soul into people’s work. Central Gujarat too saw the number of ministers doubling to eight in the new Cabinet. The region had only four ministers in the Rupani government that included two from Ahmedabad city - Pradipsinh Jadeja and Kaushik Patel. However, the new dispensation has eight ministers with Kheda also getting a representation. Vadodara city which only had Yogesh Patel as the minister saw Rajendra Trivedi and Manisha Vakil to get place. For the first time, there are more than one ministers from scheduled castes with Vadodara’s Manisha Vakil and Asarwa MLA Pradip Parmar getting inducted in the government. "In 2017 assembly polls, BJP was down to just 99 seats but central and South Gujarat firmly remained with the party. Tribal belt is now the backbone of the saffron party and it has been rewarded by giving more ministers,” said a political observer. Patidars of course account for nearly one-third of the ministries with as many as seven from the community taking the oath. The tallest among them is Jitu Vaghani, the former state BJP president, who got the key portfolio of education. Interestingly, Visnagar MLA Rushikesh Patel, who had earned the wrath of Patidars during the 2015 quota stir, was chosen to head the health ministry which was held by former deputy CM Nitin Patel. Both are from Mehsana district. Also, Bhupendra Patel has compensated the dropping of some senior ministers by giving a chance to other MLAs from their district. For example, while veteran Bhupendrasinh Chudsama was dropped, Mehemdabad MLA Arjunsinh Chauhan got the coveted Cabinet portfolio of rural development. Kolis, who form a huge chunk of voter population, got two ministers in Keshod MLA Deva Malam and Mahuva MLA RC Makwana as senior ministers Kunvarji Bavaliya and community strong man Purushottam Solanki were dropped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bhupendras-balancing-act/articleshow/86272499.cms||---
---||Patna||Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad to banks: Extend loans to industry, agriculture sectors||PATNA: Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad on Thursday asked the bankers to improve the state’s credit-deposit (CD) ratio by extending loans to the industry and agriculture sectors, besides enhancing loaning activities during the remaining months of the current financial year, as the loan disbursed during the first quarter (April-June) was only 18.5% of the target. “While the national CD ratio was 75%, the state’s CD ratio during the first quarter was 45.68%. The CD ratio could be improved if bankers provide loans in the emerging sectors like cattle and goat rearing, fishery and poultry, as well as to small traders and entrepreneurs and persons in the industry sector and in flood-affected areas, all of which have huge scope for growth,” Prasad said. He was addressing the state level bankers’ committee (SLBC) meeting here. Among other speakers were industries minister Shahnawaz Hussain and rural development department (RDD) minister Shrawan Kumar. Prasad said annual credit plan (ACP) fixed for the 2021-22 financial year was Rs 1.615 lakh crore, but only Rs 29,866 crore had been disbursed by way of loan in various sectors during the first quarter of the current fiscal. It amounted to only 18.5% of the target. Incidentally, the loan disbursed was Rs 6,321 crore more than the amount disbursed in the 2020-21 fiscal during its first quarter, he said. Prasad asked the bankers to open their bank branches at the panchayat sarkar bhavans being established in the state. To spread financial literacy in the state, a booklet was released on the occasion, while a portal to monitor the applications submitted for loans under various schemes was also launched. Industries minister Hussain said the bankers should instruct their branches to show readiness in providing loans to investors whose proposals regarding ethanol production had been cleared. The projects, after diligent processing of the proposals, were being cleared in record time, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/deputy-cm-to-banks-extend-loans-to-industry-agri-sectors/articleshow/86272696.cms||Abhay Singh

In a reply filed in the Delhi high court, NCPCR highlighted that the social media post was violative of the provisions of JJ Act, POCSO Act, IPC and various provisions of IT Act, 2000, but was still available on Twitter and it wasn’t cooperating with the law enforcement agencies.It claimed the online social media platform was not following the law of the land by failing to take any action against the post and urged the high court to direct it to remove the post keeping in view the need to protect the dignity of the girl child.National Commission for Protection of Child Rights said that in response to its communication, Twitter said the image was pixelated or blurred and it was undertaking a further qualitative assessment of the subject-post and, if necessary, would take action.The high court has already granted Zubair protection from arrest in the case, which was registered against him last year under the IT Act. It had also directed Twitter India to cooperate with police in the investigation.The accused last year approached the high court seeking quashing of the FIR and also sought a copy of the FIR saying the cyber cell refused to provide him with the document. The court then ordered police to give him a copy of the FIR so that he could respond to the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/minors-torture-twitter-is-not-cooperating-in-probe-hc-told/articleshow/86273475.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||PM Narendra Modi’s clarion cull: Empty the Gujarat cabinet, let freshers in!||GANDHINAGAR: The BJP may have created history in Indian politics by pressing on with the ‘total no repeat’ formula, dropping all 22 ministers of the previous government led by Vijay Rupani and inducting a brandnew team of 24. Most of them are freshers. The disruptive change has been occasioned by Bhupendra Patel’s recent and staggeringly unexpected elevation to the post of the chief minister. By any yardstick, the culling is one of the most audacious political experiments orchestrated by PM Narendra Modi in his home state Gujarat, often referred to as the saffron party’s laboratory. The bold move also signals the supreme confidence of Modi in his party’s grip over Gujarat. Wednesday had been a day of hectic parleys and unrest, with senior ministers being open about their dismay at the prospect of being axed. But even that rare episode of discord in the party did not alter the high command’s resolve to prop up a new team of netas to lead Gujarat into the 2022 assembly polls. It was pegged to be an attempt to wipe out any anti-incumbency sentiment that voters may harbour after the BJP’s more than twodecade rule, especially in the aftermath of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. In the tsunami of transformation, senior leaders including former DyCM Nitin Patel, Pradipsinh Jadeja, Saurabh Patel, Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, and Kaushik Patel — each with decades of experience in the government — were cast aside as ‘Team Dada’ took over. The new ministers were sworn in by Gujarat governor Devvrat Acharya. Of the 24 ministers, 10 have cabinet rank and 14 are ministers of state. Five ministers of state have been given independent charge. If prior experience of ministership is a benchmark, this is essentially a team of freshers. Almost a dozen of the new ministers are first-time MLAs including CM Patel. Two women, Nimisha Suthar and Manisha Vakil, have bagged ministerial berths. Only three members of the Bhupendra Patel cabinet have prior experience of being ministers. They are Kiritsinh Rana, Rajendra Trivedi, and Raghavji Patel. The induction of Raghavji along with two other Congress turncoats — Jitu Chaudhary and Brijesh Merja — is perceived to be a move to douse resentment which erupted over the removal of three turncoat ministers. Caste equations rejigged with prominence to OBCs, SCs/STsThose ousted were Kunvarji Bavaliya, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja, and Jawahar Chavda. In the new cabinet, casteequations were also rejigged to give more prominence to OBC and SC/ST communities. The number of OBC ministers jumped from four to six while the number of SC and ST ministers rose from three to six. The surprise element in Bhupendra Patel’s selection as the CM resonated in his cabinet formation as well. CM Patel has kept most of the key portfolios held by Rupani. The relatively low-profile Kanubhai Desai was given arguably the most important cabinet-rank portfolio: the finance department. Former DyCM Nitin Patel had ruled the finance department for long. Ex-speaker Rajendra Trivedi was given revenue, law and justice, and parliamentary affairs. The youngest minister in the cabinet, Harsh Sanghvi, 36, has been appointed as the minister of state for home. Jitu Vaghani, meanwhile, has been absorbed into the cabinet after a successful stint as the state party president. The health department held by Nitin Patel has gone to another Patidar MLA, Rushikesh Patel, who represents Visnagar in Mehsana district. With Bhupendra Patel at the helm, six Patidar ministers were sworn in on Thursday; Rupani’s government had eight. The complete change of guard created a major flutter across the state. Political observers said PM Modi first toyed with the “change is the only constant” theory in 2007 in a taluka panchayat election in Gondal. In 2010 he implemented the “no repeat” formula in the civic elections in Ahmedabad and Surat. The GAS (Gondal-Ahmedabad-Surat) formula’s success in cutting anti-incumbency spurred determination to replicate it, albeit in a limited measure in assembly elections of 2012 and 2017 and even the 2019 general elections when many senior leaders were denied tickets. “This experiment has consistently given results and has been implemented in the cabinet formation to create a positive impression among people before the 2022 elections,” said a keen observer of Gujarat politics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/modis-clarion-cull-empty-the-gujarat-cabinet-let-freshers-in/articleshow/86273218.cms||---

Dubey has been accused of amassing unaccounted wealth worth Rs 2.56 crore, which is 85% more than his known sources of income. Dubey is the first IPS officer against whom disproportionate assets (DA) case was lodged and searches were conducted for his alleged links with illegal sand mining mafia. He was removed from the post of SP of Bhojpur in July this year and subsequently put under suspension after preliminary investigation hinted at his links with sand mafia. Additional director general (ADG), EOU, Nayyar Hasnain Khan, said a DA case was lodged against the former Bhojpur SP on Wednesday and searches were conducted on Thursday after obtaining warrant from the competent court. During investigation, it came to light that Dubey has invested huge money through a building construction firm, Khyati Builders, whose proprietor, Rakesh Kumar, is a close relative of a controversial builder, Anil Singh. Singh, proprietor of Patliputra Builders, was recently arrested for duping people crores of rupees on the pretext of providing them flats. The Enforcement Directorate has initiated action against Singh. In addition, evidence of money laundering has been collected, which suggested that the police officer in question used to give money on interest to the people through certain agents. The identity of such people was being ascertained. The operation started around 10am and concluded in the evening. Initially, a police team led by a DSP rank officer searched Dubey’s residence near Gandhi Park at S K Puri here. Another team conducted searches at a flat at Sudama Palace near Abhiyanta Nagar in the state capital. Two separate teams conducted searches at his hotel at Jasidih and ancestral house at Simaria near Jasidih in Jharkhand. However, relatives of Dubey told the raiding team that the police officer had no property in his name at his native village. The raiding team came to know that the flat at Sudama Palace near Rupaspur in Patna had been sold recently. The flat was reportedly purchased in the name of Dubey's sister. The abrupt action prompted the search team to contact the builder, Rakesh Kumar, whose construction firm, Khyati Builders, had allotted the flat. As the builder Rakesh Kumar came to know about the operation, he fled after shutting his office. However, he later returned to his office after being informed about deployment of a magistrate to break open the lock of the office. Anticipating searches, the suspended IPS officer had safely shifted gold jewellery from his house. The EOU was trying to find out whether Dubey owned plots of land on northern side of JP Setu near Sonepur in Saran district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/da-case-eou-sleuths-raid-premises-of-ex-bhojpur-sp/articleshow/86271216.cms||Ramashankar

According to Acharya Santosh Kumar, a priest at the Durga Mandir in Panchsheel Nagar, Lord Vishwakarma is believed to be the creator of the world and son of Lord Brahma. Vishwakarma Puja marks his birth. The owners of factories, garages, and car showrooms, who had been eagerly waiting for the auspicious day, made all the arrangements for Vishwakarma Puja on Thursday. They also decided to adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour during the celebrations. Sooraj Bhanu Pratap, the employee at an automobile showroom on Boring Canal Road, told this newspaper on Thursday that everything was set. “All our employees and customers have been asked to attend the puja. However, only a limited number of them will be allowed to enter the showroom with a view to avoiding huge gatherings.” Sooraj added, “I wish Lord Vishwakarma blesses us and brings everyone’s life back on track.” Similar celebrations have been planned at a Gola Road-based motorcycle workshop. One of its workers, Vijay Kumar, said he and his colleagues had set up a small pandal where they would install Lord Vishwakarma’s idol. They would also distribute ‘prasad’ after the puja and “celebrate the day with enthusiasm”. Many Patnaites will also worship Lord Vishwakarma in their houses. For instance, Manya Singh, a resident of Patliputra Colony, will not go outside because of the pandemic and worship the creator of the world at home with her family. Surbhi Singh, a resident of Kankarbagh, said, “My father cleans all the vehicles at home on Vishwakarma Puja and goes pandal-hopping in the evening.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pandals-erected-as-city-gets-ready-to-celebrate-vishwakarma-puja/articleshow/86271168.cms||---

The DRAT Allahabad chairperson, who has been given additional charge of Kolkata, has been looking after cases of both Allahabad and Kolkata appellate tribunals, as a result of which appeals from 15 Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs)—nine under Kolkata and six under Allahabad—has been reaching this bench on every working day. This interim arrangement, which is increasing case pendency, has also come to the notice of the Supreme Court. A special bench comprising Chief Justice of India N V Ramana, Justice D Y Chandhrachud and Justice L Nageswara Rao was hearing an appeal on a similar issue, when it referred to the Kolkata DRAT vacancy. The CJI questioned the practice of clubbing DRATs, and not appointing a full-time chairperson. The Union finance ministry makes these appointments. The DRAT and the DRTs deal with disputes over defaults on loans. DRTs are crucial for banks, financial institutions and people seeking loan-default redress. Kolkata has three DRT benches, and one DRAT bench. The bench of the chairperson of DRAT Kolkata has been vacant since June. The post of the presiding officer of DRT-1, Kolkata has been vacant since January. In the absence of regular presiding officers in DRT-1, the presiding officer of DRT-3 had been given additional charge of DRT-1 Kolkata. “For eight months, DRT-3 Kolkata presiding officer has been dealing with all files and matters. Though the DRT-3 presiding officer is doing everything possible at the office of DRT-1 Kolkata, the advocates are facing difficulty because of unusual rush on board of the presiding officer and the large number of urgent matters listed every day, leaving the presiding officer behind with files due to extreme workload,” said Paritosh Sinha, secretary of Incorporated Law Society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/debt-tribunal-vacancies-leading-to-case-pile-up/articleshow/86275251.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

---||Business||Solve.Care partners HealthLink to bring cross-border telemedicine to India||Mumbai: Solve.Care, a global healthcare blockchain platform company has partnered with Pune-headquartered HealthLink Technologies to provide Indian doctors and patients access to Global Telehealth Exchange (GTHE) — a patient-doctor teleconsultation network that works across borders. Solve.Care CEO Pradeep Goel said that the company is using blockchain to ensure that both doctors and patients’ rights are protected. “Patients have 100% control and can give and revoke consent,” said Goel. GTHE acts as a global directory of physicians worldwide for patients, and once doctors complete a strict verification process, they can set and publish their rates, credentials, availability, and start accepting appointments from patients anywhere in the world. “The idea of global telehealth exchange is to empower the physician to be a physician and not worry about appointments, delays and refunds. All of that, we do for them,” said Goel. He added that hurdles for healthcare were as much a problem in rural US as in India. According to B S Ratta of Healthlink Technologies, there is a large population of Indians living and working abroad who would like to continue with their doctors in India. Similarly, many have left the country with family and parents still in India but have parents here. GTHE would enable them to connect with doctors across borders. Doctors who sign up on GTHE are assigned a Global Telehealth ID with their professional profile published on the network, enabling patients worldwide to easily find and book appointments with them. It cuts out the middleman by putting the doctor directly in touch with the patient conveniently and securely. Doctors determine and fix their consultation charges, duration of consultations and availability, giving them the freedom to work as much as they want when they want.GTHE is also designed with other features that help doctors provide preventative care and continuity of care to facilitate better patient outcomes. GTHE is rapidly expanding around the world. In addition to patients in India, patients from Bangladesh, Bahrain, Brazil, Kenya, Kuwait, Nepal, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, and the UAE can also access Indian registered doctors through GTHE for consultations. Patients can access GTHE through the Care.Wallet app, Solve.Care’s healthcare companion application. Patients can form Care Circles, made up of their loved ones so that friends and family can take an active part in their healthcare journey. Payments can be made using either the SOLVE token, Solve.Care’s native digital healthcare currency, dollars, or the rupee directly in the Care.Wallet app itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/solve-care-partners-healthlink-to-bring-cross-border-telemedicine-to-india/articleshow/86295155.cms||Mayur Shetty

Speaking at an event organised by the Upendra Maharathi Shilp Anusadhan Sansthan at Bihar Museum to felicitate 40 craftsmen of the state, Shahnawaz pointed out that the industries department had also decided to tie up with leading e-commerce websites for providing a bigger market to the local artisans. “We are making efforts to ensure that our craftsmen and artists build a strong customer base in different parts of India. However, their biggest achievement will be to make their products reach every nook and cranny of the world,” the minister said, adding that the industries department was also concerned about the people involved in small industries. The minister also urged the state government to convince the dignitaries from other places to visit Bihar Museum whenever they are in Patna. Of the 40 craftsmen, 20 received cheques of Rs 50,000 each and the remaining 20 got Rs 25,000 each. Padma Shri awardee and Mithila painting artist, Baua Devi, who was also present on the occasion, said, “The craftsmen of Bihar are very courageous and hard-working.

---||Business||Zee board backs two directors who resigned||Mumbai: Zee Entertainment Enterprises’s board has come out in support of its two former directors, Ashok Kurien and Manish Chokhani, who had resigned from the company in the wake of corporate governance allegations against them. Zee said on Thursday its entire board stands with the two ex-directors and it condemns the allegations made by certain proxy advisory firms against Kurien and Chokhani. Both were long-time directors at Zee, with Kurien being one of the original promoters of the company. “Speculations disparaging the contribution of the said directors are baseless and arise out of inadequate understanding of the (media and entertainment) industry. Decisions taken by committee members and the board of directors of the company are being wrongly attributed to individual directors without any basis.” Two proxy advisory firms — InGovern and IiAS — had raised governance concerns at Zee, advising shareholders not to vote in favour of the reappointments of Kurien and Chokhani at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM). But a day before the AGM, the duo resigned, citing personal reasons. “Under the mentorship of Kurien and Chokhani, along with all the members of the board, the interest of the shareholders has always been paramount for the company, and it is committed to maintain the highest standards of governance and transparency,” the Zee statement said. The development also comes against the backdrop of a board tussle with largest shareholder Invesco. The US fund had sought the removal of Kurien, Chokhani and MD Punit Goenka and the appointment of six of its nominees on the Zee board. Since Kurien and Chokhani have already quit, only Goenka continues on the board. Counter-attacking the proxy advisory firms’ views, Zee said it is immensely grateful to both Kurien and Chokhani. “Their guidance to the leadership team has been valuable, enabling the company to touch newer heights and deliver greater value to all its stakeholders year on year. Under their collective direction, the company has consistently undertaken several initiatives to bring in more transparency to the shareholders.” Zee will now have to decide when to call an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) sought by Invesco for the board overhaul. According to rules, it will have to hold an EGM within 45 days of receiving such a request. If it doesn’t hold, then Invesco can hold the EGM within three months, with Zee bearing the expenses. Further, according to rules, the removal of a director requires a simple majority to pass (more than 50% of the votes cast). Goenka owns 4% in Zee, which was established by his father in October 1992. Goenka has been on the company’s board since January 2005. Last year, shareholders reappointed him as a director for five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zee-board-backs-two-directors-who-resigned/articleshow/86275678.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The 31 plots are part of a 5 lakh sqm tranche that the National Informatics Centre (NIC) is e-auctioning on behalf of GIDC. GIDC is offering the industrial plots, which range from 1,506 sqm to 45,000 sqm, on long-term lease with the initial period being for 30 years. The base rate for the plots has been fixed at Rs 5,000 per sqm and the plots will be allotted to the highest bidder through a two-step process. “The lease can be extended for a total term of 95 years, in case the industry is fully set up and in operation within the first five years,” a GIDC senior manager said. On December 30, 2019, the industries department asked GIDC to auction 5 lakh sqm of the repossessed SEZ land in order to repay the short-term loan of Rs 200 crore taken in May 2019. GIDC had a one-year moratorium on the repayment of principal, which ended in May 2020 and since then GIDC has been paying approximately Rs 4 crore in EMIs to repay the loan. Of the 5 lakh sqm earmarked for e-auction, 4.42 lakh sqm is being auctioned with the remaining being kept as open space and for further development at a later stage. A utility plot has been earmarked for setting up of sub-station by the electricity department. GIDC failed in an earlier attempt to appoint a consultant to auction the land repossessed from promoters of the SEZ so GIDC decided to adopt NIC’s e-auction platform. “GIDC is bankrupt. There is Rs 112 crore principal amount outstanding. GIDC has no money to develop infrastructure in the industrial estates. The 7th Pay Commission has been implemented from September, but the arrears are pending,” a GIDC official said. The allottee will have to start commercial operations within a period of three years from the date of possession and if the allottee fails to commence construction after two years or fails to start operations even after a period of four years GIDC will reclaim the industrial plot. A pre-bid meeting with potential bidders has been slated for September 29 and the final bids have to be submitted by October 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/31-plots-from-verna-sez-land-for-e-auction/articleshow/86276473.cms||Newton Sequeira

The state has a stock of around 40 lakh doses of Covaxin and Covishield vaccines and it wants to break all previous records as far as number of vaccination in a day is concerned. The number of session sites has been increased to 14,157 for the mega vaccination drive. At nearly 1,000, maximum number of vaccination centres has been set up in East Champaran, followed by Vaishali (900), Patna (840), Samastipur (603) and Muzaffarpur (600).

The 12-wheeled truck was stacked with hay and liquor bottles were hidden in it. However, both the driver as well as the cleaner managed to escape. Sniffer dogs from Gaya failed to trace the culprits due to extensive water-logged paddy fields. Police inspector Jitendra Kumar said that on a tip-off, Nawada SP DL Sawal quickly formed a team to intercept the truck laden with liquor bottles of 750ml and 180ml. “In the wee hours of Thursday, a team of local police seized the truck from the premises of the Referral Hospital adjacent to the village,” the inspector said. Police sources said that the label on the bottles depicted that it was manufactured in Arunachal Pradesh and was apparently to be used to lure voters in the upcoming panchyat elections in November.

Assuaging markets on the RBI’s continued accommodative stance, Patra said that the stance of “as long as necessary” accommodation is reflected in ample liquidity in the system, with net surpluses of close to Rs 9 lakh crore being absorbed by the central bank on a daily basis. Patra was speaking at the 12th edition of the Financial Markets Summit organised by industry body CII. “The envisaged glide path should take inflation down to 5.7% or lower in FY22, to below 5% in FY23 and closer to the target of 4% by FY24. The rebalancing of liquidity conditions will dovetail into this glide path, but the choice of instruments is best left to the judgment of the RBI with its considerable experience with such tapers,” said Patra. “Markets are, however, constantly reassessing this stance with incoming data and seek definitive reassurance on the future course of policy,” said Patra. “We don’t like tantrums. We like tepid and transparent transitions — glide paths rather than crash landings,” Patra said. He said that it would be wrong to mistake the central bank’s variable rate repo auction as a liquidity-tightening measure pointing to the surplus funds in the money market. Patra said that the Indian economy is emerging from the second wave in a more resilient manner as compared with the first. He added that the recovery was more broad-based around manufacturing as a pivot, though output is still below pre-pandemic levels. “GDP outcome for the first quarter coming in just a shade below the RBI’s forecast, the projection of growth of 9.5% for the year as a whole appears to be on track,” said Patra. Vindicating the RBI’s stance to look through price spikes, Patra said that inflationary pressures are largely driven by supply shocks. Although shocks of this type are typically transitory, the repetitive incidence of shocks is “giving inflation a persistent character”. According to Patra, the essence of India’s flexible interest rate-targeting policy was to protect growth by minimising the sacrifice of output, which is the “price” of price stability. “Symmetrically, FIT (flexible inflation targetting) also protects the economy from deflation by adopting a positive — rather than zero — lower bound,” he said. Besides the dual target of price stability and growth, Patra said that in India the monetary policy target is defined in averages rather than as a point. Also, the inflation target is set to be achieved over a period of time rather than continuously. Patra said that there is a reasonably wide tolerance band around the target to accommodate measurement issues, forecast errors, supply shocks and, as vividly demonstrated recently, black swan events like the pandemic. Also in India, the MPC’s failure is defined as three consecutive quarters of deviation of inflation from the tolerance band, rather than every deviation from the target.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/inflation-seen-easing-to-4-by-fy24-rbi-dy-guv/articleshow/86275597.cms||---

She was administered the oath of office by Patna DM-cum-district electoral officer Chandrashekhar Singh here. Rajni was elected as the deputy mayor after beating her nearest rival and cousin-in-law Suchitra Singh of ward 22 (B) by 74% votes, which was almost two-third majority. Rajni was the hand-picked candidate of Patna mayor Sita Sahu while the opposition group led by former deputy mayor Meera Devi contested turncoat Suchitra, who is also a member of empowered standing committee of the civic body. As many as 59 of 74 councillors participated in the voting process. Vote of one councillor was declared invalid by the magistrate and the observer appointed by the district administration. Rajni got 43 votes in her favour and Suchitra 15. “The meeting to select the deputy mayor went on throughout the night on Wednesday. I was shocked when my own sister-in-law contested against me for the post. It was something that I had never expected,” Rajni said, adding she will try her best to live up to people’s expectations. Rajni is the third deputy mayor of Patna in last four years. She had earlier contested for the mayoral election in 2017 against Sita Sahu. However, she lost by three votes. Sahu congratulated the new deputy mayor and said development work pace in the city would gather pace now.

---||India||Centre’s threat to snap power supply makes states pay up||NEW DELHI: Overdues of central generation companies (gencos) have dropped to Rs 35,314 crore in August from Rs 49,780 crore a year after the power ministry invoked tripartite agreements with defaulting states and the RBI to recover outstanding amounts and asked power plants to snap supply to utilities that failed to pay their bills on time. Under Raj Kumar Singh's watch, the ministry has invoked agreements with Jharkhand, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to recover combined overdues of Rs 30,087 crore, taking a politically non-partisan approach to tackle one of the banes of the power sector. As of August 31, Jharkhand had an outstanding of Rs 3,292 crore. The ministry recovered Rs 714 crore and has served notice for recovery of Rs 1,126 crore. Karnataka discoms had an outstanding of Rs 5,240 crore. Recovery notices have been issued for Rs 1,540 crore. Tamil Nadu had an outstanding of Rs 21,555 crore. Tripartite agreements are a payment security mechanism for power supplied from central gencos to states. It is signed by a state, the ministry and the RBI. In case a discom fails to pay its bill, it becomes the state's liability. The ministry can then debit the amount from the state's account with the RBI. Under the ministry's direction, central power stations also issued in recent months disconnection notices to J&K, Madhya Pradesh and poll-bound UP, where BJP has high stakes. Discoms get 45 days to pay their bill for power bought from gencos. After this period, the outstanding bill is designated as 'overdue' amount and gencos charge interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centres-threat-to-snap-power-supply-makes-states-pay-up/articleshow/86279224.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC posts for priority hearing plea by widows of septic tank workers||Mumbai: Bombay high court on Thursday posted for priority hearing on Friday a petition filed by widows of septic tank workers seeking compensation. The workers had lost their lives in December 2019 while they were cleaning a septic tank at Morya Housing Society in Govandi. “Having regard to the nature of the writ petition, list this matter tomorrow as the first item,” said an order by a bench of justices Ujal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar after briefly hearing advocate Isha Singh for the women and government pleader Purnima Kantharia. The court asked the advocate for the petitioners if they received any form of compensation. Singh said that in over a year and 10 months since the deaths, the widows “had not even received a penny”. Singh argued that as per the directions of the honourable Supreme Court in Safai Karamchari Andolan versus Union of India, the state of Maharashtra, through its district collector, is obligated to pay the petitioners Rs 10 lakh per family, which they may then recover from the private employers. Kantharia argued that as per the Supreme Court directions and the law, the state of Maharashtra is only obligated to oversee that the compensation is paid, and is not required to dispense with the compensation itself, since the deceased manual scavengers were employed by a private housing society. The state submitted that the builder of the premises had deposited Rs 3.75 lakh with the government as part of the compensation . The HC said the issue requires a detailed deliberation and interpretation of the law and posted the matter for hearing on Friday and asked the state to bring the cheque of Rs 3.75 lakh that has been deposited.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-posts-for-priority-hearing-plea-by-widows-of-septic-tank-workers/articleshow/86275477.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||After Mumbai, Hyderabad has highest stalking cases in India||HYDERABAD: After Mumbai, Hyderabad has the most stalking and voyeurism cases reported among 19 cities, revealed National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2020 data. An increase in the number of cases was attributed to the SHE Teams’ work. In Mumbai, at least 452 cases of stalking were reported, followed by 267 in Hyderabad and 235 in New Delhi. Among the states, Maharashtra reported 2,013 cases of stalking under section 354-D in 2020, followed by 1,436 in Telangana and 956 in Andhra Pradesh. In voyeurism cases, 201 were reported in Maharashtra, followed by 124 in AP and 99 in Telangana. Additional commissioner of police (crimes) Shikha Goel said: “Most of these cases go unreported usually. Awareness campaigns and ease of reporting with SHE Teams have led to increased number of cases.” Mamatha Raghuveer Achanta, founder of Tharuni, said thanks to SHE Teams’ work, stalking cases were being reported. “All the SHE Teams are linked to police stations. There are around 100 SHE Teams that were operational in hotspots which resulted in more number of cases of stalking getting reported,” she said. The case of outraging the modesty of women were also reported in high numbers in public transport system in the city. “In 70 per cent of the cases, minors were involved. Unemployment, lack of education opportunities and addiction to ganja and liqour are also causing high incidence of these crimes,” Mamatha said. She further said: “We have to look at low conviction in these cases. Judiciary has to take up these cases on priority and deliver justice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-mumbai-hyd-has-highest-stalking-cases-in-country/articleshow/86275440.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Almost all the roads — those under the control of the public works department (PWD) as well as the Zilla Parishad (ZP) — are riddled with potholes causing severe inconvenience to motorists. Be it the Deola taluka, which receives very low rainfall, or the Igatpuri taluka that is often rain-battered, the situation of the roads is uniformly bad everywhere. Motorists here say they don't even expect smooth roads anymore, but they want the roads to at least be motorable and safe.  Pothole on Saundana Waghai Road in Deola taluka“This year, there has not been much rainfall here so far. Still, the roads in our taluka are bad. All the PWD officials say is that they will repair the roads ‘as soon as possible’,” said Keshav Borsea , resident of the Deola taluka who often has to travel on his motorcycle for business and agriculture purposes. The situation is no different for the residents of the Trimbakeshwar taluka. They are demanding that the roads here be repaired immediately. “See the condition of the four-lane road between Nashik and Trimbakeshwar. The road near Anjineri and Trimbakeshwar town is the worst. Incidentally, it is a road with very high traffic movement. You can then understand what is the condition of the roads in the more rural areas,” said Shailesh Bangare, a driver of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses. The PWD officers said they were assessing the situation of the roads and clearing many stretches by adding murrum to fill the potholes. The PWD manages a total road length of 3,635km that is operational. Another 2,365km length of roads are under construction through various schemes. Of the ones that are ready, 1,500km length is damaged and the department is managing with some temporary repairs. “There is no solution to this unless the rain stops completely. Currently, we are only adding murrum, or paver blocks at times, to ensure that the motorists are least inconvenienced. But all the work will happen only after the rainfall stops,” said Prashant Sonawane, the superintendent engineer of the PWD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bad-roads-in-rural-nashik-inconvenience-motorists/articleshow/86270926.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Bareilly||UP: Wrestler dies in 'ring' as rival fatally twists neck in Moradabad||BAREILLY: A fortnight after a 23-year-old wrestler was killed during an unauthorised match in UP’s Moradabad after his rival allegedly twisted his neck during the fight, police on Thursday registered a case against several people, including the opponent. The FIR was lodged against the opponent, Sajid (only identified by his first name), and several unknown people under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC based on the family’s complaint filed on Wednesday as well as a video of the wrestling match which was widely shared on social media. On September 2, Mahesh, a resident of Uttarakhand’s Kashipur, was killed in the ‘ring’ — an agricultural field at Faridpur village under Thakurdwara — when Sajid, a wrestler from Moradabad, allegedly twisted his neck. A video of the incident purportedly shows Sajid slamming Mahesh on the ground. Mahesh soon falls unconscious amid claps and cheers from the crowd. The wrestler was later rushed to a hospital where he died during treatment. The body was handed to the family. According to police, a postmortem could not be conducted since the family cremated the body soon after the incident. Deputy superintendent of police (circle officer, Thakurdwara), Anup Kumar, told TOI that police took cognisance of the video as well as the family’s complaint and booked several people. “The participants at the illegal matches were self-motivated. These matches were held earlier as well but the pandemic had put a stop to them. The latest match was held in a plowed agricultural field in the village. We are trying to ascertain the identities of the organisers,” he said. The DSP added that it was not clear if there was any prize money for those participating. Mahesh’s mother, Parvati, meanwhile, accused the organisers and her son’s opponent of killing him “deliberately”. “Mahesh was the sole breadwinner of a family of four. He did odd jobs to earn and had recently taken to wrestling. We were offered money to settle the case by the organisers. We used that money for my son’s treatment and yet he could not be saved,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/wrestler-dies-in-ring-as-rival-fatally-twists-neck/articleshow/86270925.cms||Maria Khan
---||Nashik||No helmet no petrol rule: Police to conduct surprise visits to petrol pumps in Nashik||NASHIK: The city police will be conducting surprise checks of petrol pumps in the city to ensure that the ‘No Helmet No Petrol rule’ is strictly implemented by the petrol pump owners, said commissioner of police Deepak Pandey. If petrol pump owners are found not implementing the rule, strict action will be taken against them, said Pandey. From August 15, the city police have made ‘No Helmet No Petrol’ compulsory at the petrol pumps. Under this rule, petrol pump owners or operators have been barred from selling petrol to bikers and two-wheeler riders arriving at the pumps without wearing a helmet.  Pandey said, “Ever since the new rule has been floated in the city, a large number of bikers are seen wearing helmets in contrast to what the situation was earlier. I believe that as of now, nearly 80% of the bikers are wearing helmets. Now we want to ensure there is zero negligence among petrol pump owners in implementing the rule. So, police personnel would make surprise visits at the petrol pumps.” “In case it is observed that petrol pump owners are negligent in following the rule, we will issue them a show-cause notice on why their license should not be cancelled,“ added Pandey. Under this rule, bikers arriving at petrol pumps should be wearing helmets. If they have forgotten to wear the helmet but are in urgent need of petrol, they have to fill a form mentioning their details and the reason for not wearing the helmet. The petrol pump operator then gives the form to the traffic police, who verify the reason. If the reason is found invalid, the process of sending a proposal to suspend the biker’s driving license to the regional transport office (RTO) is taken up. The traffic police said they have sent a large number of proposals to suspend the driving license to the RTO over the past month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-helmet-no-petrol-rule-police-to-conduct-surprise-visits-to-petrol-pumps/articleshow/86270994.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Pune||Centre for enough samples from states for genome test||PUNE: Union health officials on Thursday said there had been a slight drop in Covid-19 samples being sent to the sentinel sites for genome sequencing following the reduction in overall cases in many parts of the country. National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) director Dr Sujeet Singh told TOI that each state should send at least 15 samples a week for genome sequencing, subject to the number of active cases. Maharashtra and Kerala are currently sending the maximum number of samples for genome sequencing. A central health ministry official said there were over 300 sentinel sites, but many districts had seen a reduction in cases.“Hence, it is possible that the sentinel sites are not getting adequate samples. The states should ensure that the samples are sent for genome sequencing, as the country needs to keep a check on the Covid variants,” the official said. Since April-May this year, Maharashtra is sending 100 samples (from all 36 districts) every month to the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. The state has so far reported 103 samples of Delta plus variant. “Kerala is also sending adequate samples,” Singh said. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), a group of 28 laboratories in the country monitoring the genomic variations, on Monday said a statement that the newer Mu and C.1.2 variants coronavirus have not been found in India so far. The consortium stated that the Delta variant and its sub-lineages remained the main “variant of concern” in India and the world. The bulletin added that AY.4 was the most frequently seen sub-lineage in the recent sequences from India, as well as globally. “No further rise in cases pertaining to the C.1.2 variant has been noted and it seemed to have plateaued at 2% in South Africa, where it was originally detected,” the bulletin stated. ‘Pandemic in country may reach endemic stage within six months’PUNE: National Centre for Disease Control director Dr Sujit Singh on Thursday told TOI that the Covid-19 pandemic in India was likely to reach the endemic stage in the next six months.

While they cited social harassment, police suspect a POCSO case against the man may be the cause of their extreme step. Before attempting to end their life, Rajeev Kashyap, 30, and his wife, Ishita, aired their grievances on social media. They claimed that they had been framed in false cases and though no evidence had been found against them, they were being harassed by local youth and neighbours who forced them to shut their coaching centre, their only means of livelihood. Fed up and penniless, they were ending their life. The couple also left a suicide note for CM Yogi Adityanath and SHO of Baghpat police station. It said, "We are suffering from mental harassment, including thrashing and threats, for quite a few months. My husband was even administered poison once and while I was trying to save him, these people slapped fictitious cases against us.” The people include Rakesh Kumar, Vinod Singh, Subhash, Ajay and Amit. They forced us to shut the coaching centre. We are left with no option but to end our lives. They are responsible for our deaths. We request strict action against them." The couple claimed that some 45 days ago, a few neighbourhood youths had attacked Rajeev. On the latter’s complaint, five youths were booked for disturbing peace in the area. Later, the neighbours filed an FIR under Rajeev under SC ST Act for which investigation is still on, they added. But police had a different tale to recount. Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, Baghpat SP, said, “A case under POCSO Act is pending against the teacher for harassing a 13-year-old girl. Investigations are underway. It is possible that the mental pressure due to the case drove them to take the extreme step.” The SP added that the woman’s condition is serious but her husband is better. “The couple's family had met me on Thursday and we discussed the case at length. I have assured them that no harassment will be allowed but investigations in the case will have to continue."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/harassed-by-locals-couple-tries-to-end-life-in-baghpat/articleshow/86270965.cms||Sandeep Rai

After the mega vaccination camp on Sunday, no Covaxin doses have been administered with the regular camps allotted only Covishield. People who took their first dose and have completed their mandatory wait period since September 12, and those who missed the mega camp are desperately looking for Covaxin to complete their vaccination status. Inquiries by residents with the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial government hospital also proved futile. “All the camps are offering only Covishield. At least one camp in each zone can offer Covaxin since the vaccine is not available even in the 24X7 vaccination centre,” P Jaiganesh, a resident of Vayalur road, said. A health official said that the vaccine is preferred among senior citizens, women and people with comorbidities as they believe that it offers fewer side effects. “In a few centres, there is a demand. We are planning to repeat a mega vaccination camp this weekend where Covaxin will be available,” coordinator of urban vaccination camps, Dr A Mohammed Hakkim said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/covaxin-second-dose-seekers-hit-by-shortage-of-vials-in-trichy/articleshow/86275514.cms||---

Vishwas’s entire family – of around 25 people – suffered from Covid-19 in April, in a span of 10 days, but only his condition worsened and he was taken to hospital. He won the battle against the deadly virus after 130 days, probably the longest hospital stay for a Covid patient, and was discharged earlier this week. According to the doctors who treated Vishwas, he was diagnosed with Covid-19 on April 28. His condition deteriorated and he was moved to hospital on May 5 where he was kept in the ICU for over 35 days. He then continued to be on high-supply oxygen support (bilevel positive airway pressure) for another two months. In the last one month, his oxygen support continued, but he showed 90% recovery which led to his discharge from the hospital. “We have discharged Vishwas from hospital on Tuesday after almost 130 days of admission. He still needs high-supply oxygen daily for a few hours,” said Dr Ayush Jain, the doctor who treated him. Vishwas is happy to be back home. He is spending time with his children who keep on asking him about the scar he got on his nose. His elder son, 12-year-old Aarav Saini, is not letting his dad move away from his eyes even for a minute. “He was put on a ventilator and then on oxygen support for so long that he developed a very deep wound on the nose. It’s common in patients who remain in ICU for a longer time. It will heal eventually,” said Vishwas’s brother Dr Rishabh Saini, an orthopedic surgeon in Meerut. “We had admitted him to the hospital on May 5. It was hard for us to see him gasping for breath. His oxygen level had dropped to 16,” Dr Saini added. A few other long hospital stays in Covid cases include a Gujarat-based man who had recovered after 119 days. Another man from Chennai stayed in hospital for 119 days and a Meerut-based elderly woman who spent 100 days in hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/in-one-of-the-longest-covid-recoveries-meerut-man-goes-home-from-hospital-after-130-days/articleshow/86271001.cms||Ishita Mishra

Nashik NHAI project director B S Salunke said that the notice was served to the contractor on Wednesday, giving the latter an ultimatum to repair the road in the ghat section of Igatpuri by the end of this month. There is a growing annoyance among commuters using the highway about the constant deterioration of the road. Many motorists have taken to social media, uploading images of the pothole-riddled road and questioning why the road is in such a state despite them paying the toll. Nashik city Lok Sabha MP Hemant Godse had met Salunke on Wednesday demanding that the agency suspend toll collection at Ghoti until the ghat section is repaired. “Under the rules, the contractor entrusted with the upkeep of the road has to undertake repairs of any pothole within 72 hours. But, in this case, leave alone the repairs, the road condition itself is fast deteriorating. The stretch has become treacherous for motorists,” admitted Godse. The MP plans to accompany an NHAI team early next week on a visit the ghat section for an on-the-spot assessment of the road. Salunke said that Nashik NHAI has also decided to rope in a consultant to suggest measures that need to be taken at 4-5 spots in the ghat section that are damage-prone, especially during the monsoon. According to the Nashik highway police, the condition of the road is such that vehicles find it difficult to ply over 10-15 kms. “What is more concerning for us is that the soil in the ghat section has become soggy due to constant rain in Igatpuri for the last 4-5 days and it could lead to a landslide. We have apprised NHAI about it and our team remains alert round-the-clock,” added a highway police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/contractor-faces-deadline-to-repair-igatpuri-ghat-section/articleshow/86271017.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The state had postponed these elections till August 31 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and was expected to issue the orders for conducting the polls this month. The order will give respite to nearly 30,000 housing societies below 250 members in the state due for elections. Of these, 4,000 housing societies are in Pune district. Maharashtra Cooperative Housing Federation vice-chairman Suhas Patwardhan told TOI that this was a long pending demand and the societies could start the poll process following Thursday’s order. The state has over 1 lakh cooperative housing societies, while Pune district has around 18,000 registered cooperative housing societies. Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association chairman Ramesh Prabhu had said the polls would benefit the societies that might have some disputes in the absence of a new body. The polls were delayed first due to the amendement to the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, and then the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nod-to-polls-in-hsg-societies-with-less-than-250-members/articleshow/86275511.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The vendors were relocated to three different temporary sites.The civic body sources said that meat vendors were taking more time than allotted to relocate their properties. As the delay was hampering the construction, the engineering department has started demolishing a portion of the market to force the meat vendors to relocate. “We will complete the demolition in two days. A contractor has been identified to take up the work. Within a week, the foundation work may commence,” a corporation official said. The 0.50-acre market will be razed down, to expand the number of shops in the new market. Until now, the fish market had only 128 shops. After renovation, it will have 148 shops. A two-wheeler parking area will come up in the basement.The ground floor will have retail outlets, and the first floor will have stalls with cold storage units. The civic body is planning to complete the work within a couple of years. The existing fish stalls will be relocated to the Diamond Jubilee bazaar. Around 20 poultry and meat stalls will be relocated to the campus of the corporation’s abattoir on East Boulevard Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/fish-market-renovation-begins/articleshow/86275541.cms||---

Periyar self-respect propaganda institute (Periyar trust) will soon initiate construction work on the Rs 100-crore edutainment facility along the Trichy-Chennai national highway.The state government had granted permission for erecting the statue recently. DK president K Veeramani had personally met chief minister M K Stalin and thanked him for the gesture. According to the leaders of the Dravidian movement, the statue will have a 40-feet pedestal, altogether making it stand at a height of 135 feet from the surface. Once commissioned, the statue will be the tallest in the state, surpassing the Valluvar statue (133 feet) in Kanyakumari. The organisers said the statue may have an elevator facility to scale the entire structure. However, a decision on allowing the public to access the statue to have a bird’s eye view of the complex is yet to be taken. “The construction work of the Periyar world complex may go on for three years. It will be spacious. We are mobilising funds through donations,” P Subramaniam, a senior representative of the Periyar self-respect propaganda institute told TOI. The trust will submit the documents for building plan approval on September 17 (Friday) that marks the birth anniversary of Periyar E V Ramasamy, the patriarch of the Dravidian movement.The complex has a slew of proposals promoting science and the Dravidian movement. It will also have public parks for children and food courts, the organisers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/95-ft-tall-periyar-statue-to-come-up-in-trichy-in-3-yrs/articleshow/86275531.cms||Deepak Karthik

The appointments come after the presidents of 19 block committees were appointed last week. As part of the overhaul, Congress has also dropped Terancio Fernandes as the block president for Curtorim and reappointed Milagres Fernandes. “The appointment of presidents of the remaining block committees will be announced shortly,” state Congress vice president M K Shaikh said. “These appointments have been made with the concurrence of AICC Goa in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao and the AICC observers. The new block presidents are Rudresh Deshprabhu for Pernem, Rajesh Gaonkar for Mayem, Derek Rodrigues for St Andre, Dnyaneshwar Govekar for Taleigao, Umakant Kudnekar for Tivim, Dnyaneshwar Naik for Marcaim, Rajendra Shirodkar for Sanvordem and Menino Fernandes for Benaulim.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: In huge shift in TB control gameplan, focus to now be on prevention||MUMBAI: In a first, a pilot study is being rolled out in the city to gauge prevalence of latent tuberculosis. It signals a giant shift in the TB control gameplan that has till now focussed on detection and treatment of active TB, and not so much on prevention. People with latent TB carry the bacterium but have no symptoms and cannot infect others. But upto 10% can progress to active TB if the latent infection is left unaddressed. An estimated 350 million Indians are likely to have latent TB and preventing even a fraction can make a dent in the burden of new cases. The study will be the first structured attempt to understand how widespread latent TB is in Mumbai, said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. The risk of developing active TB from latent infection increases more than 25 times among contacts of bacteriologically confirmed TB patients. In this study, close contacts of 125 newly-diagnosed TB patients will be traced and screened. An active TB infection will be ruled out first in contacts, following which a blood test (Interferon-Gamma Release Assays, called IGRA) that measures an individual’s immune reactivity to TB bacteria will be carried out. The contacts will be started on a three- to six-month preventive course of Isoniazid and Rifapentine based on the IGRA findings. BMC and NGO Share India will screen around 500 people, taking at least 4-5 high risk contacts for each of the 125 positive cases. TB preventive treatment (TPT), that exists nationally, has been limited in coverage till recently and extremely low on priority. The survey will be the first step towards an overhaul of TPT, that will see more funds, infrastructure and manpower being pumped in. Till early this year, TPT was offered only to children under five who had an active TB case in the house, and people living with HIV. Now, TPT has been extended to children above five and adult household contacts after an active TB infection has been ruled out in them. People living with immune-suppressive conditions will be persuaded too. Dr Pranita Tipre, Mumbai’s TB officer, said the study will go a step further and analyse how many comply with months-long preventive course and document hurdles. Although treating latent infection can stop progression to active TB by almost 90%, there are major adherence issues. Individuals, who are otherwise healthy, often drop out. The pill burden, that can range from 36-182 tablets, also acts as a damper. Dr Tanu Singhal, a paediatric infectious disease expert at Kokilaben Hospital, said preventive treatment is seldom advised due to low compliance and general lack of awareness among physicians.  “Most are not geared to think about prevention, so few offer it,” she said, adding that guidelines also state that it should be given to immunocompromised people such as diabetics and organ transplant patients, but that’s hardly the practice. Latent TB regimens also has other shortcomings: It doesn’t protect against repeated exposures, which hinders its wide use in high TB burden settings like India. “A strong preventive programme will be crucial to achieve the End TB goal of 2025,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-huge-shift-in-tb-control-gameplan-focus-to-now-be-on-prevention/articleshow/86275562.cms||Sumitra Debroy

In 2020, the fourth largest state witnessed a 24 per cent rise in juvenile crimes, which means the total number of registered cases was 1,282 in 2020 compared to 976 in 2019. On the contrary, national figures report an 8 per cent decline in the juvenile crime rate. According to the NCRB data, 29,768 crimes were committed by juveniles in 2020 compared to 32,269 in 2019 in the entire country. The major crimes registered against juveniles were the ones committed under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The number was pegged at 238, with UP being No. 2 after MP. The number of offences against property (including theft, burglary and robbery) was 219 and offences affecting human body, including murder, attempt to murder, culpable homicide, etc. 70. In all, there were 40 cases of attempt to murder. The data also reveals the educational background of apprehended juveniles. Out of 1,458, 144 never went to school, 293 were found to have studied up to the primary level, 575 had passed their matriculation examination and 382 had received higher secondary education. Most of them used to live with their parents. Meanwhile, states like Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, which otherwise had a higher juvenile crime rate, have shown a decline in the crime graph compared to 2019. For instance, in Gujarat, 2,025 cases were registered in 2019 that fell to 1,812 in 2020. Similarly, MP that had 5,522 cases in 2019 showed 4,819 in 2020. Maharashtra too reported a dip from 5,189 to 4,079. However, two states in the Northeast exhibited a sharp rise. Assam saw cases going up from 129 to 247 and Manipur from just 2 to 20. Besides, states like Punjab (246 to 267), West Bengal (537 to 586), TN (2686 to 3394) and HP (181 to 202) showed a rise in juvenile crimes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-sees-24-rise-in-juvenile-offences-against-8-nationwide-dip/articleshow/86271064.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Delhi||Delhi reported max number of crimes against foreigners||NEW DELHI: Delhi reported the highest number of crimes against foreigners last year, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Charge sheets, however, were filed in only 29% of the cases. As for crimes committed by foreigners in the city, most were related to selling drugs or fraud online. In 2020, Delhi reported 62 cases of crime against foreigners, a drop from the 123 cases reported in 2019 and the 189 in 2018. The reduction in the number of cases can be attributed to the Covid lockdown when flights from abroad were banned or restricted for a while. On why only 29% of the cases eventually reached the charge-sheet stage, a police officer explained that in many cases the victims of the crime returned to their home countries, making it difficult to pursue the case to its logical end. “However, the cases are always given priority and the chargesheets filed within the stipulated time,” the officer added. Meanwhile, around 168 foreigners were booked for participation in crimes in the capital. This figure too was a decline from the previous two years. In 2019, 264 foreigners were booked for various crimes and 203 in 2018. Chargesheets were filed in 98% of these cases. “Most of the foreigners caught were either illegally staying in India and were booked under relevant provisions of the law, while many were arrested under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,” said a police officer. “Other crimes included defrauding of people online, murder and other offences. During the lockdown many foreigners duped people with fake offers on credit card points, etc.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-reported-max-number-of-crimes-against-foreigners/articleshow/86273338.cms||---

As many as 2,150 students, including 2300 in PG (allopathy), had appeared for these exams and the pass percentage was over 95%. In the previous exam too the pass percentage was around 95% among about 2000 students who had appeared. MUHS authorities said this is one of the shortest periods in recent times that the examination department has announced the exam results. The theory papers were conducted from August 16 to 23 and the practicals culminated on September 9. Under the rule, the university’s exam department has to declare the results within 45 days but it usually announces them within a month after completion. “We were able to announce the results within six days due as the evaluation of the answer scripts started immediately after completion of the theory papers on August 23. We had requested all examiners to complete checking the answer scripts as soon as possible. Each answer script is checked twice by two different examiners,” the university’s controller of examination, Dr Ajit Pathak, told TOI. There are 41 different specialities like MD, MS, DM, M.Ch under the PG exam and 13 specialities like diploma in chaild health, obstetrics & gynaecology under the diploma. Pathak said the university’s acting vice-chancellor, Nitin Karmalkar, had been guiding the examination department to declare the results speedily. Moreover, the department’s officials and staff worked even on holidays. Pathak described the performances of the examinees as “encouraging”. MUHS officials said that since last year after the Covid pandemic unfolded, the state medical education department decided that those appearing for such specialised examinations would be granted 45 days’ leave from hospital duty. So they started getting more time to prepare for the exam. “Our aim was to see that more specialised doctors are available in the state since there is a forecast of a third wave of the pandemic and hospitals would need the doctors. Moreover, a series of undergraduate health science examinations are lined up in the next two months. We wanted to ensure that there are no pending results that would increase our workload,” added Pathak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/muhs-declares-pg-dipl-exam-results-in-6-days/articleshow/86271082.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

When late chief minister J Jayalalithaa announced a special samba package on August 18 in 2016, well ahead of the season’s commencement, it was very helpful to farmers. It was continued for the subsequent year also, but the Edappadi Palaniswami government stopped the package in 2018, the farmers said. It was in this context that the present DMK government announced a special kuruvai package this year much to the relief of the farming community, said Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association secretary Swamimalai R Vimalnathan.Farmers were reeling under losses due to Burevi and Nivar cyclones and unseasonal rains in January 2020 when the pandemic-induced lockdown also added to the woes of the agriculture community. Though the disbursal of kuruvai package had come as a great relief, farmers are yet to receive crop insurance compensation for the samba season, he added. Hence, if the government would announce a special package for the samba season, it would be very helpful to farmers, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/delta-farmers-seek-spl-samba-package/articleshow/86275564.cms||---

---||Goa||PM Narendra Modi should speak about mining resumption in Goa before making fake promises: Congress||PANAJI: Reminding Prime Minister Narendra Modi of his assurance to grant special status for Goa and permit the resumption of mining in Goa, Congress on Thursday said that Modi must explain why both the promises remain unmet. The party said that Modi should refrain from making fresh assurances if BJP cannot address the present concerns of the state, particularly the status of the Coastal Zone Management Plan, coal transportation, the Major Ports Bill, unemployment and the three projects in Mollem. The party’s demand comes a day ahead of the planned interaction between the Prime Minister and Goan officials. Modi will interact with the cabinet members, health department officials and other elected representatives on Saturday through video conference to congratulate Goa for the inoculation of the eligible population with the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. “Goa’s mining was closed in 2012 and till today remains closed. BJP is in the Centre and in Goa. The Prime Minister must tell the state what is happening otherwise people will think that the Prime Minister really lies,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar said. Congress also demanded that Modi scrap the three linear projects at Mollem, the Nauxim Marina, coal transportation and ensure that feedback at the village level is adopted while finalising the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan. “Goans are upset today. There is unemployment, Goa’s financial debt has hit a high, small businessmen are struggling to survive. The Prime Minister should speak about these issues,” Chodankar said. Addressing a press conference at the Congress House, Chodankar came down heavily on the policies of the BJP government. “Most of the panchayats have outright rejected the various proposals and projects of the government, which will cause harm to the identity of Goa and destroy the environment, forest, wildlife and the coastal life of the state,” Chodankar said. Congress has also demanded that the Prime Minister make his stand clear regarding the Mhadei water dispute and where Karnataka has diverted the water. Chodankar also said that Modi should speak and apologise for the deaths that occurred in Goa due to Covid-19 and shortage of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pm-should-speak-about-mining-resumption-before-making-fake-promises-cong/articleshow/86275682.cms||---

In a plea to the court conducting the trial under charges of abetment of suicide against actor Sooraj Pancholi, CBI had said it wanted to send a dupatta used in the suicide for analysis to the forensic laboratory in Chandigarh. On June 3, 2013, Jiah was found hanging at her Juhu flat, after which Pancholi was arrested and charged with abetment. He was later released on bail. The CBI’s plea also sought permission to send phones of Jiah and Sooraj to forensic unit, FBI, US, to recover the messages. The court also rejected a plea by Khan’s mother, Rabia, who had pointed out to “defects” in the earlier investigation. In 2019, the CBI had first moved the plea. Sooraj’s lawyer, Prashant Patil, had then sought its dismissal. The defence reply said that CBI’s plea was in direct contempt of a 2017 Bombay high court (HC) order. It said Jiah’s mother had moved a plea in HC, making a similar plea, which was rejected in 2017. The reply stated that in an affidavit filed by CBI in response to Rabia’s plea, the investigating officer had submitted that messages by the accused and Jiah were related to his meeting with a jewellery designer at a hotel and not connected to the incident. It said the plea was contradictory to CBI’s earlier stand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/jiah-khan-suicide-spl-court-turns-down-cbis-plea-for-more-analysis-in-mumbai/articleshow/86277594.cms||Rebecca Samervel

In 2019, 2,408 minors and 1,08,349 were first-time offenders. Overall, 2,940 children and 1,29,321 adults were booked last year under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code and special and local laws. While 2,766 children in conflict with the law were apprehended under IPC, 174 minors had special and local laws invoked in their arrest. Among adults, 1,04,925 people were arrested under IPC sections and 24,396 under special and local laws. The NCRB data shows that 140 minors were apprehended but not convicted, with only 12 being convicted. Comparatively, 2,123 adults were convicted though 11,530 adults were arrested but did not face conviction. A Delhi Police officer said the first-time criminals pleaded that they had committed the felonies due to job loss. “There were also several cases in which unemployed youths committed crimes to earn money and others in which people who lost their jobs during the Covid lockdown indulged in crime to feed their need for alcohol or drugs,” the officer said. The officer also said that environmental factors, lack of parental attention, easy money, attraction to a lavish lifestyle, revenge and drug and substance abuse were the main reasons why the children and adults were opting for crime. Priyank Kanoongo, chairperson, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said parents should regularly interact with and take care of their children. "No child wants to be in conflict with the law,” he said. “Sometimes, they fall into the trap set by bad elements. Sometimes the circumstances force kids into crime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2788-kids-went-to-other-side-of-law-1-2-lakh-adults-first-timers/articleshow/86273425.cms||Abhay Singh

Massive soil erosion every monsoon over the past few years has already caused a huge loss of productive land of the village. The swollen river is now posing a threat to its residential area by causing the boundary wall of the primary school to collapse and sweeping away the toilet. According to an estimate, this year’s monsoon rage has resulted in 100 hectares of land belonging to half a dozen villages, including Simali, Gauspur, Daibalgarh and Fatehpur Sabha, from being washed away. The only way out to rein in the raging river is to build embankments, a demand pending for years, said villagers. A Rs 61-crore proposal to build stone studs to check erosion by the district administration and approved by the state government in 2017 is yet to take off as the funds are yet to be released. But the issue of embankments to check the river from washing away land is still hanging fire. Ad hoc arrangements such as placing sandbags along Ganga banks are not working. Shifting people to higher lands during monsoons or the 60 children enrolled in Fatehpur Sabha primary school to Narayanpur school is not a solution, said residents. Rajendra Pal of Fatehpur village said, "Ganga is eroding agricultural land and crawling towards populated areas for the past several years. It has destroyed hundreds of hectares of land and now threatens to swallow our houses. We have been demanding an embankment between the villages and the river. During every election, politicians make tall promises to stop the destruction. Once they get our votes, our grievances are forgotten. A flood is only a poll issue for them, nothing more.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/massive-erosion-by-swollen-ganga-may-swallow-bijnor-village/articleshow/86271268.cms||Harveer Dabas

South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will launch this online initiative next week wherein a person can book a sapling at the civic body’s parks for Rs 2,000. “Gifting a tree will be a pleasant surprise because the chances are that the recipient would never have had a sapling planted for them and they will feel special and honoured. Usually, we adopt such practices to honour dignitaries, but now people can also make their near and dear ones feel special,” said SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti. The civic body has identified 20 parks that a person can select online as well as the timings if they want to be present for the plantation ceremony. SDMC would place a tree guard and look after the sapling for its entire life and the person adopting it would be able to visit at intervals to see its health. “Interested people can fill in the name, address, occasion for gifting the saplings, and other details on the SDMC portal. Based on this, we will make necessary arrangements. After plantation, we will write down the name and address on tree guards to identify the person who gifted it,” said Alok Singh, SDMC horticulture director. A certificate would also be issued in the name of the person or relative to acknowledge the memorable plantation. Explaining why only 20 sites had been chosen, an official said regular care would become difficult if the saplings were planted at different places. “For the convenience of residents, we have identified five parks in each of the four zones. In all, 498 points would be used for planting saplings. The initiative also aims to boost community participation in increasing greenery in south Delhi,” added the official. The shortlisted parks include Central Park Shanti Niketan (18 saplings), park near C-4 Vasant Kunj (30 saplings), W-Block park, GK-II (12 saplings), Harsukh Park near B-4 Safdarjung Enclave (28 saplings), Club Park, Defence Colony (25 saplings), park near Mata Mandir, New Friends Colony (20 saplings), waterbody in Sector 7 Dwarka (40 saplings), Zakir Hussain Park near Surya Hotel (20 saplings), park at Road No. 17, Punjabi Bagh Extension (20 saplings), park opposite Kamal School, Vikaspuri and park near road no. 13, Sarita Vihar (20 saplings).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plant-sapling-as-gift-south-corpn-vows-to-take-its-care-for-life/articleshow/86273519.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Kochi||Kerala cannot afford to lose revenue from fuel tax, says finance minister K N Balagopal||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Ahead of the crucial GST council meeting in Lucknow on Friday, Kerala finance minister K N Balagopal on Thursday reiterated the state government’s stand against the proposal to bring petroleum products under GST regime. The state, he said, would make all possible efforts to protest against the proposal by bringing together all other states that are against the Union government proposal. The GST council has been pushing forward the proposal to include petroleum products under GST tax regime for long, but the immediate reason that brings the subjects to the table of GST council is Kerala high court’s directive to discuss the feasibility of the proposal. The Union finance ministry had in an affidavit submitted before the high court said that the GST council would discuss the subject on September 17. The Centre filed the affidavit in a petition filed by Kalady Sree Sankaracharya University former vice-chancellor M C Dileepkumar. Balagopal said the government would try to evolve a consensus among states that are of the view that states have the right to fix tax on petroleum products. According to Balagopal, the arguments that bringing petroleum products to the GST fold would lead to steep fall in fuel price were not based on facts. “The price of petrol and diesel would come down significantly only when the Centre stops collecting fuel cess. If the Centre is not ready to forgo the cess which it doesn’t share with states, price of petroleum products would remain the same even if it is brought under GST regime. States like Kerala cannot afford to lose the proceeds from fuel tax. If the Centre’s move materialises, Kerala’s revenue from fuel tax would comedown to Rs 6,000 crore from the current Rs 12,000 crore,” he said. If petrol is brought under GST, the tax on per litre petrol would be 28% of petrol’s basic price Rs 39 per litre. In that scenario, the GST on petrol per litre would be only Rs 10.92. And, the state would be eligible for only Rs 5.46 as tax per litre of petrol. Currently, the state receives around Rs 20 as tax on the sale of per litre of petrol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-cannot-afford-to-lose-revenue-from-fuel-tax-fin-min/articleshow/86271347.cms||---

As part of the initiative, GGMA members will hold a camp wherein people who are currently unemployed can visit and fill in an application form mentioning their skillsets and based on requirements, garment making units will give them jobs. Members of the association stated they have organised the event in collaboration with the Gujarat chapter of BJP’s Business Cell. “A lot of people lost jobs during the pandemic and are still looking. Our idea is to build a database of people who need jobs whatever be their skillsets be it as workers in a garment manufacturing unit or even an executive level role. We are even ready to provide skill training to the aspirants,” said Vijay Purohit, president, GGMA and convener, BJP Business Cell – Gujarat. “The event is an industry initiative but is being supported by the BJP Business Cell and has been organised on the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as a mark of respect for the PM. Organising an event on the PM’s birthday will help us reach out to a larger set of people,” Purohit further said adding that job creation is the role of industry and industry associations too along with the government. Besides garment manufacturers, event clothing and apparel traders are willing to give jobs wherever possible. At least 20,000 jobs in Ahmedabad are expected to be created as per GGMA estimates. Association members have shown willingness to pay anything ranging from Rs 7,000 to Rs 30,000 a month to job aspirants.“The industry is showing signs of demand revival and we’re witnessing a 70-80% capacity utilisation ,” said a senior GGMA member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/apparel-makers-body-to-hold-yagna-to-address-unemployment/articleshow/86273495.cms||Niyati Parikh

Safdarjung, the base station for Delhi, received another 12.6mm of rainfall between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm, which took the overall monsoon total to 1,160.8mm so far. This is now the third-highest ever monsoon total recorded and the highest since 1964, according to India Meteorological (IMD) data, beating the 1975 record of 1,155.6mm of rainfall during the season. In the monsoon of 1964, Delhi had received 1,190.9mm. The all-time rainfall record for the season for Safdarjung is 1,420.3mm, which was witnessed in 1933. Thursday’s downpour also meant Delhi crossed the 400mm mark for September rainfall, with 404.4mm recorded this month till 5.30 pm on Thursday. This is now just around 13mm short of the all-time September record of 417.3mm, which was recorded in 1944. In contrast, the capital received only 404.3mm of rainfall during the entire monsoon season of 2019. Last year’s monsoon total was 576.6mm. IMD has forecast the rain to continue this week, with light to moderate showers expected on Friday. “Activity may reduce over the weekend, however, it will resume again from Monday onwards and light to moderate showers are forecast for Monday until Wednesday again. This means steady rain will continue over Delhi during this period,” said an official. RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said that conditions were currently unfavourable for the withdrawal of monsoon from northwest India until September 29, however, the situation might change depending on the weather conditions. “Delhi-NCR will continue to receive good rain,” Jenamani said. The capital recorded a maximum of 28 degrees Celsius on Thursday – six degrees below the normal temperature. Relative humidity oscillated between 88 and 98 per cent. Similar conditions are expected on Friday as well. “Light to moderate showers will once again occur across the city. It is possible the September record will be broken by Friday,” said an official. Delhi’s air quality, meanwhile, remained in the ‘satisfactory’ category on Thursday. It is expected to stay in the same category for the next few days. Rain triggers waterlogging, snarlsHeavy morning rain in parts of the city, followed by drizzle for the rest of Thursday, led to waterlogging and triggered traffic snarls at different places. While the Pul Prahladpur underpass and both carriageways of the Nangloi flyover were shut, the civic bodies reported incidents of tree falling and waterlogging on internal roads. PWD and civic officials said, the waterlogged areas included Mehrauli-Badarpur (MB) Road, Anand Parbat, Zakhira underpass, Mundka, Uttam Nagar, Rohtak Road, Sangam Vihar, Dabri, Krishna Nagar, Madhu Vihar, Chhatarpur, Badli and Kirari. South corporation reported waterlogging at Mahavir Enclave Part-1, Beri Wala Park and Bindapur.  There were reports of tree falling from Dayanand Colony in Lajpat Nagar, Safdarjung Enclave, Humayunpur and Shivalik near Malviya Nagar. “We directed our staff to remove the fallen trees,” said an official. A PWD official said compared to previous days, waterlogging complaints were less on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/raining-records-city-logs-highest-monsoon-total-in-57-yrs-at-1161mm/articleshow/86275766.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration stops mention of house floor in bank NOCs||CHANDIGARH: Even as the petition challenging floor-wise registration in Chandigarh is pending in the Punjab and Haryana high court, the UT administration has issued an order stopping mentioning of floor while issuing NoC by UT estate office to banks. Earlier, estate office staff mentioned floor while issuing NoC to bank. According to the latest order, this is against the letter and spirit of the estate law of Chandigarh. The office order issued by assistant estate officer (AEO) Harjeet Singh Sandhu reads, “It has been discussed during the meeting with the estate officer, UT, on August 19, that the estate office is mentioning share as well as floor while issuing NoC to banks for loans, which is against the letter and spirit of the estate law of Chandigarh as fragmentation of property is not allowed. So, it is circulated that fragmentation of property is not allowed in Chandigarh and there is a specific percentage of share of applicant for e.g. 20%, 30% or 50% share in the whole estate.” Sources said after the latest office order, many public and private sector banks have stopped giving loans to applicants planning to buy floors in different estate office properties in Chandigarh. UT administration had recently submitted before the high court that fragmentation of a plot was not permitted, although there is no prohibition on occupation of the site by more than one family. The affidavit submitted by UT administration stated, “The factual position is that a building plan is approved for the entire building and not for an individual floor.” The affidavit further said, “Further, no sale of defined portion/floor of building is permissible, nor any such sale has been recognised by the Chandigarh administration, except those registered during 2001 to 2007 when ‘The Chandigarh Apartment Rules 2001’ were in vogue”. The UT administration has submitted a survey report before the high court on Thursday and the case will now come up for hearing on September 20. PIL against floor wise sale filed in HCThe PIL in the high court seeks prohibitory orders on conversion of residential plots into apartments. It alleges that in recent years, floors are being sold as apartments, which will destroy the city and impose additional burden on infrastructure. The petitioners submitted before the high court that registration of property on the basis of percentage was a way to promote apartments. There was no provision for apartments as per the city’s Master Plan, but the buildings were being sold floor-wise as apartments, the petitioners had said. As such, a three-storey house was being converted into three units, putting unnecessary pressure on the city’s infrastructure, the petitioner’s counsel had submitted before the court. SLP against HC order in SCThe petitioner, in the SLP before the Supreme Court, submitted that that there was no prohibition on multiple individuals, even from distinct families, buying residential units, with a caveat that the construction of the home must be done in a cohesive manner and as a single entity. Once the plans of a house are passed and construction approved by relevant authorities, how individual residents within the house reside is firmly within the fundamental right of privacy of those individuals and it would be impermissible for authorities to adjudicate who must live within the confines of such a house, further adding that such a survey should not have been ordered amid the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mention-of-floor-in-bank-nocs-stopped/articleshow/86273501.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Alarmed by the unexpected fall, the state government on Thursday set up an 11-member committee headed by sugar commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad to study sugarcane production scenario in Uttar Pradesh and measures to be taken to restore Maharashtra’s position as the leader state. Besides Gaikwad, director of Vasantdada Sugar Cooperative Research Institute, Western India Cooperative Sugar Mills Federation and few organisations involved in production of sugar and cooperative sugar factories are members of the committee. UP’s spectacular progress is being viewed as a major challenge for sugar barons. According to a bureaucrat, last year, sugarcane production in Maharashtra stood at 106.3 lakh metric tonnes (MT) as against Uttar Pradesh’s 110.6 lakh MT, for next year, Maharashtra has projected 112 lakh MT against Uttar Pradesh’s 120 lac MT. “It’s a fact that unexpectedly Uttar Pradesh has surpassed us despite the fact that Maharashtra is among the pioneering states in sugarcane production. The committee is expected to study the Uttar Pradesh pattern and recommend if a similar experiment can be implemented in the state,” the bureaucrat said. Elaborating on the Uttar Pradesh experiment, the bureaucrat said that in 2016-17, UP farmers used Coimbatore brand sugarcane plant to enhance production. Then it was found that the Coimbatore sugarcane size was almost two-third the size of the cane in Maharashtra. “Since the size of the sugarcane was huge, naturally, production of sugar too was very high. But in the recent past, it was found that it was affected by red rot disease. When we make attempts to enhance sugarcane production, we will have to examine that aspect too,’’ he said. Further, the bureaucrat said that the committee will also examine the soils in Kanpur and Lucknow belts, where there is maximum sugarcane plantation. “By and large, in Uttar Pradesh’s sugar belt, its alluvial soil, which has capacity to sustain the tall sugarcane crop, whereas in Maharashtra, we mostly have black soil,” he pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/top-cane-producer-tag-lost-maharashtra-to-study-up-model/articleshow/86277648.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

Petrol pump owners of the district have complained to the police and to the district collector but in vain. The petrol pump owners of the district under the banner of Barmer Zila Petroleum Sangharsh Samiti submitted a memorandum to the district collector.The petrol pump owners said that if their demands are not met, then from Thursday, they will not provide petrol for government vehicles and warned to go on an indefinite strike. The petrol pump owners demanded to stop the illegal sale of biodiesel and give permission to sell biodiesel from the petrol pumps. For some time now lately, with the increase in the cost of diesel, illegal business of biodiesel kept increasing. The petrol pump owners had demanded action by submitting a memorandum to the district collector on August 25. They alleged that police and administration take action but it is merely a formality.According to one petrol pump owner Jodharam, the sale of illegal biodiesel is continuously increasing. Till now, biodiesel was sold on highways but now, it is being sold near the cities. He said that the samiti has only two demands — to ban sale of illegal biodiesel and to allow sale of biodiesel at the petrol pumps. If the administration does not agree to their demands then they will not provide petrol and diesel to government vehicles from Thursday and they will go on an indefinite strike from September 25. Petrol pumps will neither buy nor sell oil. The owners said that the increase in sale of biodiesel is directly affecting the petrol pumps. The sales in petrol pumps have fallen by 80% and the government is suffering heavy losses in revenue. Meanwhile, Barmer superintendent of police (SP) Anand Sharma said action against illegal biodiesel has been taken. Last month, 14,434 litre biodiesel was seized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fuel-stn-owners-up-in-arms-against-illegal-biodiesel-sale/articleshow/86277650.cms||---

Only 40 km of the 127-km road has been built so far as the company entrusted with the road construction left the work midway in 2016, given the tough terrain. In 2018, the work was entrusted to the Nepalese Army and in May last year, after India inaugurated the 74-km Ghatiabagarh-Lipulekh road, following which Nepal stoked the Kalapani dispute and relations were cold between the two countries, the Nepalese Army deployed one of its units to repair a mule track between Sunsera and Tinkar (the unfinished part of the road). Sources said that the Nepalese Army has now surveyed the road to be built and submitted a detailed project report (DPR). Work is expected to start from Friday. Sources added that the Nepalese government aims to complete the road within 10 years. This year, only a 7-km stretch of the road will be constructed from Sunsera to Kotedhar, for which 22-crore Nepalese rupees would be spent, the sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-gap-of-5-yrs-nepal-to-start-work-on-strategically-important-darchula-tinkar-road/articleshow/86273555.cms||Prem Punetha

It lifted a 10-litre tank of pesticide and sprayed it on the crop in minutes, taking everyone by surprise. The same task would have taken days. The drone for farmers is being promoted by the agricultural scientists of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Agriculture University (SVBPAU), who have been holding demonstrations at various villages. They say it is quite effective not only in terms of reach but also in mitigating health risks faced by farmers who walk through the fields with handheld sprayers, exposing themselves to toxic chemicals. Besides, it will help overcome the shortage of labour. “The technique is very helpful, particularly for paddy and sugarcane, where negotiating the way through every nook and corner of vegetation is not possible and several portions of the crop are left out from the spray. The cost of a drone is Rs 6 lakh and it can spray crops in one acre in 15 minutes,” said RS Sengar, agriculture scientist, department of biotechnology, College of Agriculture, SVBPAU. A Chennai-based company has tied up with the university for the supply of drones “Utilization of drone technology will go a long way in attracting youth towards farming,” said RK Mittal, vice-chancellor, SVBPAU. According to the university sources, the drone-based technique will reduce the cost of spraying by almost half as 700 ml of pesticide is used to cover an area of one acre under conventional system, but with the drone, only half the amount will be needed, reducing input cost. The high cost of equipment is still a challenge. Bhoop Singh Chaudhary, a farmer at Ditoli village, suggested, “As of now, we think that a few farmers can jointly purchase the equipment instead of one bearing the entire cost.” As of now, agricultural drones are being used for spraying pesticides on paddy, groundnut, red gram, cotton and soya bean crops in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Chhattisgarh among other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/drones-to-help-meerut-farmers-spray-crops-cut-risk-of-exposure-to-toxic-pesticide/articleshow/86271437.cms||Sandeep Rai

The HC said this while passing the interim order staying the operation of Rule 9 (1) and (3) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. Pointing out that a similar order has also been passed by the Bombay high court, the Madras HC said: "Indeed, there may have been no need to pass an independent order. However, it is submitted on behalf of the petitioners that notwithstanding the order passed by the Bombay high court, which ought to have a pan India effect, notices have been issued to the petitioners subsequently requiring them to adhere to the rules". The issue pertains to two separate pleas moved by vocalist T M Krishna and Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) challenging the rules. Rule 9 (1) of the new IT rules states a publisher shall observe and adhere to the code of ethics and norms of conduct for journalists under the Press Council guidelines and Cable TV Code. Rule 9 (3) relates to a three-tier structure to deal with complaints against publishers. Level III of this structure is an oversight mechanism by the Centre, while level I and II are self-regulation by publishers and self-regulating bodies of publishers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-stays-2-clauses-of-it-rules-says-they-may-rob-media-of-independence/articleshow/86279339.cms||Sureshkumar

This is the second such project after the underground parking lot of Sector 17. Senior engineering officers, administrative staff and officers related to the architect wing and finance attended the presentation. Representatives of two companies from Delhi and Panipat came to the city to deliver the presentation, while two companies from Chennai and Kolkata did so online. The MC has taken documents from the four companies and will now study the feasibility and other technical aspects before deciding on the tender for the project. “Since viability and financial mode is the most crucial aspect, all these areas will be studied and then a decision will be taken. As the commercial aspect is also crucial in this project due to short space and other reasons, this will also be discussed before any decision on the project is taken,” an official said. If all goes well, this will be the first parking project of the MC to come up on PPP model in Chandigarh. As Manimjara is a thickly populated area, the project will facilitate thousands of people and commuters who visit the area on a daily basis. The project will come up over 0.75 acres of land in the area, where the civic body authority has been currently running the paid parking lot. Land for the said project is situated along government schools, which is a busy area. Sources in the MC said, “Currently, the civic body authority has been running surface parking on the location in Manimajra where the multilevel parking has been planned. The project of multilevel parking is really required in this area. The area is thickly populated and there is no parking facility, which forces people to park their vehicles at unauthorised places and along the roadside.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/firms-in-fray-for-multi-level-parking-project-deliver-presentations/articleshow/86273614.cms||---
---||Jodhpur||Bhanwari Devi case: Trial to continue sans presence of FBI’s DNA expert||JODHPUR: Trial of Bhanwari Devi abduction and murder case will now proceed without the “much-awaited” prosecution witness Amber B. Carr, a DNA expert from Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the US. The period of wait for Carr granted by the Supreme Court ended on Thursday. CBI special counsel Ashok Joshi said that since Carr has not appeared in the court for examination despite repeated summons, the trial court had now decided to proceed with defence witness. “On September 21, the accused would be submitting the list of their witnesses as they would produce evidence in their defence. This would be followed by their examination,” said Joshi. Though the CBI had once again sought permission from the court to issue fresh summon to Carr, but the presiding officer Sushma Pareek refused to grant permission to the CBI and directed the defence to proceed with defence witnesses. It may be noted that the trial of the case had commenced in May 2012 with examination of the prosecution witnesses. The last prosecution witness except Carr had been examined in September 2018. But the trial had stuck since then for want of Carr, as she did not appear in the court despite 22 summons between May 2017 and September 14, 2021. The CBI had, meanwhile, moved the high court with a prayer to allow the examination of Carr through video conferencing, but the high court had rejected the plea directing the trial court to issue a fresh summon to Carr. The CBI had, then moved Supreme Court with a SLP and the apex court had granted the CBI, a period of two months to produce Carr in the court with a condition that if the CBI failed to produce her in two months, the SLP would itself be considered rejected. “Since this period was over on Thursday, the evidence of Carr was deemed shut and the court has decided to proceed with the examination of the defence witnesses from next hearing on September 21,” said Joshi. For the CBI, Carr is a very important witness as she was the one, who had carried out DNA examination of the charred bones, obtained by the CBI from a canal in Jaloda village, which had been linked to Bhanwari Devi. According to experts, in order to get Carr in the court again, the CBI may consider filing a review petition against SLP in the Supreme Court or even pitch for her examination through video conferencing, which has become popular feature of legal procedure these days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/bhanwari-case-trial-to-continue-sans-presence-of-fbis-dna-expert/articleshow/86277676.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC raps Gandhidham municipality over waste dump removal||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday came down heavily on the Gandhidham municipality over its inaction in removal of 1.70 lakh tonne dump of solid waste from the landfill site near the airport to the newly earmarked landfill site some 46 kilometres away from the town. The court criticized heavily the municipal councillors and administrators. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati was furious with the municipality for wasting time by putting forth an excuse of court’s restraint order. The judges threatened of superseding the entire municipality and the chief officer. They said, “We have been reduced to the level of now taking care of filth. You people keep on dumping of solid waste and the high court has to deal with such types of litigation. We have no problem with this, we will deal with this, but what is the problem with the Nagarpalika?” The judges further said, “We are passing an order to supersede entire Nagarpalika. They are in contempt of court. We will not tolerate anyone who undermines our order. For those who have no respect for the high court’s order, our message is loud and clear that don’t mess around with the high court. If the high court says to do it, just do it. If you are aggrieved, you go to the Supreme Court, challenge the order and do the needful.” The judges also said that the court has been noticing “nonsense on part of the civic authority”. “You are creating a trouble for the airport. The project of removal of the dump is for the safety of the airport,” the judges said and then criticized the municipal councillors, “Your councillors are good for nothing. They do 99% politics and 1% administration. The chief officer will also go home and we will recommend his supersession.” The project of remediation of the waste dump is under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and over Rs 11 crore has been allocated to Gandhidham municipality. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) submitted that if funds are transferred, it would get the work done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-raps-gandhidham-municipality-over-waste-dump-removal/articleshow/86273595.cms||---
---||Goa||Canacona councillors to oppose opening of Palolem toilet block||Poinguinim: Ruling councillors of Canacona Municipal Council (CMC) stated that they would protest the inauguration of a toilet block at Palolem as the civic body has been ‘sidelined’. Councillors condemned the “dirty politics” being resorted to by those in power over the toilet block scheduled to be inaugurated on Friday. They demanded postponement of the inauguration by at least 8 days. CMC chairperson Mario Simon Rebello said that even if the government inaugurates the Rs 1.4-crore project, the council will not inaugurate it. He blamed the Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes for politics even in the developmental works. Councillors said that the names of the chief officer, deputy chairperson, ward councillor and chairperson were not figuring in the invitation card as the project is constructed on municipal land. “How the inauguration could be done without occupancy, TCP approval and non-payment of licence fees,” Rebello questioned. “We are definitely going to protest against the inauguration and may even lock the toilet blocks if the same is inaugurated without the approval of the council,” Rebello warned. When the name of the chairperson is mentioned on the foundation stone plaque, how could it be missed out in the invitation, asked Chaudi councilor Ramakant Naik Gaunkar. Canacona MLA denied the charge of playing politics in developmental works. He said that if he was doing politics, he would never take up projects in the municipal limits. “Give me the list of development projects that have been given to him to be pursued, and which he didn't follow up,” he asked the council members. Regarding the omission of chairperson's name, Fernandes said he has nothing to do with it as the project belongs to the GTDC and that he is not to be blamed for it. However, he informed that in the list of names forwarded to the GTDC, the chairperson's name figured prominently. “He can ascertain it from the concerned department,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/canacona-councillors-to-oppose-opening-of-palolem-toilet-block/articleshow/86275831.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Rare books, paintings, awards of author Nirad Chaudhuri in eye of storm||DEHRADUN: Prithvi Narayan Chaudhuri, son of acclaimed writer Nirad C Chaudhuri, best known for his book ‘Autobiography of an Unknown Indian’, has claimed that a collection of rare books, paintings and awards belonging to his late father, estimated to be worth around Rs 3 crore, have gone missing. Prithvi, who spends his time between Dehradun and Kolkata, said the collection was lent by him to the Calcutta Club, a social club in Kolkata, soon after his father’s death in August 1999. The collection has some old and rare items like the first folio of Shakespeare, first edition of Concise Encyclopedia Britannica, original letter written by Queen Victoria, a painting presented by Queen Elizabeth II to Nirad Chaudhuri on his 100th birthday, original paintings by artists Nandalal Bose and Jamini Roy as well as original manuscript of ‘Autobiography of an Unknown Indian’. There are also original citations and awards like D Litt presented by Oxford University and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) presented by Queen Elizabeth II to the senior Chaudhuri. Prithvi says the items were part of the ‘Nirad C Chaudhuri corner’ set up by the club in its library. A few months back, though, when he wrote to the club asking for some of the items to be photographed for a documentary on his father, which is being made for his 125th birth anniversary celebrations this year, the club allegedly evaded his request, saying their rules do not allow photography and asked him to submit a script of the documentary for approval. When TOI reached out to Partha Ghose, president of Calcutta Club, about the issue, he said that the items in the Nirad C Chaudhuri corner were the club’s property. In an email response, Ghose said, “According to the records that we have, Prithvi Chaudhuri gifted everything to the club. There was no official agreement with him. He presented everything to the club. So, they are now our property.” He added that “the Nirad C Chaudhuri corner still exists in the library.” “It has been refurbished recently. It is kept very well. Any club member can go and see that. But we do not give anything on loan from there,” Ghose said. Chaudhuri told TOI that “neither I nor the makers of the documentary are in any way obliged to submit any content or script to anyone for photographing our own materials.” “These are priceless items and I don’t know what has happened to them. Either they have been damaged, stolen, sold off or simply put in the dustbin. What else can explain the club’s hesitation in getting them photographed despite being approached several times?” he said. Chaudhuri added that “it was made clear to the club that the items would come as a loan from me and they were not being given as a gift”. However, he agreed that no formal agreement was drawn up. “I gave the items in good faith for display at the club as the people who were running Calcutta Club at that time were my friends and I trusted them. Most of them have now passed away. I never believed that the present club management would act in such a manner. I have served them a legal notice and am preparing to pursue the matter in court.” (with inputs by Priyanka Dasgupta in Kolkata)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rare-books-paintings-awards-of-author-nirad-chaudhuri-in-eye-of-storm/articleshow/86273659.cms||Atul Sethi

---||Nagpur||Nagpur, Patna have highest murder rate in country: NCRB data||NAGPUR: National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)’s 2020 data has revealed that Nagpur and Patna have the highest murder rate (3.9) in the country per one lakh population, followed by Jaipur (3.1) and Delhi (2.8). The method of calculating the murder rate, using the population census of 2011 — when Nagpur had 25 lakh population — was, however, challenged as an “erroneous one” by the city’s former and current top cops. According to the senior cops, Nagpur, with 97 murders in 2020, has a higher rate than Mumbai (148 murders) because of the population density of 2011, and not as a fallout of law and order. Former city police chief (CP) BK Upadhyay said a lot of correspondence had been made with NCRB, right from the time when K Venkatesham was CP (2014-15), pointing out the disparity between the present population (around 40 lakh) and that in 2011, which is being made the basis of calculation of the current crime rate. Upadhyay said, “NCRB adds the preventive actions of proactive policing to the number of offences registered, which increases the crime rate. The policing which helps the society goes against the department, when it comes to crime rate calculation. When a lower population figure is used to calculate, the percentage increases.” Though the overall numbers of violent crimes have been steadily decreasing in Nagpur, certain crimes like murder, rape, theft and a few such others have blotted the image. “Serious offences had certainly fallen by 20-25% when I handed over the charge,” said Upadhyay. NCRB data put Nagpur, with a rate of 25.0 per one lakh population for violent crimes, at third place in the state after Mumbai (184) and Pune (50.5). The data also showed Nagpur and Surat had the second highest number of murders in the country over romantic relationships (11) after Delhi (17). Around 15 murders were related to monetary disputes in Nagpur, which is the third highest in the country for this motive. Around 23 murders took place due to personal vendetta. Four senior citizens were among the ones murdered in Nagpur in 2020. CP Amitesh Kumar said Nagpur historically has a background of a high number of murder cases which, on an average, hovers around 100 annually. “In the last few years, the commissionerate had a population surge as several villages from the Nagpur district and three talukas were inducted, which made the crime rate (crime per one lakh population) higher,” Kumar said. In cases of hurt, especially the ones involving weapons, Nagpur had the highest crime rate (4.1) in the state, followed by Mumbai (3.4) and Pune (3.1). Nagpur's 82.7 crime rate in theft cases is the highest in the state, surpassing Mumbai (33.9) and Pune (31.0). In the crime rate of automobile thefts too, Nagpur (47.0) is the highest in the state, followed by Pune (19.3) and Mumbai (15.2). Nagpur's rate of burglary (27.5) is also more than Mumbai (8.9) and Pune (6.8). Citizen activist Tejinder Singh Renu said that by and large, Nagpur is a safe city. “Under CP Amitesh Kumar, the city police are doing a fine job of keeping the crime rate under control,” Renu stated. He added, “Citizens should also understand their duty to avoid roaming around in deserted areas during odd hours. We can't keep our houses/shops unlocked because of carelessness and then complain about obvious consequences and an unsafe society.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-patna-have-highest-murder-rate-in-country-ncrb-data/articleshow/86275095.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Delhi||Delhi: 9-year-old girl was raped, court told; mother to be paid Rs 2.5 lakh||NEW DELHI: A city court was informed by Delhi Police that a nine-year-old Dalit girl, who was said to have died due to electrocution at a crematorium in Delhi Cantonment when she had gone to fetch water from a cooler, was raped and suffocated to death. A priest, one of the accused, mentioned this in his disclosure statement. Four people — Radhey Shyam, Kuldeep Singh, Laxmi Narayan and Salim Ahmed — were arrested in the case and booked for gang rape, murder and criminal intimidation and under POCSO Act. Disclosure statements are not admissible in court unless they are corroborated by additional evidence. However, in this case, the statement is supported by forensic and autopsy reports. The submissions were made by police before Additional Sessions Judge Ashutosh Kumar in reply to an application filed by Delhi Commission for Women seeking interim compensation for the victim’s family. The court granted Rs 2.5 lakh to the victim’s mother. The accused purportedly also made extra judicial confessions before two witnesses when the public barged into the crematorium, nabbed them and started asking them questions. Police claimed they confessed privately to the witnesses that “they had raped and murdered the girl and, later, forcefully cremated her”. The accused also pleaded with them to get the matter sorted. The FSL report stated that “no biological fluid, DNA trace or sample was found on the water cooler, which clearly suggested that the girl was not electrocuted”. The autopsy report suggested that after examining the body parts, the doctors could not find any evidence related to electrocution, the reply stated. The two witnesses, in statements recorded under Section 161 CrPC, claimed they saw Shyam and Singh taking the body of the girl towards the water cooler. A witness, who gave a statement under Section 164 (examination by magistrate) CrPC, stated that he “saw Kuldeep and Shyam carrying the body of the girl towards the water cooler. Seeing that, they thought the girl was not feeling well and she was being taken towards the cooler to make her drink water”. The police report stated that according to the disclosure statements of the co-accused, Shyam and Singh took the girl from the veranda to the hall of the priest where he allegedly raped her while Singh held her hands. Shyam kept his hand on the girl’s mouth due to which she could not breathe and died of suffocation. After that, all of them gathered and decided to cremate the girl’s body to eliminate the evidence of rape and murder. A search by police of the browsing history of Shyam’s mobile phone revealed that he was “addicted to porn and sexually arousing material”. He had “visited around 1,300 porn websites from June 1 to July 30 and used to show the same content to the girl to arouse her”. Police further claimed that he used the smartphone only for browsing porn as no call logs were found on it. He kept the phone secret from everyone. It was further claimed by police that Shyam had tried to manipulate the crematorium register by giving a false time of death (5.30pm), though she was seen alive in CCTV footage at 5.42pm. He also mentioned the reason of death as illness instead of electrocution. The victim’s father was allegedly referred to by casteist remarks by Shyam. He also allegedly referred to the girl by casteist slurs while making the extra judicial confession in front of one of the witnesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/9-year-old-girl-was-raped-court-told-mother-to-be-paid-rs-2-5-lakh/articleshow/86273677.cms||Usha Das

Unlike every year when monsoon withdrawal starts from May 16 onwards, this year south-west monsoon will have an extra and extended spell. IMD in its bulletin on the monsoon on Thursday stated that many parts in the country, including Rajasthan, will get an extended spell of the monsoon this year. On Thursday, mild to heavy rainfall continued at many places in the Udaipur and Kota divisions of the state, while in other parts scattered rainfall was witnessed. Gadhi (Banswara) and Bhungra (Basnwara) received a rainfall of 50mm which was highest in the state. It was followed by a rainfall varying from 40mm to 10mm at many places in the state. People in Jaipur woke up to a comparatively pleasant morning as a minimum temperature of 24.8°C was recorded in the city. It was followed by a cloudy afternoon due to which scattered rainfall was witnessed at many localities in the city. At some places, it was clear sky with a sunny day while some places and localities in the city witnessed rainfall. “This happens when we have scattered rainfall that only covers certain parts in the city,” said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. On the extension of monsoon, an officer with Jaipur Met office, said, “Usually monsoon starts withdrawing from Rajasthan from September 15. However, this year the climatic conditions suggested that eastern and western parts of the state will continue to get monsoon activity till September 27.” In this season so far at least 10 districts in the state have deficit rainfall. “In the coming days there is a forecast of rainfall at districts including Sirohi, Jodhpur, Jalore and Jodhpur which are still in the category of deficit rainfall. Hopefully the extended monsoon can bring cheers in this region and will surely bring more rainfall in the whole monsoon season compared to average rainfall of the state,” the officer added. In its forecast Jaipur Met office stated that mild to moderate showers will continue for the next 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/monsoon-to-have-extended-spell-till-sept-27-in-raj-met/articleshow/86277722.cms||---

The directives come following reports of the fresh potholes that have surfaced in many parts of the city after heavy rainfall. The potholes had been filled recently. “The city received heavy rainfall over the past few days. I have taken the note of the potholes that pose serious threat to the lives of motorists. I have asked the PWD officials to carry out repairs on a war footing so that people can bid adieu to Lord Ganesh,” Kulkarni said. Motorists have complained that there is no road in the city that is free of potholes. “It is not a pothole, rather it is like a crater on the road. This is not only affecting the vehicles but even the health of the riders,” said Keshav Thorat, resident of Ashok Nagar, Satpur. The citizens are vexed with the pothole ridden streets at the time when the festivities are going on. Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav too has directed the public works department of the civic body to start road repairs on a war footing. “We have been carrying out the process of clearing potholes on the regular basis. Commissioner Kailas Jadhav has also asked us to ensure motorable roads during the rainy season,” said Shivkumar Vanjari, city engineer of NMC. The officer stated that the department had so far identified 11,299 potholes and was in the process of clearing them. “We have cleared highest numbers of potholes in New Nashik division – 3,270, which is followed by 2,311 in Satpur division, 1,951 in Panchavati, 1,818 in Nashik East, 1,252 in Nashik Road and 697 in Nashik West,” Vanjari added. The officer said that there was no system to find out what numbers of potholes are still to be mended. “The city has 2,500 km of roads and hence, how many potholes have to be cleared cannot be answered. However, we have asked the employees to cover every visible and noticeable pothole by murum when it is raining and by tar, when it is dry,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-mayor-fix-potholes-before-anant-chaturdashi/articleshow/86238041.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Delhi: ASI sent to prison again for graft, 25 years after he was released on bail||NEW DELHI: Over 25 years after being released on bail in a corruption case, a Delhi Police officer was sent back to jail by the high court on Wednesday, after it decided his appeal pending since 2001 and ordered him to serve remaining part of the prison sentence. Justice Anu Malhotra dismissed the appeal filed by the assistant sub-inspector (ASI) who had challenged the conviction by a trial court in 2001, for demanding bribe of Rs 10,000 to settle a case. ASI Ram Naresh Tiwari’s three-year jail sentence was kept in abeyance after his appeal was admitted. “The appeal is thus dismissed and the bail granted to the appellant vide order dated 03.05.2001 suspending the sentence is withdrawn and the accused who has as per the nominal roll, undergone 16 days of detention as an undertrial from 16.06.1996 is directed to be taken into custody forthwith,” the court noted in the order dismissing his appeal, nearly 20 years after it was filed. According to CBI, which filed the chargesheet in the case in 1996 itself soon after nabbing the ASI red handed, Tiwari was posted at Shanti Nagar police post, falling under the jurisdiction of Keshav Puram police station. The investigating agency said Tiwari abused his official position as a public servant and demanded Rs 10,000 as bribe from Sunil Aggarwal, against whom a complaint of alleged kidnapping had been filed by a third party. According to the prosecution, Tiwari was given the charge of investigating the case in which a father claimed his daughter was kidnapped by Aggarwal and his friends. Later, it turned out that the kidnapped girl who was a major, was in love with Aggarwal’s friend and the duo got married, prompting the father to drop the complaint. However, even after the complaint was withdrawn, ASI Tiwari harassed Aggarwal and threatened to prosecute him unless he paid bribe, CBI said. Aggarwal didn’t pay the bribe and instead approached the investigating agency, which set up a trap and caught Tiwari red handed with a bribe amount of Rs 5000 recovered from his work place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/asi-sent-to-prison-again-for-graft-25-years-after-he-was-released-on-bail/articleshow/86273782.cms||Abhinav Garg

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Bandhavgarh tigress was caught in electric trap & hacked to death||BHOPAL: Bandhavgarh’s “most beautiful tigress” met an extremely gruesome end – hacked in the face and head as it lay paralyzed in an electric trap. The killers turned out to be members of the most primitive tribe group of Madhya Pradesh, the Baigas, say forest officers. Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (BTR) field director Vincent Rahim told TOI that three suspects -- Shivkumar, Kailash and Babulal Baiga -- have been arrested on inputs from informers and they have confessed to killing tigress T32. They are residents of Kachoha village in the Manpur buffer zone of BTR. During interrogation, they said that they had laid an electric wire trap from a 11-KV line to poach wild boars, say officers.  The trap was set around 9pm on August 27. Two hours later they came to know that a tigress had got snared in the trap. To ensure that the tigress was dead, they hacked it repeatedly in the face and head with an axe, said officials. The poachers broke two canines and yanked out claws and whiskers, say officers. Then, the trio stuffed the carcass in a sack, weighed it down with two heavy stones and threw it into a well. One of the stones got untied and it surfaced on the morning of August 31. Search on for 4 th suspect who has claws, caninesForest officers said Baigas do hunt wild animals for food, but they have taboos against killing certain species. “Their intention was to poach wild boars but the tigress fell into the trap. In any case, the charges against them will be the same,” said an officer. The trio has been booked under Wildlife Protection Act. Teams are out looking for a fourth suspect who has the claws, canines and whiskers. T32 was a popular and much photographed tigress. The magnificent stripes that made it famous stood out even in death and decay. It was 14 years old and known among locals as ‘Amanalabali Baghin’ since she was sighted frequently in the Amanalabali area inside the tiger reserve, but never bothered any human. The well where it was found is in Manpur buffer zone near Tamna Basa village, about 50km from Umaria district headquarters and 470 km east of Bhopal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bandhavgarh-tigress-was-caught-in-electric-trap-hacked-to-death/articleshow/86273679.cms||P Naveen
---||Allahabad||HC seeks update on death of Mainpuri girl in a month||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Thursday directed the state government and the police authorities to update the court after a month with the progress in the investigation into the 2019 mysterious death of a 16-year-old Mainpuri girl student, who was found hanging in her school in suspicious circumstances. The family members of the deceased girl had alleged that she was sexually assaulted and killed. The UP DGP, who was present before the court on the second consecutive day on Thursday, informed it that a new special investigation team (SIT) has been formed to investigate the case. The court exempted the personal appearance of the DGP for the next hearing date of the matter. Besides, the court issued a general direction that the state government must issue an order directing its officers to complete the investigation of rape cases within two months or within the time limit as per amended provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). In addition to it, the court directed the police authorities that they must ensure that family members of the girl concerned are not pressurized during investigation, and further to ensure their safety. Hearing a public interest litigation filed by one Mahendra Pratap Singh, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Anil Kumar Ojha also directed the state government that investigating officers must be given proper training from time to time to teach them how to investigate such cases and collect the ‘material evidence’ scientifically. In the PIL, the petitioner had alleged that the police were not fairly investigating the said incident, rather they have been protecting the actual accused. The petitioner had alleged that the SIT formed for the investigation was not acting independently. On the last occasion on Wednesday, the court had asked the lawyers of the high court Bar to assist it in the case. Hence, following the court’s direction, senior advocate Amrendra Nath Singh, who is the president of the High Court Bar Association, appeared before the court on Thursday. He requested the court to monitor the probe of the case. Considering the request of the Bar, the court directed concerned authorities to apprise it with the progress in the investigation of the case on the expiry of one month and ordered to list the case on the expiry of the said period. During the course of hearing, the court raised its concern on the issue of poor rate of conviction in the country, saying, “We are aware of the fact that the conviction rate in India is just above 6%, the reason is poor or manipulated investigation by the police. Most of the time material evidences are not collected in a scientific manner and hence, experts fail to reach any conclusion resulting in acquittal of accused persons in most of the cases.” During the course of hearing, additional advocate general Manish Goyal, representing the state government, informed the court that the concerned investigation officers, ASP and DSP, who were initially investigating the case, have been suspended by the state government. Further, a new SIT has been formed to investigate the case afresh. Senior advocate Amrendra Nath Singh, while assisting the court informed it that the mother of the girl in the FIR had alleged that her daughter used to complain that she knew some secrets of the school and that is why the principal was torturing her. He further said that the girl had called her mother just a day prior to her death and said that she was getting threats for her life, but when the family members tried to talk to the principal, she paid no heed. On which, the court suggested that the investigating officer must collect the call details of the concerned phone numbers which can be material evidence in the case. Now, the case will be listed again after expiry of one month for hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-update-on-death-of-mainpuri-girl-in-a-month/articleshow/86275866.cms||---

While several voices from the academia and social sector condemned the act of the enforcement agencies, officials said they are investigating receipt of funds and their alleged diversion for other purposes. The ED’s investigation is based on an FIR by the Delhi Police which had filed a case last year after an ‘inspection’ by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) found alleged violations of child rights at two of Mander’s children homes in Delhi.The Delhi Police had filed cases under the Juvenile Justice Act and the IPC on the complaint of the NCPCR. Mander and his Centre for Equity Studies run the two children's homes in south Delhi. The ED is investigating funds received by his NGO and its alleged diversion to activities other than the purpose it came for. The Centre for Equity Studies said, "This is a continuation of harassment and coercion of CES and Harsh Mander for being an outspoken and passionate defender of human rights." "CES has cooperated with every government agency by providing all organisational details requested by the agencies including balance sheets and other financial and programmatic documents. The entire set of organisational documents and records have been submitted more than once to the government agencies," the release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ed-conducts-searches-on-manders-premises/articleshow/86275910.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||District reports 2nd highest number of child abuse cases||Thiruvananthapuram: As per the crime statistics released by the state police for the first half of the year, the district has reported the second highest number of cases of sexual abuse against children in the state. From January to June this year, as many as 233 cases were registered in the district under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.  This includes 48 cases reported under city police limits and 185 cases reported under rural district police limits. Malappuram tops the chart with 264 cases. The cases reported in the state capital in the first six months of the year are more than half the cases reported during the entirety of the previous year. In 2020, the total number of cases reported was 351. Advocate N Sunanda, the chairperson of child welfare committee (CWC) said the change in lifestyle in the pandemic era could be attributed to the rise in sexual abuse cases of children. ''We have noticed that there has been an increase in sexual abuse cases of teenage girls, which often involves love affair and subsequent eloping,'' Sunanda said. With the new norm of online classes giving children access to smartphones, children have become more vulnerable to such crimes, she said. S K Ratheesh, district child protection officer under Childline project said while the rise in crimes is a concerning issue, there is also a positive side to it. ''More number of cases reported means more children are aware of the crimes they face and are brave enough to speak out. This also means the parents are also supporting the children ignoring social stigma,” Ratheesh said. However, he said the parents need to be more careful to prevent sexual exploitation of their wards. “Our past studies have proven that in majority of cases related to sexual abuse of toddlers, abusers happened to be a close relative or someone who is close to the family. The parents need to draw a line on how much liberty can be given to outsiders in their households, no matter how close he or she is to the family,” he said. The parents also need to control their use of digital communication devices in the presence of children as the internet is becoming a major platform through which abusers trap the children. Parents spending too much time on social media will generate curiosity among the children to try their hands on social media too, which eventually leads to traps, Ratheesh said, adding that this pattern was noticed in several cases they attended in the recent past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/district-reports-2nd-highest-number-of-child-abuse-cases/articleshow/86273785.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar: Government ‘deposits’ Rs 967 crore in accounts of 2 Katihar children||KATIHAR: Two Class VI students of a government school in Katihar briefly had more millions in the bank than what their multiplication skills would have enabled them to calculate, courtesy a supposedly "software error" that credited Rs 905 crore and Rs 62 crore to their respective accounts. Gurucharan Biswas and Ashish Kumar's short-lived windfall was "rectified immediately" after Uttar Bihar Gramin Bank realised what had happened, district magistrate Udayan Mishra said on Thursday even as the two students recounted their fleeting tryst with crores of rupees they never got to spend. On Tuesday, one Ranjit Das of Khagaria had been arrested for allegedly refusing to return a portion of the Rs 5.5 lakh wrongly credited to his account with the same bank in March last year. He told the police that he thought the money was part of a direct benefit transfer promised by PM Narendra Modi. In Katihar, both students received the mistakenly credited amounts in their accounts on Wednesday. They both study in a government school at Pastiya village of Azamnagar block. "Due to a banking software error, one account was showing an inflated amount. In another instance, the amount appeared only in the printout of a receipt," the district magistrate said. Lalan Biswas, mukhiya of Pastiya village, said, "Children receive money in their bank accounts every month to buy uniforms and books. When one of our students checked his balance on Thursday, he was surprised to see the amount. Another student did the same and he was in for a surprise, too." When the students tried to withdraw some money, they realised that the "credits" were notional, Biswas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-deposits-rs-967cr-in-a/cs-of-2-katihar-kids/articleshow/86271508.cms||---

While the police has claimed that the man took his own life, family members and Congress MLAs have sought a thorough probe in the matter. Accused Kasim Hayat was nabbed after forensic tests revealed that the meat he was ferrying on his scooter on Tuesday was beef. Hayat was taken in police custody along with others. On Wednesday night, Hayat hung himself to death inside the Godhra B Division police station. Senior officers rushed to the police station in wake of the incident. Hayat’s body was sent to the SSG Hospital in Vadodara for a post mortem by a panel of doctors. While cops maintained that Hayat ended his life, three MLAs from Congress — Gyasuddin Sheikh, Javed Pirzada and Imran Khedawala — have sought a thorough probe and said that relatives claim police torture killed their kin. In a letter to the state’s director general of police, the MLAs said that the family had claimed that they had met the deceased and he had revealed that he was beaten up by the police. They demanded that if the police was found responsible for the incident, action should be taken against those involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/row-over-custodial-death-of-accused-in-beef-ferrying-case/articleshow/86272205.cms||---

On Wednesday, the CBI raided offices of the varsity and is likely to camp at the university for the next few days. The four-member CBI team will file its report after examining documents pertaining to the case. The team also summoned eight staffers of the university to record their statements. The case is related to former vice-chancellor J L Kaul and his OSD (Officer on Special Duty) D S Negi who had allegedly awarded the central university’s affiliation to colleges between 2014 and 2016. It was alleged that they provided affiliation to private institutes and colleges in contravention of the rules. Kaul was forced to resign as VC after the irregularities came to light in 2017. CBI had registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) and later cases were registered against the VC, his OSD, other public servants and six private institutions. In July as well, the central investigative agency had conducted raids at 14 spots in Dehradun, Srinagar and Noida in connection with the case. During the searches, three bank lockers belonging to the accused were also examined in which documents pertaining to the case were recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cbi-raids-garhwal-university-over-affiliation-fraud/articleshow/86273774.cms||Mohammad Anab

Land of government schools cannot be sold, leased or mortgaged for any other purpose. The commission issued that it was hearing a petition filed in the name of students of the Govt LP School and Model Nursery, Palakkad, against the move to build a public toilet in the school compound area where students had planted several trees that made the campus green. The petitioners submitted that building a public toilet in the compound would affect the safety and security of children studying there. They complained that all the trees that the student planted had been pulled down. The district education director responding to a notice issued by the commission said that 560 students were studying in the school coming under the Palakkad municipality. They submitted that the local body had pulled down the compound wall at midnight on Oct 19, 2019, using general education funds and attempted to begin the construction activity.  The toilet was coming up near the well, which was the source of drinking water for the school. Hearing the petition, the child rights commission member K Nazeer said that according to the Kerala Education Act, 1968 Sec 5B, no property belonging to government educational institutions should be used for any other purposes.

---||Goa||Goa average rainfall crosses normal level this season||PANAJI: The average rainfall in Goa this year has crossed the normal value for a complete monsoon season, recording 2,975mm on September 14. During last year’s monsoon, this level was breached around August 13. Except for the month of August, the southwest monsoon has provided normal or higher than normal rainfall, the India meteorological department (IMD) reported. The intense activity of around 14 days in July even resulted in flood-like situation in many parts of Goa. During 14 days, from July 11 to 24, 122% of normal rainfall was recorded. In a sharp contrast to that, the absence of any significant weather enhancing system in August resulted in a 49% deficit than the normal amount of rain. In September, rainfall has been higher than normal, except for September 16. “As on September 16 the seasonal total is 5% higher than normal. With a relatively weaker period of monsoon for about 3-4 more days, rainfall activity is again likely to become active from around September 21,” IMD scientist, Rahul M said. According to meteorologist and retired NIO scientist, MR Ramesh Kumar, the crossing of the normal value of the state average rainfall brings out the intra-seasonal variation of the monsoon. “This intra-seasonal variability is driven by the active and break spells of monsoon over the state. The peak monsoon month of August contributed very little as compared to the peak monsoon month of August 2020. That’s why we had to wait till September 14 to reach those values. The main reason for this is the absence of convective systems over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal during August,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-average-rainfall-crosses-normal-level-this-season/articleshow/86276140.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Mysuru||Dasara elephants checked-in to Mysuru palace||Mysuru: Dasara elephants led by Abhimanyu were given a rousing welcome at the Mysuru Palace where they will stay till the culmination of the 10-day Dasara celebration on October 15. The team of elephants which are the centre of attraction of the Dasara celebration was greeted with sugarcane and ‘modaka’, a sweet dish, followed by a special gajapooja at Jayamarthanda Dwara, the main gate of Mysuru Palace. District minister ST Somashekar offered the elephants a special dish and welcomed them while Chamundi temple chief priest Shashishekar Dixit conducted the pooja. The Elephants had halted at Aranya Bhavana, the forest department headquarter, in Ashokapuram from Monday. Led by lead elephant Abhimanyu, the caparisoned elephants left Aranya Bhavan early in the day and walked all the way to Mysuru Palace. Elephants passed through Ashoka Circle, RTO circle, Ramaswamy circle, Chamaraja Double Road and Gun House Circle to reach the palace. The elephants covered the distance of 3km in 55 minutes. Police provided a guard of honour even as they were showered with flower petals. Hundreds of policemen and forest staffers guarded the elephants along the route. Traffic was diverted on the route to ensure hassle-free movement of elephants. Somashekar said the government will soon hold a cabinet meeting to select the special guest to inaugurate the Mysuru Dasara soon after the on-going session. Dasara will be opened atop Chamundi Hills on October 7. MLA SA Ramadas and mayor Sunanda Palanethra were present. ‘Only eight nights this Navratri’ Sri Chamundeshwari Temple chief priest Shashishekar Dixit said this year there will be only eight nights during Dasara celebration due to changes in the ‘Tithi’ in the Hindu calendar. “This happens once every three years or five years and there is no concern about it. But all poojas and rituals that are conducted during the celebration will go on as usual,” he said. Challenge is to keep elephants in the pink As Mysuru Dasara is restricted within the confines of Mysuru Palace this year too, keeping the elephants in good health is a challenging task for forest officers. Deputy conservator of forests (wildlife) V Kariklan, told TOI that as special ration is provided to elephants during their stay in the palace, they’re likely to gain weight. This year too elephants will not be taken outside the palace premises for rehearsal. This year there will be eight elephants – Abhimanyu, Gopalswamy, Vikrama, Ashwathama (a first timer), Dhananjaya, Cauvery, Lakshmi and Chaitra, in the celebration as against five elephants last year, he said, adding all elephants are hale and healthy. Ashwathama, Lakshmi ‘panic’ Ashwatthama, the fresher, and 20-year-old Lakshmi, participating in the Dasara for the third time, panicked on their way to Mysuru Palace but didn’t create any trouble. Ashwaathama jumped on the footpath while Lakshmi jerked following honking by a truck.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/dasara-elephants-checked-in-to-mysuru-palace/articleshow/86271713.cms||---

Students said they have to wait to complete 18 years to attend the college. First year classes will start from October 1. “I will be 18 in December, which means I can’t go for vaccination before that. As vaccination certificate is mandatory for attending classes, I will have to miss my classes,” said Shlok Dubey. He is worried that that he may be in big trouble if online classes are also stopped. “I have heard that colleges may stop e-classes once offline classes resume. How to attend classes after that will be a big question before me,” said Dubey. Even girl students are also facing same problem. “I can’t change my age. Even college has given me admission. Now, issue is that how to attend classes as I will complete 18 years in November. Despite being eligible I won’t be able to attend offline classes,” said a student Shruti Maheshwari. Higher education department had recently issued guidelines for opening colleges and universities in the state from September 15. Students with 50% strength and at least first dose of vaccination can attend classes on the campuses. Students and college staff are asked to submit their certificates of first dose of vaccination. Hostel facility will be available for the students only after they submit consent letter of their parents and vaccination certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/vac-cert-mandate-catch-22-situation-for-u-18-students/articleshow/86273818.cms||Ramendra Singh

---||Hyderabad||Nizam’s rule was over, but legal troubles continued for next 8 years||Hyderabad: ‘Operation Polo’ or the so-called ‘Police Action’ on September 17, 1948, brought a swift end to the rule of Asaf Jahi dynasty in Hyderabad, but there was no such quick resolution to the legal troubles of Nizam VII Mir Osman Ali Khan, which continued for the next eight years. After the fall of Hyderabad, the Nizam continued to be the administrator technically till January 25, 1950, as all government orders or ‘firmans’ were issued in his name. On January 26, 1950, the Nizam was sworn-in as ‘Raj Pramukh’ or governor of Hyderabad state — a position he held till the merger of Hyderabad with Andhra to form Andhra Pradesh on November 1, 1956. But during 1948-1956, the Nizam faced numerous charges from various quarters, though most were found to be unsubstantiated. The complaints included secret business deals with foreign firms, plans to flee with vast wealth, defamation for alleged statements against a Muslim religious sect and non-payment of wages for goldsmiths. The then ministry of states (home ministry) sought details on each complaint and referred them to Hyderabad state for investigation. Records from the National Archives of India (NAI) show that a complaint was lodged by one S Mohammad Ahmad Alavi with the Centre for Nizam’s alleged interference in religious matters as ‘Raj Pramukh’. The NAI document (Progs., Nos. 17(36)-H(P), 1954, ministry of states) refers to Nizam’s statements published in ‘Shiraz’, a local weekly. “It is clearly an imputation concerning a religious sect and a collection of persons,” the complainant claimed. The complainant’s grouse against the Nizam was that he did not permit the leader of a Muslim religious sect to hold a congregation (Majlis) in Hyderabad. The questions raised included whether the ‘Raj Pramukh’ could issue royal decrees on religious matters, interfere in religious affairs of subjects and side with one group while condemning the other. And if his orders were binding on the citizens. In another case, a group of six goldsmiths led by Ibrahimputtan Raghavloo (National Archives of India, Progs., Nos. 2(3)-H, 1953) alleged that Nizam owed them Rs 65,000 as wages for eight years. The correspondence between Centre and the state shows that as ‘Raj Pramukh’ the Nizam enjoyed protection from prosecution under criminal laws. Moreover, the above cases as well others were found to be frivolous and they were eventually dismissed by the central government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nizams-rule-was-over-but-legal-troubles-continued-for-next-8-years/articleshow/86275991.cms||Syed Akbar

They said they are afraid to step out of their house as the killers are still roaming free. Ajaypal Singh Middukhera, Vicky’s younger brother, has written a letter to director general of police (DGP), Punjab alleging that his family fears threat from the killers, who are still at large. Ajaypal said, “We are unable to come out of our house as we fear that the killers might target me and my family as they are away from the clutches of Mohali police. I have also written to DGP Punjab in this regard.” In his letter to the DGP, Ajay said that after a over month of the killing, Mohali police have not been able to trace, identify and arrest the killers. “Now, almost one month has elapsed since the date of the murder but there has been no headway in investigation of the present case. I apprehend that crucial evidences would vanish with the delay of investigation. It is therefore humbly prayed that the investigation be conducted in an accurate and speedy manner so that justice can be given to the victim and his family,” he stated. Mohali police claimed that Middukhera’s killers have been identified. “One of the gangsters is most wanted in Haryana whereas the other is most wanted in Delhi. They are hardcore criminals involved in murders and extortion,” said Mohali senior superintendent of police (SSP) Satinder Singh. Vicky Middukhera was killed in Sector 71 on August 7 in the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vicky-middukheras-family-fears-threat-from-his-killers/articleshow/86273862.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Hyderabad||How Indian Constitution came to Laiq Ali’s rescue||Hyderabad: Laiq Ali, prime minister of princely Hyderabad, was the most controversial politician and he ran a parallel administration to the Nizam, even as Hyderabad was in talks with the Indian Union on the merger of the princely state during 1947-1948. But, despite all the controversies surrounding Laiq Ali, the newly-adopted Constitution of India came to his rescue after he was accused of escape from government detention. It was a different thing that Laiq Ali had no faith in the Constitution. Laiq Ali was detained on December 19, 1948 a couple of months after the Operation Polo or the so-called Police Action on September 17, 1948. He escaped from the detention at his bungalow on March 3, 1950. As the law under which Laiq Ali was detained in 1948 was superseded after the Constitution came into existence on January 26, 1950, the question arose whether Laiq Ali could be held guilty of escape from detention. Chief justice RS Naik of the Hyderabad high court in his judgment on August 11, 1950 held that the detention of Laiq Ali after January 26, 1950 cannot be held as legal and those who helped him to escape have incurred no criminal liability. According to documents (Progs., Nos. 1(36)-H, 1950, Ministry of States 1950) available with the National Archives of India (NAI), Laiq Ali was served with an order by inspector-general of police A Patro under Section (2) of the Public Safety and Public Interest Regulation No.8 of 1358 Fasli year. A military and later a police guard was posted all round his bungalow. He continued to stay in his bungalow till March 3, 1950 when he escaped. He was not served with any new order of detention under Section (3) of the Central Act IV of 1950 after it was passed on February 25, 1950. He had not also been formally arrested in connection with the charges subsequently preferred against him. The high court held that after the Constitution came into being, the laws under which Laiq Ali was detained ( Hyderabad Regulation and Hyderabad Penal Code) cannot be sustained. The court had freed all those accused of helping, conspiring and abetting the escape of Laiq Ali from the detention. As many as 26 people were accused besides Laiq Ali. Of them 17 were taken into custody while the remaining were absconding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/how-indian-constitution-came-to-laiq-alis-rescue/articleshow/86276008.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Kochi||‘KIIFB’s parameters very strong’||Kochi: The global ratings agency Fitch Ratings has assessed that Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board’s (KIIFB) is ‘very strong’ in parameters like status, ownership, control and support record and financial implications of default, and ‘strong’ socio-political implications of default. The agency has affirmed KIIFB’s long-term foreign and local-currency issuer default ratings (IDR) at ‘BB’, with a stable outlook. Fitch has also affirmed KIIFB’s Rs 50 billion medium-term note (MTN) programme and the Rs 21.5 billion 9.723% senior secured notes due 2024 under the programme at ‘BB’. The notes, issued by KIIFB directly, are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Kerala state (BB/stable) acting through the finance department of Kerala. While describing about ‘very strong’ in status, ownership, and control, Fitch Ratings said, “KIIFB is a statutory body set up by the government of Kerala (GoK) under the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Act, 1999. It has a special legal status whereby its liabilities are automatically transferred to the state in a default”. “KIIFB follows the GoK’s plan to finance and implement various infrastructure projects and its board consists of existing and former government officers as well as independent members. In addition, a fund trustee and advisory commission acts as KIIFB’s trustee to ensure there is no diversion of funds,” Fitch Ratings said. Clarifying how KIIFB is ‘very strong’ in support record, Fitch said, “The state government is statutorily mandated to guarantee the payment of principal and interest of any funds that KIIFB proposes to raise. In addition, the state government has created a dedicated ring-fenced fund to help KIIFB’s debt servicing. The fund draws on the entire petroleum cess and a progressive step-up share of up to 50% of the motor-vehicle tax collected by the state”. According to Fitch Ratings, KIIFB has ‘very strong’ financial default implications. “KIIFB is a proxy financing platform for large-scale and capital-intensive state projects. The KIIFB had approved projects with total investment exceeding Rs 630 billion as of end-July 2021 and had made project disbursements of around Rs 129 billion. Fitch regards KIIFB’s creditworthiness as directly linked to that of the GoK, with the direct guarantee embedded in the legal portion of the Act. KIIFB’s insolvency would directly affect the GoK’s credibility,” the ratings agency said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kiifbs-parameters-very-strong/articleshow/86271730.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Kolkata||Second Covid jab share now 60% at Kolkata Municipal Corporation units||KOLKATA: Even as queues for the second vaccine dose that had suddenly lengthened in end-August have started thinning at private hospitals this week, civic clinics have seen a steady swell in the number of recipients with second dose recipients outnumbering first dose ones by a ratio of 60:40. In the past 10 days, the demand for second dose has overtaken the first, said a KMC official. According to a KMC medical officer at a Garia clinic, the demand for a second dose has picked up slowly but steadily in past three weeks. “Even a month ago, we would reserve 30% of total allocation for recipients of the second dose. Witnessing a surge in the number of second dose recipients in the past 10 days, we have decided to allocate the lion’s share of our vaccines to the recipients of second dose,” said a KMC official. Several private hospitals, on the other hand, have seen the number of recipients drop to a third of what it was a fortnight ago. With two big consignments arriving recently and civic centres inoculating a large number, the crowd has subsided quickly, said hospital officials. According to a KMC official, while the civic brass has been sending 250 doses of Covishield daily to a vaccination clinic (on an average), the Covishield mega centres receive 500 doses (on an average) daily. At Peerless Hospital, that would inoculate around 600 a day in the last week of August, a mere 189 were vaccinated on Wednesday. “The surge had been prompted by the fact that most 45-plus recipients had their second shot due in late August. After the initial crowding, many chose to visit KMC centres that had enough doses,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. Belle Vue Clinic has seen the recipient number drop to 200-250 from over 600 till early-September. At AMRI Hospitals, there has been a sharp 50% drop in recipients since last week. While last week, the three AMRI units administered 1,200 doses a day, it came down to 600 on Thursday. “A large number of second dose recipients have moved to civic clinics. With enough vaccine in store, the latter have functioned very efficiently, helping to take the load off private hospitals. But we have enough in stock,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Number of recipients has dropped at CMRI Hospital, too. “We are getting mostly second dose recipients,” said CK Birla Hospitals COO Simmardeep Gill. At some hospitals, though, the demand spurt continues. Woodlands, for instance, has seen a rise in daily vaccination from 350 in August last week to 500 now. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, too, daily vaccinations have remained steady at 500-550 since end-August. “It’s similar to last week with more second dose recipients than first,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2nd-jab-share-now-60-at-kmc-units/articleshow/86271732.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Former PMs have worked for the welfare of the country and its people, so they are remembered on their birthdays.” Patwari said that India’s first PM Jawaharlal Nehru’s birth anniversary is celebrated as Children’s Day, Indira Gandhi’s birth anniversary is observed as National Integration Day, Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s birth anniversary observed as Good Governance Day and Rajiv Gandhi’s birth anniversary as Communal Harmony Day.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cong-criticises-bjp-for-20-day-celebrations-for-pms-birthday/articleshow/86273896.cms||---

Now, an Indo-French Scientific Partnership project by the French embassy in India plans to document these scientific collaborations between the two countries. Two French scientists — Luc de Golbery and Anne Chhapuis — had earlier worked extensively with the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh government on various projects. “They conducted first generation data driven documentation during the then AP chief minister NT Rama Rao’s tenure. The French connection in visual analytics has been very strong in Hyderabad,” said Pranav Sharma, curator of the Indo-French Scientific Partnership project, which is fully funded by the French embassy in India. Work by the two French scientists included a visual tool to monitor school infrastructure, performance, building and location as well as developing visual dashboards for watershed programme among many others. Not just this, the French scientists also worked in space sciences. “Earth observations were conducted via National Remote Sensing Centre which was then known as the National Remote Sensing Agency in collaboration with French scientists. There have been other ties with Defence Research and Development Laboratory, Nuclear Fuel Complex etc.,” said Sharma. To document many such alliances systematically, the Indo-French Scientific Partnership project now plans to revisit and reinvestigate the scientific history of India and France. Focus would be on themes such as astronomy, space science, aviation, visual analytics, medicine, epidemiology etc., where both the countries have collaborated, especially after India attained independence from British rule. “The idea is to document 300-400 years of active scientific partnership between India and France. We would be writing blogs, producing a book, hold exhibitions and a planetarium in cities such as Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru as part of this project,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/french-connection-recalling-over-300-yrs-of-scientific-ties-with-india/articleshow/86276028.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Govt seeking legal opinion on FIR against RaGa for ‘fake Hindu’ barb||Bhopal: Home minister Narottam Mishra on Thursday said he would take legal opinion on registering an FIR against Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for calling RSS and BJP “fake Hindus”, who “use religion for their benefit”. “Rahul is an ‘icchadhari’ Hindu. He uses topi and tilak as per convenience. He goes on religious tourism and talks like this. So far, I believed he is childish, but when he said about the Sangh saddened me. He cannot understand the Sangh as his roots are foreign. I will take advice from legal experts to see if an FIR can be registered,” said Mishra. “Imagine, he is going to give us the certificate on whether we are Hindus. Isn’t it amazing that a person who is born of a foreign mother will distribute certificates on whether we are Hindus? Can he speak about any other religion? Why not register a case against him?” Mishra said. Congress defended Rahul and said BJP is trying diversionary tactics. PCC spokesman Narendra Saluja said, “What Rahul Gandhi said is totally right. BJP is again trying to divert attention, so it is making Rahul Gandhi’s statement an issue. They have nothing to say about the NCRB data of 2020. BJP and RSS have always suppressed women and created an atmosphere of fear. There is no place for women in their organisations. They use religion only as their political motive while farmers and women are frightened of them. There is a vast difference between their ideology and ours. We follow Mahatma Gandhi’s principle of non-violence while they believe in Savarkar and Godse.” At the All India Mahila Congress foundation day convention on Wednesday, Rahul had launched a scathing attack on the BJP-RSS combine. He said, “Yeh kis prakar ke Hindu hain? Yeh jhoote Hindu hain. Yeh Hindu dharm ka prayog karte hain, yeh dharm ki dalali karte hain. Magar yeh Hindu nahin hain (What kind of Hindu are they? They are fake Hindus. They experiment with Hindu religion, behave like middlemen of religion. But they are not Hindus).” Congress said BJP is raking up Rahul’s remark to divert attention from the NCRB data, which puts MP on top in crimes against children and child rape. “The NCRB report on 2020 says MP recorded 17,000 cases of atrocities against women. If BJP does not understand the sentiments behind that statement (Rahul’s comment on Durga and Lakshmi), then they need to get treatment at a mental asylum,” said PCC media department chairman Jitu Patwari. BJP MLA Rameshwar Sharma gave an application to police to register a case against Rahul, saying people of the country will not tolerate the “insult of god and goddess”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/govt-seeking-legal-opinion-on-fir-against-raga-for-fake-hindu-barb/articleshow/86273914.cms||---

As part of this project, a Hyderabad Urban Trail will be developed which would be on a par with the one developed in Bordeaux, France. Urban trails are transforming cities by connecting its territories, shedding new light on them and encouraging the emergence of a user-friendly practice. Workshops and exhibitions are being organised from November 15-25 to chalk out the Hyderabad Urban Trail. For the first two days, locations would be identified for the exploratory walks which would then be taken up from November 17-21 by covering a length of 10-15 km/day. “An attempt would be made to map out a metropolitan trail in Hyderabad that would be on a par with that developed in Bordeaux. Then, an exhibition would be held to present the many faces of Hyderabad,” said Yvan Detraz from Bruit du Frigo, who would be spearheading the project. Various organisations such as Hyderabad Urban Labs and Society to Save Rocks are set to participate in developing the Hyderabad Urban Trails.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bordeux-like-project-to-map-out-citys-urban-trail/articleshow/86276056.cms||---

Villagers allegedly attacked Azamnagar FRO Divya, section officer Mohan and beat staff Ajay with sticks. The incident happened around 3pm while the three, who were on patrol duty, were returning to office after inspecting alleged encroachment on a piece of forest land retrieved earlier. “They were surrounded by about 50-60 people on the village outskirts,” Jayashankar Bhupalpally district forest officer (DFO) B Lavanya told TOI. Officials said that the forest department had started a plantation on the land and a few days ago villagers allegedly encroached the same land to start cotton cultivation. “This encroachment has got nothing to do with Podu land,’’ a forest official said. Officials said that cops reached the spot and shifted the injured to a hospital in Bhupalpally. While DFO Lavanya said that they had filed a police complaint, Bhupalpally DSP A Sampath Rao said that they had not received any complaint from forest officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/forest-staff-attacked-over-land-row/articleshow/86276060.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna
---||Hyderabad||Amit Shah to raise pitch for Telangana Liberation Day at public rally today||HYDERABAD: Union home minister Amit Shah is set to talk big on Telangana Liberation Day at his public rally in Nirmal on Friday and question the TRS government’s silence for not officially celebrating September 17 as liberation day. While the state BJP is leaving no stone unturned to make Shah’s meeting a big success by getting not less than one lakh crowds, party leaders said Shah will send a clear signal to the ruling TRS that if the state government does not recognise the liberation day, the BJP will not keep quiet. Party leaders said Shah will also call the bluff of TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao who, during the separate statehood movement, had promised to celebrate the liberation day officially but gone back on his word due to AIMIM’s pressure. Shah will fly to Nirmal from Nanded in Maharashtra and address the public meeting, which is scheduled to begin at 2 pm. The meet will be attended by BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar, who is taking a break from his padayatra. According to party leaders, Shah will also question Congress party’s stand on the liberation day. “Congress and regional parties in Maharashtra and all parties in Karnataka also celebrate liberation day because few parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka were part of then Hyderabad State. The parties, however, are not taking a stand on the issue following pressure from the Majlis party. The home minister will definitely talk about it,” BJP vicepresident NVSS Prabhakar told TOI. Sources said Shah’s Friday meeting was crucial for the party’s success in the run-up to the Huzurabad bypoll, which is being billed as a semi-final before the 2023 assembly elections. “BJP attaches a lot of importance to September 17. This is the day when Hyderabad State (now Telangana) merged into the Indian Union in 1948,” a senior party leader said. Also, the BJP wants to prove a point or two by ensuring a huge crowd for Shah’s meeting as the date also coincides with the Dalit Dandora meeting of Congress in the state. A committee led by Prabhakar and party leader Gudur Narayan Reddy was tasked with making the public rally a huge success. Prabhakar said Friday’s meeting will be big, unlike anything seen before in the state. “We have been travelling to the tribal areas and talking to Adivasis. They have voiced a desire that one of the districts (Adilabad or Nirmal) be named after Ramji Gond, who fought against the Razakars of Nizam,” Prabhakar said. Some freedom fighters will be felicitated by Shah at the meeting, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shah-to-raise-pitch-for-liberation-day-at-public-rally-today/articleshow/86276083.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Speaking at the 18th Indo-US Economic Summit organised by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce-North India Council on Wednesday, Rosenthal said that in August, a meeting was held with members of the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce, several ministers and officials of the UP government to discuss deepening of UP-US economic ties. Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, who was the chief guest at the event, invited American companies to invest in the defence sector, referring to the upcoming defence corridor in UP. “I see the information technology sector as a major growth engine in the times to come. Indian companies can supply components to US companies and initiate technology transfer through joint ventures in the defence sector,” he said. Arvind Kumar, additional chief secretary, Industries, spoke about the revival of industries after the Covid-19 lockdown. “The state ranks second in the country in ease of doing business. A land bank is being created to attract foreign investments even as we have already received investment proposals worth US$ 9220 million from 10 countries in various sectors,” he said.

The two accused, Dr Abhay Pratap Singh, MBBS, MD, and his aide Abhishek Pathak, both of PGI police station area, were booked at Sushant Golf City police station. Singh is assistant professor at UP University of Medical Sciences, Saifai, in Etawah district. The team recovered 100 units of packed red blood cells (PCRB), 21 fake letters of different blood banks, two banners of blood donation camps, a luxury car, an identity card of Dr Singh, five mobile phones and ATM cards, two PAN cards, a doctor membership card and Rs 23,830 in cash. STF was tipped off that some persons from Lucknow were involved in smuggling of blood. The accused were involved in smuggling adulterated blood and sold it to the needy through their agents at high rates while using fake letters of different blood banks in Lucknow, said ASP, STF, Vishal Vikram Singh. On Thursday, STF team was tipped off that the accused were going to supply blood. “A team, including a drug inspector, laid a trap at Lucknow Agra Expressway toll plaza and nabbed a man in a luxury car,” said the ASP. “The accused identified himself as Dr Abhay Pratap Singh of SGPGI police station area. We found 45 units of blood in the boot of the car, but the papers were incomplete. He claimed he was following rules and sought time to show papers. The team went to his residence in Gangotri Apartments where he showed some documents, but the drug inspector found them invalid. The team found Abhishek Pathak in a room and recovered 55 units of blood from the refrigerator,” said Singh. The doctor then confessed to his crime and disclosed he had been doing it for long. Deputy SP STF, Amit Nagar, interrogated the accused who disclosed the names of institutes and their agents. The gang purchased blood at Rs 1200 per unit but sold it for Rs 4,000-6,000 per unit after mixing saline water in the blood to meet the demand. Dr Singh told STF that he did MD in transfusion medicine from SGPGI and then worked in a blood bank and later as a consultant in a city hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/stf-busts-blood-smuggling-gang-asstt-prof-held-in-city/articleshow/86276102.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||‘Mai Bhi Digital’ campaign launched for Chandigarh street vendors||CHANDIGARH: City mayor Ravi Kant Sharma on Thursday launched the “Mai Bhi Digital” (me too digital) campaign from Shastri Market, Sector 22, Chandigarh for street vendors, enabling them to accept and make payments digitally. Addressing street vendors and the general public on the occasion, the mayor said that in order to mitigate the impact of the Covid lockdown on street vendors, the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) has launched the Prime Minister Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi). He said the street vendors would use PayTM digital mode of transaction in their street vending business. He said this was in line with the PM’s vision of making digital India inclusive. “The ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA), Government of India has engaged PayTM, a digital payment aggregator (DPA) for Chandigarh. The Street Vendors Federation, Sector 22, Chandigarh assisted in mobilising street vendors from vending zones for on the spot onboarding. On Thursday, 21 street vendors were distributed QR code for PayTM digital transactions. The same facility will be provided to the remaining street vendors in different parts of the city by the end of this month,” the Mayor said. Elaborating on the benefits of the scheme, MC commissioner Anindita Mitra said that the special micro-credit facility scheme provided working capital to street vendors so that they could resume their businesses. Beneficiaries will be trained in using digital payments and would be able to receive payments and pay for material they procure from sellers using unique QR codes. Mitra said training on digital payments to street vendors will be provided on a safe and secure platform and their cell phones would be equipped with the software to make transactions. Shopkeepers try to edge vendors outA verbal altercation was witnessed during the launch of the programme between vendors and local shopkeepers in Sector 22. Sources said shopkeepers of Sector 22 market attended the event, where they met the mayor and MC commissioner and asked them to shift the vending sites from there. Vendors were enraged at this and an altercation ensued between the two sides. Police personnel at the spot intervened to set things right.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mai-bhi-digital-campaign-launched-for-street-vendors/articleshow/86274010.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Zero convictions in Mumbai in offences on SCs, STs||MUMBAI: Not a single offence committed against an individual from a Scheduled Caste (SC) or Scheduled Tribe (ST) received a conviction in city courts last year. The situation was hardly better in other parts of the state, according to data with the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Maharashtra had a conviction rate of 11% for crimes against SCs and 12.5% for those against STs. Dalit rights workers attributed the low conviction rates to weak prosecution.“For a Dalit victim, getting an FIR registered itself is an uphill task. The police explicitly discourage lodging of an atrocity case. In some rural areas, victims are threatened that they would be slapped with a dacoity charge if they attempt to register an atrocity plaint,” said Siddharth Mokle, vice-president with the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi. If a victim does manage to get a complaint lodged, evidence gathered by law enforcement agencies is insufficient and the case often ends in an acquittal or discharge, said activists. During the lockdown year of 2020, the sufferings of vulnerable groups grew further. Crimes against SCs in Maharashtra grew by 19% from 2,150 cases in 2019 to 2,569 cases last year. Offences against STs showed a similar trend with an 18% surge from 559 cases in 2019 to 663 in 2020. “There is massive under-reporting of crimes, which means that the actual numbers would be much higher than those in the NCRB report,” said Ashok Tengde, a Dalit activist from Beed. He cited instances of how lockdown norms provided perpetrators with an excuse for committing atrocities. “During the lockdown, several city-dwellers, including Dalit families, had moved to their hometowns. There were instances where upper caste villagers would take objection to Dalit families moving outside their house or sporting urban outfits. In a Beed village, a group of Dalit women that had moved from a city ventured to a well to fill up water but were promptly beaten up. At Udgir in Latur, an entire Dalit family was attacked for venturing out. Typically, police officers expressed irritation when complaints of atrocities came up; they claimed they were already battling the pandemic,” said Tengde. Around 480 cases of rape, 633 cases of molestation and 81 murders were registered in the state in 2020 where the victims were SCs and STs. Whether they lived in urban areas or rural parts, vulnerable groups were not spared. In December, a food delivery boy, Akash Jadhav, was thrashed near his home in Santacruz (East) by four inebriated men who got into an argument with him. He was hospitalised twice and eventually died. His family complained that the police did not apply charges under the Prevention of Atrocities Act. “A delay in applying POA seems to be a regular occurrence,” said Pradnya Pawar, a Dalit poet and writer. In the recent case of a woman’s rape and murder at Sakinaka, the act was applied only after the intervention of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/zero-convictions-in-city-in-offences-on-scs-sts/articleshow/86277918.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp to hold meeting to reach consensus||Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation has decided to take the count of residents willing to go on rent or to be shifted to transit accommodation as part of starting construction work of integrated housing complex at Rajaji Nagar. The housing project being implemented under the smart city project has been delayed as some of the residents are reluctant to shift from the present place of accommodation. A meeting with the residents will be convened in two days. Mayor Arya Rajendran and S Salim, chairman of the welfare standing committee visited Rajaji Nagar on Thursday. “Although we had planned to complete construction in phases, some technical issues have cropped up. Even if construction of one tower has to begin, the site has to be raised by filling with earth. This could result in water logging in nearby flats and the issues could worsen. So it is ideal to vacate the flats and start construction in one phase,” said S Salim. The corporation which had earlier offered a monthly rent of Rs 5,000 now plans to provide Rs 7,000 as monthly rent for two years. This has to be met from its own fund. The corporation has also put forward the option to sign contracts with each beneficiary as part of winning their trust. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a review meeting held recently had directed the officials concerned to expedite the works and to arrive at a solution. The corporation has identified a spot for transit accommodation. The work commencement at Rajaji Nagar was inaugurated in October 2020 by former LSG minister A C Moideen. The project was awarded to a firm in September 2020 and the work was expected to be completed in 24 months. The beneficiaries of the housing scheme are reluctant to leave the present area of residence in spite of the dilapidated condition of flats because their livelihood is centred around it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-to-hold-meeting-to-reach-consensus/articleshow/86274047.cms||---

Gadkari was here to inspect the progress of the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway’s Dausa section here on Thursday. “Like electric railway engines, buses and trucks will also be powered by electricity. This will check pollution and save money. We will bring an end to the use of petrol and diesel in the country. Farmers will provide us with an alternative to this,” said Gadkari. “Now, we can produce ethanol from maize, wheat, rice and bajra. Ethanol will soon replace petrol, and we will bring a law to ensure that scooters and bikes are not run on petrol. So, instead of purchasing petrol at Rs 110 per litre, one can buy ethanol at Rs 65 per litre to run their vehicles. It will reduce air pollution further,” he added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-talks-with-a-foreign-firm-to-build-electric-highway-from-delhi-to-jaipur/articleshow/86274030.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Continuous rain and lack of proper drainage trigger waterlogging in several city areas||Prayagraj: Normal life was thrown out of gear due to incessant rainfall across the district over the last 48 hours under the influence of a deep depression over Odisha. The city on Thursday recorded 16.8 mm rainfall between 8:30 am and 5:30 pm. Weathermen at Bamrauli airport told TOI that Sangam city recorded 180.2 mm rainfall between 8:30 am on Wednesday morning and 8:30 am on Thursday. Many parts of the district, including posh colonies, witnessed waterlogging after heavy showers lashed the city on Thursday. Both vehicular traffic and pedestrian movement were disrupted, giving commuters a difficult time. Localities like Georgetown, Tagoretown, LIC Colony, Beli Road, MNNIT trisection, Hindu hostel crossing, Indian Press crossing, Mehdauri gas godown pulia, Niranjan bridge , Rajapur and adjoining areas were the worst affected. Senior corporator Mukund Tiwari on Thursday held the officials of PWD, Prayagraj Municipal corporation (PMC), and Prayagraj Development Authority (PDA) responsible for the mess and claimed that no attention was paid towards the drainage system during the construction of roads ahead of 2019 Kumbh Mela. He added, “During the 2019 Kumbh Mela, officials of many development agencies were more interested to finish off the work than in working on a proper drainage plan. As a result, the city streets are now choked and left the day-to-day lives of its citizens disrupted.” “Secondly, the authorities of PMC have not taken up cleaning of drains properly. As a result, most of the drains are choked and desilting in nullahs have filled the streets with filth,” said Tiwari. “While constructing table tops at city’s prominent crossings, officials had failed to put their attention towards rainwater drainage system. Now water assembles at all crossings and intersections whenever it rains,” said the corporator, adding, “We have demanded district authorities to start a probe into this mismanagement and initiate action against irresponsible officials.” Senior BJP leader and corporator Ashish Gupta also echoed similar views. “There was no proper drainage system in posh colonies of the city, and as a result, most of the streets in LIC Colony, Georgetown and Tagoretown got waterlogged when it rained heavily.” On Thursday, rainwater entered into the premises of Georgetown thana, and cops and complainants at the police station were forced to walk through mud, drain and rainwater. Corporators of PMC claimed that they had raised the issue of drainage system several times during mini sadan meets but to no avail. Moreover, open pits filled with rainwater are also inviting mishaps. Residents of Teliyarganj and adjoining areas alleged that a deep pit filled with rainwater near MNNIT trisection was open for last 15 days but none of the district officials paid any heed despite several reminders. Continuous rainfall for the past three days has exposed the lacklustre attitude of development agencies. Commuters are forced to drive or walk through waterlogged streets. Heavy showers have also led to uprooting of many trees and collapse of houses in more than three city localities. Three days ago, weather experts had made a forecast that many states (including UP) across the country would witness widespread rainfall over the next few days (from September 13 to September 18) due to a deep depression over north Odisha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/continuous-rain-and-lack-of-proper-drainage-trigger-waterlogging-in-several-city-areas/articleshow/86276119.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Congress offers to play role of mediator to resolve Narcotic Jihad controversy||KOTTAYAM: In an unexpected move, state leadership of the Congress party on Thursday stepped in to play a mediatory role to resolve the controversy raging around the “Narcotic Jihad” remarks made by Pala bishop Joseph Kallarangatt. Though Congress leaders made the first move by holding talks with various religious heads, later in the day, Jose K Mani arrived at the bishop’s house in Pala and extended his support to him, the first LDF leader to do so. KPCC president K Sudhakaran and opposition leader V D Satheesan began the hectic day visiting the archbishop of Changanassery diocese of the Syro-Malabar church Joseph Perumthottam. Perumthottam had backed bishop Kallarangatt in an article and wanted the political parties to address the issues raised by him. KPCC president K Sudhakaran too met the bishop before holding talks with Imam of Thazhathangady Juma Masjid Shamsuddin Mannani IlavupalamAfter holding talks with Perumthottam Satheesan met the bishop of Madhya Kerala diocese of the Church of South India (CSI) Malayil Sabu Koshy Cherian who had held a joint press conference with Kerala Muslim Youth Federation president and Imam of Thazhathangady Juma Masjid Shamsuddin Mannani Ilavupalam on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Sudhakaran before travelling to Pala to meet bishop Kallarangatt, visited Shamsuddin Mannani Ilavupalam. Both Satheesan and Sudhakaran hinted that they will be holding talks with more Muslim religious leaders in the coming days. Efforts are being made from their side to bring both the sides together for talks. After meeting bishop Kallarangatt, Sudhakaran said that Congress is committed to maintain communal harmony in the country. He also said that talks are being held with the concerned persons to put a lid on the controversy. He hit out at the state government for not acting to resolve the issue and alleged that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan ignored the demand from several quarters to settle the dispute. Earlier in the day, after meeting the CSI bishop, Satheesan praised the efforts made by him and the Imam for making an unanimous call for peace and added that if the government comes forward to resolve the issue Congress will welcome it. Kerala Congress (M) chairman Jose K Mani who met Pala bishop later in the day extended his support in the “fight against social evils”. Rajya Sabha MP Suresh Gopi who was the first to arrive at the bishop’s house at 9am told reporters after the meeting that the bishop never made any communal remarks and that he did not attack any religion. He said that bishop Kallarangatt had only criticised the activities of some individuals. He also said that he came to meet the bishop as an MP and not as a politician.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cong-offers-to-play-role-of-mediator/articleshow/86274052.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

---||Mysuru||CM will take action after getting DC’s report: STS||Mysuru: Mysuru district minister ST Somashekar on Thursday indicated that the government could act against officials for the demolition of a temple at Huchchagani in Nanjangud taluk, even as he asserted the government is not in a spot owing to the controversy arising out of the demolition drive. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai is seized of the issue and will take appropriate action after the government receives a report from the district administration, he said. According to him, Mysuru deputy commissioner Bagadi Gautham and Nanjangud tahsildar Mohanakumari have been issued notices seeking an explanation. Revenue minister R Ashoka has also taken the issue seriously and will act based on the report from the Mysuru DC, he told reporters. Stating the demolition drive has been temporarily halted, he said the CM will take a call on it after discussing it with cabinet colleagues. He said there will be clarity on it by the weekend. The government will discuss the pros and cons of the Supreme Court directive on demolition of places of worship which are built illegally or in public places, he added. This comes on a day when hundreds of Right-wing activists and villagers from Huchchagani protested in Mysuru seeking action against officials, mainly the Nanjangud tahsildar. They accused the officials of demolishing the temple in the early hours. The protesters gathered at the North Gate of Mysuru Palace and marched through the main thoroughfares of the city. They said the BJP government has failed to protect the interests of Hindus. Huchchagani villagers said they celebrated a festival on September 1 at the temple. On September 8, officials demolished it without giving any notice or information, they said. During the protest a journalist working for an Urdu newspaper was mobbed by the angry protestors. Police acted swiftly and moved him quickly to safety. The Mysuru District Journalist Association has condemned the incident and asked the police to extend security to media persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/cm-will-take-action-after-getting-dcs-report-sts/articleshow/86271904.cms||---

---||Mysuru||Typo leaves dist BJP in a soup||Mysuru: Mysuru district BJP chief Mangala Somashekar’s petition to deputy commissioner Bagadi Gautham seeking a ban on the celebration of Mahisha Dasara has led to a controversy. Various progressive and Dalit organisations are planning to celebrate Mahisha Dasara atop Chamundi Hills on October 5. BJP is opposing it alleging that it is aimed at dividing the society. On Wednesday, the BJP district unit submitted a memorandum to the DC urging the district administration not to permit Mahisha Dasara. In the three-page appeal submitted to the DC, it was written that anti-social ‘Shudra shaktigalu’ are planning to celebrate Mahisha Dasara, which should be stopped to convey the point that ‘anti-social elements’ are planning the event. However, Mangala informed that it was a typo. “It should have been ‘Khudra shaktigalu’ (nuisance forces), which was wrongly typed as ‘Kshudra shaktigalu’. We changed it immediately. It was a typo,” she said. She also submitted a letter to the DC about the mistake. The letter went viral on social media with several rationalists demanding an explanation from BJP leaders. They alleged that BJP leaders humiliated the entire backward class and demanded an apology from BJP. Later in the day, BJP leaders met DC Gautham and submitted a rejoinder saying it was a typo. Mangala clarified that it was a printing mistake, and it is not used against any communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/typo-leaves-dist-bjp-in-a-soup/articleshow/86271973.cms||---

In any case, no change can be made in these bypolls without the prior permission of the Supreme Court,” said an SEC official. The state is hoping to issue the ordinance this week and will then seek the view of the SEC. On whether inability to restore the quota for the ZP polls will be an embarrassment for the MVA government, food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said: “Why should it be an embarrassment? It shows we have explored all the routes to restore the quota. We have pursued the matter in the Supreme Court, asked for empirical data from the backward class commission, and also issued an ordinance. In fact, the next hearing of the case in the SC is on September 23.” In the five ZPs where nominations were filed in July, OBC seats are now open seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ordinance-on-quota-for-obc-wont-apply-to-octs-zp-polls/articleshow/86276329.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Kochi||Books of Hindutva icons: Kannur Uty to make changes in syllabus||Kozhikode: With the two-member expert committee recommending changes in Kannur University’s controversial syllabus in the third semester of MA Governance and Politics course, the varsity decided not to teach the core course `Themes in Indian Political Thought', which had writings of Hindutva ideologues, in the current third semester batch. VC Gopinath Ravindran said the report of the two-member committee has been forwarded to the board of studies which will decide on the changes to be made. A final decision in this regard will be taken by the academic council meeting on Sept 29. “As making changes in the syllabus would take time, we decided that the current third semester students will study the earlier paper Contemporary Political Theory instead of Indian Political Thought,” he said. The VC added that the core paper Themes of Indian Political Thought will be included as part of syllabus in fourth semester after revision. The varsity had asked the expert panel comprising political scientists Prof J Prabhash and Prof KS Pavithran to examine the syllabus and suggest changes, if required. It is learnt that the committee has recommended that the syllabus must be balanced and should represent the diversity of Indian political thought. Responding to a question, the VC said the expert committee had found shortcomings in the syllabus. He refused to divulge any recommendation of the committee but said that it suggested giving equal representation to various strands of political thought. Ravindran had earlier pointed out that Left political thought hadn’t found representation in the syllabus. He had opined that instead of five writings related to Hindutva ideology in the syllabus, two would have been more appropriate. He said that when a new-generation course was started last year, the syllabus was designed by an expert committee in December as the board of studies was not in place. “We now have a board of studies and it will study panel recommendations and make necessary changes,” he said. The unit ‘Rashtra or Nation in Indian Political Thought’ in the course had extracts from books by Hindutva icons, including ‘Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?’ (VD Savarkar), ‘We or Our Nationhood Defined’, ‘Bunch of Thoughts’ (MS Golwalkar) and Integral Humanism (Deendayal Upadhyaya). This had led to protests from student organizations affiliated to Congress and IUML who termed it as a hidden attempt at saffronisation of education. State higher education minister R Bindu had sought a report from the VC and said the varsity will review the syllabus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/books-of-hindutva-icons-kannur-uty-to-make-changes-in-syllabus/articleshow/86274089.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Getting ridge clearance was also a major hurdle, sources said. On Thursday, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said the proposal to build a tunnel is being prepared and soon he will hold a meeting with concerned agencies and take a decision on the project. The minister said the NHAI is spending close to Rs 55,000 crore on different road projects in the national capital to reduce congestion and pollution. Sources in the NHAI said the tunnel is expected to be bi-directional of three lanes each. “So, it would work as a six-lane highway. We are working on different alternative alignments and a detailed project report is being prepared,” said an official. TOI has learnt that the project cost for the tunnel would be around Rs 2,000 crore. The tunnel is being proposed to connect NH8-Dwarka Expressway junction near Shiv Murti towards Nelson Mandela Marg near Vasant Kunj to decongest the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway and provide alternate connectivity to Gurugram and IGI Airport from central and south Delhi. As there will be an interchange at Shiv Murti, vehicles coming from central and south Delhi can also use the tunnel to get onto the Expressway and also the upcoming Urban Extension Road-II, which will provide direct link to Delhi-Chandigarh highway. This will not only reduce congestion on Gurugram Expressway but also on the Ring Road. The need for alternate roads to Delhi-Gurugram expressway, which now often gets clogged during peak hours, was flagged soon after the expressway was inaugurated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nhai-plans-tunnel-from-shiv-murti-to-vasant-kunj/articleshow/86274114.cms||Dipak K Dash

They came back to the college before August 30. Though the students had produced RT- PCR negative certificate taken within 72 hours before the start of journey to Coimbatore, some of them turned positive after reaching here.“They could have been infected after they got tested or on the way to the hostel. The students should have been ideally quarantined, but they were allowed to mingle with other students in the hostel, allowing the infection to spread quickly. Four students started showing symptoms from September 4. They eventually tested positive three days later,” a Coimbatore corporation official said. “Students were crammed into hostel rooms. Six to seven students were accommodated in 160 sq ft rooms that can ideally accommodate three students. Had they followed the norms, infection might not have spread to these many students in such a short time.”“The corporation had imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on the college for flouting standard operating procedures. More fine will be slapped if norms are flouted again,” the official said. “All students of the college have been tested. While the college has been closed, the administration has been asked to keep all students inside premises. Medical camps were conducted at the college from Monday. Students who tested negative will be tested again. All students have received at least one dose of vaccine and some have received the second dose as well.

Overnight express trains including Cheran and Nilgiris express between Coimbatore, Tirupur and Chennai are insufficient due to the increase in population and rapid industrialization of Tirupur and Coimbatore,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rail-users-seek-memu-service/articleshow/86274123.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Idukki airstrip likely to be ready by November 1||IDUKKI: The district’s first air strip is almost ready and is likely to roll out the runway carpet for small aircraft by November 1. The National Cadet Corps’ (NCC) first and only airstrip in the country coming up at Sathram near Vandiperiyar is expected to provide training for NCC Air Wing cadets in flying small aircraft. The airstrip is built in such a way that every year as many as 1,000 Air Wing cadets can be trained for flying practice on the small aircraft. The NCC's two-seater Virus SW-80 aircraft will be the first to land on the airstrip, said officials. NCC Kerala director general Brigadier P K Sunilkumar said the first flight is expected to land on the airstrip on November 1. "PWD department has agreed to complete the works by the time. We need to get clearance from the forest department to level a hillock. Peermade MLA Vazhoor Soman will hold high-level talks to solve the issue," he said. An NCC official said the first airstrip in the district will provide a boost to disaster preparedness. "The district administration can use the airstrip for disaster management requirements. It will help to kick off immediate rescue operations when natural calamities strike," he said. Vazhoor Soman said he has met ministers and high-level officers and that they have agreed to take the necessary steps to make the airstrip operational by the beginning of the next month. "The airstrip will help to boost the tourism sector in the district as well. Sabarimala is close by and the airstrip can be used for VIP visits to the hill shrine. We hope the airstrip will change the face of the district," said Soman. According to officials the construction works of the airstrip began in May, 2017. For the first time in the country, the construction works of the airstrip were handed over to a PWD department. The revenue department had allotted 12 acres for the project and Rs 13 crore has so far been spent on it. Construction work of 650m of the 1000m runway has been completed and the ministry of aviation had given landing permission for aircraft on June 3. Along with Sunilkumar, PWD chief engineer Beena L, and district development commissioner Arjun Pandian had visited the airstrip on Wednesday for reviewing the works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/idukki-airstrip-likely-to-be-ready-by-nov-1/articleshow/86274144.cms||Sandeep Thomas

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: 7-year-old lay still for 2 hours with cobra around her neck before it bit||WARDHA: Pari, a 7-year-old girl, who was bitten by a snake that remained coiled around her neck for close to two hours on Saturday night, is recovering at Kasturba hospital, Sewagram. The girl from Borkhedi (Kala) village had lain still for the entire time, as the family hoped the snake would move away by itself. The snake bit the girl when a snake rescuer tried to remove it. “Her condition is stable and she is recovering well,” said Dr Manish Jain, HOD of the department of MGIMS, on Thursday. The bizarre incident took place in Selu tehsil at midnight on Saturday. The girl’s mother Hemlata first noticed the snake wrapped around her neck when she woke up on hearing a noise at around 11.45pm. She was frightened at the sight but had the presence of mind to tell her daughter to remain calm and not move at all. The girl’s father Padmakar Gadkari called neighbours for help. Vaibhav Talvekar, a neighbour, said the venomous snake (cobra) remained wrapped around her neck for close to two hours, till 1.45am, with people clicking photos and shooting videos. It took people a long time to find the mobile number of a snake rescuer. Finally, a snake rescuer reached the spot from Selu at about 1.45am. The girl had remained calm all through, and after the snake friend arrived, he tried to catch it. At that moment, the snake bit the girl near the elbow of her left hand, and disappeared in the melee as everyone rushed to save the girl. Gaurav Talvekar, Kiran Gavhale and Mayur Lidbe took the girl to hospital, 25km from her home, in 14 minutes to ensure she got immediate medical treatment. Upon arrival, the doctors checked to see if a venomous snake had bitten her, after which anti-snake venom treatment was started. This is because the treatment can cause dangerous side effects if the snake was not venomous. The girl’s left hand, which was bitten by the snake, had swollen, and the colour of the hand was changing. Treatment was started immediately with the consent of the relatives, said Vaibhav. He also said doctors are to perform a surgery on her hand on Friday. With snake bite, it takes one or two days for some complications to appear. Now, she is out of danger and improving well, said Dr Manish Jain, head of the department of paediatrics. The incident is a warning to those sleeping on the ground in rural areas. Recent continuous rains have flooded farms, forcing reptiles out of burrows, and in rural areas snakes can easily enter homes.

The road users, particularly motorists, have a tough time navigating on the road. Chatram Road, famous for grocery shops and other wholesale markets including Leigh Bazaar, is invariably abuzz with business activities. Hundreds of trucks from neighbouring districts and states come to Chatram. Similarly, trucks would be going out to other states from here. One of the shopkeepers at Chatram V Ganesan, 48, told TOI that the tar road that connects Longley Road, Leigh Bazaar, Paul Market, Four Roads and Three Roads was totally damaged in the recent rainfall. “There’s always vehicle traffic on the road due to potholes,” he said, adding that many bikers fell on the road after they lost control over the vehicle when crossing the potholes. Ganesan said the corporation had refused to repair the roads citing incessant rainfall. Though the tar road was laid only a year ago, it didn’t withstand even three days of rain, a shopkeeper on the road said. “Roads in many parts of the city are also in same condition,” Narayana Rao, another resident from Shevapet area, said. The shopkeepers and the residents of Chatram said heavy vehicles including trucks were frequently coming and going out from the area. “The trucks which are using the Chatram Road have made the condition of the road worse,” S V Rajagopal, a resident from Leigh Bazaar, said. The corporation officials said that they are taking measures to repair all the damaged roads in the city. “We will repair all the damaged roads at the earliest,” they assured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/pothole-filled-road-turns-nightmare-for-salem-residents/articleshow/86274169.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Jain says cost of sewage barrel project down by 90%||New Delhi: Water minister and chairman of Delhi Jal Board (DJB), Satyendar Jain, along with Kalkaji MLA, Atishi, visited a 15km stretch on Thursday to inspect old-sewage carrying barrels at Okhla, which take around 115 million gallons per day (MGD) of sewage and waste water from south and central Delhi to the Okhla Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). While the government had earlier kept Rs 662 crore to replace these old barrels — some of which were built pre-Independence — Jain said the cost of the overall project had been brought down to Rs 60 crore, using innovative techniques and newer technology. The minister said the cost of the project had therefore been brought down by around 90%, with a timeline of two years set to lay down new pipelines to replace these existing ones. Jain had met other senior officers from DJB and experts from other departments to consult them on innovations that could be put to use, with the new pipelines to be made of high density polyethylene (HDPE), which will be running parallel to the existing conduits. Officials said the existing conduits were being replaced, as they had exhausted their usual life. Amongst these, the oldest barrel was made by the British in 1938, while the other two barrels were constructed in 1956 and 1985. After the pipelines are laid, the rehabilitation of the oldest barrel will be done in a period of four months. The second barrel, constructed in 1956, will be rehabilitated in the next two years. The third – built in 1985 — will be cleaned. Officials said after the completion of the project, there will be a total of four functional conduits in the area, thereby increasing the sewage carrying capacity of these pipelines as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jain-says-cost-of-sewage-barrel-project-down-by-90/articleshow/86274165.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Stray dogs raze ceramic shop||Thiruvananthapuram: Adding to the street dog menace the city is facing, a pack of stray dogs wreaked havoc in a shop selling ceramic vessels at East Fort, resulting in loss amounting to Rs 30,000. Sindhu, who runs a small ceramic vessel shop and wayside eatery at East Fort, was heartbroken when she saw the materials in her shops being torn apart and damaged to pieces. She is the sole breadwinner for her two children and her old parents. She soon filed a complaint with the Fort police, but she was in for a shock when she saw the CCTV visuals which showed a pack of stray dogs ripping apart the tarpaulin cover of the shop and shattering the ceramic vessels. Sindhu, a graduate in economics, had quit her job as a receptionist at a private hospital to run an eatery and shop at East Fort. She says some of the items which were damaged were transported from Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. “I had borrowed money to get these items. Now, I am clueless as to how to resume my business. This is how we earn our livelihood. I quit my job and started running this shop because my daughter fell sick. I am a divorcee and I take care of my family with the earnings from my shops,” says Sindhu. A few officials had contacted her to enquire about the loss, but they have informed her that they are unable to help because the items were destroyed by stray dogs. The dogs destroyed edible products as well as the ceramic pots and cups that she sells here. The corporation staff came and cleaned the leftovers on Wednesday. “I want to reopen the wayside eatery as soon as possible because now this is the only option for us to live. I do not know what is the next step,” said Sindhu who resides at Poozhikunnu. With dogs being the culprits, the police are also at a loss. “It is clear from the visuals that stray dogs destroyed the goods in the shop. There is nothing we can do about it,” the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/stray-dogs-raze-ceramic-shop/articleshow/86274214.cms||---

He added that there is a system in India in which the police in Kerala will also have to follow. He asked whether there is any circular from the DGP which says that an MP need not be saluted. Gopi said that police associations are only for the welfare of policemen and should not be used for playing politics. On Wednesday, Gopi had sparked a row after he ordered a police officer to get down from his jeep and salute him.

---||Coimbatore||15,000 drinking water connections to be provided before year ends||Coimbatore: The city corporation is planning to provide 15,000 drinking water connections before the end of the year under the 24/7 drinking water scheme.Though DMK opposed the project when it was in opposition, as the new government has given the go-ahead, the project will be sped up, a corporation official said.While around 600 connections have been provided in Jayaram Nagar in Telungupalayam where the pilot project was executed, RS Puram could be the next place to be covered.The civic body had signed an agreement with French company Suez in 2018 to supply round the clock drinking water to 60 wards in the old city. As many as 1.5 lakh connections need to be replaced with new meters and pipeline at a cost of Rs 2,975 crore.As per the agreement, the company has to complete the project by 2023 and carry out operation and maintenance for 21 years. As the project is racing against time for completion, officials are working overtime to meet the deadline. “We are already behind schedule. By now, we should have provided 30,000 connections. But we can give only 15,000 connections by the end of this year,” said an official with the project team.The pandemic situation and change of guard in the state government stalled the progress of the project, the official said. “However, we are confident of meeting deadline.”The project involves laying of 75km new feeder mainline and 1,744km of drinking water distribution lines, independent engineering-cum-project management consultant Gopalakrishnan Padmanabhan told TOI. “Of the 75km feed mainlines, 12.5km has been laid. Of the 1,744km distribution lines, 251km has been laid.”Residents of Jayaram Nagar are satisfied with the quantity of water supplied as well as pressure, said M Jagadeewaran of Brindavan Garden in Jayaram Nagar. “We are happy with the uninterrupted power supply as we can get water at our convenience. Earlier, we could not leave the house as we did not know when water would be supplied. I would not have constructed a sump had the project was implemented 10 years ago. Water pressure is now adequate to store water directly in the tank on the terrace,” he said.T Latha of Telungupalayam Main Road said that although she is happy with the water supply, she is concerned about the tariff, which is yet to be announced. She is using bore water for household uses, while keeping the corporation water for drinking and cooking.Residents need not worry about tariff as the civic body will continue to follow the old tariff, the corporation official said. “Only that charges would be levied based on meter reading.”Timeline2008- Consultant appointed to prepare report2011- Report submitted to state government2013- Central government approves it2014 – State government suggests public-private partnership2017- Letter of acceptance given to Suez2018 – Corporation signs agreement with Suez2019- Construction works commence2023- Project deadlineFundingConstruction work- Rs 646.71 crore· Govt of India – Rs 166.99 crore· Govt of TN – Rs 101.21 crore· Concessionaire – Rs 129.34 crore· Tamil Nadu Infrastructure Development Board- Rs 66.8 crore· Coimbatore corporation – Rs 182.37 (Rs 150.73 from smart city fund and 31.64 crore from own fund)Operation and maintenance (21 years)– Rs 2,328.45 crore Frequently Asked Questions1 Do consumers need to pay anything extra for the connection?There is no need to pay any extra money.

---||Coimbatore||Project to ensure drinking-water safety||Coimbatore: The 24/7 drinking water supply project will ensure drinking-water safety by preventing contamination, a corporation official said.“Water gets contaminated when sewage water enters pipelines due to leaks. When supply is stopped, vacuum is formed inside pipes and sewage water enters the pipe to fill the vacuum. If water is supplied continuously, there will be no room for contaminated water to enter the pipeline,” the official told TOI.The project will substantially improve collection of water charges as high-quality meters are used, an official involved in implementing the project said. “Water charges collected by the corporation had increased dramatically by around 50% when meter reading was handed over to a private company a few years ago. Earlier, corporation employees were involved. Imagine if the old meters, which are less accurate, are replaced with better meters and a mechanism in place for accurate readings. There will not be spillage,” he said.“While the financial burden on the civic body will not increase much, residents will receive better services. For instance, the civic body had spent Rs 47 crore for operation and maintenance for the 72 wards in 2011. The civic body will pay the private company Rs 54 crore for the first year. The costs are already defined. The civic body would pay Rs 169 crore for the 21st year, which would be the last year the private company handles the system.”A central monitoring cell, which will use supervisory control and data acquisition (Scada) system, will be set up to monitor the supply system. “The system will make it easy to identify issues and set them right,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/project-to-ensure-drinking-water-safety/articleshow/86274224.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Nine first-time MLAs are new ministers||A significant impact of the BJP’s "No-Repeat Formula" is that only three of the 24 ministers in the newly sworn in government have prior ministerial experience. In fact, nine of the 25 ministers, including chief minister Bhupendra Patel, are first-time legislators. Like his predecessor, chief minister Bhupendra Patel retained most key portfolios that were held by Vijay Rupani. Rajendra Trivedi, who was speaker, has made a comeback to government and has been given the revenue and law and justice portfolios among others. In a surprise move, a relatively unknown face, Kanubhai Desai, has got the important finance portfolio, which was held for long by former deputy chief minister Nitin Patel. After the 2017 elections, Nitin Patel had refused to take charge when he was not allocated the prestigious finance portfolio. The youngest minister, Harsh Sanghvi, who is all of 36 years old, hit the jackpot bagging the all-important MoS home portfolio. Former BJP state president Jitu Vaghani has been absorbed into the cabinet after his successful stint in the party organization. The health portfolio, held by Mehsana’s Nitin Patel, has gone to another Patidar MLA, Rushikesh Patel, who coincidentally represents Visnagar constituency in Mehsana district. Rushikesh’s office was vandalized during the first Patidar quota rally in 2015, which had turned violent. The new ministers who have prior experience are Kiritsinh Rana, Rajendra Trivedi and Raghavji Patel. Those who have become ministers and are first-time MLAs include CM Bhupendra Patel, Naresh Patel, Pradip Parmar, Arjunsinh Chauhan, Arvind Raiyani, Kirtisinh Vaghjela, Gajendrasinh Parmar, Raghavji Makwana and Devabhai Malam. Questions were raised from several quarters on how such a massively inexperienced council of ministers will be able to effectively run the government. Many others saw it as a move to infuse fresh vigour into governance ahead of next year’s assembly elections in the state. When asked about the need for a complete overhaul of the cabinet, BJP national general secretary and Gujarat in-charge Bhupendra Yadav said that the new cabinet formation is part of the BJP’s strategy of implementing a "new experiment ensuring that new leadership is cultivated and continuity is ensured". He denied that there was any discontent and said the decision to change the entire cabinet was unanimous.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nine-first-time-mlas-are-new-ministers/articleshow/86274232.cms||---

The deceased is Bhavya Singh, 16, a class XI student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Pattom. The police have registered a case and launched a probe into the circumstances that led to the mishap. According to the police, the mishap occurred around 1.45 pm on Thursday at Nikunjam apartment complex at Jawahar Nagar. Anand Singh and family were residents of Flat 9A on the ninth floor of the building. It was the security personnel of the apartment complex who spotted Bhavya who had allegedly fallen from the balcony. She was still breathing when found. She was rushed to a private hospital at Edapazhanji, but the doctors declared dead on arrival. Sources in the police said it was high time to confirm whether it was a case of accident or suicide. Though the parapet wall of the balcony had sufficient height, the possibility of an accidental fall still could not be ruled out. The police have recorded the statements of the domestic help of the family as part of the probe. The statements of bereaving family members will be recorded later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pwd-secretarys-daughter-falls-to-death/articleshow/86274250.cms||---

When the Association of Self-Financing Arts, Science and Management Colleges of Tamil Nadu moved the high court in 2019 seeking representation in the BU syndicate, the court asked the university to consider their request.While principals of self-financing arts and science colleges have representation in the syndicate, there was no provision for secretaries of the colleges to be members. With the state government approving amendment to Bharathiar University Act, 1981, non-academic members will be exclusively nominated to the syndicate.Ooty unit president of Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers Association R Sanil said such significant matters are usually discussed in the senate. “But the syndicate, led by the vice-chancellor, tabled the agenda, approved it and forwarded it to the state government for consideration. All this happened without the knowledge of us,” he said. “It would be apt to have academicians and scholars as members of such a higher body instead of non-academic members of college management.”Opposing the move, state president of Association of University Teachers (AUT) P Thirunavakkarasu termed it a move to privatise BU. “Inclusion of five secretaries from self-financing colleges to the syndicate is equal to handing over BU administration to private colleges. We are planning to meet higher education minister K Ponmudi and seek withdrawal of the decision,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/syndicate-membership-for-secretaries-of-pvt-colleges-draws-flak/articleshow/86274229.cms||---

Over 70 mm of rain was recorded till 8 pm after the rainfall started at around midnight on Wednesday. Heavy showers continued to lash the city at the time of filing the report. As per the Met department, the city has never witnessed such heavy rains in a single day in this season the past 10 years. In 2011 and 2012, 00 mm and 14.5 mm of rains were recorded on this date while in 2004, 2013, 2017- 2020 there was no rainfall on this date. In 2015, 5.5 mm of rains was recorded on September 16 while only 1.8 mm of rainfall was recorded next year. While the average rainfall for September is 167.2 mm, about 100 mm of rains including 28 mm of rains between September 1 and 15, has already been measured in the city and more rains are in the offing. However, the uneven distribution of the rainfall is the cause of worry for the climate experts and farmers. Rain gauge between September 1 and 10 stood at just 8 mm while about 92 mm of rain has been measured in the past six days. Talking to TOI, agrometerologist at CSA University, Dr SN Sunil Pandey said, “The total rain gauge for the city during monsoon season is 870 mm. Earlier it appeared that the season was rain deficit this year with only 739 mm of rains but now over 70 mm of rains has been recorded in a single day on Thursday. Similar conditions will prevail on Friday however, the intensity of rains will reduce but light to moderate rains will continue till September 19.” Dr Pandey said that unequal distribution of rain will not be beneficial for farmers. “It did not rain much in the first 10 days of September and now there are heavy showers. Such rains cause loss to standing crops. Changing weather patterns cause such rainfall”, he said adding that usually Southwest monsoon begins to retreat by September 17 but this year it seems not to be the case. It appears that the retreat might begin only after September 30 as there is much moisture in the atmosphere at present, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/city-witnesses-heaviest-rainfall-of-season-more-in-offing-met/articleshow/86276293.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

With no alternative way, the residents of these villages are stuck and not able to commute to Banda city to get their daily provisions. The road also connects the area with parts of MP. On September 10, around 10-15 meters of the retaining wall of the Durendi underpass caved in due to water logging. Luckily, no casualty took place as some of the people standing there raised a timely alert. Locals claimed that the four-year-old underpass caved in because of inferior construction quality. With no solution to the persisting problem, the locals have served a memorandum to DRM Jhansi, Ashutosh. It has been signed by hundreds of locals including the village heads and principals of schools warning for agitation and stopping of trains failing any constructive solution by Saturday. A separate letter has also been sent to the rail minister by local MP, Vishambar Prasad Nishad, citing the problem. Nishad has also mentioned that previously he had raised the issue of inferior construction quality but the rail authorities did not take its notice. The letter also mentions that the nearest alternative level crossing number 451 is five kilometres away with no accessible road to it. As per a local, “The previous DM Banda who was present on the day of the accident had assured opening of the manual level crossing for regular commuting till the underpass is repaired, but the situation remains the same. We are not able to even get our daily provisions.” CPRO NCR, Shivam Sharma, said: “We are not able to open the manual level crossing at 452 LC because of safety issues and will suggest using 451 number crossing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/villages-schools-cut-off-from-bandacity-as-railway-underpass-collapses/articleshow/86276323.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Desperate citizens call up LMC, Lesa helplines in vain||Lucknow: Various helplines run by Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC), district administration and Lucknow Electricity Supply Administration (Lesa) failed to provide much help on Thursday as residents battled water-logging, caved-in roads, power cuts and traffic jams due to continous rain throughout the day. While the majority of residents said they could not connect to congested helplines, those who did, could not get required help on time. Take the example of residents of Shaktinagar on Faizabad road. After heavy water-logging, they tried calling several helpline numbers - from LMC to district administration and fire brigade, but there was no response. Either the phone calls went unanswered or the standard reply was “we are busy elsewhere”. One of the residents, a retired vice-chancellor, even sent out an SOS message on social media saying “The area is badly flooded. Water is entering our homes. Situation is getting worse. Please get the water drained.” However, people were left to fend for themselves. Eldeco-2 resident Neha Singh and her husband too made several calls to helplines with no success. “We have been facing water-logging mixed with sewer filth whenever it rains for the past several years. However, numerous complaints over the years to civic authorities to install a proper drainage have gone unheard. The same happened on Thursday,” she said. Neha lost her temper, when she saw her elder son Sonu’s sports winning cups sunk into filth water. “We pay all taxes honestly, then why do we have to suffer? Can the district administration explain this to us?” she said. Avaneesh Awasthi of Faizullaganj, said, “As no helpline issued by administration responded, we drained out water on our own and it took 10 hours to complete the task.” Similar were the scene in many parts of the city. Abhishek Yadav, Vikasnagar, said that not just filth, small snakes and venomous insects too flowed in with drain water. I called the LMC helpline several times, but nobody took the call.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/desperate-citizens-call-up-lmc-lesa-helplines-in-vain/articleshow/86276297.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Lucky had saved the lives of 12 personnel in Assam by sniffing out an improvised explosive device which was buried by insurgents.With nowhere to go after his retirement, Lucky was brought to Nagpur by his handler after which animal welfare activist Karishma Galani got him admitted to a local hospital run by activist Ajay Maheshwari as the animal’s health had significantly deteriorated.In 2018, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court had taken sou motu cognizance of TOI’s reports exposing the absence of measures for rehabilitation of canines serving in the bomb disposal and detection units. A public interest litigation was filed and lawyer S Sanyal was appointed as the amicus curiae.The court had then issued directions to the authorities concerned to devise an ad hoc policy for looking after retired animals.Sanyal recently cited Lucky’s case to the judiciary following which the amicus has been called upon to submit a formal application.Based on TOI’s report, the application which is expected to be taken up by the court highlights how despite three years of court’s earlier directives, no action has been taken by the authorities to rehabilitate canines serving the bomb disposal and detection units of various armed and paramilitary forces. “It is really distressing that dogs protecting our country are dealt with such inhuman manner. Authorities utilize their services and after they turn a certain age, forget them as they are of no use,” the application stated.It further added that the negligence of the authorities concerned was a violation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. “It is unfortunate that the Animal Welfare Board of India is a mute spectator, specifically in cases related to rehabilitation of retired animals,” the application stated. Sanyal had prayed to the court to direct all the respondents to place on record a policy for the welfare of animals working for them post their retirement. He also appealed for necessary help needed to treat Lucky and his further care taking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/plight-of-retd-sniffer-dogs-again-draws-hc-attention/articleshow/86272124.cms||Manka Behl

---||Nashik||Nashik dist: Curbs on gatherings till Nov 11||Nashik: The district administration has issued prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC with immediate effect to ensure that a large number of people do not gather at water bodies considering the pandemic situation and festivities like Ganapati visarjan and Navratri. The prohibitory orders come into force with immediate effect to ensure that people do not crowd around water bodies. The order will be applicable till November 11, post-Diwali. Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare, who issued the orders for water bodies located in the rural areas of Nashik, said, “There are multiple reasons for issuing such orders. While that includes safety of people, who generally go to water bodies for Ganesh visarjan and other purposes, another important aspect is that of the Covid-19 situation.” With Covid restrictions in place in city areas, people are likely to travel to various water bodies, including Gangapur Dam, Gautami Godavari, Kashyapi, Alandee, Darna, Mukne, Bhavli, Valdevi, Kadva, Nandurmadhmeshwar, Bhojapur, spread across talukas like Igatpuri, Trimbakeshwar, Nashik, Niphad, Dindori, etc. The administration has, therefore, warned people against visiting such places for Ganesh immersions. The other reason includes the safety of people as well as water bodies and dams. Asked if such orders would be detrimental for tourism and other activities near water bodies, Mandhare said, “The orders were related to open places. There are restrictions in place for resorts and boat clubs and the responsibility of guest safety on the premises is underlined.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-dist-curbs-on-gatherings-till-nov-11/articleshow/86269524.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel’s big balancing act||The brand new cabinet of chief minister Bhupendra Patel clearly had a stamp of south Gujarat strongman and state BJP president C R Paatil with seven MLAs from the region getting ministerial berths. With 2022 elections just 15 months away, the new CM tried a smooth balancing of both caste and regional equations by roping in Patidars, tribals, OBCs and Brahmins in the new government. The challenge clearly for the new ministers is performance given that none of them have any experience in government administration and the short time before the polls. According to sources, this is the highest representation in the state government so far for South Gujarat and observers believe that the veteran Paatil, an MP from Navsari, played a pivotal role for his region. There are three Cabinet ministers, two ministers of state (independent charge) and two ministers of state from the region. Importantly, Purnesh Modi from Surat East got the key portfolio of roads and housing, transport, civil aviation, tourism and Yatradham vikas while Kanu Desai from Pardi got the important finance and energy department. Within BJP cadres, there is a feeling of rejuvenation as many feel that the young faces will give their heart and soul into people’s work. Central Gujarat too saw the number of ministers doubling to eight in the new Cabinet. The region had only four ministers in the Rupani government that included two from Ahmedabad city — Pradipsinh Jadeja and Kaushik Patel. However, the new dispensation has eight ministers with Kheda also getting a representation. Vadodara city which only had Yogesh Patel as the minister, saw induction of Rajendra Trivedi and Manisha Vakil For the first time, there are more than one minister from scheduled castes with Vadodara’s Manisha Vakil and Asarwa MLA Pradip Parmar in the government. Patidars, of course, account for nearly one-third of the ministries with as many as seven from the community taking the oath. Interestingly, Visnagar MLA Rushikesh Patel, who had earned the wrath of Patidars during the 2015 quota stir, was chosen to head the health ministry which was held by former deputy CM Nitin Patel. Both are from Mehsana district. Also, Bhupendra Patel has compensated the dropping of some senior ministers by giving a chance to other MLAs from their district. For example, while veteran Bhupendrasinh Chudasama was dropped, Mehemdabad MLA Arjunsinh Chauhan got the coveted cabinet portfolio of rural development. Kolis, who form a huge chunk of voter population, got two ministers in Keshod MLA Deva Malam and Mahuva MLA R C Makwana as senior ministers Kunvarji Bavaliya and community strong man Purushottam Solanki were dropped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bhupendras-big-balancing-act/articleshow/86274273.cms||---
---||Lucknow||People wake up to knee-deep water and caved-in roads||Lucknow: Lucknow Municipal Corporation claims to spend Rs 5 crore annually in cleaning and maintenance but heavy rainfall on Thursday turned city roads into canals and open spaces into lakes, with at least three persons dying in rain-related incidents. As a flood-like-situation prevailed, almost the entire state capital got submerged in ankle-to-knee deep water, marooning residents in several localities for hours. Problems poured in along with heavy showers with roads caving in at several places, creating huge craters in at least a dozen places, leading to accidents and traffic jams. Adding to the woes were the 12-16 hour long power cuts in some places caused by the damages inflicted on the cables by uprooted trees, branches and hoardings across the city. Erratic supply was reported from almost all the localities. At a few places, supply that was disrupted at around midnight could not be restored till the evening. Common complaints everywhere were of poor and clogged drainage. People blamed the LMC for shoddy work and callous attitude. Lucknow has 26 high drains (nullahs) and a network of 1,800km of small drains. As per records, these drains have to be cleaned twice in a year – pre and post monsoon. Till last financial year, the LMC used to allocate Rs 8 crore annually to clean these drains but this year it was slashed to Rs 5 crore due to financial losses because of the pandemic. Officers claimed that drains were cleaned before the start of monsoon this year. However, these claims fell flat on Thursday when not only streets were heavily water-logged, drain and sewer water entered many houses on the ground floor, damaging electronic items and furniture. After receding, it left behind filth and sludge in houses and streets. Alambagh resident Sukhwindar Singh feared that the filth left behind after receding of water in the locality may lead to the outbreak of a contagious disease. “Potholed roads, garbage piles and clogged drains - LMC has failed at every front,” he said. Dalibagh resident Rajan Kishore took leave from office after drain water flooded his house. “We spent all day draining out the water,” he said. Shashi Singh, a Mahanagar resident, was seen cleaning clogged drains outside his house. “I have lodged complaints with the LMC a number of times in the past few months, but nobody paid attention.” Gomtinagar resident, Mohammad Asif’s complained that the road in front of his house was flooded with waste deep water so much so that even his car got submerged. “Due to poor drainage, it took 10 hours for water to recede from my house,” rued Jyoti Shukla, a resident of Aliganj Sector K. Aishbagh resident, Hemant Kalra said, “My entire furniture in the drawing room was damaged due to flooding.” Shaktinagar resident, Vandana Shukla said, “The sewers are blocked and not cleaned for a long time. Now even toilets are choked due to backflow of water.” (With inputs from Pranchal Srivastava, Vivek Singh Chauhan, Urooj Khan, Pragati Gupta and Ayushi Mishra)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/people-wake-up-to-knee-deep-water-and-caved-in-roads/articleshow/86276338.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The boy had caught the infection in his native village at Rewa in Madhya Pradesh. Since he was not vaccinated against tetanus, the disease turned serious for him. ICU in-charge of GMCH Dr Milind Vyawahare told TOI that this is the first case of tetanus in last two years and first such serious case in recent years. Dr Vyawhare said that tetanus injection is very common and it’s rare to see a patient with such serious level of disease. “It is difficult for new doctors to diagnose the infection,” he said.A super specialty hospital in MP and a well-known private hospital in Nagpur referred the boy to GMCH after initial treatment. The ICU in-charge said the patient was having continuous convulsions due to tetanus. “His pulse rate and blood pressure was fluctuating due to autonomic nervous system involvement. Patient was not able to breathe due to continuous convulsions. So, he was kept on ventilator support,” said Dr Vyawahare. The boy reached Nagpur on August 5 and was treated in a private hospital for two days. On August 7, he reached GMCH and was put on ventilator support immediately. His was on ventilator till September 15. Doctors from private set-up told TOI that it would have been very difficult for any private hospital to keep the patient on ventilator for 37 days and then wean him off the life support system. Patient’s maternal uncle Dinesh told TOI that they hail from a poor family and the GMCH was the last ray of hope. “The doctors have given second life to my nephew. He was unconscious for more than a month and we had little hope. But doctors were confident,” he said. HoD of the medicine department, Dr Prashant Patil, GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta and medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande appreciated the efforts taken by doctors and staff nurses. The boy is doing well now. Doctors successfully weaned him off the ventilator and shifted in another ward. He will be discharged after closure of tracheostomy. A resident doctor for whom this was a learning experience said that the boy’s condition was so bad that they had to create an opening at the front of the neck so a tube can be inserted into the windpipe to help him breathe. “It was first case of tetanus in my career,” she said. Rare encounter - Due to the widespread vaccination, tetanus is now a rare disease- In 1980, registered tetanus cases were 45,948. In 2019, only 35 cases in India - Before the latest case, Nagpur GMCH had seen only one case of tetanus in 2018 - The 12-year-old patient was kept on ventilator for 37 days straight, recovered on September 15- He was referred from a super specialty hospital in MP and a well-known private hospital in Nagpur||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/12-yr-old-with-rare-tetanus-survives-at-gmch-after-37-days-on-ventilator/articleshow/86272149.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

At a protest held near Mallikatte, the protesters chanted Hanuman Chalisa and offered prayers, seeking punishment for to those who are behind the demolition drive. They also raised slogans against the BJP government. VHP zonal president M B Puranik demanded restoration of the demolished temple in three months, and regularisation of all temples in the list prepared by the government for razing. “We now have our government, our own system and our own departments, but unusual decisions are being taken. The VHP and Sangh Parivar are pained because of the government’s move. It will have to face consequences if it does not mend ways,” Puranik warned. Bajrang Dal convener Puneeth Attavar said BJP leaders should keep their promise of protecting Hindutva. Urging the saffron party to withdraw its decision regarding the demolition of Hindu religious structures, Puneeth said that Bajrang Dal and other Hindu organisations helped the BJP to come to power in the state. “You will have to face the consequences if you dump Hindutva. Regularise all Hindu religious structures that are mentioned in the list of illegal structures,” he said. VHP zonal secretary Sharan Pumpwell said the temple demolition drive seems to be a part of a conspiracy. “An investigation must be conducted into the drive carried out against the temple in Mysuru district. Suspend the errant officials responsible for the incident,” he added. Hindu Jagaran Vedike members warned that massive protests will be held, if the government carries out similar drives in the coastal region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/temple-demolition-saffron-outfits-slam-bjp-govt/articleshow/86269466.cms||---

In his plea before the NGT, activist Zoru Bhathena said there is an ongoing illegal construction of a thick wide, 1.2 km-long, reinforced cement concrete wall under the guise of anti-sea erosion wall on the Versova beach. In the process, dumping of debris due to construction activities is also taking place, he said. Bhathena said the construction of the anti-sea erosion wall from Sagar Kutir to the Hindu Smashanbhoomi at Versova was being carried out only to safeguard the adjoining premises/super structures. While according necessary clearances for the construction, he said, the statutory authorities had given the go-by to all environmental and ecological concerns. Bhathena further said that Olive Ridley turtles visit the beaches of Mumbai coast during the breeding season, and lay eggs around the Versova beach. “The ongoing illegal construction affects their natural habitat,” he said. The NGT bench in its order said it was inclined to entertain the plea, and has directed issuance of notices to all the agencies concerned. The next hearing has been scheduled for September 29. The construction of the wall was taken up following a petition from local residents to MLA Bharati Lavekar, who raised funds from the Centre and the state for it. Lavekar said it was for the authorities to ensure that all permissions were in place prior to the construction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ngt-issues-notices-over-versova-beach-wall-construction/articleshow/86276500.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Postpone Ayush PG entrance, say docs peeved by exam centre mess||Nagpur: More than 9,000 Ayush PG aspirants in Maharashtra are up in arms against the National Testing Agency (NTA) over the mess in allotment of exam venues for the Ayush Post Graduate Entrance Test (AIAPGET). Now, they are demanding that the NTA and the Ayush ministry postpone the examination scheduled on September 18. Candidates from Maharashtra had been allotted examination centres mostly in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat states and even in Jammu. They were informed just four days prior to the exam. After it was reported in media and an email campaign initiated by the candidates, the NTA hastily started process of changing the examination venues on late Wednesday night. But less than 20% of the candidates have received the updated admit cards with colleges in Maharashtra as their exam venues. More than 80% candidates are still holding admit cards with Ahmedabad, Bharuch, Bhopal and Vadodara as their centres. TOI Nagpur was the first to report that not enough colleges were available in the state on September 18 due to the pre-scheduled MH-CET. NTA, on Thursday, officially accepted this. “Dates of CET in Maharashtra are clashing with AIAPGET. Hence, NTA is facing difficulty in getting adequate test centres in spite of best efforts. Therefore, some candidates have been allotted centres beyond their choice,” reads the statement issued by Dr Sadhana Parashar, senior director (exams), NTA. According to Dr Parashar, this clause is well mentioned in the NTA information booklet and “candidates have already accepted this while filling up the application”. However, this explanation has left thousands of candidates in a lurch. “What if someone has already reached Gujarat and NTA changes his centre to Maharashtra a day before examination? Even the helpline number issued by the agency is not working,” said Dr Ganesh Kate. A student, Vaidya Shubham Dhoot, called Ayush minister Sarbananda Sonowal who has reportedly assured to provide some relief. Sources at NTA told TOI that it’s very unlikely to postpone the examination as the issue is limited to Maharashtra state only while the examination is being held nationwide. National Integrated Medical Association (NIMA) has resolved to support the students. “We will stress postponing the examination in larger interest of the candidates. Missing this exam due to faraway venue or due to change in centre will cost one full-year and many years of preparation for these doctors,” said Dr Atul Raut Patil from NIMA students’ forum. IN HELPLESS STATE- Not possible to manage 9,000-odd computers on Sept 18 in Maharashtra to conduct AIAPGET, says NTA- It managed a few hundred computers on Wednesday night and changed exam venues of some candidates without any notice - All other candidates were asked to reach centres in Gujarat, MP to appear in AIAPGET- Instead of relief, this move created confusion among candidates as no one knows whose centre will be updated when- Difficulties in reaching other states plus confusion about centres has made candidates helpless - They have asked for postponement of AIAPGET||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/postpone-ayush-pg-entrance-say-docs-peeved-by-exam-centre-mess/articleshow/86272182.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Vaghani’s detractors were jubilant as he was without a post in either the organization or government for over a year. However, the two-time Patidar MLA from Bhavnagar West made an impressive comeback in active politics, being made the second-most important minister in the Bhupendra Patel government. Inducted for the first time in government directly as a cabinet rank minister, Vaghani has been entrusted with the education, higher and technical education and science and technology portfolios. Vaghani was appointed president of the state unit of the BJP in August 2016 even as the ruling BJP was grappling with the Patidar reservation stir and widespread protests by Dalits following the Una episode. BJP won the 2017 assembly election with a reduced majority as a section of Patidar vote bank got alienated from the BJP during the reservation stir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jitu-vaghanis-impressive-comeback-silences-critics/articleshow/86274320.cms||---

A two-time MLA from Vadodara, Trivedi was allocated the important revenue, law and justice, parliamentary affairs and disaster management portfolios. This is Trivedi’s second stint as minister. He was minister of state (MOS), sports, youth & cultural affairs for a short span of time before the 2017 assembly elections, after which he was elected speaker of the Gujarat assembly. Trivedi’s proactive work in his constituency during the lockdown and promotion of central government schemes as an MLA were taken note of by the leadership, propelling him to the number two position in the Bhupendra Patel government. Rajendra Trivedi represented the accused in the Gulbarg Society case, a high-profile post-Godhra riots case. He discontinued his practice as an advocate after being made minister in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/the-rise-and-rise-of-legal-eagle-rajendra-trivedi/articleshow/86274354.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Second in list of states with most cases pending trial||Vadodara: Gujarat again became the second state with most pendency of cases in the country in 2020. The National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) report titled ‘Crime in India 2020’, released on Wednesday, reveals that last year over 13.7 lakh cases registered under the Indian Penal Code and over 21 lakh cases registered under state laws are pending trial in different courts of the state. The pendency of cases saw a rise of above 19% over the previous year. The pendency rate of these cases also rose by 5.9%. Gujarat had second highest cases pending trial at the end of the year in 2019 and 2018 too. The Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions put in place hampered the trials last year, opine lawyers practicing criminal law.  They said that other factors also added to the overall higher number of cases pending trial in the state. The high number of FIRs registered for violation of Covid guidelines too added to the burden of the judicial department. “Due to the lockdown, only urgent cases like bail applications were being heard last year, so that led to an increase in pending trials,” said Vadodara-based lawyer Hitesh Gupta. “Besides the pandemic, there are also other limitations like lack of infrastructure and shortage of backend staff in courts which slows down the judicial system,” Gupta said. He added that support staff like a stenographer or a clerk that a judge needs for faster trial, aren’t available in enough numbers. Now, as the physical hearings of the cases have resumed, lawyers want their cases to move forward faster. “The courts are issuing summons and even if all witnesses are present, it is not possible to examine them in a single sitting due to limitations,” Gupta told TOI. While the conviction rate in the cases registered under the state laws increased last year to 54.9%, it decreased to 40.7% in cases registered under the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/second-in-list-of-states-with-most-cases-pending-trial/articleshow/86272167.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Of the four, one is a cabinet minister while the others are minister of state (MOS). All the ministers appointed are from different communities. In former chief minister Vijay Rupani’s government, only one MLA, Kumar alias Kishore Kanani, could secure a ministerial berth as MOS for health. In all assembly seats BJP won the 2017 election with a thumping majority. The other notable politicians from the city include state BJP chief C R Paatil who is an MP from Navsari constituency. Recently, Surat MP Darshana Jardosh too was appointed as MOS, railway and textile in the Narendra Modi-led government in the Centre. Considering his political equations with state BJP leadership, newly appointed cabinet minister Purnesh Modi surprised many with his selection as a minister on Thursday. The two term BJP city unit chief, who is considered as the face of the OBC community in the region, threw many off guard when he he took a seat on the dais at the swearing-in ceremony. Of the 12 MLAs, only Sanghvi, Moradiya and Patel were congratulated by city BJP leaders before the swearing-in ceremony. Harsh Rameshkumar Sanghvi is considered the face of youth in BJP and was the youngest MLA in 2012 to be elected at the age of 27. An active student leader, he was associated with Vishwa Hindu Parishad and played a key role in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s road show and meeting with youth. A farmer and closely associated with cooperative bodies in Surat district, Mukesh Patel belongs to the Koli Patel community that has a greater presence in the coastal belt of south Gujarat.

The ambitious project of UP government aims a makeover of state-run schools by providing toilets, drinking water, furniture, boundary walls by March 2022. The ranking based on third party survey by Prerna mobile application done by the basic education department in September 2020, and August 2021, puts Varanasi on first place with 198.7 score. Ghaziabad and Etawah stood second and third with their overall scores of 189.7 and 171.8 respectively. Lucknow was ranked sixth with an overall growth score of 128.2. The ranking shows that out of 1,32,675 schools mapped on August, 2021, 5.3% (7,092) qualified for five-star ratings with OVK indicators saturating above 90%. Another 21.7% (28817) schools were graded as four-star, where over 75% of basic facilities were provided. Another 45% (60,142) schools achieved three-star grading by meeting at least 50% of the OVK indicators. Around 15.7% (20,815) and 11.9% (15,809) got two-star and one-star grading respectively. Schools with single stars show saturation of OVK indicators below 35%. Director general, school education, Anamika Singh said, “Operation Kayakalp is one of the biggest inter-departmental programmes targeted for ensuring basic infrastructure facilities in state-run schools. Field officers are working hard. The work of rejuvenating remaining schools is being done in a phased manner.” Though the grading shows significant improvement – from 0.6% five-star and 3.3% four-star schools last year to 5% five-star and 21.7% four-star schools this year respectively – the target is still a long way off. Singh has now set a fresh time-bound target to ensure 100% completion before UP goes to poll in 2022. Citing the Operation Kayakalp as the government's dream project which is monitored at high level, Singh has instructed district basic education officers to ensure 75% saturation of OVK indicators by November, 90% by December and 100% by January 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kashi-claims-top-rank-in-operation-kayakalp/articleshow/86276495.cms||Isha Jain

However, the vaccine storage at the centre was found unlocked. After the surprise inspection of the health and wellness centre (HWC), Behlana, health secretary Yashpal Garg sought a written explanation from three staffers of the dispensary—medical officer, nurse and sanitary worker—for coming late. This was Garg’s second surprise inspection within a week. Earlier, he had carried out a night inspection at all government hospitals, including GMCH-32 and GMSH-16, and flagged various shortcomings. On Thursday, Garg reached Behlana dispensary at 9.15am, as its opening time is 9am. He was shocked to see that the HWC at the ground floor was locked, but vaccine storage at the first floor was unlocked. No one was there except a patient waiting for the centre to open. Shortly, an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) reached there. Garg, the patient and the ANM then started waiting for the HWC to open. At 9.30 am, a sanitary worker arrived, looked for the keys and opened the HWC. He informed the UT health secretary that he was coming from Raipur Khurd after meeting an officer there in connection with medicines. At 9.35am, another sanitary worker reached and clarified that he was coming from the ADM’s office after delivering parcels there. In the meantime, the ANM phoned the medical officer and requested him to reach the HWC. Another ANM, who was initially stated to be on leave, came at 9.40am, saying someone was indisposed in the family. At 9.52am, medical officer Dr Hansraj Rahi reached. Another sanitary worker reached at 10.04am. After seeing the UT health secretary, he said he was caught in a traffic jam, but when Garg told him that he was late by over an hour, he said he had health issues. Ensure punctuality, DHS toldUT health secretary Yashpal Garg has directed the director, health services, to ensure punctuality in offices so that patients do not have to wait.

The announcement, made by Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, is based on the party’s Delhi model. Sisodia also said that within 24 hours of coming to power, an AAP government would waive all pending dues, provide 24x7 electricity to the state and give free power to farmers. “People from UP have been very impressed with the model of governance that AAP has been able to provide in Delhi. Many people from UP live and work in Delhi and when they return home, they tell how they do not have to pay anything for electricity. I guarantee you on behalf of Arvind Kejriwal that we will make consumption of up to 300 units free,” he said. In Delhi, consumption of up to 200 units of power is free while for up to 400 units the rate has been halved. Sisodia added: “UP government has made power so expensive that people have not been able to pay their bills. There are many who have pending dues of more than Rs 1 lakh. I assure you that if elected to power, we will waive all pending bills. We also promise that there will be 24x7 power availability. Delhi is purchasing power and still manages to supply continuous power. UP is producing its own power so it has no excuse for power cuts.” Party MP and UP in charge Sanjay Singh said that there are 38 lakh consumers who have pending dues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aap-promises-300-units-of-free-power-if-it-forms-govt/articleshow/86276524.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Singh, who was in the state capital to review projects and schemes of his departments, said, “From over Rs 1.93 lakh crore between 2008-9 and 2013-14, the total spending under MNREGS rose to over Rs 4.86 lakh crore — an increase of 150% — between 2014-15 and 2021-22.” MNREGS, which came into force during UPA government in 2006, helped provide employment to lakhs of migrants who returned to their respective states after the pandemic-triggered lockdown. “Be it creation of mandays or engagement of women workers, there has been much improvement in the scheme’s implementation,” Singh said, adding that the linking of nearly all job card holders with Aadhar has brought transparency in MNREGS. The asset creation through MNREGS also grew from 49% in 2013-14 to over 73% in 2021-22, he added. Singh said the Centre plans to associate MNREGS with a programme for farmers under which 20% of their total tillable land can be used for cultivation of fruits and vegetables. “This will help in increasing the income of farmers besides saving the environment,” he said. The number of women associated with Self-Help Groups (SHGs) under National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) also rose from 2.35 crore till 2013-14 to eight crore in 2021-22, the minister said. On rural and urban housing front, the Centre is committed to meeting the target of providing 2.95 crore houses under PM Awas Yojana by 2022, the deadline set by PM Narendra Modi, Singh said. “The previous government in UP came up with Lohia Awas scheme, but it turned out to be a political housing scheme under which just a select few got houses,” he taunted. “Under the Modi and Yogi governments, all the homeless are being provided a roof,” said Singh, adding, that over 26 lakh housing units have been given to beneficiaries in UP in the last four years. Under PM Gramin Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), just 1.88 lakh km of rural roads were constructed between 2009-10 and 2013-14, the figure increased to over 6.3 lakh km under Modi government, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mnregs-spend-rose-by-150-under-modi-govt-says-giriraj/articleshow/86276569.cms||---

---||India||WHO: Indian women’s healthy life expectancy SE Asia’s lowest||Females in India can on average expect to live just over 60 years of a healthy life unhampered by disabling illness or injuries, the lowest healthy life expectancy among 11 countries in the World Health Organisation's South East Asia region. Even when it comes to men, there are just two countries in this region, Timor-Leste and Myanmar, that are worse off in terms of healthy life expectancy. One factor that clearly contributes to this is the fact that the mortality rate of children under five years is the highest in these same countries, Timor-Leste and Myanmar being again even worse off than India. These sobering realities emerge from data in a recently released WHO report on the region's progress in achieving universal health coverage and the health-related sustainable development goals. In the countries with the best performance in the region, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Maldives, health expenditure as a share of total government expenditure is among the highest in the region. In contrast, the estimated share of spending on health in total government spending is the lowest in India (3.4%), Bangladesh (3%) and Myanmar (3.5). Consequently, in these three countries, out-of-pocket expenditure, that is people spending from their own savings constitutes between 63% in India and 76% in Myanmar compared to just 11% in Thailand. Given this situation, it comes as no surprise that Bangladesh and India also have the highest proportion of their population, 7% and 4.2% respectively, being pushed into poverty because of having to spend on healthcare. They also have the highest proportions of people who spent more than 10% of their household's total expenditure on healthcare, a situation that is described as catastrophic health expenditure. Almost a quarter of the population in Bangladesh and over 17% in India are estimated to face catastrophic expenditure due to healthcare. The report pointed out that health inequity analysis showed that some people were able to "live healthier lives and have better access to health services than others - entirely due to the conditions in which they are born, grow, live, work and age". It stressed the need to collect high-quality disaggregated data for monitoring health inequalities to enable framing of appropriate policies for ensuring equitable access to and uptake of health services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/who-indian-womens-healthy-life-expectancy-se-asias-lowest/articleshow/86279599.cms||Rema Nagarajan

Enforcement agencies and experts believe the fall in number of cases was due to the Covid-19 lockdown and restrictions. However, conviction rate in white-collar offences is very low in AP when compared to other states. State registered 7,467 economic offence cases in 2020. As many as 8,806 cases were booked in 2019 and 6,473 cases of cheating by white-collar criminals were registered in 2018, according to the National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) 2020 annual report. AP police registered 852 cases under Sections 406-409 for criminal breach of trust, 27 cases for counterfeit under Sections 231-243,255 and 489 A and 489 E and 6,588 for forgery, cheating and fraud under Sections 420,465, 468,471, 231-243 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in 2020. State saw 4,081 cases of loss of property due to criminal breach of trust, forgery, cheating and fraud including a case of Rs 50 crore-Rs 100 crore and another of Rs 25 crore to Rs 50 crore. Six cases related loss of Rs 10 cr-Rs 25 crore, 62 cases of Rs 1 crore to Rs 10 crore and 123 cases of Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore were also registered. A total of 10,545 cases were pending from 2019. Police investigated some offences in 2020 and had to dispose of around 4,457 cases due to insufficient evidence despite the cases being true. However, 13,552 cases were pending investigations at the end of 2020. Trial was completed in 1,017 matters and courts disposed of around 1,809 cases related to economic fraud. However, 13,290 cases were still pending for trial at various levels. The conviction rate in the state stood at 11.7%, far less than that of other states. The police are of the opinion that investigation in economic offence cases is a lengthy process as most of the time, the prosecution purely depends on the documentary evidence and reports of forensic, banks and a few others which delay the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/economic-crimes-conviction-rate-decline-in-ap/articleshow/86274479.cms||Nalla.Babu

The two were mobbed by activists who condemned the recent demolition of a temple in Nanjangud taluk. The two leaders tried to pacify the crowd and said the Congress was trying to gain political mileage out of the incident. On September 8, the Mahadevamma temple in Huchchagani village in Nanjangud taluk was demolished following a directive from the Supreme Court. Speaking to reporters Tejasvi Surya, said suddenly Congress leaders have become religious and are sympathising with Hindus and projecting themselves as saviours of Hindu religion. “Do not fall for their guiles. The Congress celebrated Tipu Jayanti even though so many Hindus were against it. Now they are singing a different tune,” commented the MP of Bengaluru South. Simha admitted that people were upset with the demolition drive. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has promised to take a decision on the issue after consulting the cabinet, he told the protesters. “We will study the Supreme Court order in detail and issue specific directives in this regard,” the CM had said three days ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/activists-gherao-surya-simha-over-temple-demolition/articleshow/86272429.cms||---

Kurollu was then a law student and is now a practicing lawyer. His name had not been mentioned in the FIR, but Kurollu was still taken into custody from Nanded and driven to Karimnagar, where he was under detention for eight days before being let off. In 2002, after becoming a practicing lawyer, Kurollu filed a writ petition in the HC seeking apt compensation for his illegal detention. The AP home secretary, the then Karimnagar Superintendent of Police (SP), the then inspector of One Town police station in Karimnagar and a home guard-cum-driver were named respondents, apart from the state and the then Nanded police officers, who assisted their Karimnagar counterparts. All four respondents from AP did not contest the matter either in written or oral form. In a recent judgement, the bench of Justice V K Jadhav and Justice S G Dige said that the compensation must be paid within three months from the date of receipt of the order and, if necessary, the money may be recovered from the then Karimnagar SP, then inspector of One Town police station and the home guard-cum-driver. In December 1997, Kurollu’s sister-in-law had registered a domestic violence and dowry case against her husband Shyam, his other brother, Ravi, as well as his mother. Kurollu’s lawyer Maya Jamdhale had brought to the court’s notice that he was detained while he was on his way to college and taken to Karimnagar despite his name not being mentioned in the FIR. Despite being detained, he was not produced before a magistrate in Nanded for a transit remand required to take him to Karimnagar, as per procedure. In 2010, the HC had partly allowed the petition by asking the AP home secretary to pay Rs1 lakh as compensation and later recover the same from the then Karimnagar police officers. However, following a petition by the then inspector Sanjeev Kumar of One Town police station, the court had recalled this order in January 2013 and had restored the petition for decision afresh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pay-nanded-man-rs-2-lakh-hc-tells-ap-home-secretary/articleshow/86269803.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Lucknow||Modi b’day: BJP to send postcards from 40L grassroots beneficiaries||Lucknow: Stepping up the clamour around PM Narendra Modi’s popularity, the UP unit of BJP plans to send lakhs of postcards greeting him on his 71st birthday on Friday. The cards will be sent on behalf of people who were benefited by welfare schemes, including Ujjwala, Saubhagya and PM Awas Yojana. UP BJP general secretary J P S Rathore said, the party plans to send anything around 25 cards from each of 1.63 lakh booths, in what translates into around 40 lakh cards. “The number will, however, depend on availability of postcards in each district,” he said, while speaking to TOI. Sources said, the party has shortlisted names of people from various castes and communities on whose behalf a postcard greeting Modi would be sent. Experts interpret the move as BJP’s endeavour to mobilise maximum number of people, ostensibly beneficiaries of flagship schemes that are touted to play a crucial role in positioning BJP against an assertive opposition in run-up to assembly elections next year. Sources said, the party does not wish to miss a chance in hoisting people’s adulation for Modi, while keeping the cadre on its toes. A senior BJP leader said, since 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi has been the mascot of almost all political campaigns of the party and left his mark on all major social welfare schemes. Earlier, the party had been celebrating his birthday as “Seva Saptah”, but this year the campaign has been expanded as “Seva Evam Samarpan Abhiyan”, which will run from September 17 (on his birthday) to October 7 (when he became Gujarat’s CM for first time in 2001). BJP’s heightened activity on Modi’s birthday comes two days before Yogi Adityanath government completes four-a-half-year rule in the politically crucial state of UP. Rathore said, the party will also organise various social services, including organising health camps, distribution of fruits and medicines to the poor and tree plantation drive to mark the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/modi-bday-bjp-to-send-postcards-from-40l-grassroots-beneficiaries/articleshow/86276596.cms||Pankaj Shah

Cops and sex workers joined hands to take a pregnant woman with mental disability in her twenties to Mayo Hospital, where she delivered a healthy boy less than an hour later. The woman’s family members offered to pay for the clothes and bedsheet the sex workers gave her. The sex workers — who were with the woman at the hospital, helping the cops to get her admitted — are learnt to have politely refused to be compensated for the material provided by them. The pregnant woman, later identified as Uma Paunikar, had left her home and strayed into the Dargah Galli of Ganga Jamuna before she went into labour pain. The woman was spotted at 6.30am by cops deployed in the lanes of Ganga Jamuna, where sex work has been stopped by city police chief Amitesh Kumar. With the woman unwilling to reveal her name and address, the constables on duty alerted assistant police inspector (API) Gopika Kodape of Lakadganj police station, who was patrolling the locality. Kodape said she realized the woman was in labour pain and immediately summoned a police vehicle to shift her to hospital. “As a woman, I could sense her condition and hence decided to take her to a hospital at the earliest, though she was not revealing anything about herself,” she said. The API added, “Our team later traced her family in Zenda Chowk, Lalgunj, and alerted them. The woman had left her house in the night when rest of the family members were asleep, and somehow walked till Ganga Jamuna.” Kodape said the woman’s mother rushed to the hospital after receiving the information. It's learnt that the constables also sought help from an elderly sex worker, Santoshi Lahere, to help them support the woman in her labour pain. Lahere promptly stepped out with a friend to help the cops shift the pregnant woman. Lahere said she spotted the woman at 4am but thought she was a vagabond. “When the cops alerted us, the woman's condition was precarious. Some of us offered her clothes, some gave her a bedsheet, some of us tried to massage her legs and hands but her labour pain was growing,” said Lahere, who lauded the cops for their efforts. “The police officer and her team summoned a police vehicle quickly, in which we could take the woman to hospital,” Lahere added. Lahere said the pregnant woman was vomiting, but she cleaned it without any hesitancy. Senior police inspector Parag Pote of Lakadganj police station said the woman had given birth to a boy, who was doing well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/woman-with-mental-illness-delivers-boy-after-cops-sex-workers-rescue-her-from-road/articleshow/86274543.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh pips Karnataka to lead 2020 tally with most cybercrimes||LUCKNOW: In 2020, Uttar Pradesh may have registered the sharpest dip in cases of heinous crimes in seven years, but the state registered at least 30 criminal cases of cybercrime daily all through the year. While this was slightly lower than the number of cybercrime cases in the state in 2019, it made UP top the list of states with such cases in 2020. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) statistics released on Wednesday, UP registered 11,097 cases of cybercrime in 2020. The second on the list was Karnataka, a comparatively less populated state, with 10,741 cybercrimes in the year. This was a whopping increase of 1,500% from 687 cybercrime cases reported in UP in 2013. The records also state that 6,491 people were arrested in these cases while 878 were convicted. Among cybercrime cases, the maximum, 4647, had fraud as motive. This was followed by 560 with sexual exploitation as motive. While 73 cases had political motives, 63 were for hatred against the country. In 2,120 cases, the offence was publication and transmission of obscene material. Another 325 cases were registered for pornography against women and 161 for the same against children. SP cybercrime Triveni Singh told TOI that as many as 18 dedicated police stations in each range have been made functional and more are underway in the wake of rise in cybercrimes. “We are using state-of-the-art tools to detect cybercrimes. Recently, Rs 6 crore were recovered by us across the state in such cases,” he said. Another senior official said that a first-of-its-kind initiative for safeguarding women and children had been initiated by the state where at one click, one could register complaints regarding cyber bullying and online harassment. A new website, www.wcso.in, was launched recently for women and child security organization.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-pips-karnataka-to-lead-2020-tally-with-most-cybercrimes/articleshow/86276638.cms||---
---||Business||Mastercard ban boosts Visa’s biz||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: Visa is consolidating its leadership in the Indian credit card market with most issuers who had partnered with Mastercard earlier signing up with it to continue issuing credit cards. Shares of RBL Bank, the latest to sign up with Visa, rose over 2% on Tuesday after the private lender announced that it has signed up with Visa to issue credit cards. RBL has a 5% share of the Indian credit card market, which is disproportionate to its size due to its partnerships for co-branded cards, particularly the one with Bajaj Finserv. “We would like to thank Visa as well as Finserv, our technology partner, for enabling this journey. With this launch, we are confident of meeting our annual plan of issuing 1.2-1.4 million credit cards in FY22,” said RBL Bank head (retail, inclusion & rural business) Harjeet Toor. Like RBL Bank, Yes Bank and Federal Bank have said that they will start issuing Visa credit cards. Both private lenders have said that they would also be issuing RuPay credit cards. What will help Visa gain more market share is the lifting of the ban on HDFC Bank from issuing credit cards. The embargo on HDFC Bank on issuing cards was lifted soon after Mastercard received a ban from RBI for not adhering to norms that require customer data to be stored only in India. HDFC Bank is the largest issuer of credit cards in the country and the lifting of the ban is expected to spur pent-up demand from its customer base.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mastercard-ban-boosts-visas-biz/articleshow/86259976.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Pune||NCRB report says cybercrime down in Pune; police records show otherwise||PUNE: The National Crime Records Bureau’s ‘Crime in India — 2020’ report notes that cybercrime in Pune saw a decline in 2020 compared to the previous year. But this is far from an accurate assessment of ground reality, according to data available with the Pune police. As per the NCRB eport, 238 cybercrime cases were reported in Pune city in 2020, down from 309 in 2019. “These figures are based on registered FIRs. In reality, Pune police received 14,400 cybercrime complaint applications in 2020 — double the 7,742 applications received in 2019,” inspector D S Hake of the Pune cyber police said. Hake said police have already received over 13,000 applications this year. “This clearly shows the extent to which cybercrime has increased in the city since 2019,” he said. Most instances of cybercrime involved revenge, anger, extortion, defamation, pranks, sexual exploitation, political motives, and incitement of hatred. “Cybercrime has gone up because of increased use of internet during the lockdown, as most people were dependent on online services,” Hake said. “Cybercrooks exploited vulnerabilities in online systems. By the time these loopholes were plugged, users were already targeted,” he added. Hake explained that one of the most widespread methods of online fraud was the use of fake websites offering services or products. “Many users are unaware or cannot distinguish between secure and unsecured sites and get cheated,” he said. Further, Hake said 70% of the complaints they get involve netbanking fraud. “Such complaints have increased as banks/mobile phone companies are slow in updating their customers’ details — crooks use the KYC update trick and siphon funds from people’s accounts,” he explained. The inspector said investigating such complaints consumes time as they are heavily dependent on technical information to be handed over by service providers, which would help identify where (IP address) and how the fraud was committed, as well as details of the victims. Cyber expert Gaurav Jachak said delay by service providers in giving police this information lead to a delay in the registration of FIRs. “In most cases, people duped of small amounts are unwilling to pursue the matter. In some instances, banks settle disputes with consumers. This could be why the number of FIRs is lower,” Jachak said. Sapna Deo, an academician specialising in cyber law, said it was important for people to be eductaed in cyber security measures. “Most incidents occur due to negligence as many people don’t know on how to use computers/mobile phones. Instances of blackmail have increased with the increase in video-calling; photos posted on social media are morphed,” Deo said. Jachak said the lockdown-induced circumstances were partly to blame. “Many people lost jobs and started looking for ways to earn money. Cybercrooks would target such people, offering them fake jobs abroad or loans at an attractive rate of interest. The crooks would thus gain access to sensitive financial information/bank accounts and cheat them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ncrb-report-says-cybercrime-down-in-pune-police-records-show-otherwise/articleshow/86274586.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Nagpur||NMC to re-appropriate Rs 40 crore for road works||NAGPUR: With NMC going to polls early next year, the ruling BJP seems desperate to arrange funds for improving road infrastructure in the city. On Wednesday, standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar chaired a meeting during which approval was given to re-appropriate Rs40 crore from several heads. The meeting was attended by officials from NMC’s public works and accounts departments. The re-appropriation is being done following a ruling by mayor Dayashankar Tiwari on this in a recently held general body meeting after municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had stated that city roads will be improved only on availability of funds. PWD officials told Bhoyar that the department requires additional fund of Rs40 crore for improving city roads, including Rs8 crore for hotmix department. “Then only NMC can start road improvement work,” the official said. Official sources said Bhoyar and PWD officials have come to conclusion that for the time being, the civic body can divert funds kept for payment of bills of some cement roads, which comes to around Rs5 crore. Similar funds sanctioned for a road in Mahal too can be diverted as central Nagpur MLA Vikas Kumbhare had provided money required for the project from his DPDC fund. NMC will also divert Rs2.5 crore earmarked for a crematorium in the city after it got state funds for the project, sources said. Bhoyar reportedly gave in-principle nod for re-appropriation of funds from several heads from his NMC budget for 2021-22. Now, the administration will table a proposal before the standing committing for its nod. Sources said if the civic body issues work orders worth Rs150 crore sanctioned by then standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane, all tar roads in the city can be re-carpeted easily. Since the last two financial years, Pohane’s nod to road improvement proposals had been reportedly stopped by the civic administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-re-appropriate-rs40-crore-for-road-works/articleshow/86274560.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

He was upset with Congress MLAs for unruly behaviour and not following the rules of business in the House. Joshi complained to Gehlot about the behaviour of ruling party MLAs and spoke to Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria. It is learnt that Gehlot had prevailed upon Joshi to continue with the session, slated till September 18 to complete the listed business. Speaking to the media after a function at the Pink City Press Club on Thursday, Joshi said, “Since the business advisory committee had already decided on the business of the House till September18, I have to honour the decision. So, the assembly will conduct its business as scheduled on Friday and Saturday.” Following the directions of the Speaker, assembly secretary Promil Kumar Mathur issued the notification on Thursday for reconvening the session from Friday. Speaker was angry after ruling party members deviated from the topic despite repeated reprimands by the chair while having discussion on the Compulsory Registration of Marriages (amendment) Bill 2021 on Wednesday. When the Speaker called out deputy opposition leader Rajendra Rathore to speak on the Bill, transport minister Pratap Singh Kachriayawas also stood up to say something. Speaker then reprimanded the minister. Parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal then stood up to defend the transport minister. An upset Joshi said that he was adjourning the House proceedings and left the House much to the surprise of both the ruling and opposition members. Trouble started when the transport minister started replying to the Rajasthan State Road Transport Service (Prevention of Ticketless Travel) (Amendment) Bill, 2021 under which the penalty for ticketless travel was increased to a maximum of Rs 2,000. The Opposition have been demanding a comprehensive bill to bail out the perennially loss-making public transport corporation instead of a piecemeal approach. But the minister, in his reply, accused the previous BJP government for the ills of the Roadways. BJP members then started a protest in the well of the House. The Speaker then came to the chair to pacify the members. He was angry not only with the Opposition, but ruling party members as well for not cooperating with the chair to conduct the business. Deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore said, “I have never seen ruling party members obstructing the House and disrespecting the Speaker which led to the unsavoury situation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/speaker-gives-in-to-gehlot-toresume-assembly-session-today/articleshow/86276689.cms||---

The activists claimed that several roads constructed in the city in the past two years have been easily washed away due to floods and rains and heavy flow of traffic. As per the road construction manual, the contractor must be held liable to repair if roads get damaged due to any reason. Firoz Sheikh, an activist, said, “We met Balkawade and demanded that any road building work not be awarded to the contractors who have built poor quality roads. They should first rebuild the damaged roads to be eligible for new contracts. Balkawade has asked the officials to survey such roads and display boards with details like name of contractor, date, expenses and dimensions.” The activists also demanded that unscientific speed-breakers along major roads are causing inconvenience to the motorists. They cited the example of a stretch between Mahasainik Darbar Hall and Kasba Bawda that has a total of 12 speed-breakers. “Such speed-breakers should be removed. They are serving no purpose neither they are constructed as per the manual. Such speed-breakers are causing accidents, harm to the motorists and damage to the vehicles,” said Sheikh. Balkawade has asked the officials to count all unscientific speed-breakers. The activists also demanded that the road repair and rebuilding work should start at the earliest to avoid the work getting stalled due to code of conduct for Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) election that are likely to be held early next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/no-contracts-for-bad-road-builders-kolhapur-activists/articleshow/86267006.cms||---
---||Pune||Offences against the elderly dipped in 2020||Pune: Crime against senior citizens fell sharply last year, as per the ‘Crime in India — 2020’ report released by the National Crime Records Bureau on Wednesday. As per the report, Pune recorded 224 cases in 2019 and 123 cases in 2020. Pune stands ninth among the 19 metropolitan cities covered in the report — Delhi with 906 cases is first, while Mumbai, which had 844 cases, is ranked third. In the 2019 report, Pune was sixth with 224 cases of crime against senior citizens. Police commissioner Amitabh Gupta attributed the downward trend to most senior citizens staying at home due to the pandemic. “Pune police too have taken many proactive measures to help senior citizens,” Gupta said. Most of the cases related to forgery, cheating, theft, robbery, and murder. Of the 123 cases, 38 (31%) related to theft and 27 (22%) related to cheating and forgery cases, as per the report. The previous year, there were 63 cases of cheating and forgery, and 57 cases of theft. Seven cases of robbery were reported by the elderly, a sharp drop from 21 reported in 2019. “Senior citizens out on morning walks are easy targets for robbers. Due to the pandemic, the elderly were not permitted to go out; this obviously had an impact on the figures,” a crime branch officer said. Pune police have a special cell, with a dedicated helpline, to assist senior citizens. The helpline gets an average of four calls a day, assistant inspector Yogita Bodkhe, in charge of the cell, said. She said most calls tend to be about domestic issues, such as ill-treatment by son or daughter-in-law. “In such cases, we counsel the family, and it usually has positive results. We got 377 calls till August this year and resolved 321,” Bodkhe said. In its records, the cell has a list of 621 senior citizens who live alone as their children have settled abroad. “We call and check on at least 20 every day. During peak pandemic, we also helped them get medicines and other essentials,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/offences-against-the-elderly-dipped-in-2020/articleshow/86274626.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Pune||Training in internet fraud probe techniques for all officers, staff||Pune: Police commissioner Amitabh Gupta on Thursday said all officers and personnel at every police station would be trained in handling cybercrime investigations. Gupta said the decision was taken in view of the rising number of cybercrime cases, which was proving difficult for the dedicated cyber cell to handle. “The volume of cybercrime complaint applications has grown, particularly since last year. So far this year, we have received 13,000 applications for verification and investigation,” Gupta told TOI. “The dedicated cyber cell is proving insufficient and so, we have started training our officers and personnel at the police station level too,” he added. There are 32 police stations under the Pune commissionerate, including the most recent additions — Lonikand and Loni Kalbhor. Gupta said the training would cover a range of topics, such as types of cybercrime, past and emerging methods employed by cybercrooks, and ways to investigate and solve such cases. On women’s safety in the wake of the recent gang rape incident, Gupta said, “We have initiated short- and long-term measures like stepping up police presence, patrolling and prompt action against offenders to ensure that women feel safe and secure.” He further said the police were consulting social activists, NGOs, and lawyers on women’s safety issues. “We have asked PMC to increase the number of CCTV cameras,” he said. On traffic regulation, Gupta said, “We need long-term planning to resolve traffic issues. For now, we have taken short-term measures like increasing the manpower in the traffic branch, deploying sufficient policemen at important junctions and other spots.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/training-in-internet-fraud-probe-techniques-for-all-officers-staff/articleshow/86274603.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Officials of the Trust confirmed that with a robust foundation in place, the Ram temple’s sanctum sanctorum will be thrown open to pilgrims by December 2023, just months before the Lok Sabha polls. Despite the design hanging fire for several months after the first pillar wobbled in loose sand and a streaming Saryu underground, India’s best tech brains hammered out the final foundation blueprint, which took more than a year to roll out after PM Narendra Modi performed the ‘bhoomipujan’ on August 5 last year. On Thursday, the Temple Trust invited journalists to Ramjanmabhoomi premises for the first time to have a glimpse of the sprawling 2.77acre foundation, which is 50-foot deep, 400-foot long and 300-foot wide. It was raised with roller compacted concrete of stone ash, stone powder and cement with each layer of 12 inch thickness. Member of temple trust, Anil Mishra, said, after completion of the first phase, work will kick off on erecting the 1.5m high raft, which will be cast in cement, followed by the plinth to be sculpted from pink sandstone sourced from Mirzapur. Temple trust secretary Champat Rai said, 4lakh cubic feet of pink stones from Mirzapur will be used for constructing the plinth and 1 lakh cubic feet of carved marble from Bansi Paharpur in Rajasthan is ready for sculpting the spire. Experts are brainstorming on construction of the outer periphery wall around the main temple complex, keeping security aspects in mind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ram-temple-foundation-complete-premises-showcased-for-first-time/articleshow/86276673.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

SECI has promised to supply power at Rs 2.49 per unit, the lowest rate in the country. The state government had recently floated tenders to set up 6,400 mw plants for the agriculture sector. However, the finalisation of bids was delayed due to a pending litigation in the high court. The SECI offer comes at a time when the state government was contemplating to finalise the bids after getting the clearance from the high court. The state government has already identified the land to set up the mega solar parks. The SECI, however, wants the state government to purchase power from the plants to be launched by the agency. The government is expected to take a call on the issue soon. In a letter to principal secretary (energy) N Srikanth, SECI complimented the innovative model promoted by the state government to utilize renewable energy to achieve sustainable agriculture growth while lowering the cost of cultivation by providing day-time power supply to farmers at competitive prices. “This indeed will go a long way in uplifting the living standards of farmers, without increasing financial burden on the state’s discoms,” it said. SECI started auctioning manufacturing linked solar tender in November 2019 and tenders were finalised between December 2019 and June 2020. About 12gw of ISTS-connected solar projects were awarded in four tranches of 3gw each. Commercial operation of tranche I projects is expected by September 2023 and tranche II, III & IV in 2024, ’25 and ’26, respectively. SECI is gearing up to tie up with different power utilities to purchase energy generated from tranche I projects. It said it is in a position to offer 9,000 mw capacity under tranche II, III & IV-3000 MW each, to be set up by September 2024, September 2025 and September 2026, respectively. The developers, who have been issued letter of award (LoA), have suo moto offered 9gw under tranche II, III & IV under this scheme at a tariff of Rs 2.49/kwh including SECl’s trading margin, considering reduction of solar tariff in recent tenders for solar projects conducted nationwide and considering the bulk capacity being offered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/solar-power-boost-to-states-farming-sector/articleshow/86274593.cms||Samdani MN
---||Jaipur||Now, Nitin Gadkari proposes electric highway in Rajasthan||DAUSA: Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari has said that his ministry was in talks with a foreign company to construct an electric highway between Jaipur and Delhi. He made this announcement while inspecting the progress of the work on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway at Dausa on Thursday. “It is my dream project to build an electric highway from Delhi to Jaipur. It is still a proposed project. After finalising the technology to be used and discussions with the company, a decision will be taken. Like electric railway engines, buses and trucks will also be powered by electricity. As a transport minister, I have taken a resolution to bring an end to the use of petrol and diesel in the country. The farmers will provide us an alternative to this,” said Gadkari while addressing the media. “We can now produce ethanol from maize, wheat, rice and bajra. Ethanol will soon replace petrol, and I shall bring a law to ensure that scooters and bikes are not run on petrol. So, instead of purchasing petrol at Rs 110 per litre, one can buy ethanol at Rs 65 per litre to run their vehicles. It will reduce air pollution further,” he added. Gadkari also took a ride on a bus to inspect the site. “This is the world’s largest express highway. After the completion of the project, the distance between Delhi and Mumbai will be covered in 12 to 12.5 hours and the distance between Delhi and Jaipur will be covered in two hours. The first phase of the project from Delhi to Dausa will be completed by March 2022,” said Gadkari. “To ensure wildlife protection so that they don’t get disturbed due to this project, I have decided to use the sound of Indian musical instruments for horns and sirens. This will also decrease sound pollution,” he added. Giving an account of total work done in Rajasthan, he said, from 2014 to 2020, Rs 35,000 crore has been spent on construction of roads, covering 5,800km. In 2021-22, 900km will be completed at a cost of Rs 10,000 crore and, by 2023-24, 2,500km roads will be constructed at a cost of Rs 30,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/now-gadkari-proposes-electric-highway-in-raj/articleshow/86276718.cms||---

Senior inspector Rajendra Sahane said on Thursday, “The EoW had received a complaint application on September 13 against Hrishikesh Patankar (38) from Dhayari. Verification of details showed that he had cheated at least 450 farmers in a similar manner.” Sahane said, “Patankar would encourage farmers to invest in medicinal plant crops and collected Rs50,000 per acre from each of them towards technical assistance in growing such plants and promised them return of Rs3lakh each. This did not happen and the complainants realised that they had been cheated.” “Apart from farmers, Patankar has also duped investors by luring them to purchase land for growing crops and promising them good returns,” he added. An FIR relating to cheating, forgery and criminal breach of trust was registered under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and sections 3 and 4 of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors Act. Complainant Rahul Shah (46) from Walvekarngar said, “I and other famers had met Patankar at a function organised by Ayush Mantralaya in 2018. He lured us to grow six tons of crops per year. He assured us to purchase crops at the rate of Rs50 per kg and pay Rs3lakh to each of us per year. We then signed an agreement with him. He collected crops from most of us, but he did not make payment to us till date. .” Farmer Pritam Chougle said, “ We realised that Patankar had cheated us after he breached the agreement and failed to return the money.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-held-for-cheating-farmers-of-over-rs-24-lakh/articleshow/86274636.cms||Asseem Shaikh

As many as 2,648 cases of crime against children were registered in state as per the ‘Crime in India-2020’ report published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The number of victims was 2,738. The report says the state stood at the bottom of the table in southern India. In the rape category under Section 376 of IPC, 577 cases were reported and the number of victims was 587. A total of 454 offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POSCO), were reported. The data also said that 39 children were found murdered in the state including four rape-murder. In 90.8 per cent of cases pertaining to penetrative sexual assault and other sexual assault, the accused were known persons such as family members, friends, or neighbours. The accused were unknown persons only in 25 cases. As many as 487 cases of kidnapping and abduction were reported in 2020. A total of 2,626 cases were pending from 2019. Police have disposed of 2442 cases. However, 2837 cases were pending investigations at the end of 2020. Trial was completed by various courts in 693 matters and 788 cases of crime were disposed of. However, 6,421cases were still awaiting trial. The conviction rate stood at 9.2 per cent and pendency was 89 per cent. Efforts must be made to ensure protection for the victim and her relatives to make them fearless and appear before the court to ensure punishment for the wrongdoers. The conviction rate is not more than 45 per cent. Defective investigation, victims’ stand, harsh atmosphere, and a few other factors are the major reasons for the poor conviction rate, legal experts observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/crimes-against-children-register-5-rise/articleshow/86274635.cms||Nalla.Babu

Around 2,100 cusec, however, continued to flow from the power house spillway of the barrage into the Koyna river — a tributary of Krishna river. During the recent spell of heavy rainfall, the maximum discharge from Koyna dam was 50,000 cusec. The discharge from Koyna and Warna dams had led to increase in water level of Krishna river, but the level has now started to speedily come down. On Thursday evening, the river was flowing at 17 feet at Sangli city’s Irwin Bridge — four feet less than the level reported on Wednesday. In the Kolhapur district, the Panchaganga river has also receded to its stream. A couple of days ago, the river had breached the banks for the second time in the current rainy season. The river was flowing at 25.4 feet at the Rajaram Barrage on Thursday, down from 32.9 feet. As many as 18 barrages are still under river water even though the discharge from upstream Radhanagari has stopped from the last 36 hours. No rainfall led to increase in the maximum temperature of the region. In Sangli, the maximum temperature was recorded at 31.2 degrees, while in Kolhapur it was 29.6 degrees. It was 29.2 degrees and 34.2 degrees in Satara and Solapur districts, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/as-rain-takes-a-break-koyna-radial-gates-stop-discharge/articleshow/86267047.cms||---

Many citizens had approached the NMC for vaccination of people at the old age homes as some of them are too old to step out. The NMC, therefore, started a special campaign in which data of the beneficiaries was collected from the institutes. The inoculators were then sent to the locations along with the vaccine doses. “We have vaccinated 507 people across 20 old age homes and the teams are ready to help the other citizens who need the service”, said Dr Ajita Salunke, the immunization officer of the NMC. As per the guidelines, all beneficiaries are to be administered Covaxin doses only. A few more beneficiaries, are yet to get vaccinated and therefore, the NMC has requested them to get in touch on the helpline numbers. The NMC has announced the helpline numbers — 0253-2317292 / 9607432233 — for those who require home vaccination, but there has been no response so far. Beneficiaries who have been immobilized for more than six months — due to mishaps, age, surgeries, ill-health etc. — can apply for the home-vaccination. Doctors treating such people need to certify their health condition and immobility for at least six months. The vaccination centres have already been asked to take up the requests of home vaccinations and make appropriate decisions. “The centers will take a call on home vaccination. If people are not satisfied, they can call on the helpline numbers. Meanwhile, the vaccinators are instructed to go out of turn to vaccinate the immobilised people who have been transported to the centres in vehicles on priority as well,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/500-senior-citizens-residing-at-old-age-home-vaccinated-in-nashik/articleshow/86269976.cms||---

A woman sanitation worker had picked up garbage from one of the multi-storied buildings in the society and handed it over to two men segregating the trash. The duo found the baby’s body and alerted the Chandannagar police. “The boy’s body has a head injury,” assistant inspector Gajanan Jadhav told TOI on Thursday. “A post-mortem has been conducted, but the medical experts have reserved their opinion for now. The viscera has been preserved and we are investigating the case,” Jadhav said. Police said the society has three 22-storied buildings. The woman goes to the society regularly to collect garbage, which she then hands over to the two men to sort out. The duo sort out the garbage at a spot in front of one of the buildings, police further said. On Tuesday, the woman collected garbage as usual and gave it to the two men. According to the police, the woman was unable to precisely recall from which passage in the three buildings she picked up the bag containing the body. “We hope to recover clues from CCTV footage,” Jadhav added.

The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders claimed that the Union government had not given the data, while the BJP has stated that the state should expedite collection of such information and initiate steps to provide reservations before the nagar panchayat (municipal council) elections.  The Congress said the political reservation for the OBC must be given, as the lack of would adversely impact people belonging to the category. “The OBC reservation should be a must for all the elections. The Centre has the data, which will help in proving OBC reservation in the elections. The Union government should provide the data to the state,” Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said. “Efforts on multiple grounds will be needed to provide political reservation at the earliest. Specific exemptions and relaxations for the OBC, to enable a special quota for the category, should be sought from the Supreme Court ahead of each election” he said. Shiv Sena spokesperson Arvind Sawant said the Centre has to provide the empirical data. “Till that happens, the stand on the OBC reservation will keep on fluctuating,” he said. Sawant said this might not have much impact on the allocation of seats. “A solution can be found in giving adequate representation to people representing the OBC category. These people can get seats from the general category during the elections,” he said. “The decision about OBC reservation and its impact on the elections was clear earlier as well. The state government could have collected the empirical data on priority and proved the need for the OBC reservation. But it did not do it. This has hampered the possibility of giving political reservation to the category,” BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/empirical-data-crucial-for-obc-poll-quota-politicians/articleshow/86274662.cms||---

---||India||Centre backs off on NCLAT, Justice Cheema to continue||NEW DELHI: Staring at a back-to-back confrontation with the Supreme Court on appointments to key tribunals, the Centre on Thursday backed off and agreed to continue with Justice A I S Cheema as acting chairman of National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) till his retirement on September 20 and send its appointee Justice M Venugopal on leave till then. When Attorney General K K Venugopal said the Centre has decided to allow Justice Cheema as officiating chairperson "only on paper", and not as acting chairperson, to enable him to pronounce judgments he had kept reserved, a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli said this was unacceptable. Venugopal said a new acting chairperson has been appointed on September 11 and it would be awkward to continue Justice Cheema. The AG attempted to assert the powers of the Centre to appoint a new chief of NCLAT under the new Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021, by arguing that as per the new law, Justice Cheema's tenure had expired long back. The CJI-led bench decided to hit back. "The way this order (appointing Justice Venugopal as acting chairperson) is passed is also awkward. You are responsible for the situation. Bureaucrats cannot get up at 7am and say the acting chairperson goes out today itself. How fair is it? If the government thinks of sticking to its stand, we will suo motu stay the operation of the Tribunal Reforms Act." The SC was fresh from Wednesday's stand-off with the Centre over non-appointment of chairperson and members to 15 key tribunals despite the search-cum-selection committees headed by sitting SC judges and has threatened the government with contempt of court proceedings if appointments were not made in two weeks. The SC has also warned the government against "cherry picking" chairpersons and members from among the merit list sent by the selection panels. On Thursday, the threat of suo motu stay of the new legislation, already under challenge before the court with the Centre being asked to respond to the PILs, made the AG seek time to take instructions. The bench gave just 30 minutes and the AG came back to inform the court that the government was agreeable to Justice Surya Kant's suggestion for a middle path. During the stand-off between the SC and Centre over hurried truncation of Justice Cheema's tenure, Justice Kant had suggested - "You (government) can allow Justice Cheema to be acting chairperson till September 20 and in any case, if Justice Venugopal has been appointed, let him go on leave for two days till Justice Cheema's retirement. It is only an ad hoc arrangement". It ended well as the SC complimented the AG for defusing the tricky situation and recorded that Justice Cheema will continue till September 20 to enable him pronounce the judgments pending with him and till then Justice Venugopal, appointed acting chairperson of NCLAT on September 11, would go on leave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-backs-off-on-nclat-justice-cheema-to-continue/articleshow/86279807.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Activist Zoru Bhathena has sent a written complaint to the BMC on Thursday, along with photographic proof of soil, rocks and debris being dumped on the beach and intertidal area to enable access for piling machine. Bhathena pointed out that such reclamation for access is impermissible in CRZ-1 area, and even the access platform needs to be constructed on stilts. The BMC, however, said that the dumping was only temporary and that the portion on which the dumping was done had no sand even before. “BMC’s plan for a platform-cum-viewing gallery is proposed over a drain pipe and on stilts. But work is being carried out on the sandy beach and in the intertidal area. The civic body should have constructed an access platform on stilts. I have attached pictures in my complaint on how this is already being done for other projects,” he said, adding that CRZ-1 is the area between high tide and low tide, and some parts may have sand while some others may not but it still remains under CRZ-1. BMC assistant municipal commissioner of D ward Prashant Gaikwad, however, said that the portion of the beach with sand was intact and the filling was only on a two-metre stretch beyond the drain on both sides where there was no sand even before. “This is only temporary, and the area will be cleared after piling work. We are not reclaiming the beach,” said Gaikwad, adding that the viewing deck should be ready by January next year. The viewing deck is proposed along with a seating area. An amphitheatre will also be set up to give locals as well as tourists an interrupted view of the Marine Drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-activist-raises-a-red-flag-as-proposed-viewing-deck-at-girgaum-chowpatty-flouts-crz-norm/articleshow/86276093.cms||Richa Pinto

Instead of one, there will now be two towers built on public private partnership (PPP) basis. According to a release by the agency, the two towers will be connected to Sitabuldi Interchange Metro station with a foot over bridge. “The total allowable construction on each land parcel will be maximum about 5 lakh square feet. The two towers will be multistorey with ample parking space,” the release stated. According to officials, the redesigning was done to get better response from the bidders. “The local bidders were finding it difficult to construct one huge tower. So, we decided to go for two towers,” they said. The permitted height by Airport Authority of India is about 289 feet. “It is up to the bidders how many floors they want to build,” said officials. Officials added that the project is expected not only to change the skyline of Nagpur but create a lot of parking space in the congested Sitabuldi area. “The concessionaires can build offices, restaurants, banquet halls, hotels etc in the building. They are free to decide the commercial use of the towers,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mahametro-plans-2-towers-will-connect-buldi-interchange/articleshow/86274730.cms||Manka Behl

Police found a charred body from the office cabin of the unit. “We will confirm the man’s identity once we get a DNA test report,” inspector Sadashiv Shelar of the Haveli police told TOI. PMRDA’s chief fire officer, Devendra Potphode, told TOI, “We learnt from the people, who managed to move out of the unit, that their employer, Dattanand Digambar Bendre (36), was in the cabin and could not come out in time. All others managed to come out.” Potphode said the fire broke out during the weighing of sparkling powder used in the making of birthday candles. He said sparks from a bulb, which was on over the weighing unit, fell on the adjacent corrugated cardboard boxes that were also covered by a layer of the powder. Inspector Shelar said 16 women and two men, including Bendre, were inside the unit and operating on the first floor of a ground-plus-one building hired on lease more than five years ago. He said, “Some of these women were moved to safety and four others jumped from the first floor. One woman sustained a fracture to leg and the other three women suffered minor injuries.”  The police said the local residents heard a blast and shattered pieces of the window glass were seen strewn all over the place and on the road in front of the building. Potphode and fire station officer Sujit Patil reached the spot with eight fire tenders following an emergency call at 10.24 am. The fire brigade officials brought the flames under control after about one-and-a-half hours. “The fire spread in few seconds. Some women came to the balcony and got stuck. The iron staircase is on the other side of the balcony. Four of them jumped from the balcony” Potphode said. Sayara Khan, a worker, told TOI, “I was working on my desk near the entrance. Around 10.30am, I heard the women screaming. Some of them ran towards the balcony. I came out through the entrance gate. By the time I could descend the stairs, a blast occurred.” The police have registered an accidental death case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fire-at-candle-making-unit-claims-one-4-women-hurt/articleshow/86274713.cms||Gitesh Shelke

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra allows ‘overdraft’ facility to pay kin of those killed by wild animals||NAGPUR: In a major relief to forest department, which is grappling with worst ever human-animal conflict, the state government has restored the negative budgeting system. This allows payment of compensation for human and cattle kills, and crop depredation even when there is no money in the account. The state government pays Rs15 lakh compensation to kin of victims who die in wild animal attacks. If there are limited funds, or if funds have lapsed, there was a provision to pay money to the kin, but finance department had withdrawn this facility last March owing to Covid-19 triggering a funds crunch. The scheme had been introduced in 2010-11 in budget distribution system (BDS), which allowed overdraft to make payment for cattle kill, crop damage and human kill by wild animals. “The negative budgeting restarted from September 3. It is big support from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. In the face of delayed compensation to kin of the victims, forest officials are always at the receiving end. Besides, it also leads to revenge killing of wild animals at times and community outrage,” said Sunil Limaye, PCCF (wildlife), Maharashtra. As per the All India Tiger Estimation (AITE)-2018, there are 312 tigers and 1,690 leopards in Maharashtra, a jump from 190 tigers and 905 leopards from 2014. This has led to increase in human-animal conflict with 88 persons being killed in wild animal attacks in 2020, and 57 in the last 8.5 months. This year, 3,185 cattle kill and 7,794 crop depredation cases were reported. Limaye said, “We pursued a lot with the government to restore negative budgeting. In July, I personally met finance minister Ajit Pawar in Pune on the issue. He was convinced and agreed in principle to do the needful. Finally, the decision has been taken.” Pradeep Kumar, PCCF (budget, planning & development), said, “Now local officers will be able to pay compensation even if money is not there in the forest department account.” With increasing man-animal conflict, in 2019-20, the budget outlay for human and cattle kills and crop damage compensation was Rs40 crore. In 2020-21, Rs78 crore has been spent on this head. “In 2021-22, considering the spurt in conflict, a provision of Rs80 crore was made. Out of this, we demanded Rs29 crore and received Rs20 crore, which has been distributed through the budget distribution system (BDS),” said Pradeep Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-allows-overdraft-facility-to-pay-kin-of-those-killed-by-wild-animals/articleshow/86272648.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Goa||Goa govt defying empowered committee’s recommendations for Tamnar project: GFP||Panaji: The BJP government’s move to notify the alignment for a double-circuit line from Mollem to Collem which links the controversial Tamnar project to the intra-state grid, defies the recommendations of the Supreme Court’s Central Empowered Committee (CEC), said Goa Forward Party (GFP) on Thursday. GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that the CEC had directed the electricity department to redraw the alignment in the corridor of the existing 220KV line instead of clearing pristine forest cover. Sardesai said that as per the electricity department’s notification around 35 ‘tentative’ survey numbers in Mollem and Collem have been identified. “This arrogant BJP government has not respected even the recommendations of the Supreme Court. With this it is evident that this government wants the complete destruction of Mollem and Collem,” Sardesai said. On April 23 CEC released a report red-flagging the three infrastructure projects that threaten the biodiversity of Mollem National Park and Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary. Sardesai said that chief minister Pramod Sawant is also going against the sentiments of the people and hence he will have to face their wrath in the 2022 assembly elections. “To save our natural resources and the wealth of Mollem and Collem, numerous citizens along with hundreds of students protested against the linear project. However Pramod Sawant is executing the agenda of his political bosses from Delhi by destroying Goa,” said Sardesai. Sardesai further said that the government has failed to review the three projects and consider the objections raised by the people. “The Pramod Sawant-led government is anti-Goan and hence it is trying to irreparably damage the state,” the former deputy chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-govt-defying-empowered-committees-recommendations-for-tamnar-project-gfp/articleshow/86274891.cms||---

---||Mumbai||With 100+ shots per session, Maharashtra has zero vaccine wastage||Skilful and efficient administration of doses have helped Maharashtra achieve ‘negative vaccine wastage’, inoculating an average of 103 beneficiaries per session as against 92-96 last month. In September so far, an average of 7 lakh vaccine shots have been administered every day. ‘Negative vaccine wastage’ means zero wastage of doses by vaccinators. Manufacturers provide 11-12 doses in each vial as against the general perception of just 10. In case of negative wastage, vaccinators extract and administer extra doses from vials to cover more beneficiaries. Vaccination data showed that at least 16 districts (see box) have vaccinated an average of more than 100 beneficiaries per session so far pushing up the state’s average. Mumbai’s average has increased from 158 beneficiaries vaccinated per session to 172 now. Pune’s average was about 106 around August 23, which increased to 112 by September 13. Health department officials said vaccinating less than 100 beneficiaries on an average per session could lead to vaccine wastage and sub-optimal use of resources. Maharashtra’s net wastage for Covishield so far has been -1.77% and for Covaxin, 0.51%. The vaccination data was arrived at by dividing the number of beneficiaries vaccinated so far by the total number of sessions conducted till September 13. The numbers are, therefore, an indicator of how state has performed per vaccination session. Dr Rajshree Patil, medical officer at Pune’s Kamala Nehru Hospital, said: “Vaccinators are drawing more than 10 doses from each 10-dose vial, which depends on their skill and practice. Competent vial use during each vaccination session has helped push the number of beneficiaries to an average of 120 per session. Even if 10 vials are used per session, we end up vaccinating 110-120 beneficiaries as more than 10 doses are being drawn out per vial.” Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI: “The health department has been regularly telling low-performing districts to increase the number of beneficiaries vaccinated per session. The ministry had earlier also advised that each vaccination session should cater to at least 100 beneficiaries.” He said as per the original plan, districts were told to vaccinate a minimum of 100 beneficiaries per session. “However, several districts are now surpassing that number increasingly.” Deshmukh added that an increase in vaccine supplies over the last one month also helped boost the number of beneficiaries inoculated per session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/with-100-shots-per-session-maharashtra-has-zero-vax-wastage/articleshow/86274805.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Vijayawada||TTD agarbattis: Andhra Pradesh high court refuses to interfere in the matter||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Thursday said it is not inclined to pass any orders in a public interest litigation challenging the decision of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams to make incense sticks out of flowers, leaves and other offerings made to Lord Venkateswara and in other temples managed by it.  The HC bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya observed that the petitioner did not give any representation for redressal of his grievance and suggested him to first approach the authorities concerned for a remedy and move the appropriate forum if his grievance is not resolved. One Meduri Sai Kumar had moved the PIL, alleging that the TTD’s decision is against the procedures prescribed in the Agama Shastra. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao said according to Agama Shastra, which prescribes the procedures to be followed for worship in Vykanasa temples, offerings made to Lord Venkateswara should not be reused. It’s considered a sin to reuse the offerings made to Lord Venkateswara and certain procedures need to be followed if the ritual is somehow broken, he said, adding that the Agama Shastra also mentions the procedure to be followed to dispose the offerings made to Lord Venkateswara, especially the flowers. “They have to be disposed in a well called ‘Pulabavi’ and this ritual cannot be discontinued to make commercial use of the flowers offered to the Lord. It is a religious practice being followed since centuries and involves the sentiments of crores of devotees,” Rao argued. Senior counsel SS Prasad, representing the temple body, said the petitioner seems to be under the wrong presumption that flowers offered to the main deity are being used for this purpose. The prescribed procedure is being followed and will not be affected. Only flowers from all other temples managed by the TTD would be collected to make the agarbattis, he said, adding that the petitioner should have first approached the TTD authorities for clarification instead of moving the high court. Considering the arguments from both sides, the court said it is not inclined to interfere in the matter at this stage and closed hearing on the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ttd-agarbattis-hc-refuses-to-interfere-in-the-matter/articleshow/86274776.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s standing committee on Thursday decided to drop the proposed guideline which mandated people to furnish proof of parking space availability before buying vehicles. The committee also resolved to officiate and allot full powers to the AMC commissioner for implementation of the new parking policy. Confirming the news, Hitesh Barot, chairman of AMC’s standing committee, said, “We have decided to remove one guideline from the proposed parking policy that required citizens to give proof of parking space before they buy a new vehicle.” Barot said that a committee will be formed to finalise the new parking policy and suggest the process of implementation. Formulated last year, the proposed policy lays out multiple guidelines to smooth out the city’s parking issues including construction of more multi-level parking facilities. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had ordered the Gujarat government to frame a parking policy in two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/car-buyers-wont-need-to-show-parking-space/articleshow/86272668.cms||---
---||Madurai||Public servants are liable to work wherever posted: HC||Madurai: A public servant is liable to work wherever he is posted in the interest of public administration as transfers are incidental to the service conditions, the Madras high court has observed.Justice D Krishnakumar observed that it is pertinent to note that transfers are imminent in respect of public servants. In certain circumstances, there may not be any evidence to prosecute the employee or to initiate departmental disciplinary proceedings. However, the competent authorities may be of the opinion that further continuance of a public servant in a particular place would cause inconvenience as well as cause some difficulties for the peaceful functioning of the public administration.The judge observed that administrative transfers are the prerogative of the concerned department and its competent authorities are the best persons to assess and act accordingly. Only if an order of transfer is issued with malafide intention or in violation of the statutory provisions, a writ petition can be entertained. In the absence of any such legal grounds, routine administrative transfers can never be interfered with by the constitutional courts.The court made the observations while hearing a batch of petitions filed before the HC Madurai bench in 2019, by two Railway Protection Force (RPF) constables challenging their transfer orders and consequential relieving orders. They were transferred from Golden Rock Workshop at Trichy district to Mayiladuthurai railway station in 2019.The standing counsel for the authorities submitted that transfer orders were issued to the petitioners on administrative grounds. He further submitted that departmental proceedings were initiated against the petitioners and they were imposed with penalty of reduction of pay by one stage in the same pay level for a period of one year.Justice Krishnakumar observed that the orders under challenge were passed in the year 2019 and the petitions came to be filed in the same year. The petitioners were not able to obtain any interim orders in their favour so far. Therefore, at this distance of time, the question of granting direction as sought for by the petitioners does not arise.Hence, the judge dismissed the petition by observing that the transfer orders and the consequential relieving orders do not warrant any interference as this court does not find any malafide exercise or violation of any statutory provision on the part of the authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/public-servants-are-liable-to-work-wherever-posted-hc/articleshow/86274802.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Proffesor Dr Vijaya Sangawar from department of physics at the Government Vidarbha Institute of Science and Humanities, professor Dr Shital Bhad from the Smt Narsamma Arts, Commerce and Science College, and professor Roshani Bhagat from Rajarshi Shahu Science College, Chandur Railway, have been granted a patent for research titled ‘Rhodaming dye doped PVA/KSCN reversible, sustainable polymer electrolyte & process of synthesis thereof’. This is the third patent in the name of Sangawar. Research on rechargeable batteries is underway throughout the world but required success in this field is not achieved. Dr Vijaya Sangawar decided to invest her time in this field. Research students Bhad and Bhagat started the research in 2009 under the guidance of Sangawar. After success in this research, they applied for a patent in 2019. After complying with the remarks raised by the patent office, the patent was granted on dated August 24. In this research, rhodamine dye and potassium thiosynet were mixed in proper percentage with polivinil alcohol polymer and a gel was prepared by a very simple process at low cost. The conductivity of this gel was checked and studied scientifically over nine years. Even after 9 years, the conductivity of the gel was checked and verified. The research observed that there wasn’t any change in the conductivity of this gel. It remained constant. Hence the research proved that the capacity of this gel is nine years and it is reversible to its original condition by a very simple process. Hence, this gel could be used effectively in rechargable batteries, as it improves the quality and life span of the battery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amravati-professors-patent-long-lasting-rechargeable-battery-gel/articleshow/86270166.cms||---

The court took cognisance of the chargesheet, report Vijay V Singh and Rebecca Samervel. Waze had collected the money from bar owners in the city illegally on Deshmukh's instructions. In the chargesheet, ED had named Waze along with Deshmukh's Nagpur-based trust, which runs educational institutions, and his family-controlled company that owned land worth several hundred crores in Navi Mumbai, as accused. The ED also chargesheeted Deshmukh's private secretory (additional collector rank government officer) Sanjeev Palande and PA Shinde in the case. Deshmukh has been avoiding ED summons for months, and a lookout circular has been issued preventing him from leaving the country. In his statement recorded during Deshmukh's house search in June, he told ED he had resigned on "moral grounds" after Bombay high court directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary enquiry. The chargesheet also stated that first Deshmukh demanded Rs 2 crore from Waze for helping him remain in service, as many senior politicians in the MVA government were not happy with his reinstatement in the police force after 15 years of suspension and were insisting on his removal. Later, Deshmukh asked Waze to collect Rs 100 crore 'hafta' from bar owners every month for him. Deshmukh repeated the demand after calling DCP Raju Bhujbal and ACP Sanjay Patil at his official residence.

---||Vijayawada||Tax payers’ body moves Andhra Pradesh high court against property tax system||VIJAYAWADA: The tax payers’ association of AP has moved the high court challenging the new capital value system of property tax enforced by the government. The association has alleged that the new system is against the spirit of Constitution. “Only the state finance commission has the authority to reform property tax collection. But in this case, a committee formed by municipal authorities took the decision, which has imposed huge tax burden on the public,” association secretary MV Anjaneyulu said. Sunkara Rajendra Prasad, the counsel for the tax paying body, said capital value is released only when someone sells his or her property. “Collecting property tax as per capital value is unethical and against the law. The civic body should have heard out the objections raised on the proposed tax reforms and addressed them. But the objections were ignored and the reforms were approved in a special council meeting. We will raise all the objections in the court of law,” Prasad said. The writ petition, filed on September 14, is yet to come up for hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tax-payers-body-moves-hc-against-property-tax-system/articleshow/86274827.cms||---

While they were convinced that some of his customers included the armymen from the Narhad townsituated army camp, they lured him to send information in lieu of some money,” said a senior officer of intelligence wing on condition of anonymity. Umesh Mishra, Director General, intelligence stated that the Pakistani handling officers got in touch with the accused some months ago through a social networking platform and asked for sensitive and secret information related to the army camp at Narhad. “It was also found that the accused had also sent his bank details to the handlers and has received some money for sending the information,” said a senior officer. After keeping a watch on activities of Sandeep, the intelligence wing first detained him on September 12 and later brought him to Jaipur for interrogation. “Following incriminating evidences against him, the accused was arrested on Thursday,” the officer added. “He would be produced in the court on Friday and we will take him in a remand of at least a week to question him further,” the officer said.

---||Pune||Health minister Rajesh Tope rules out extra curbs in Maharashtra after Ganeshotsav||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday told TOI that the government was not planning to increase any curbs after the Ganeshotsav because the weekly positivity rate in the state for the seven-day period ending on September 15 was 2.63% — slightly less than the preceding week’s 2.67%. “As of now, the daily cases are in the range of 4,000-4,500 in Maharashtra. We had a long discussion with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray after the cabinet meeting. As of now, we are not planning to introduce any new restrictions, but there will be a close watch on any sudden rise in cases, especially in the districts of concern,” he said. Tope said there could be a slight rise in cases next week, after the festivities. The state public health department had issued guidelines to increase testing and vaccination in its anticipation, he said. “We have instructed the districts not carrying out enough testing to ramp it up and ensure adequate testing infrastructure is in place for it. A detailed note has been issued by the department to all the collectors and the commissioners. They have to follow it. Along with testing, the scale of vaccination, too, would be ramped up,” he said. The health minister said there should be no lowering of guard during the festivities. Along with the existing restrictions, he stressed on keeping close tabs on any rise in cases in any particular area. “Strict surveillance should continue,” Tope said. Following the Centre’s advisory to the state to take extra caution during the Ganesh festivities, the Maharashtra government had issued strict directives to ensure that there was no crowding during the entire festival period. State surveillance expert Dr Pradip Awate said they were keeping a close watch on if there was any sudden rise in cases in any districts. He said the genomic sequencing samples were being sent as had been the protocol. There has been no further addition to the 103 Delta Plus cases registered in the state in the last week of August. On the testing front, Awate said the districts registering low testing had been pulled up. The collectors had been directed to take action against the laboratories not updating both positive and negative Covid test reports within 24 hours on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s portal, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-rules-out-extra-curbs-in-maha-after-ganeshotsav/articleshow/86274861.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Madurai||‘Helicopter brothers’ made Rs 500cr foreign investment: Tamil Nadu govt to HC||MADURAI: The state on Thursday informed the Madras high court that nearly Rs 500 crore in foreign investment was made by Kumbakonam ‘helicopter brothers’ M R Ganesh and M R Swaminathan who were involved in a financial fraud by cheating crores of rupees from the people. The court was hearing the bail petitions filed by S Venkatesan, a priest and Akilandam alias Akila, wife of Ganesh, accomplices of the main accused, and arrested in connection with this case. Justice B Pugalendhi granted bail to Venkatesan by taking into account the fact that he had only canvassed the investors to invest money in the company run by the brothers. However, the judge denied bail to Akilandam, after it was informed that she was one of the directors in the company. During the previous hearing, the state informed the court that the case would be probed by the economic offences wing. It may be recalled that the ‘helicopter brothers’ who were running a finance company had approached affluent people promising to double the returns on their investment. After taking crores of rupees from various people, the duo absconded. The issue came to light when a couple from Kumbakonam lodged a complaint at the Thanjavur district crime branch police. Subsequently, police arrested Ganesh and Swaminathan. Ganesh, who was district president of BJP traders’ wing was relieved of the post following the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/helicopter-brothers-made-rs-500cr-foreign-investment-tn-to-hc/articleshow/86274846.cms||---
---||Pune||Police file one more cheating case against Gautam Pashankar||Pune: A fresh case of cheating, involving complaints by a 61-year-old businessman from Malegaon in Nashik and a Pune Camp resident, has been registered against two-wheeler dealer and realtor Gautam Pashankar and one of his aides, for failure to deliver flats booked in a housing project at Kharadi in 2015. Inspector Sunil Thopte from the Chandannagar police said, “The Malegaon resident in his complaint said he had paid Rs1.56 crore on December 12, 2015 to Pashankar for a flat in the project at Kharadi. He said Pashankar had assured him to hand over the flat’s possession within two years.” He added, “The complainant approached Pashankar on several occasions in the last two years demanding possession of the flat, but the site is still under construction. The victim then asked for a refund and Pashankar promised to pay. But he did not give any refund to the complainant,” said Thopte. “We merged another similar complaint by a Pune Camp resident with this case, as it also pertains to a flat in the same housing project. The Camp resident had paid Rs82 lakh to Pashankar for a flat in the same scheme. However, Pashankar did not hand over possession of the flat, but took a loan of Rs2 crore by mortgaging the same flat to a credit cooperative society. The victim learnt about this loan transaction a year ago and collected all documentary evidence from the bank and other sources before approached police,” Thopte said. The police have registered the case under sections 406 (Criminal Breach of Trust), 420 (Cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. TOI on Thursday made several calls to Pashankar’s son, Kapil, who is now handling the family business, but he did not answer the calls nor did he respond to the text message raising queries about the fresh case. On September 11, the Shivajinagar police had registered a case against Pashankar, his daughter, Rinul, and an estate broker after a business development and management consultant Narendra Patil (42) lodged a complaint accusing them of cheating him of Rs2.40 cr over a deal for two flats in the same housing project at Kharadi. Patil had also accused Pashankar of assaulting him in the latter’s office when he demanded a refund after realising that the realtor had sold the two flats to third parties. He claimed to have then suffered a fracture to his right leg in the assault, which, he said, took place on June 8, 2020. Kapil Pashankar has denied all these charges and said Patil was not speaking the truth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-file-one-more-cheating-case-against-gautam-pashankar/articleshow/86274832.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Leftover doses given as booster jab to health staff and politicians||MUMBAI: A booster shot though offered in several western nations, remains a hotly debated subject and is yet to be approved in India. However, healthcare workers have taken the third shot at various hospitals in Mumbai, multiple sources confirmed to TOI. Covishield has been the choice for the booster dose, said a hospital source, adding that in some cases an eleventh dose has been drawn from the vaccine vial for the purpose. Another hospital head said in other cases, the third dose is drawn from a vial which may have a few doses left but doesn’t have takers at the end of the day’s immunisation drive. “Healthcare workers have seen breakthrough infections among colleagues and are worried about emerging variants,” he said. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), however, called it misguided enthusiasm, saying a third dose could lead to massive life-threatening reactions in some cases. “Let us be scientific and not be driven by emotions,” he said. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “There is a possibility that the extra dose in each vial is being used for this. If one is using that extra dose, there is no need for any registration. But my question to those who are taking it is how do they know it’s useful at all,” he said. Globally, several nations have rolled out a third dose, primarily for the elderly, and a few for healthworkers. NHS staffers in the UK started getting booster shots on Thursday. The US is likely to roll out third shots from September 20, while Israel has published findings that at least 12 days after the booster dose, rate of confirmed infection was lower in the booster group by a factor of 11.3 and rate of severe illness lower 19.5 times. However, two leading US vaccine scientists have written in Lancet that there is no credible evidence that efficacy of vaccines against severe Covid reduced substantially over time. WHO too has asked wealthy nations to hold on to booster shots as it could worsen global vaccine inequity. Indian Council of Medical research head Dr Balram Bhargava said on Thursday that getting a full vaccination with two doses remains the priority. “Antibody levels alone shouldn’t be measured. One can have cellular immunity, antibody immunity, mucosal immunity and that persists.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-leftover-doses-given-as-booster-jab-to-health-staff-and-politicians/articleshow/86274909.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya passed the interim orders and directed the government to file an affidavit after hearing a PIL filed by one Para Kishore from Guntur. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate Karumanchi Indraneel Babu said the appointment was in contravention of prescribed rules, which state that a retired high court judge should be appointed as chairman of state-level police complaints authority for a period of three years or till he or she attains the age of 65. But contrary to the rules, the state government appointed Justice Kanagaraj, who is about 77 years, Babu pointed out. Stating that the Supreme Court has issued guidelines with regards to appointment of police complaints authorities at the state and district levels, Babu said the government should have picked a person from a panel of names recommended by the Chief Justice of the high court. Besides violating the apex court’s guidelines, the government has also violated its own rules by giving age relaxation to Justice Kanagaraj, he argued. Considering the arguments of the petitioner, the court asked for the response of the state government, represented by Kasa Jagan Mohan Reddy, who sought time to get appropriate instructions from the authorities concerned. Agreeing to the request of the government pleader, the bench passed an interim order suspending the GO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-suspends-kanagarajs-appointment-as-chairman-of-police-complaints-body/articleshow/86274888.cms||Srikanth Aluri

But on Thursday, the fanfare was visibly subdued amid heavy cop bandobast. While a huge crowd had gathered outside the pandal, barely 50 persons were allowed to accompany the procession while a sea of khakhi stood on guard ensuring that the roads don’t get overcrowded, especially in the walled city areas. City police commissioner Shamsher Singh deployed hundreds of policemen along with the companies of state reserve police (SRP) and Rapid Action Force (RAF) on the immersion route. Twenty-two ACPs, 80 inspectors and hundreds of junior cops were out on the roads to ensure that people follow Covid guidelines and complete the immersion quickly. By evening, hundreds of processions headed towards the artificial pond in Navlakhi ground amid the DJ music. The cops had also deployed drones in the walled city to monitor the interior areas. The processions continued till late in the night but no untoward incident was reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/subdued-immersion-processions-amid-tight-security/articleshow/86272263.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal on top of FICN arrest list||KOLKATA: In 2020, Bengal topped the list in terms of the arrest of counterfeiters, who tried to take advantage of the Covid situation and spread fake Indian currency, according to NCRB data. Fake currency with a face value of over Rs 2.5 crore was seized in the state last year. The state is behind Maharashtra and UP on the seizure amount list. Maharashtra has recovered FICN with face value of Rs 83.6 crore, followed by UP with Rs 3.9 crore. Though the state lodged barely 81 FIRs — far less compared to Maharashtra (83) and UP (55) — there were 111 arrests . The state STF and the Kolkata Police STF have played crucial roles in nabbing the culprits from various parts of India. Maharashtra has managed to arrest 97 alleged counterfeiters. Bengal was the only state in India where old fake Rs 500 notes were seized. The law agencies ended up seizing 2,742 such notes. The cops also seized 13,129 new Rs 500 fake notes and another 8345 fake notes of Rs 200 denomination. Kolkata Police sources said the seizures across Bengal were on expected lines after the spurt in counterfeiting activities in 2019 once the effect of demonetization was over. “We had actually seen a drop in circulation of fake currency in 2020 in Kolkata after we crossed the Rs 1 crore FICN mark in 2019. These are early signs that the counterfeiters might have regrouped amidst the pandemic. For the past three years, there has been a striking feature as far as FICN is concerned. “Amongst the 50 odd men arrested since 2019 by Kolkata STF, 16 were from outside Bengal. These include not only men from states like Bihar and Jharkhand, but also from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-on-top-of-ficn-arrest-list/articleshow/86272773.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Sources said she was taken to the nursing home after complaining of unease. Doctors will run some diagnostic tests to determine if she has any ailment. Earlier in the day, Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee sent some representatives to the mental hospital to arrange for her return to the Khardah home. He also reportedly assured the septuagenarian, a retired school teacher, that her issue of monthly pension would be looked into as well. Basu, a former school teacher of a Khardah girls’ school, has been living on the pavement for several years. She was allegedly driven out of her own house at Salt Lake. Basu retired from the government school in 2009 and is entitled to a monthly pension, which she hasn’t yet claimed. The matter came to light after a bunch of her students felicitated Basu on a pavement under the Dunlop flyover on Teacher’s Day. According to locals, Basu never begged or accepted money but lived on pavements across the Baranagar and Dunlop area. She would make it a point to buy food from local eateries and never accepted alms. “I would never beg. I would stay at a rented place. If I can’t, I would return to the pavement. Mira Bhattacharya, my sister, already made a statement about me and I have a great respect for her and her husband. Abhishek Banerjee sent some people to look after me and assured to look into my pension issues,” Basu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ex-cm-in-law-taken-to-rented-house-later-shifted-to-hosp/articleshow/86272770.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

Scientists at the city-based Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) found it through complete genetic sequencing of the virus after isolating it from the blood sample of the Belsar woman (51), testing positive for the Zika virus during the routine outbreak investigation on July 30. Zika virus (ZIKV) is classified into two lineages — African and Asian/American. The American lineage — derived from the recent central American outbreaks — is diverged out of the Asian lineage. Understanding the genetic lineage of the Zika virus is of paramount importance because, unlike the Asian strain, African and American strains are associated with neurological defects in infants of Zika-infected pregnant women. “The complete genome sequencing of the Zika virus found in Pune has revealed that the sequence belongs to the Asian genotype,” said a senior ICMR official. In India, the previous outbreaks were largely of the Asian genetic lineage. The latest Zika outbreak in Kerala also has the virus matching the Asian strain. There are concerns that if the Zika virus gets transmitted from a pregnant woman to her foetus, it can result in microcephaly and other congenital malformations in the infant, collectively referred to as congenital Zika syndrome. The scientists have cautioned that the Asian strain may also cause microcephaly (smaller than normal head size), depending on the timing of Zika virus infection during pregnancy. The state surveillance officials have intensified the monitoring and testing of pregnant women. “Barring the Belsar woman, blood sample of nobody else has tested positive for Zika virus so far in Maharashtra,” said state surveillance officer Pradip Awate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/asian-strain-of-zika-virus-found-in-pune-icmr-niv/articleshow/86274931.cms||Umesh Isalkar

These findings are based on the second round of genomic sequencing carried out in the BMC’s new laboratory inaugurated on August 4. While 376 positive Covid samples from public and private hospitals were analysed in the second round, 188 samples were analysed in the first round. Of the 376 samples in the second round, 304 were found to have the Delta variant and none with Delta-plus. Analysis of the first round samples showed Delta had caused breakthrough infection in 50% of the 93 Mumbaikars diagnosed with the Delta variant; only four of the 27 fully vaccinated patients needed oxygen support (see box). “In both rounds, we didn’t find any Delta-plus variant. Delta is the predominant strain circulating in Mumbai and we need to remain vigilant about following all Covid-appropriate measures,” BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani told TOI on Thursday. He said in the first round of sequencing, 128 samples had the Delta strain; of these, 93 were Mumbai residents. “We traced nearly 1,200 contacts of these 93 people and found only 80 positive for Covid. It shows that the spread was not that high for whatever reason.” He said half of these 93 Delta patients didn’t need hospitalisation and “its transmissibility also seems lower now’’. Experts said the two rounds of genomic testing in Mumbai’s Kasturba Hospital had proved there is no local emerging variant of concern. “The maximum isolates are Delta. It has been causing breakthrough infections (despite vaccination), but, fortunately, these infections are mild,” said Dr Jayanthi Shastri, who heads the laboratory. The BMC felt the need for a genome testing laboratory after the delay in getting samples from Mumbai analysed in out-of-town centres. While inaugurating the laboratory, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had said that if the Delta variant had been traced earlier in Maharashtra, its spread could have been checked and the high morbidity and mortality could have been averted. Apart from genomic sequencing, the laboratory’s analysis is equally important for authorities to plan public health strategies. A senior doctor said as long as there are no new variants and the daily tally is around 500 (as against 11,000 during the second wave’s peak), the healthcare system is adequate enough to handle the situation. The samples of the second round were collected from both civic and private hospitals as compared to only public hospitals in the first round.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-delta-still-dominates-in-city-reveals-bmcs-genome-lab/articleshow/86274984.cms||---

---||Mumbai||No high-end cars for varsity bigwigs as Maharashtra govt caps price||MUMBAI: The state government has capped the price for purchasing automobiles for university authorities. A government resolution to that effect has been passed and the upper limit for a vehicle for a vice-chancellor (VC) has been set at Rs 12 lakh, which includes the cost of installing additional accessories and services. Similarly, the expenditure limit for a pro vice-chancellor’s car is Rs 10 lakh. The GR caused ripples in the academic circles with heads of universities making frantic calls to Mantralaya to find out whether the rules would be applicable retrospectively too. “We have issued a resolution to ensure that university heads do not splurge on cars. After all, this money is collected from students’ fees,” minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant told TOI. “VCs are on a par with state secretaries and after due diligence, my team has issued the expenditure limit that all university authorities need to adhere to.” VCs who have been enquiring regarding the application of the rules on purchases already made, may have to wait for clarity. “The matter on whether university heads should personally pay the difference between the cost incurred and what is permitted for a car is pending before the higher education secretary,” added Samant. The GR states that money in university corpus or general fund is public money which ought to be utilized judiciously. “Since the past few years, university authorities have been flouting the government rules and purchasing cars that are in excess of the cost set by the state,” read the GR. On December 13, 2019, TOI had carried an article titled, “Mumbai University’s top bosses’ splurge on SUVs” after the VC and pro VC purchased two topline vehicles for Rs 64 lakh using the university’s general fund. Interestingly, the minister who toured several state universities noticed that most VCs had purchased very high-end vehicles. “Our cabinet ministers travel in a car costing Rs 12 lakh. Our state’s chief secretary has a car costing Rs 15 lakh. But our VCs are traveling in cars ranging from Rs 45 lakh to Rs 60 lakh. We were worried that if a GR is not put in place, we will find VCs travelling in vehicles that will cost a crore,” said a source from the ministry. As per the GR, the upper limit for purchasing a car for the exam director, legal and financial officer is set at Rs 9 lakh and that for other varsity administrative officers, who have permission to use an official vehicle, at Rs 8 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-high-end-cars-for-varsity-bigwigs-as-state-caps-price/articleshow/86276984.cms||Hemali Chhapia

Of the total cases, 189 pertained to criminal breach of trust, 13 to counterfeiting and 1,615 related to cheating and fraud. Delhi has registered the maximum number of economic offences (4,445) in the country. No data is available for 2019 as NCRB claimed it had received it late. The first year of the pandemic — 2020 — has seen the city police probe a criminal breach of trust case that had left the complainant poorer by more than Rs 100 crore. The city cops also registered 18 other cases when the estimated loss ranged between Rs 10 crore and Rs 25 crore. In 450 cases — the highest among the 19 Indian cities that have a population above 20 lakh — the losses were calculated to be above Rs 50 lakh but less than Rs 1 crore. According to the data, the city had seen a total of 150 cases of criminal breach of trust where money or property loss were involved. Thirty seven of them involved loss of less than Rs 1 lakh, 65 saw cash or property loss of Rs 1 lakh-Rs 10 lakh. While 25 cases saw losses between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 50 lakh, 17 saw losses between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore. Five cases saw the victims lose between Rs 1 crore and Rs 5 crore. The one case above Rs 100 crore is pending with the detective department. The city police has disposed of 1,560 cases in 2020 while 2,899 cases are pending investigation. The charge sheet rate — 93.7 — is one of the highest in the country. The pendency rate of 65 is on the higher side but better than other Metros like Delhi (80), Chennai (98.5) and Mumbai (85.1). Police's specialized units together have specialized in investigating these economic offences cases. “The specialization has come through experience and updating oneself with the latest technology. However, 2020 had presented its unique challenges and we had to adapt quickly. In the coming year, our aim is to bring down the pendency rate even further,” said a detective department official. Earlier this year, Lalbazar had proposed the creation of a new anti-bank fraud police station. Kolkata Police has sought a state government nod to set it up in Lalbazar. If the proposal is accepted, Kolkata will become one of the first cities in India to have a specific police station handling bank frauds. Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma has confirmed that a proposal has been sent to the state home department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/economic-offences-dip-by-a-third-in-kol-in-two-years/articleshow/86272774.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The MP said that at present candidates recruited for the post of postal assistant, sorting assistant and inspectors in the department of posts are not undergoing any test for the regional language. “Regional language was there when the recruitment was conducted by the postal department,” he said.However, regional languages were done away with after the selection job was assigned to the staff selection commission. Personnel in the above said ranks have to interact with people on a day-to-day basis as part of their job and inspectors have to deal with the functioning of village post offices. He observed that people are facing a lot of hardships and confusion in communicating with them as they lack knowledge of the regional language.Venkatesan said that staff from other states are unable to discharge their duties effectively. He said that 57 of the 60 inspectors recruited by the department in Tamil Nadu over the last 10 years are from other states. Recalling the importance of the postal services in connecting with crores of people across the country, he said that a major share of their clientele is the rural populace who are from the economically lower strata. He appealed to the minister to include tests in the regional language in the recruitment procedure for those who have not studied regional language in the SSLC level to ensure proper services to the people as well as to discharge duties of the staff concerned effectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mp-include-regional-language-test-for-postal-dept-selection/articleshow/86274957.cms||---

If any drawbacks and financial irregularities were detected, action would be taken against the concerned people, whoebver they are without any prejudice. He also added that the DMK government is trying to make best use of what has been done and bring it to public use.Speaking to reporters after inspecting the parking lot that is being constructed near the Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple, the minister said that the inspection was in preparation for the smart city review meeting to be held on Thursday (September 17), after years of delay.“Madurai’s smart city programme was against the rules of democracy where the welfare of the people had been given the least preference to benefit some individuals, the minister in-charge of the scheme and two local ministers,” he said. “Schemes have been implemented with the aim of making money through corruption,” he added.The re-laying of the road round the Meenakshi temple with cobblestones was one such flawed scheme, and it was executed just to remove the river sand from beneath the road, he claimed. The parking lot of the Meenakshi temple needed reverse engineering to put it to best use as the shops in the underground section would not be of much use. Ways to prevent parking in other places or hiking the parking fee there so that people utilise this spot would have to be planned, he added. Rajan also said that no proper schemes were implemented under the visionary Tamil Nadu Infrastructure Fund Management Corporation in the last seven years and the Rs 70 crore just went waste.Asserting that people have voted this government to overcome these issues, he said that chief minister M K Stalin has said that a proper model should be evolved in the next two years, which will enable proper financial management and proper utilization of the funds to enhance the economic growth and development of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/govt-fixing-flaws-in-madurais-smart-city-schemes-says-ptr/articleshow/86274933.cms||---

Our social workers and psychologists will also make home visits if needed. However, the issue needs to be addressed at the root and all stakeholders, teachers, students and families must be sensitized through a comprehensive programme,” said Dr C Ramasubramanian, founder of the foundation. The senior consultant psychiatrist vouched for sensitization programmes at school and college levels. The 104 health helpline under GVK-EMRI has collected information on all those who wrote NEET. “We are dividing students district-wise and calling them up. The goal is to talk to students and filter them based on the response our counsellors get. We don’t want to alarm them. It is more of a check-in or feedback call. If we identify any student who may need immediate help, we share the number to the district mental health programme Officer who will contact the student,” said Dr Saravanan, 104 health helpline. The official further said that after NEET results are announced, a second phase of counselling will be done in a targeted manner.School teachers are staying in touch with those who had undergone free government coaching through WhatsApp. “We have told students that the coaching will help them do well in any government exam, not just NEET. Even now, we share messages and information about other courses and options available for them,” said S Vennila Devi, district co-ordinator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/counsellors-teachers-reach-out-to-neet-candidates/articleshow/86275002.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The big butterfly month for this year began on September 4, with the theme ‘Habitat for Butterflies’, and hence this programme was very timely.American College is part of this initiative in which 44 organisations are participating and it will conclude on September 30, he said. It includes various activities including big butterfly count, online workshops on butterflies, gardening workshops, butterfly origami workshops and videography and photography contests.Students of the college under the guidance of principal Dr R Rajeswara Palanichamy and faculty members Malar and Latha were able to identify 20 species of butterflies including common gull, common pierrot, tawny caster, common crow, blue tiger, plain tiger, striped tiger, common rose, crimson rose, tailed jay, common emigrant, common mormon and white orange tip.The students said being able to identify the butterflies, which are one of the main pollinators, helped them appreciate the insects more. “They are definitely the wonders of nature, and such walks were very educational,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/covid-19-effect-students-spot-20-species-of-butterflies-on-campus/articleshow/86274979.cms||---

We had a long discussion with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray after the cabinet meeting. We do not plan new restrictions, but there will be a close watch on any sudden rise in cases, especially in districts of concern,” he said in Pune. Tope said there could be a slight rise in cases next week, after festivities. The state public health department had issued guidelines to increase testing and vaccination in anticipation, he said. “We instructed districts not carrying out enough testing to ramp it up and ensure adequate testing infrastructure is in place. A detailed note has been issued by the department to collectors and commissioners. They have to follow it. Along with testing, vaccination will be ramped up,” he said. Tope said there should be no lowering of guard during festivities. Along with restrictions, he stressed on keeping close tabs on any rise in cases. “Strict surveillance should continue,” Tope said. Following a central advisory, the government issued directions to ensure against crowding during the festival.

---||Chandigarh||Rural household debt in Punjab increased by 52% between 2012 & 2018||Chandigarh: The average amount of debt among rural households in Punjab has increased from Rs 65,000 in 2012 to Rs 98,000 in 2018, a rise of 52%. What’s more, the debt amount in Punjab is way above the average national rural household debt recorded at Rs 59,748 in 2018, as per the SBI research report. The average national rural household debt in 2021 is estimated to increase to Rs 1.16 lakh and urban household debt to Rs 2.33 lakh, which indicates that Covid-19 has impacted households significantly. The research also found that the average urban household debt in Punjab escalated from Rs 49,000 in the year 2012 to Rs 94,000 in 2018, showing a surge of 93% in these six years. Whereas the average amount of debt for urban households across the country increased by 42% during this period. On the positive side, the share of non-institutional agencies in outstanding cash debt has declined in Punjab from 36% in 2012 to 28% in 2018, indicating formalisation of the economy, penetration of kisan credit cards(KCC) and better banking facilities. This share used to be at 64% in 1971. The research also found that three states in the country – Punjab, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh – witnessed decline of at least 100 basis points (bps) in debt-asset ratio over the six year period ending 2018. Debt-asset ratio is an indicator of household indebtedness calculated as the average amount of debt outstanding on a given date for a group of households expressed as a percentage of the average amount of assets owned by them on that given date. Solution for agriculture Affirming that the recent reforms in agriculture could further help in formalisation of the economy, the research report underlines there is still a fundamental reform pending which is in the realm of RBI — making agriculture cash credit at par with other segments. As per the norms of asset classification for agriculture advances, in case of an agriculture cash credit account a farmer has to repay the entire outstanding — principal along with interest — to seek fresh loans from the banks, unlike other segments of cash credit business, where if the borrower has cleared interest payments, he would be eligible for enhancement or renewal of loan. It has farmers’ woes aggravated. “It would be in the interest of the farmer, if he or she is given renewal or enhancement, especially when the bank is satisfied with the farmer in terms of his or her land holding or paying capacity,” reads the report. 44% dependent on agriculture The SBI research says that nearly 44% of people in India are dependent upon agriculture, which has just 16% share in growth and currently growing only in the range of 3-4%. “So, if nothing is done for agriculture, this sector will continue to grow in the range of 3-4% and the high number of dependents will lead to low per capita income,” says the report, emphasising on the urgent need to focus on agriculture. A combination of livelihoods and agribusiness or value chain approach can help leverage the farming sector for betterment of its stakeholders — farmers, workers and others around it, says the SBI. It also advocates that there is a need for institutional innovations besides product, process and organisational innovations in the sector to deal with existing and emerging challenges and problems of sustainability in the sector which can be converted into opportunities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rural-household-debt-in-punjab-increased-by-52-between-2012-2018/articleshow/86275025.cms||Sanjeev Verma

---||Mumbai||‘Won’t allow Maharashtra’s right to earn via tax to be impinged on’||MUMBAI: Amid speculation that the Centre will propose to bring petrol and diesel under the GST regime at the council meeting on Friday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said, “The Centre is free to levy its own taxes, but impinging on the state’s right to raise revenue through taxes will not be tolerated.” He said the issue of including petrol and diesel underGST was being discussed in hushed tones and the state would make its positionclear when this issue is officially raised. However, he said, “The system of GST taxation should continue the way it is. There are few sources of revenue generation for states, including stamp duty, VAT and GST. In the name of having one nation, one tax, the right of states to raise revenue through taxes should not be reduced,” he said. Sources said that the state government is set to oppose the move since it will impact its revenue significantly. When GST was introduced, five commodities including petrol, diesel, crude oil, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel were kept out of its ambit. This is because these commoditiesgenerated higher revenue on which both Centre and state depend heavily. Pawarsaid he was also opposed to having a physical meeting of the GST council in Lucknow amid the pandemic. “We have asked for the meeting to be held through video-conferencing,” he said. He pointed out that the Centre owed the state between Rs 30,000 crore and xRs 32,000 crore in GST compensation dues. BJP’s Ashish Shelar criticised Pawar’s comments. “This shows the government’s double standards. Why was it agitating against petrol and diesel prices? It wants revenue through petrol and diesel,” Shelar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wont-allow-states-right-to-earn-via-tax-to-be-impinged-on/articleshow/86277060.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

According to police sources, garbage dumps and drainage channels in the area were thoroughly searched by corporation sanitation workers since the baby’s head was covered with mud and sewage. Police have been checking the records of births for 10 days before September 8 at the nearby primary health centres and Government Rajaji Hospital.“We verified that there is no record of such a baby at the hospitals. It is likely that the baby was not born at a hospital and perhaps the parents had secretly disposed of the baby after birth,” said a police source. Police also checked CCTV camera footage in the area but didn’t find any suspicious activity.A police team is investigating different areas and checking for any information among local people. The baby’s head is being preserved at GRH. The baby’s gender and cause of death is still unknown. However, sources said that a DNA test can be done for identification but it was only possible if they can identify the parents of the baby.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/baby-with-severed-head-yet-to-be-identified/articleshow/86275027.cms||---

While hearing a petition highlighting denial of reservation in promotion to the SC employees in courts across Punjab, commission chairman Vijay Sampla asked the Punjab government to submit the progress report to the commission within two weeks. During the hearing those present included Punjab special secretary (home affairs and justice)Baldeep Kaur, registrar general of Punjab and Haryana high court Sanjeev Berry and joint secretary of the Union ministry of law and justice Anju Rathi Rana. The commission also expressed its displeasure over the fact that no concrete action has been taken on the commission’s recommendations in its previous hearings even after the lapse of considerable time. The petitioner who had approached the commission had submitted that the state government had passed a law - Punjab Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act, 2006 - and as per the Act group A & B employees would get 14 % reservation, group C and D will get 20 % reservation in promotions, but had never implemented in the case of judicial services and for other court employees. Sampla said, “The Supreme Court in State of Bihar and another Vs Bal Mukund Saha and others (2000), held that any office or establishment of the judiciary of the state of Bihar concerned with appointments to public services and posts in connection with affairs of the judiciary of the state of Bihar would fall within the sweep of the term ‘establishment’.  On similar lines, engagement of judicial officers and other court employees in various courts of Punjab must be in the ‘establishment’ category of the state government.” The commission has now recommended that the home department in Punjab would immediately move the file for implementation, in accordance with the reservation rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/consider-quota-to-promote-judicial-officers-ncsc-to-punjab/articleshow/86275474.cms||---

The Good Samaritan will also be honoured by the state government with a ‘letter of appreciation’. The move is aimed at encouraging people to help road accident victims get early treatment. Health minister Raghu Sharma on Thursday said the finance department has finalised the entire process of rewarding the Good Samaritan under the scheme.Sharma said the implementing agency of the JRY, which was a budget announcement, will be the health department. The entire budget for the scheme will be provided from the Road Safety Fund. For the purpose, a fund of Rs 5 crore will be transferred to the health director. The person who rushes a road accident victim will have to voluntarily provide his details such as his name, age, address, mobile number, identity proof and bank account number to the medical officer of the emergency room of the hospital where the injured road accident victim gets admitted. Under the scheme, the hospital will not compel the Good Samaritan to stay in the hospital and will be allowed to leave the hospital on his will. In case, if more than one person rushes a victim to a hospital, the reward money will be distributed among all the Good Samaritans. The reward money will be given only for transporting critically injured victims. The condition of a accident victim will be decided by the chief medical officer. If the victim has minor injuries, the Good Samaritan will get only a letter of appreciation. The reward will be provided to the Good Samaritan within two days of getting the patient admitted to a hospital. The hospital administration will recommend for issuing reward money to the director of the health department through e-mail within three days. The director will credit the reward money in the Good Samaritan’s account in two days of receiving the e-mail. The letter of appreciation will be sent by speed post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rush-injured-mishap-victims-to-hospital-get-reward-of-rs-5000/articleshow/86277061.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Dacoity suspect nabbed after 41 years from Solapur village||PUNE: Ankush Manik Gaikwad, suspected to be part of a gang that had committed a dacoity at a house in Daund taluka in December 1980, managed to evade police for the past 41 years. But luck finally ran out on him on Wednesday when a team from the Pune rural police swooped down on him at his native village Khadki in Karmala taluka of Solapur district, catching him unawares. The dacoity incident was his only brush against the law and the passage of time had eroded his memory about the case, said police officials. “Gaikwad was visibly shocked when our team zeroed in on him and mentioned the 1980 dacoity,” Pune rural police’s local crime branch inspector Ashok Shelke told TOI. “His first words were that even he had forgotten about the incident,” said Shelke. “The fact that his name did not figure in any criminal cases in Pune and Solapur districts before or after the 1980 dacoity perhaps made the task of tracing him all the more difficult for the police,” the officer added. Gaikwad was a sprightly 18-year-old lad when the police suspected him to be a part of a nine-member gang that committed a dacoity at a house in Yavat under Daund taluka, off the Pune-Solapur highway, around 45km from here. The Pune rural police had then managed to arrest six of his associates, but Gaikwad and two others managed to evade the police all these years. “Gaikwad (now 59) confessed to his involvement in the dacoity but maintained that he had not been involved in any other crime since then,” said Shelar. The LCB officials are now busy rummaging through old case files and documents to establish Gaikwad’s role in the dacoity and ascertain as to what happened after the six previously arrested men were charged in the case. A search is on for his two other aides who are still on the run, said an LCB official. Pune rural superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh told TOI, “Many criminals change their identities and looks and locations. However, in this case, the accused did not do anything of that sort. He did not commit any crime after the 1980 incident and, hence, may have gone off the police radar. Often the investigating officers change on account of transfers and new postings, and those who replace them sometimes do not take interest in old cases.” “We have now prepared a list of 800 criminals against whom the courts have issued warrants or proclamation orders and they have evaded arrests so far,” Deshmukh said. Gaikwad’s name figured prominently in this list of 800, and the rural police focussed afresh on nabbing him as part of a month-long special drive. “His home is strategically located at the end of Khadki village and every time he would get the wind of police movement, he would slip into nearby agricultural fields or forest areas,” said inspector Shelke. The long arm of the law finally caught up with him. “This time, we deployed our men in plain clothes to survey the village and seek information about his movement. Our team learnt from local villagers that Gaikwad had gone to a nearby grassland where we went and picked him up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dacoity-suspect-nabbed-after-41-years-from-solapur-village/articleshow/86275059.cms||Gitesh Shelke

At present, the overall case tally in Mumbai is 7.4 lakh and the toll stands at 16,039. State government officials said the dip in testing due to the festive season is a cause for worry and districts have been asked to ramp up testing. There are nearly 17 districts which have fewer than 100 active cases, and the testing in these districts have dropped significantly. “Once devotees start returning to the cities, they should be screened for symptoms and tested if required,” said an official, referring to people returning after the Ganpati festival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-active-cases-keep-rising-but-bmc-calm-as-positivity-rate-under-1-deaths-low/articleshow/86275097.cms||---

The celebrations in the wadas, known for intricate and beautiful carvings on the pillars and doors, showcased close bond with the neighbours. “Our mandal has been celebrating the festival in our wada for the last 73 years,” said Manohar Gavali, a resident of Gavali wada in Nana Peth, where 30-35 families resided. He said, “Most of the tenants have shifted. Some have even moved to other cities for work and personal reasons. But many of them make it a point to take leave for 10 days and visit us during the Ganeshotsav and keep the tradition of celebrating the festival together alive.” The celebrations in the wadas, known for intricate and beautiful carvings on the pillars and doors, showcased close bond with the neighbours. Pralhad Malvadkar, a resident of Malvadkar wada in Ganesh Peth, said, “We have always strictly avoided the use of speakers during the festival to prevent noise pollution. We are mindful of our neighbours and don’t want to be a nuisance to them. Every year, we also organised a talent contest for the children of the wada and invite others from neighbouring residences to join in the activities as well.” Reminiscing about the grand celebrations in the past, Meghana Shidhaye from a wada near Jogeshwari mandir in Budhwar Peth said, “We do all the decorations ourselves, with children making it an art and craft project. Before the pandemic, all the tenants would participate in cultural activities, such as skits, dance, rangoli, and other fun games organized throughout the 10-day festival. The women from the wada would get-together and watch a movie to stay awake till midnight for a puja performed just before the festival.”  Before the pandemic, all the tenants would participate in cultural activities, such as skits, dance, rangoli, and other fun games organized throughout the 10-day festival. After the pandemic, however, there have been no such celebrations. Out of the 10-15 families that lived in the wada, most have moved, she said. Born and brought up in a century old wada, Kapil Jagtap from Sadashiv Peth, misses how every family took turns to make the prasad during aarti every day of the festival during his childhood. “Though they were different households, tenants of the wada considered themselves a part of one big family. Tenants took turns to perform the aarti and every one would join the procession to raise slogans and chants as we headed towards the river for visarjan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wada-occupants-try-to-hold-on-to-traditions-during-pandemic/articleshow/86275094.cms||Mandar Deshpande

Before Ganpati stole the show, Lord Biswakarma would usherin the festive season in West Bengal which continues till Kali Puja. But thisyear demand for the idol has been low due to the pandemic, economic downturnand closure of several business units due to lack of business.  “I would sell atleastfive big and several small idols. This year I sold only two big idols and veryfew small ones,” said Prodyut Paul, an artist in Kumartuli. Jhulan Paul, another artist in Kumartuli said there werehardly any orders for big idols this year which normally come from theindustrial clusters in North 24 Parganas and some parts of Kolkata. “The orders have declined by 25 to 40 percent this year. Manypeople who have been organising the puja every year have just cancelled it thisyear,” said Paul. In areas like Baithakhana in Amherst Street where severalprinting presses are situated the mood has been gloomy. “Many people have shutdown the units because there is no business,” said Jyoti Kumar Sarkar,associated with book binding. Transport sector has also been hit badly. “I owned four appcabs out of which I sold two because they were not fetching adequate revenue. Inorder to pay the EMIs of the other two vehicles and the salaries of the driversalong with my own expenses we have to work for over 16 to 18 hours every day.In such a crisis it is difficult to organise a Biswakarma Puja,” said SagnikGhosh, a transporter in central Kolkata. In most cases employers fund the puja and the celebrationsfor the employees. This year several business owners organised Ganesh Puja socould not spare adequate funds for another puja in just a week’s time. “Earlierbhog for 200 people would be cooked along with along with funds for a galafeast for the employees in the evening. But this year we have scaled down theexpenses,” said Ankit Tiwary, a tour and travel operator in Burrabazar. Even the small and medium sized sweetshops have receivedfewer orders. “Earlier we would receive orders for several hundred packets ofsweets with average price of Rs 15 to 20. This year when we did not receivemany orders we called back our customers many of whom said they have shut downtheir units and were doing other jobs,” said a sweetshop owner in Fariapukur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/zee-biswakarma-puja-16/09/21/articleshow/86272830.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Nagpur||Residents halt cement road work to protest encroachment by BJP neta||NAGPUR: Residents from Gopal Nagar are vehemently opposing the conversion of a tar road in the area to cement concrete. The project is being executed with funds of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for his south-west constituency. The residents have erected a hoarding mentioning encroachment near the road by BJP corporator Pramod Tabhane and lapses in the construction work. They also stopped the contractor to stall the project. A fortnight ago, Fadnavis had performed bhoomipuja for the work of concreting work of the 1,300 metre tar road of 12 meter width. According to a senior official from the NMC’s public works department, Fadnavis had sanctioned Rs4 crore for the work. TOI on Thursday visited the locality. The tar road which was recarpeted some 15 years ago has innumerable potholes. The illegal construction for Tabhane’s contact office near Mate Chowk has eaten into almost 15 feet of the tar road. It has become a blind turn and an accident-prone spot, said the residents. “In the last couple of years, at least four motorists have been killed on the stretch due to illegal extension by Tabhane,” said Pankaj Nighote, a local resident. According to the locals, the then municipal commissioner Shyam Wardhane had directed the Laxmi Nagar zone to raze the illegal construction. Nighote said the civic administration did not take any action as Tabhane represents the ruling party in NMC. A senior official from NMC’s anti-encroachment department said that the corporator has been issued three notices. “Tabhane had assured to raze the illegal construction on his own,” the official said and added neither the corporator nor the Laxmi Nagar zone has done anything. Apart from removal of encroachment, the residents are demanding the existing road be excavated two ft deeper before starting the concreting work. “If we do not protest now, the road’s height will increase by at least two feet and the houses will face waterlogging during rain,” said the residents. Currently, height of the road in many localities is more than the plinth level of residential localities abutting the road, leading to rainwater gushing into the houses. Tabhane said he has already given consent to raze illegal construction of his house, if any. “I have asked the NMC to conduct road marking and if any land is required I will part with the portion,” he said and added that in the past too, a portion of my property was demolished citing encroachment. The corporator said due precaution will be taken to ensure that road would not cause waterlogging in the locality. “VNIT’s opinion will be sought on this,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/residents-halt-cement-road-work-to-protest-encroachment-by-bjp-neta/articleshow/86274348.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The incident triggered panic among the locals, coming close on the heels of a red alert in the state. According to an eyewitness, the powerful blast occurred when the bike — a five-year-old Bajaj Platina model — was near the Punjab National Bank. The rider, Balwinder Singh alias Luv (23) of Jhugge Nihanga Wala in Ferozepur, was thrown several feet in the air and died on the spot. The injured passerby was referred to Faridkot Medical College in a critical condition. Security agencies are examining whether the blast was a well-planned conspiracy or an accident. The bike that exploded did not have a number plate. Agencies are also looking into whether there was any link between this blast and the recent tiffin bomb case in a shop in Ferozepur, in which the shop was reportedly gutted after some miscreants set it on fire by putting some chemical at night. DIG, Ferozepur range, JS Aulakh, SSP Fazilka Deepak Hillori and forensic teams from Mohali visited the spot on Thursday. The police also confiscated a locked motorbike parked near the explosion site. It is expected that the investigation of this case could be handed over to the NIA shortly. The deceased’s sister, Jyoti, claimed he was coming to meet her when the blast took place. The police, after collecting call details of the deceased’s cellphone, have also begun investigating his family members. DSP Jalalabad Palwinder Singh claimed that the parked motorbike belonged to one Sukha, who is the cousin of the deceased and from the same border village. There were unconfirmed reports on Thursday evening of police nabbing Sukha. Auto maintenance experts said while it is uncommon for such an explosion to occur, a spark in the bike’s plug could have caused a fire in the engine area, leading to the fuel tank explosion. Meanwhile, police sources said the cousins, who were facing cases under Excise Act, and had left for Jalalabad on two bikes on Wednesday. Fazilka SSP Deepak Hillori said that it is too early to say anything and the matter is being investigated. This is the second blast in Punjab in a month. Earlier on August 8, there was a blast in an oil tanker at Ajnala in Amritsar district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/youth-from-border-village-killed-1-injured-in-jalalabad-bike-blast/articleshow/86275202.cms||Dinesh K Sharma

According to an FIR filed by the Vellore detachment of the DVAC on Wednesday, the former minister from Jolarpet in Tirupattur district has amassed Rs 28.78 crore worth assets from April 2016 to March 31, 2021 (DVAC’s check period) which was 654% more than his declared income. Some of the assets recorded as illegally acquired were registered on his mother’s name, the agency said. “Assets acquired by him and those in the name of his mother and dependents should not have exceeded Rs 1.83 crore during the said period,” the DVAC said. DVAC had used data declared by Veeramani in his election affidavits in 2016 and 2021 for arriving at the quantum of the disproportionate assets. His assets at the start of the check period in April 2016 were valued at Rs 26 crore. In five years, value of his assets grew to Rs 56.6 crore. While income earned by Veeramani and his dependents for the period was Rs 4.39 crore, the expenditure was at Rs 2.56 crore, DVAC said, explaining the calculation for his disproportionate assets. DVAC said Veeramani’s deceased father K K Chinnarasu was running a beedi company ‘KK Chinnarasu and Sons’ at Jolarpet and the ex-minister and his brothers, Alzhagiri and Kamaraj, were managing it. The family was also operating a tipper lorry transport business in the name of ‘Akalya transports’. DVAC said the agency conducted searches at Chennai-based properties linked to Veeramani at Leith Castle North in Santhome, Sivananda Salai at Gill Nagar, Choolaimedu, Shanthi Colony, Anna Nagar, and on Murugankoil Street in Kolathur. A case under prevention of corruption act and sections related to criminal misconduct has been registered against him. According to DVAC, Rs 34.01 lakh in cash, Rs 1.8 lakh worth of US dollars, nine luxury cars including a Rolls Royce, five computer hard discs, 4.987 kg of gold jewellery, 47gm diamond jewels, 7.2kg of silver articles, bank passbooks, and property documents were found during the search. Cash, materials and documents relevant to the case were seized and 275 units of sand worth Rs 30 lakh was found on the residential premises of Veeramani, the DVAC said. Investigation is still on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/654-income-jump-dvac-raids-ex-min/articleshow/86275186.cms||---

Dr Anil Arora, chairman, institute of liver, gastroenterology and pancreaticobiliary sciences at the hospital, said, “We successfully treated five patients between June and August. After recovering from Covid, they presented with severe inflammation of gallbladder without gallstones resulting in gangrene of gallbladder requiring urgent surgery.” He added it was the first time that the cases of gallbladder gangrene had been reported after recovery from Covid-19. Gallbladder stone is a common problem in north India (8% of the general population) and is responsible for 90% cases of acute inflammation called cholecystitis. Only 10% of the patients have “acalculous cholecystitis”, which is inflammation of gallbladder without evidence of gallstones or cystic duct obstruction. The five patients — four men and a woman — were aged between 37 and 75 years. All of them complained of fever, pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen and vomiting. Two of them had diabetes and one suffered from heart disease. Three patients had received steroids for the management of Covid symptoms. The median duration between Covid symptoms and diagnosis of “acalculous cholecystitis” was two months. All the five patients successfully underwent laparoscopic removal of necrotic perforated gallbladders, said Dr Arora. He added that “acalculous cholecystitis” with gangrenous gallbladder was a serious condition associated with high morbidity (up to 30-60%) and much higher mortality than “calculous cholecystitis”. It is usually seen in patients suffering from diabetes, HIV, vascular disease, total parenteral nutrition, those on prolonged fasting, in intensive-care units and those with underlying history of trauma, burns and sepsis. Surprisingly, all the patients had recovered from Covid and did not have these common predisposing factors. “Gallbladder epithelial cells are very similar to bile duct cells, as they richly express receptors (ACE2), and could be a target for SARS-CoV-2 or body’s dysregulated immunological response against the virus, resulting in severe inflammation of gallbladder,” the doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gallbladder-gangrene-in-5-after-covid-sparks-alarm/articleshow/86275207.cms||---

It has been developed by the SCERT in partnership with Tata Trust. Kamaladevi Awate, deputy director, equity and language department of the SCERT, said the app will bring out-of-school children back into mainstream education, and there are other sectors too where this app will help. “It will have verticals which teachers can fill with data of students who have migrated in or out, students who are irregular and new students who were out of school, but have been enrolled by teachers or others,” she added. Awate said the field testing of the app was done in one block each in five districts in the state and corrections or additions were suggested to the trust which incorporated them. The information is aligned with the Saral database. If a student migrates and joins another school, it won’t show it as two different students. There were discussions to link students using their Aadhaar card number, to incorporate photos of the out-of-school children and allow anyone to download the app. The app will be launched most probably in a month’s time, Awate added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/balrakshak-app-to-keep-track-of-out-of-school-children/articleshow/86275244.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh asked Sachin Waze to give ‘16 bags with cash’ to PA twice: ED chargesheet||MUMBAI: Former state home minister Anil Deshmukh had directed police officer (now-dismissed) Sachin Waze to hand over 16 bags containing Rs 4.6 crore in cash to his personal assistant Kundan Shinde on two different occasions outside the Sahyadri guest house and near Raj Bhavan, said the chargesheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate before a special PMLA court recently. The court took cognisance of the chargesheet. Waze had collected the money from bar owners in the city illegally on Deshmukh’s instructions. In the chargesheet, ED had named Waze along with Deshmukh’s Nagpur-based trust, which runs educational institutions, and his family-controlled company that owned land worth several hundred crores in Navi Mumbai, as accused. The ED also chargesheeted Deshmukh’s private secretory (additional collector rank government officer) Sanjeev Palande and PA Shinde. The ED is continuing its probe against Deshmukh and his family members. It will file a supplementary chargesheet against them after completing investigations, the chargesheet said. Deshmukh has been avoiding ED summons for months, and a lookout circular has been issued preventing him from leaving the country. In his statement recorded during Deshmukh’s house search in June, he told ED he had resigned on “moral grounds” after Bombay high court directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary enquiry. The chargesheet also stated that first Deshmukh demanded Rs 2 crore from Waze for helping him to remain in service, as many senior politicians in the MVA government were not happy with his reinstatement after 15 years of suspension and were insisting on his removal. Later, Deshmukh asked Waze to collect Rs 100 crore ‘hafta’ from bar owners in the city every month for him. Deshmukh repeated the demand after calling DCP Raju Bhujbal and ACP Sanjay Patil at his official residence. Waze would keep the collected cash in his car. Citing Waze’s statement, the chargesheet stated that “in January 2021, Deshmukh called him and instructed to hand over collected cash till date to Kundan Shinde, who immediately called him and (sic) asked to meet outside the Sahyadri guest house. Where he handed over five bags containing Rs 1.6 crore in the denomination of Rs 500.” Shinde came in Deshmukh’s white Mercedes to collect the money. It stated that in February, Deshmukh again called Waze, instructing him to hand over “collected cash till date to Shinde.” Afterwards, Shinde called Waze “near the Raj Bhavan signal, where he went in Deshmukh’s official vehicle and collected 11 bags containing Rs 3 crore.” Deshmukh would call Waze frequently. The chargesheet said, “It is revealed that Deshmukh by virtue of his earlier position as Home Minister... has received amounts to the tune of Rs 4.70 crore, collected from the orchestra bar owners for smooth functioning of bars and the said bribe money was used by him through his son Hrishikesh Deshmukh for providing cash to Delhi-based paper companies and after layering the same was routed to the Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha Trust in the garb of donation.” The trust is controlled by Deshmukh and his family. The chargesheet stated the trust had been used for parking illegal money since 2013. The Deshmukh family had “arranged infusion of illegal gratification so received by a collection of monies from orchestra bar owners and parked the same in the bank account of the trust in the garb of donations.” In the relevant period, Shinde was one of the trust’s members, ED said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deshmukh-asked-waze-to-give-16-bags-with-cash-to-pa-twice-ed-chargesheet/articleshow/86275237.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Chandigarh||Congress MLA protests against SSP for ‘harassing party men’||NAWANSHAHR: Congress Nawanshahr MLA Angad Singh along with party workers staged dharna outside senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harmanbir Singh Gill’s office on Thursday while accusing him of harassing Congress workers and working in cahoots with Aam Aadmi Party. The Congress MLA’s and SSP’s family have old business and land disputes and it spilled over in public domain on Thursday after police rounded up a supporter of the MLA in connection with an Excise Act case in which 805 cartons of whisky, meant for supply in Haryana, were recovered. MLA said his supporter Vikas Soni was being falsely implicated in the case. Gill’s posting as Nawanshahr SSP was seen as a snub for the MLA, as bitter equation between the two was well known in political and police circles. As he addressed his protestors on Thursday evening, Angad also talked about the personal dispute between the two and used pejoratives for the SSP. “Since the time he has arrived, he has left no stone unturned to ensure that I suffer in the ensuing assembly election due to his personal enmity with me. He is forcing Congress workers and others to join AAP. The day he joined here, he stayed in a hotel and the same night AAP’s constituency in-charge met him at the hotel, which can also be found from CCTV cameras of the hotel. In the last three-four weeks, false FIRs have been registered,” he said while speaking to TOI after the protest. Earlier, addressing his supporters, the MLA said, “Today morning also they tried to arrest a person wrongly and then twisted that they had got an enquiry report against him. The real reason was that the person they tried to arrest in the morning had accompanied me to Amritsar (in 2018) when I went to get possession of land from them. Now, they have implicated him wrongly.” However, when asked, SSP Gill said the dispute between their families about a cooperative bus transport company was already settled in black and white and the MLA had been even been calling him afterwards when he was posted as regional passport officer Jalandhar for getting works done. “The enquiry in the Excise Act case was held by a SIT led by previous SSP Alka Meena who found the person guilty. Everything pertaining to investigations had happened before I joined and today in the due process police brought him. However, MLA called up deputy inspector general (DIG), who then called me up and we released the person after getting a written undertaking that he would appear when required and that he could come up with evidence to defend himself,” he said. The SSP claimed that the real reason for MLA’s anger against him was that he cracked whip against illegal mining and drugs. “Leaders of all parties meet me including from AAP. Why would I help AAP? I called him up when I joined. MLA is levelling childish allegations. I am just doing my duty,” he added. MLA also provided copy of the letter he earlier wrote to chief minister Amarinder Singh mentioning the dispute between him and SSP’s family and the protest he had staged at Amritsar on November 12, 2018. He had urged the CM to transfer the SSP. Meanwhile, it has come out that a three-member SIT headed by previous SSP Alka Meena in a report submitted to Ludhiana inspector general had held that Vikas Soni was involved in the liquor smuggling case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-mla-says-nawanshahr-ssp-in-cahoots-with-aap-harasses-party-workers/articleshow/86275234.cms||IP Singh

---||Delhi||'More dangerous' dengue strains found in Delhi||Type I & II strains, likely more dangerous, found in the capitalNEW DELHI: The serotyping of samples found positive for dengue in Delhi has confirmed the presence of two strains of the dengue virus — Type I and Type II. The first causes classic dengue fever, while the second leads to haemorrhagic fever with shock. There are two other types, III which causes fever without shock and IV which causes fever without shock or profound shock. The presence of the Type II strain has caused some concern. But officials of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) under the Union health ministry said there was no cause for alarm. “Type I, which causes milder symptoms, is predominant. Only a few samples have been found to be positive for Type II strain,” said an official. Dengue has been a major public health concern in the city with recurrent outbreaks, prompting a rush to hospitals particularly in the post-monsoon period when mosquito breeding is at its peak. An NVBDCP official said the serotyping results were preliminary in nature due to the small sample size. “We plan to have more tests to identify the trend so that clinicians are notified in advance about the strains in circulation,” she added. Uttar Pradesh, where febrile illness has claimed the lives of several children over the past few weeks, has also been found to have Type I and II strains of the dengue virus. Dr Neeraj Nischal, additional professor of medicine, AIIMS, said the type of strain of dengue virus that is in circulation is important to prepare for a potential crisis. However, he added, it was more important to focus on preventing the spread of the disease itself by checking mosquito-breeding. The dengue virus is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is a freshwater breeder. Data from the three municipal corporations in the city shows that peri-domestic containers, such as vases, flowerpots, bird pots, tin, tyres, fountain water, etc, account for the largest chunk of mosquito breeding sites (38%). Domestic water storage containers, desert coolers and overhead tanks are other places where mosquito breeding takes place. Nischal said people needed to ensure there was no stagnation of water in such places. The authorities need to make fighting dengue a social movement through public awareness, timely identification of high-risk zones and use of anti-larval spraying, among others, he added. The latest data collated and shared by the municipal corporations on mosquito-borne diseases in the capital show 158 confirmed cases of dengue on September 11. This is higher than the number of cases of the viral illness reported in the same period last year. At least 68 cases of malaria and 40 of chikungunya — two other mosquito-borne diseases — have also been confirmed. Said Nischal, “This is a worrying trend and urgent action is needed to prevent a full-blown crisis. We are in the middle of a pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus and another disease outbreak at this time may increase the load of the already stressed health services.” Dr Vinay Aggarwal, chairman, Pushpanjali Medical Centre, east Delhi, said there seemed to be more cases of dengue than of Covid at the moment. At Lok Nayak Hospital too, medical director Dr Suresh Kumar reported a significant surge in cases of dengue. “New admissions due to Covid have gone down. But there is a big increase in cases of febrile illness that are testing positive for dengue. Some patients have required admission,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-delhi-needs-to-act-before-rising-dengue-threat-proves-double-whammy/articleshow/86272925.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

So far, the capital has recorded 158 cases as against 131 recorded in 2020 till this time of year. In the second week of September alone, 34 dengue patients were found. With the weather department predicting more rainy days this month, chances of mosquito breeding will increase, experts say. Civic officials, however, claim that things are considered to be worrisome only when there is an increase in the number of cases by more than 2/3rd of the normal occurrence. “Things are under control and we have got sufficient stock of insecticides that is being used for spraying purposes in low-lying areas, riversides and other places. We are also fogging in and around houses where dengue cases have been found,” said a South Delhi Municipal Corporation official. “A major challan drive was carried out against mosquito breeding at government offices and construction sites recently,” added the official. “A total of 1,130 DBC workers and 1,300 field staff are active on ground in the fight against dengue, chikungunya and malaria. Besides 550 fogging machines, eight heavy vehicles, four power tankers, 1,070 hand pumps and 46 motor pumps for insecticidal spray have been engaged.” East Delhi Municipal Corporation, meanwhile, has launched a month-long drive for anti-larval spraying in its jurisdiction and has made all four fever clinics, where the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test is conducted, fully operational. “The cases are on the rise and we have issued fresh guidelines. The fever clinics were non-operational as their staff were engaged in Covid-related duties, but now, they have been asked to resume their duties in the clinics,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dengue-rising-number-of-cases-higher-compared-with-previous-yr/articleshow/86272962.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||After Delhi, Type I and Type II strains of dengue virus found in UP too; MP faces threat as well||NEW DELHI: Apart from the national capital, Type I and Type II strains of the dengue virus have been confirmed in Uttar Pradesh too where several children have died due to febrile illness. Dengue is one of the causes of these deaths, but public health specialists say cases of scrub typhus — a mite-borne disease — have also been found. Dengue virus strains are of four types. Type I causes classic dengue fever, type II leads to haemorrhagic fever with shock, dengue III causes fever without shock and dengue IV causes fever without shock or profound shock. Reports suggest that at least 12,000 people in Firozabad district of Uttar Pradesh are bedridden with a viral fever that has the district in its grip. The toll has crossed 114, including 88 children. Over 2,400 people have been infected with dengue in Madhya Pradesh this year and, of them, 95 are currently undergoing treatment across various hospitals. Samples tested in Madhya Pradesh have been confirmed positive for Type II strain of the dengue virus whereas Gujarat and West Bengal have been found to have three different strains of the virus. Dengue, termed by many experts as the world’s most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease, is caused by four serotypes. While Type I and III are milder in nature causing classic dengue fever and fever without shock, respectively, dengue Type II and IV are considered deadly. These cause fever, bleeding and a drop in platelet count. Researchers say severe dengue cases, dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, started showing up in India in 1988. A reason behind the increased frequency could be the presence of many strains of the virus, doctors say. It exposes people already infected to become susceptible as they are not immune to all the subtypes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/both-strains-found-in-up-too-mp-faces-threat-as-well/articleshow/86272956.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Mumbai||Two ministers got Rs 40 crore to reverse transfer order by Param Bir Singh: Sachin Waze||MUMBAI: State transport minister Anil Parab and then home minister Anil Deshmukh had, through their close associates, allegedly received Rs 20 crore each to reverse one of the most controversial orders of former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh where he had transferred 10 DCPs in a go last year, said (now-dismissed) API Sachin Waze in his statement to ED. The statement is part of the ED chargesheet filed before a special court recently. In July 2020, Singh issued an order for transfer and posting of 10 DCPs, about which Deshmukh (of NCP) and Parab (of Shiv Sena) were not happy. They got the order reversed. In his statement to ED, Waze said, “After 3-4 days, Icame to know that after some adjustment and consideration of money, the said order was issued. I further state that I came to know about a total sum of Rs 40 crore had been collected from police officers listed in the said order and out of which Rs 20 crore each was given to Deshmukh through Sanjeev Palande and Parab through Bajrang Kharmate,(deputy RTO).”  Sachin Waze told ED that Anil Parab had received Rs 20 crore “through Bajrang Kharmate, (deputy RTO).” Recently, ED searched Kharmate’s premises and recorded his statement. It had called Parab for a statement; he sought a two-week exemption. The ED may call Parab next week for his statement. The ED is investigating a money laundering case based on the FIR registered by CBI that has accused Deshmukh of asking Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bars. The CBI is also pursuing alleged corruption in transfers and postings of police officers based on a confidential report last year by then state CID chief Rashmi Shukla, who cited tapped phone calls indicating a nexus between brokers and others. Waze told ED Singh had told him NCP chief Sharad Pawar was not happy with his reinstatement. Singh told Waze that Pawar instructed him to remove him again. Waze stated that on June 16 last year, he got a call from Deshmukh, who promised to convince Pawar for continuing Waze in the police force. After 3 days, Deshmukh called Waze at Sahyadri guest house, stating he had convinced Pawar and demanded Rs 2 crore in installment for helping him. Waze stated that afterwards, Deshmukh would call him regularly, inquiring about various ongoing investigations. Deshmukh also gave him a target to collect money from bar owners and on his instructions he handed over money to his PA Kundan Shinde. Waze told ED the chat about money delivery between him and Shinde was retrieved by NIA which arrested Waze in the murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran and the Antilia bomb scare case. Waze also stated Deshmukh would call him about car designer Dilip Chhabria’s case, through which he wanted to get some “settlement” worth Rs 150 crore with his partner. In his statement to ED, Deshmukh’s private secretary (government officer) Sanjeev Palande told officials one cabinet minister in Maharashtra used to handle “references with regard to transfer and postings of police officers of the rank of ACP and above for a political party since May 2020.” He said the minister used to forward the “recommended” list containing names of police officials and places where they had to be transferred, along with names of MLAs and MLCs from the party who had given the reference to Deshmukh. “The said list forwarded by the said minister to Deshmukh... used to be unofficial,” Palande said. He further stated there used to be “no record maintained at Home Minister’s office” and that “he used to forward the list... to Police Establishment Board as per the directions of Anil Deshmukh.” He stated “the said minister also used to meet with the home minister with the list.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-one-mantri-used-to-send-unofficial-list-to-home-min/articleshow/86275299.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Its capacity should be increased to 550 MTs,” the CM said at the meeting. Health officials said the government machinery was geared up to face any eventuality by procuring medicines and providing infrastructure facilities at a cost of Rs 133 crore. For children, 5,200 beds had been kept in various hospitals, the officials said.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: AAP demands floor test of Congress govt||CHANDIGARH: The Aam Aadmi Party has demanded that the Punjab legislative assembly speaker Rana K P Singh should conduct a floor test of the state government to prove its majority. “The state government has gone into minority and a floor test is the need of the hour. Amarinder Singh has lost support of the people of Punjab as well as the Congress party and its MLAs,” Punjab leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said on Thursday. Cheema said Amarinder Singh-led Congress government had clearly split and as the CM lacked the trust of most of his party MLAs, the ruling party in Punjab had lost the majority to run and retain the government. “The two factions (of Congress), which have been publicly blaming and distrusting each other for a long time, have been wielding power over the number of MLAs. In such a challenging situation, the government of Capt Amarinder Singh has lost its majority,” he said. Being in minority, CM Amarinder has no moral or constitutional right to remain in government, he added. The AAP leader said that a majority of the Congress MLAs were seeking Amarinder’s removal for his “incompetence and failure in running the state”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-demands-floor-test-of-cong-govt/articleshow/86275301.cms||---

The programme would be held from September 17 to October 7. Speaking to mediapersons, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said that programmes will be organised at the booth level to compliment Modi’s work, while 40,000 post cards would be sent to the Prime Minister’s Office. Modi has taken numerous noteworthy decisions, some of which include the construction of Ram Mandir and resolving the Kashmir issue, Tanavade said, and pointed out that Indians have started getting respect abroad due to Modi’s initiatives. The state BJP chief said that besides BJP workers, they will urge prominent citizens to write newspaper articles and hold television discussions on Modi‘s achievements. As part of environmental activities, BJP karyakartas will undertake tree plantation drives, and the aim is to plant around 100 trees in each constituency, Tanavade said. Under the health programme, blood donation camps will be organised, he said, and two camps have been held each in both districts. He also said that even the booth-level president can organise blood donation camps in every constituency. Tanavade said that BJP has started its election campaign and clarified that these programmes have nothing to do with poll preparations. Reacting to opposition leader Digambar Kamat’s statement that the chief minister is misleading citizens on the state completing 100% first dose vaccine coverage, Tanavade said, “He is following his leader Rahul Gandhi, and if there is someone who is yet to take the first dose then he can inform the chief minister.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-lines-up-events-to-mark-modis-20-years-in-politics/articleshow/86275346.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Nagpur’s rape rate highest in Maharashtra, as per NCRB data||NAGPUR: National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)’s 2020 data has shown that the city has the highest rape rate in Maharashtra (6.5 per one lakh population), with Mumbai (3.8) and Pune (2.5) following it. Nagpur also has the highest overall rate of crimes against women (75.3) in the state, followed by Mumbai (53.8) and Pune (44.1). In cases related to the protection of children from sexual offences (POCSO) Act, 2015, Nagpur has the third-highest crime rate in the country (16.0) after Indore (17.8) and Lucknow (16.8). While the NCRB data — especially related to offences against women — created a ripple, revealing Nagpur's alleged dubious distinction, activists feel the city may not be as safe as expected, but still better than places like Delhi, where atrocities against women are common. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said women’s security and safety is on the topmost priority in his vision for the city. “We are continuously trying to make the city safer for women through various proactive measures, like the Damini squads dedicated to them,” he added. Social activist Neelima Deshmukh, senior fellow at the Indian Council of Social Science and Research, said the city is not safe after late evening, like Mumbai. “Police may be trying to make this place safer but citizens, especially the youngsters, should be disciplined and not transgress," she said. Educationalist and activist Hema Muniyar said Nagpur is safer than other metropolitan cities but the vulnerable places must be avoided. Former additional public prosecutor Jyoti Vajani, who had got convictions in several rape cases, said Nagpur may not be safe after a certain time in the day. She expressed doubts about whether women would be able to move around freely, feeling safe in the night in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpurs-rape-rate-highest-in-state-as-per-ncrb-data/articleshow/86272954.cms||---

Two brothers Sanjay and Sandep Das, cousins of the murdered woman Sushmita Mondal, have been arrested. Her son Tamajit had used the cellphone in online classes. Police have also seized the bike used by the accused on the day of the murder as well as other articles including the bag used to carry the loot from the victim’s residence. They are being sent to the forensic lab for analysis and evidence collection. “Susmita’s cellphone was recovered close to the murder spot,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. “Initially, the accused wanted to take the phone along with them. But then they thought it could be used to track them down. So, they threw the phone while leaving after the crime,” added Sharma. Cops said Sanjay had planned the murder to lay his hands on the woman’s gold as he was financially stressed. “He was employed at a departmental store at Esplanade as a CCTV maintenance staff. He married off his step son and was saddled with Rs 3 lakh debt. He asked for Rs 5,000 as loan from the woman, requesting her not to reveal it to anyone. But she told his mother about it and this angered him,” said a police source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-trace-behala-murder-victims-phone/articleshow/86272972.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Ludhiana||Punjab: UAPA slapped on accused who smoked in Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib||PATIALA: Taking stringent action in the case of violation of sanctity of Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib in Anandpur Sahib of Ropar district, the police have added sections of the UAPA against the accused who was resident of Ludhiana and had allegedly smoked inside the gurdwara premises at Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib in the wee hours on Monday. The accused, identified as Paramjeet Singh of Ludhiana, was nabbed immediately after the incident by the devotees and task force members at the Takht and was later handed over to the police. On Thursday, the Ropar police added section 18 of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and some more sections of Indian Penal Code against the accused, who was already booked under Section 295 A of IPC under FIR 122 at Anandpur Sahib police station for violating the sanctity of the Takht. The police on Thursday have also managed to get the remand of the accused extended up till September 21. Earlier, he was given four days police remand by the court on Monday. The police in its investigation have found that the accused was getting funds from foreign country and was receiving around $1000 every month for the last two years. Akal Takht Sahib jathedar had alleged two days ago that accused Paramjeet was directly linked with controversial Dera Sacha Sauda and his father Gurmail Singh was part of seven-member committee of the dera. The police haven’t found any anomalies in foreign funding, as Gurmail Singh, who has been residing in USA since 2013, was sending money to his son for daily needs. Paramjeet was a drug addict and was undergoing treatment and also lost his dairy business. On September 5, the accused was also baptised at Gurdwara Dukhniwaran Sahib Ludhiana but soon renounced it. The accused also told police that in September 2019 he was pushed out of the dera in Sirsa for smoking there. The police are now investigating possible involvement of another accused, who was allegedly present during the occurrence of the crime at Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib. “The committee members of Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib suspect that another person was involved with whom Paramjeet had made gesture-communication before committing the crime. We are looking for another suspect,” a senior police officer told TOI. On Wednesday, president of Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) Bibi Jagir Kaur had demanded addition of UAPA sections against the accused. In October last year, the Fatehgarh Sahib police had registered a case of UAPA along with hurting religious sentiments against the 20-year-old accused who allegedly committed the crime of sacrilege in two villages— Jallah and later at Tarkhan Majra. He was nabbed by the committee members while his car was damaged by the Sikh protesters. Meanwhile, the National Commission for Minorities on Wednesday has taken suo-moto of the incident and has directed the state government to furnish a report of the incident and measures taken to prevent recurrence of such incidents within seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/uapa-slapped-on-accused-who-smoked-in-takht-sri-kesgarh-sahib/articleshow/86275317.cms||---

---||Dehradun||U’khand HC nod to Char Dham yatra||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court on Thursday vacated its stay on the Char Dham yatra, opening up the four Himalayan shrines to fully-vaccinated pilgrims carrying a Covid-negative report. The court had stayed the yatra on June 28, just days before the annual pilgrimage was to open on July 1, remarking that allowing the yatra would be “akin to inviting a calamity”. On Thursday, the bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma lifted the stay after the government informed the court that it would adhere to Covid protocol and limit pilgrim numbers to the shrines. The government submitted that 800 devotees will be allowed to visit Kedarnath each day, while 600 pilgrims can go to Gangotri and 400 to Yamunotri. The government had set the daily cap at 1,200 visitors for Badrinath, but the court limited the number to 1,000. The state also assured the court that only three people would be allowed into the sanctum sanctorum of a shrine. The state government argued in court that the Covid numbers in the state had gone down significantly and almost every temple in the country was now open to pilgrims. It added that institutions, including the courts, had also reopened. The yatra is the only source of livelihood for thousands of locals and should be allowed, the state said. TURN Earlier this week, local businessmen from Uttarkashi, Chamoli and Rudraprayag – the districts where the four shrines are located — had appealed to the petitioners, who had filed pleas that led to the stay on the yatra, to “save livelihoods and families of 25,000 people”. The petitioners— over half a dozen — had raised concerns over the state’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. While none of the pleas sought a stay or cancellation of the yatra, the court stayed the pilgrimage. Advocate general (AG) S N Babulkar said the bench has now directed the secretaries of district legal services authority (DLSA) of Char Dham districts to review the facilities available for pilgrims and send weekly reports to the court detailing the measures and status of crowd management at each shrine. The government said a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the yatra would be announced. “We will roll out an SOP soon. Right from the entry of devotees in the sanctum sanctorum to Covid-negative reports, all directions of the HC would be followed,” tourism minister Satpal Maharaj told TOI. Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal added that the yatra would boost the local economy. “The yatra is directly and indirectly related to the livelihood of scores of people, especially in Garhwal,” he said. The court’s decision brought cheer to the priest community as well. Brijesh Sati, spokesperson of Char Dham Tirth Purohit Mahapanchayat, said, “Char Dham yatra is the single source of earning for many families. There is still hope for their business to revive.” In 2017, nearly 22 lakh devotees visited Char Dham. In 2018, the footfall went up to 26 lakh and hit a high of 32 lakh in 2019. In 2020, the pandemic delayed the yatra and only 3 lakh pilgrims arrived in the state. Earlier this year, the state cabinet had decided to allow the yatra, but only for those residing in the three Char Dham districts. There were plans to open up the yatra to those from outside the state in a phased manner. After the high court stay, the state government had approached the Supreme Court. It had also appealed to the high court to lift the ban. But since the matter was pending in the apex court, the high court was not in a position to hear the state government’s plea. It recently withdrew its special leave petition in the Supreme Court paving the way for the high court to hear its plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-nod-to-char-dham-yatra/articleshow/86273010.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Penguins’ birth was kept under wraps due to tender fiasco?||MUMBAI: BMC kept the birth of two Humboldt penguins at Byculla zoo under wraps for months and announced it only on September 15 to cover up a Rs 15-crore tender fiasco over maintenance of their enclosure, Opposition alleged on Thursday. BJP leader and corporator Vinod Mishra said they were against the deal. “Their maintenance should be done by a BMC team of vets. They were brought five years back, but even now we cannot get a BMC team to take care of them, and are spending crores on hiring an agency. The announcement appears to have been done to cover up the controversy. We plan to questions it,” said Mishra. Opposition party leader Ravi Raja said one penguin was born on May 1 but no one was informed for long. “The penguins have been a huge attraction. It would have been a happy event for all of us to hear about their birth. Why keep it under wraps?” he said. SP leader in BMC Rais Shaikh said it was a cover-up for the tender fiasco, but this ‘feel good’ news cannot do away with why large amounts are being spent on extravagant projects. TOI learnt the zoo authorities planned to announce the news virtually on October 1, the fifth month of ‘Oreo’. A senior zoo official said they had been requesting mayor Kishori Pednekar to make the announcement but due to Ganpati festivities it was pushed back. “The birds are stable, so we thought it would be apt to make an announcement now,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-penguins-birth-was-kept-under-wraps-due-to-tender-fiasco/articleshow/86275349.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Delhi||Grey Line extension to take Delhi Metro further into interiors of Najafgarh||NEW DELHI: On Saturday, the much-delayed extension of the Grey Line (Dwarka-Najafgarh) to Dhansa bus stand will be put into operation, making the Delhi Metro network 390 km long with 286 metro stations. The 891-metre section, which will take the metro further into the interior of Najafgarh, will be jointly inaugurated by Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on September 18 at 12.30pm via video conferencing. Passenger services will commence at 5pm that day, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation said in a statement on Thursday. The section was scheduled to be opened along with the ‘missing link’ of Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) at Trilokpuri on August 6, but was deferred due to the restoration work on an approach road that had caved in on May 20. A large portion of the road near the under-construction Dhansa bus stand metro station had collapsed during heavy rainfall, damaging some nearby buildings. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot visited the area the following day along with DMRC managing director Mangu Singh. In a letter written to Singh before the scheduled inauguration, Gahlot said that due to the construction of the station and tunnelling up to Khaira Mor, a stretch of Dhansa Road had been blocked for more than a year and two major road cave-ins had taken place in the period when the road was under DMRC’s supervision. Gahlot pointed out that DMRC had been submitting different timelines for restoring the road but it was yet to be opened for normal traffic. “The main approach road to Dhansa Stand metro station is not even accessible to the public, what to say of being motorable,” he had noted, advising DMRC to make the road motorable before the inauguration of the new station or to postpone the inauguration till the road was made motorable for the public again. The Dwarka-Najafgarh section of the 5.4-km Grey Line opened in 2019 with three stations at Dwarka, Nangli and Najafgarh, while work remained to be completed on the extension to Dhansa bus stand. The station is going to be Delhi Metro’s first ever below-surface station to have an entire underground floor dedicated to parking. The parking facility will be integrated with the main station area and commuters will be able to leave their vehicles and proceed directly to the concourse using the elevators and escalators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/grey-line-extension-to-take-metro-further-into-interiors-of-najafgarh/articleshow/86273457.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Chandigarh||Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu didn’t object to contract farming law: BJP||CHANDIGARH: Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Navjot Singh Sidhu seems to have forgotten the fact that he did not object to or raise any concern when the contract farming Act was passed in 2013 in the state and his wife was part of the state government, BJP alleged on Thursday. Punjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma said it was the Congress government in the Centre under Manmohan Singh that initiated this Act and Rahul Gandhi in a press conference in 2013 had instructed all states to implement it. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in fact improved and worked out a better system, Sharma claimed. “I would also like to remind Sidhu that in the last eight years there was not one word said by him to counter this Act, while he and his wife were part of the government in the state,” he added. Capt Amarinder Singh in 2017 went ahead to pass this Act for private mandi and private yard and allowed private players to purchase the agriculture produce, but Sidhu did not raise any objection in the cabinet meeting or in the state assembly, the BJP functionary said, adding, “today his rhetoric has changed and he is playing petty politics in the state.” The Act protected the interests of the farmers and no where in the act it is written that the contractor of the farm can take over the land of the farmer, he said. “I would invite Sidhu to a debate on this Act and ask him to refrain from misleading farmers. In fact, he should apologise to the farming community for creating this misunderstanding,” Sharma added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-chief-didnt-object-to-contract-farming-law-bjp/articleshow/86275356.cms||---

Police have also recovered 897 fake currency notes in denomination of Rs 100 from the accused who belong to Udham Singh Nagar district and had been circulating fake currency notes in various parts of the state. The accused were identified as Shafeeq Ahmad and Daulatram alias Babu. The accused were exchanging counterfeit by paying 30 per cent in original currency notes from a supplier in Uttarakhand. Police have booked them under sections 489-B (using currency notes as genuine) and 489-C (possession of forged or counterfeit currency notes). The cops said that they will take the remand custody of the accused to trace the other members of the gang. Additional SP Rajkumar Agarwal told TOI, “The accused said that they were acquiring the counterfeit currency from Uttarakhand. We have shared the details with the intelligence agencies to check if there is a connection with any terrorist outfit." The additional SP also said, "Multiple teams have been sent to Uttarakhand to find the kingpin. We are also taking the support of local police. The accused will be sent to jail now, but we will apply for their remand custody.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/2-ukhand-residents-held-with-897-fake-notes-of-rs-100-denomination/articleshow/86270778.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Delhi||NE Delhi riots: Charges framed against 5 for setting man ablaze at Ramlila Maidan||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday framed charges of murder and arson against four persons, arrested for allegedly setting a man ablaze at Ramlila Maidan during the northeast Delhi riots. The court noted that statements of witnesses could not be brushed aside merely because there has been delay in recording the statements, or that the complainant did not specifically name the accused in his initial written complaint made to the police. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav framed charges against Lakhpat Rajora, Yogesh, Lalit, and two other men named Kuldeep under the requisite sections of the Indian Penal Code. The court said in the order: “Though there was some delay in recording the statements of public witnesses in the matter, but at this stage, it cannot lose sight of the fact that on account of prevailing communal tension in the area, it was difficult for the cops to trace the eye/public witnesses promptly as they were shocked and traumatised that it took several days for them to muster courage to come out and report the matter to the cops. The court noted that the call detail records (CDR) of all the accused showed them at or around the scene of crime on the date of the incident, which prima facie appears to be out of their routine locations. “The defence taken by them that since they are residents of same area/locality and therefore, their CDR location is being found at or around the spot/SOC is of little help to them at this stage. Accused Lakhpat Rajora had refused to undergo judicial “Test Identification Parade” (TIP) in the matter and as such an adverse inference is likely to be drawn against them. Even the orange coloured T-shirt worn by him at the relevant time during the rioting has been recovered at his instance,” judge Yadav observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-delhi-riots-charges-framed-against-5-for-setting-man-ablaze-at-ramlila-maidan/articleshow/86273508.cms||Usha Das

The panchayat executive officer of Gangabad met the beneficiaries and disbursed social security pensions, including aid for the elderly and the disabled, at Manikpatna and Gudikhudi villages under the Rayagada block. Manikpatna was in the news recently after Andhra Pradesh’s animal husbandry minister, S Appalaraju, visited the village and allegedly forced open the anganwadi centre, which had been sealed by the district administration, citing its location on the Odisha side. “We had organised special health camps and distributed dry ration among the residents of the border villages in Rayagada block earlier as well. The villagers are getting benefits from the state and we are in touch with them,” an administrative official from Odisha said. Meanwhile, the tribals of the bordering villages on Thursday decided to stage a protest at Paralakhemundi, the district headquarters town, on September 20 over Andhra’s alleged attempt to intrude into Odisha’s territory. Bhala Chandra Sarangi, leader of the All-India Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, said they would urge the state government to resolve the border dispute and other issues of the neighbouring villages at the earliest. He alleged that AP police had tried to register a case against the AIKMS district president and the former sarpanch of Gangabad, Haribandhu Karjee, for protecting the interest of the people of the bordering villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/odisha-dist-admin-distributes-pension-in-border-villages/articleshow/86275343.cms||Hrusikesh Mohanty

The man’s neighbours alerted the police after a foul smell began to emit from the house, where Asish Philip Gomes lived. Cops broke open the door to find the body lying on the bed. Initial reports suggest that there was no foul play in his death. His son and wife, who stay 300 metre away from the house, had no idea of the death. “The death had occurred sometime back. Rigor mortis had set in. Later, the autopsy surgeon gave his primary opinion that the victim might have been suffering from an illness for some time. Prima facie, the final reason for death could be cardio respiratory failure,” said an officer. Gomes’ wife told cops that they were estranged and she lived with their son a little distance away. The differences that cropped up were personal in nature. “We have come to know that Gomes often travelled outside the city for work. But for sometime now, especially after the outbreak of the pandemic, he was without work and had become alcoholic,” said the officer. Neighbours said that they had last seen Gomes in the weekend. “He told us that his health was a bit low but he did not sound alarmed. He was otherwise communicative and used to take part in local adda sessions before the pandemic. It is our fault that we could not go and ask him about his health. By evening on Wednesday, the foul smell was getting stronger and we finally traced that it was coming from his residence,” said a neighbour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/interior-designer-found-dead-in-taltala-house/articleshow/86273056.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

This court has the power to take cognisance as a special court as well as the powers of the sessions court... This is a diversionary tactic, you should take this seriously. Are you a sessions judge or a special judge for them? How are they approaching you then? If they go into technicalities, they will land in a big soup. How are they remembering that you are a special judge now,” claimed advocate Mehmood Pracha.Pracha added that the chargesheet was filed by police before the court while exercising power as a sessions judge and hence, the prosecution cannot now challenge the maintainability of the bail plea at this stage.Some of the co-accused, who had moved their bail applications under this section, have withdrawn their applications after the prosecution challenged the maintainability and filed fresh bail pleas under Section 437 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/prosecutions-using-diversionary-tactics-says-fatimas-lawyer/articleshow/86273462.cms||---

This time it was a drone that carried the latest IT policy (2021-26) to the stage occupied by the who’s who of the IT industry such as Nasscom chairperson Rekha M Menon, Cyient founder BVR Mohan Reddy, TCS senior vice-president V Rajanna, along with Telangana IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao, who underlined the vision for the sector over the next five years. Telangana aims to continue its bull run and is gunning for doubling its IT exports from the existing Rs 1.45 lakh crore (2020-21) to Rs 3 lakh crore and stepping up the number of IT jobs from around 6.28 lakh to over 10 lakh by 2025-26. It will also work towards ensuring that along with Hyderabad, the state’s tier-2 and 3 centres too offer an attractive proposition for investors and create jobs for local youth. The policy also intends to focus on honing the digital skills of citizens and bridging the digital divide. Launching the policy, KTR said, “While the ICT Policy 2016 has helped Telangana propel itself from being a young state to one of the top achievers in the IT and electronics sector, there is a need to rethink our approach. The citizens of Telangana deserve to get better employment opportunities, better access to technology and overall, a better quality of life that technology can enable.” Industry veterans Menon and Reddy urged the government to focus on skilling as the industry has been grappling with an acute shortage of skilled workforce. “Rapid digitisation is creating demand for new skills… whether it’s IoT or robotics, and if we look across the country, the demand for digital skills is eight times what’s available,” Nasscom chairperson Menon said. Even Reddy said the major crisis is not having the right skilled people. “It is imperative we make intervention in our education system to ensure we will have future skills in every campus,” he said. The government also launched the Startup Telangana Portal, which will be a one-stop platform for the state’s startup ecosystem. It also launched T-FACE (T- Fabless Accelerator through Cloud Enablement), a virtual incubation platform for supporting startups in the VLSI (very large-scale integration) and fabless chip designing space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-new-it-policy-guns-for-doubling-exports/articleshow/86275373.cms||Swati Rathor

Besides giving the updated details of all the ongoing and future projects, the website has a separate section on myths and facts about the ambitious project. The housing and urban affairs ministry had been working on the portal for more than a year, which sources said is aimed at putting everything before the public so that they can judge the government’s plan for revamping the Central Vista, including construction of a New Parliament Building, Executive Enclave and Common Central Secretariat buildings. “There have been a lot of confusion and misinformation. So, we have put everything in black and white in the website. There is also an option for people to give their suggestion. There are videos on fact checks, which show how there is misinformation about the project,” said an official. The government has uploaded several photographs of the existing Parliament Building showing how the structure is under stress and inadequate to take the future loads. It also gives updated details of the total mandays (employment) generated since the redevelopment works started last year and the materials used. This is aimed at informing people about the impact of the projects on economic activities and employment. The government has uploaded a detailed response to counter the critics, who had slammed government for taking up such an expensive project during the Covid pandemic. It says the Redevelopment of Central Vista Master Plan was conceived in September 2019, many months earlier than the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 and that the projects will be executed in six years. It also says how the government has increased the budgetary allocation for health in recent years and public health has been a priority of the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/central-vista-website-to-bust-myths-on-project/articleshow/86273466.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC dismisses Param Bir Singh’s plea against inquiries, points him to CAT||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday dismissed a petition filed by former city police chief Param Bir Singh, holding that his plea for quashing of two preliminary inquiries ordered by the state government against him was not tenable before it. A bench of Justice S S Shinde and Justice N J Jamadar said the proper remedy for Singh was to approach the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), where he could “very well agitate the issues of mala fide and vendetta”. The high court said it was not observing anything more, but its dismissal did not stand in the way of Singh’s challenging the preliminary inquiries in the tribunal, which could then decide the issues uninfluenced by its order. Singh had challenged the two preliminary inquiries ordered on April 1 and April 20 saying these were “hastily” ordered as a “vendetta and retaliation” by the then state home minister Anil Deshmukh. He said that he was targeted because he had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20 alleging “corrupt malpractice” by the home minister, and he had filed petitions seeking a CBI inquiry. The high court said that Singh’s claim of a “counter-blast” by state “prima facie does not hold ground in respect of the action initiated” against him on a complaint filed by another police officer, Anup Dange, whose complaint against Singh was from February 2, 2021, “much before the controversy arose over the explosives scare” outside Antilia, the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani. The April 1 inquiry was to be done by director general of police Sanjay Pandey, who recused himself on April 30, after which the state handed it to other officials on May 3 who Singh alleged were junior in rank to him. Pandey, through his counsel Navroze Seervai, had challenged the maintainability of Singh’s challenge before the high court, as had the state through its special counsel Darius Khambata. Both said he could approach the CAT first as the issue was of alleged breach by Singh of the All India Service Conduct Rules of 1968. Singh’s counsel Mahesh Jethmalani had said “it is not an administrative inquiry” and the “only purpose of appointing Sanjay Pandey to conduct it was to persuade me (Singh) to withdraw the March 20 letter”. The letter had formed the basis of a complaint against Deshmukh where the high court had on April 5 ordered the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry, which later led to an FIR against Deshmukh and unknown others. On May 3, the state had allotted two separate inquiries, one in a complaint filed by officer Dange, to the DG, Anti-Corruption Bureau, and one to an additional chief secretary. Nothing survives in the challenge against him as a result, argued Khambata. It was evident that the April 20 order for a preliminary inquiry stemmed from incidents predating Singh’s March 20 letter, said the high court to underscore that allegations of malice made by the former police commissioner were also rooted in fact and required adjudication by the competent tribunal. The state had submitted that even if it was assumed that the allegations against Singh were made by persons “inimically disposed towards” him, or by those who had an axe to grind, that could not be grounds to quash the action initiated to inquire into those allegations. The high court said it was not delving deeper into the matter on facts. It held that in matters within the ambit of service matters, which is of “wide amplitude”, it is only the tribunal which, as a court of first instance, is empowered to delve into.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-dismisses-param-bir-singhs-plea-against-inquiries-points-him-to-cat/articleshow/86275400.cms||Swati Deshpande

A division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad have ordered the zonal director of the investigating agency to appear before the court in virtual mode on the next date of hearing of the case. The bench observed that a judicial officer has been slain and no action has been taken as yet. The judges said that the status report of the investigation done by the CBI sleuths which is presented every week to the high court does not show much progress. The agency has not arrested anyone except the auto rickshaw driver and his accomplice, the court said. The bench further observed that the agency should investigate why an auto rickshaw driver would kill a high ranking judicial officer. The conspiracy angle in the entire case has not been probed properly, the judges said. The court said that the death of Dhanbad additional district judge Uttam Anand remains a mystery. A judicial officer has been killed which is confirmed by the investigation report furnished by the CBI, but no new facts have been unearthed as of yet, the bench said. Judge Uttam Anand died under mysterious circumstances on July 28 when he was out for his morning walk. The death of the judge was recorded in the CCTV cameras and had become viral on the social media. The incident rocked the judiciary not only in the state but the entire country and the Supreme Court also took cognizance of the matter. Soon thereafter, the police had taken up the investigation and two persons – Lakhan Verma and Rahul Verma were arrested. The state government also requisitioned the matter for investigation by the CBI which was accepted by the agency and it took over the investigation. The miscreants arrested are facing interrogation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-summons-cbi-zonal-head-in-judge-death-case/articleshow/86274480.cms||---

The NCRB figures released on Wednesday said the rate of murder in Jharkhand in 2020 was 4.2%, which is the highest among all the states. Haryana with a figure of 3.9% came second. The rate is determined on basis of the total number of incidents and the total population. Jharkhand, whose projected population in mid-2020 was 3.81 crore, recorded 1,592 incidents of murder. In terms of absolute figures, Uttar Pradesh with 3,779 cases was on the top but its rate was only 1.7%. In Jharkhand, the highest number of murders took place for personal gains as the motive followed by vendetta and enmity (269), love affairs (62), dowry (56) and illicit relationships (36). The rate of crime under the Dowry Prohibition Act was at 8.2%, which was also the highest among all the states. Karnataka with a figure of 4.6% was second while the national average was 1.6%. The state also registered 1,518 dowry cases in which 1,535 persons became victims. The projected population of women during the year was 185.9 lakh. Jharkhand also recorded the highest number of cases under the SC, ST Prevention of Atrocities Act with a figure of 180 while Rajasthan came second with 29 cases. A total of 479 cases related to various SC, ST acts was recorded in Jharkhand, which was the second highest. UP was on the top of list with 2,578 cases. In the offences against the state (waging war against the state) category, Jharkhand was listed on the top. The state was also on the top in terms of gambling with 21 cases and lottery with 18 cases. Many of the states, however, recorded zero cases under the gambling and lottery categories. With a figure of 55 cases, Jharkhand also registered th second highest number of offences against public tranquillity. In terms of human trafficking, the state is just behind Maharashtra (154) and Telangana (104) with 103 cases. Commenting on the law and order in the state vis-a-vis the NCRB’s report, the former president of the Federation of Jharkhand Chambers of Commerce and Industries, Deepak Kumar Maroo, said, “Law and order is among the primary things that investors see before putting their money in any area. The state government should take remedial steps to improve the situation.” Meanwhile, opposition BJP snubbed the coalition government for “failing” to maintain law and order in the state. Party spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said, “Since the change of the government, there has been a steady fall in the law and order situation across the state be it rape, crime against children, murders et al. BJP has long been raising the issue of law and order under the Hemant Soren government.” Jharkhand Police spokesperson and inspector general (operations) Amol Homkar said he has not gone through the NCRB report so and he would be able to comment only after reading it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/crimes-against-sc/st-went-up-last-year-in-jharkhand-ncrb/articleshow/86274377.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The bandh call has been given by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is leading the nationwide protest for the past 10 months against the laws by camping in and around the national capital. Announcing their support, Jharkhand Rajya Kisan Sabha and Centre of Indian Trade Union (Citu), the Left union on Thursday said that they have chalked out a slew of activities for its grand success. The ruling alliance partners —JMM, Congress and RJD — which has also raised its voice against the three farm laws, however, have not officially cleared their stand on the bandh. But so far they have supported the earlier protests held in the state. The farm bodies said that their protest will also be against the Union government’s national monetisation pipeline project as part of which national assets are set to be privatised. Prakash Viplab of Citu said elaborate plans have been made from state to panchayat levels. “In the run-up to the nationwide bandh on September 27, we have worked out several activities from the state to panchayat levels from September 20. During this period, farmers/people will be apprised about the bandh and also why farmers in the country are protesting against it.” Detailing their preparedness, general secretary of Jharkhand Rajya Kisan Sabha, Surjit Sinha, said 20,000 posters, and two lakh pamphlets bearing slogans in support of the bandh and against Prime Minister Narendra Modi government’s faulty policies are being readied. “This apart, similar arrangements are being done in all the districts. A special social media campaign, too, will begin shortly,” he said, adding that from September 20 onwards, they will kick off nukkad sabhas in over 1,000 panchayats in rural areas and in 500 places in urban pockets. “On the eve of the bandh, mashal julus will be taken out in 4,000-plus panchayats,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/farmers-plan-stir-on-sept-27-in-support-of-bharat-bandh/articleshow/86274270.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The new rule will come into force from September 30 and the employees can, however, carry keypad phones which do not have cameras in them. The HEC notice, signed by manager (personnel and administration) Prashant Kumar, said, “In order to maintain the safety and security of employees and the documents/ processes and to avoid distractions in production activities, the management has to prohibit the use of smartphones from September 30 till further orders.” Using smartphones at the workplace would be treated as an act of misconduct and disciplinary/ administrative action would be initiated against the violator, the notice further said. The ban applies to the permanent staff, contractual workers, trainees and even visitors. However, directors, chief vigilance officer, general managers, in-charge of operations, and shops, department and divisional in-charge have been exempted from the order. The PSU officials have made it clear that the ban has been introduced on an experimental basis and its effectiveness would be reviewed next month. When asked, the officials said the idea enforcing a ban on smartphones came up during Union secretary of ministry of heavy industries Arun Goel’s visit to HEC on September 13. Many workers were seen taking pictures of the dignitaries and the production process. Photography inside HEC plants is strictly prohibited and since workers were flouting norms, the management decided to enforce a ban. The ban evoked a mixed response from the workers’ unions. While the INTUC-affiliated HEC Hatia Project Workers Union (HPWU) termed the notice as ‘improper’ and ‘ridiculous’, CITU-affiliated HEC Hatia Mazdoor Union (HMU) welcomed the ban and said it was a step taken in the right direction since many workers engaged in production were wasting their time by scrolling through social media, thereby adversely affecting production and productivity. “HEC is facing a serious cash crunch at the moment, which is affecting work orders adversely. Even the workers have not been paid for five months. In such trying times, workers are often found wasting time on smartphones. The ban will give a boost to production,” HMU Bhawan Singh president said. HPWU general secretary Rana Sangram Singh, on the other hand appealed to the HEC management to reconsider its decision. “I do not understand the rationale behind banning smartphones in the workplace. Everything today is done with the help of smartphones. Workers carry them to remain connected with the world outside. Though HEC has not prohibited basic phones, but workers cannot buy two or more phones for themselves and incur additional expenses,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hec-bans-staff-from-carrying-smartphones-to-work/articleshow/86274424.cms||Tapas Biswas

While Saurabh Patel had contested from the city, he did not belong to Vadodara. Before Saurabh Patel, it was Nalin Bhatt and Jaspal Singh who were made cabinet ministers. They were together in the cabinet too, but later it was Singh who remained a minister till 2001 when he was dropped from the cabinet. Singh had quit the BJP only to rejoin the party later. After Singh, MLAs like Bhupendra Lakhawala, Jitendra Sukhadia and Yogesh Patel had made it to the ministry but only as ministers of state. Rajendra Trivedi who has now been made cabinet minister was named a minister of state with independent charge in 2016. Trivedi became Assembly Speaker in his second term as a MLA, but the city did not get a cabinet minister. However, all that seems to have been forgotten with Trivedi’s appointment. Sources said that it was for the first time that a MLA from the city took oath as a minister immediately after the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cabinet-rank-for-barodian-after-20-yrs/articleshow/86272310.cms||Sachin Sharma

The court made the observations while passing the interim order staying the operation of Rule 9 (1) and (3) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. Pointing out that a similar order has also been passed by the Bombay high court, the bench said, “Indeed, there may have been no need to pass an independent order. However, it is submitted on behalf of the petitioners that notwithstanding the order passed by the Bombay HC, which ought to have a pan-India effect, notices have been issued to the petitioners subsequently requiring them to adhere to the rules.” The issue pertains to two separate pleas moved by vocalist T M Krishna and Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) challenging the rules. It must be recorded with all fairness that the additional solicitor general representing the Union accepts that the order of the Bombay high court has a pan-India effect, the court added. The issue pertains to two separate pleas moved by vocalist T M Krishna and Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) challenging the rules. Krishna contended that the rule is ultra vires the parent act — the Information Technology Act — besides imposing arbitrary, vague and unreasonable restrictions on digital news media and social media intermediaries. “The code of ethics contained in Part II of the rules is likely to create a chilling effect on speech, where creators of content will self-censor themselves and produce art that is acceptable to the state, rather than art which, otherwise legitimate, pushes the boundaries of societal, religious, political and cultural norms,” Krishna said. He added that the rules offend his right as an artist and a cultural/political commentator by imposing a chilling effect on free speech and by impinging on his right to privacy. On its part, association said two provisions of the rules immediately offended the association. It particularly questioned the legality of Rule 16, which is an omnibus provision giving power to the secretary of the Union ministry of information and broadcasting to block public access to any digital information. HC forms panel to refund investors:The Madras HC on Wednesday formed a panel under retired Justice NKirubakaran to return money deposited by investors in a dairy firm. Counsel said there were 45,167 depositors and maturity amount would be Rs 222 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/madras-high-court-bats-for-freedom-of-media-stays-operation-of-new-it-rule/articleshow/86279941.cms||Suresh Kumar

The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu made the observation on Thursday while disposing of a batch of PILs alleging that the cause of death wais not being appropriately recorded in death certificates, particularly in case of deaths caused by the pandemic. When the plea came up for hearing, government pleader P Muthukumar submitted a status report on behalf of the principal secretary, health and family welfare department. In the report, the officer referred to the guidelines issued for Covid deaths by the Union health ministry pursuant to orders of the Supreme Court. It was indicated that based on the guidelines, the state government has instructed all collectors to form district level committees, consisting of the additional district collector, the chief medical officer, and the dean or joint director of medical and rural health services in addition to an expert, for the issuance of the official document in the format as suggested by the Union. Recording the submission, the bench said: “It is hoped that the guidelines are strictly adhered to and the district level committee should ensure that in case of deaths which have happened on or prior to August 31, the appropriate certificates in accordance with the relevant guidelines are issued by October 31.”In the event the certificates are not issued within time or on some other untenable excuse, it will be open to the individuals affected thereby to raise the grievance before the appropriate forum in accordance with law, the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fresh-covid-death-certificate-must-be-given-in-one-month-says-high-court-to-tamil-nadu/articleshow/86279962.cms||---

The meeting was called to introduce changes in the association’s constitution and pass them. A lawyer named Harshad Parmar had, however, appealed to the Bar Council of Gujarat (BCG) against the meeting stating that they cannot take any policy decision now as the current office-bearers’ got an extension in their terms owing to the pandemic. The chairman of BCG had stayed the meeting and asked the BBA to respond by October 3. BBA’s president Hasmukh Bhatt shot off a letter to the BCG chairman calling his order illegal. Bhatt’s letter stated that BBA is an autonomous and independent body and it cannot be governed by BCG. The meeting, which took place as planned at the advocate house in the district court campus, saw fireworks from the beginning as soon as the new constitution was introduced. Several members of the lawyers’ body opposing the meeting tore copies of the constitution and majority of the lawyers walked out. Bhatt said that the constitution was passed by the association. “The meeting should not have taken place and the office-bearers should not have introduced the constitution,” Parmar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bar-associations-egm-turns-stormy/articleshow/86272367.cms||---

"We've seen a missing person's report about an Indian national missing in Kabul. We're in touch with all concerned. We've seen reports about local authorities undertaking investigation," said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. "We'll continue to monitor the situation and tell you of any developments," he added. The spokesperson was responding to queries about whether or not India had established contact with the Taliban on the issue. When specifically asked whether Arendeh is an Indian national, Bagchi said, "I am given to understand that he is an Indian citizen but we are also checking that part". Reports said Arendeh's family lives in Faridabad, and he has been engaged in business in Kabul for the last two decades.

How can they enjoy it if they fall sick,” asked the governor, participating in an event in Puducherry. Civil rights' activists termed Tamilisai's comment 'unconstitutional' and cited a high court order that declared that the state cannot deny welfare schemes to the people, who have not taken the Covid vaccination. “I never said it was mandatory,” the governor told TOI. “Two months ago, I told govt servants that before they get their salaries, they should have taken the vaccination. I said 18+ students taking their examinations should have their vaccination certificates. My view is that everyone should take their shots,” she said. At least 65% of the adult population in the Union Territory have taken their shots, said the governor. “In two weeks’ time we hope the entire UT would be vaccinated,” she said. Flagging off a cycle expedition on Thursday to create awareness among the public to get vaccinated for Covid-19 infection, the governor urged the people to extend support to the vaccination drive and make Puducherry a 100% vaccinated territory before October 2. "I strongly object to this arbitrary move by the lg. This is unconstitutional. A high court has held that the state cannot deny welfare measures for such whims. Several poor people depend on these government schemes," said civil rights' activist Saurav Das. Das cited a Manipur high court order, which said, "State cannot seek to impose conditions upon the citizens so as to compel them to get vaccinated, be it by holding out a threat or by putting them at a disadvantage for failing to get vaccinated." "For the past one week, the vaccination drive has slackened in the Union Territory. As a doctor I am worried. The core of my talk was that if it is necessary, compel people, plead or persuade them to take their vaccination. Don’t interpret it as if it is something undemocratic. This is for the good of the people,” said the governor, adding that the number of cases were increasing again in Puducherry and that 95% of those admitted to ICU with Covid had not been vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/puducherry-governor-tamilisai-soundararajan-tones-down-covid-vaccination-message/articleshow/86280024.cms||---

The foreign ministry said the report reflected how Pakistan continued to undertake activities against India from the US. Ahead of PM Narendra Modi's visit to the US next week, India also expressed concern over reports of growing anti-India activities of Khalistani separatist groups. MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said ensuring the security of the PM and his delegation was an important issue when asked about reports that a banned Khalistani group was planning to hold protests in Washington and New York during Modi's visit to the two cities. On the Hudson Institute report, Bagchi said it made clear how Pakistan had continued its efforts in trying to undertake activities against India, including terrorism. "It was very focused about activities they are taking in American soil. I hope authorities in the US will understand the risks," Bagchi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/take-note-of-pak-backed-jk-groups-in-us-biden-govt-told/articleshow/86280027.cms||---

Concerned over plastic waste ruining the forests and damaging the eco-system, a group of youngsters from the city have initiated ‘Mission Clean Forest’ campaign in the state. “We started our campaign from Jambughoda forest as it is one of the most popular spots for tourists and trekkers. A week ago, we collected about 550 kilogramme plastic and thermocol waste within a day from Jambughoda sanctuary. We are yet to cover a vast area,” said Siddharth Amin, who runs the Life With Wildlife Foundation. “It was so disturbing to see even interiors forest areas littered with non-biodegradable waste. People who have been frequenting this forest either for religious purposes or for trekking, dispose waste carelessly. Most of the waste gets covered up by shrubs and remain invisible. Plastic and thermocol waste is damaging the eco-system,” Amin said, adding that his team keeps visiting Jambughoda forests to help the tribals. “We donate clothes, crayons, lunch boxes and study material every year. Once we gain their trust, we educate them about the importance of wildlife and urge them not to kill reptiles or wild animals. During our visits, we saw garbage in the forests and then decided to act. The forest department too is giving us all the support,” Amin told TOI. Currently, a group of about 75 youngsters including students from Parul University, members of Canine Group, Rotary Club of Baroda Greens and Shri Dhwarkamai Charitable Trust have joined Mission Clean Forest campaign. “The plastic waste we collect is handed over to ‘Kachre se Azadi’, an NGO that sends it for recycling. Our next target is to clear Ratanmahal forests of the plastic waste and gradually we will take this campaign to different forests in Gujarat,” Amin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-youngsters-aim-to-free-jambughoda-forests-of-plastic-waste/articleshow/86272408.cms||Tushar Tere

At least 23 of the 38 districts in the state reported an increase in new cases on Thursday compared to their Wednesday tally. “We are at the baseline of the second wave, but for nearly two months we have been trying to push down the number of new cases reported under the four-digit mark,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “With more relaxations we are seeing newer clusters and a marginal increase in positivity rate in several districts. This has slowed down the drop rate drastically,” he said. At the peak of the second wave on May 21, the state reported more than 36,000 cases, but a month later, on June 21, fresh cases dropped to around 7500 cases a day. By July 21, around 1800 cases. “Cases have been going up and down in at least 20 districts. While Chennai and Coimbatore are a cause for concern, districts in Delta region have also been reporting an increase in positivity rate,” he said. On Thursday, cases in Coimbatore came down from 224 to 206, but the district grabbed the slot for the district with the highest number of cases on Thursday. After Coimbatore, Chennai reported the highest number of new cases. The district reported 202 new cases compared to 226 on Wednesday – the steepest decline in the last 24 hours. Chengalpet (135), Erode (134), Tiruppur (110) and Thanjavur (108) reported more than 100 cases each. Thanjavur reported the sharpest increase from 72 new cases on Wednesday to 108 on Thursday. However, 15 districts reported fewer than 20 cases each of which five of them reported cases in single digits. With six cases each, Perambalur and Theni were at the bottom of the fresh cases list. The 25 deaths took the cumulative toll to 35,271. Meanwhile, 2.2 lakh people took vaccines on Thursday taking the dosage tally to 3.9 crore at the government vaccination centres. The number of vaccinations in private hospitals since May 1 touched 23.31 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/23-districts-in-tamil-nadu-report-rise-in-covid-19-cases/articleshow/86280035.cms||---

---||Goa||68 Covid deaths submitted late by South hospital added to tally||PANAJI: The 68 deaths added to the state’s Covid-19 mortality count, which were reported late by the South Goa district hospital (SGDH), were mostly cases of those brought dead during the devastating second wave of the pandemic. State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar told TOI that they were all medico-legal cases that were directly taken to the mortuary. On clarification with hospital authorities at the SGDH, TOI was told that they were people who were brought dead to the hospital and who tested positive after their swab sample was tested for Covid-19. “All medico-legal case deaths are certified by a forensic medical doctor,” a hospital authority said. Although the health bulletin states that the 68 deaths reported were for the period from August 2020 to June 2021, a majority took place during the second wave from March to June, when people were being brought dead to hospital. They also include victims of accidents who were found to be positive. “This happened during the peak of the second wave and by the time the test reports of the deceased were received, it was already four days or more and we were concerned about saving the living at that time when there were issues of oxygen, nurses and overload of patients. But these deaths too have to be added to the census and they have to be able to receive compensation,” an official said. Incidentally, the number of deceased also includes those brought dead to the old Hospicio and the ESI hospital. An official said there was duplication that took time to be corrected, and that the SGDH has been trying to set the record straight. Several relatives of Covid-19 victims, who fit the criteria for receiving compensation, have been going to the SGDH to collect the document certifying the cause of death. “These cases fall under the purview of the police and the hospital had overlooked them. They are not technically clinical deaths as they have not died from treatment at the hospital. These medico-legal cases will also be allowed to apply for compensation if they fulfil the criteria of income, etc,” a doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/68-covid-deaths-submitted-late-by-south-hosp-added-to-tally/articleshow/86274838.cms||---

The waste generated is being utilised to produce manure. Salkar told TOI, “The flowers used while performing pooja are not discarded in public places as it is believed that they are sacred and should not be trampled upon. So people earlier started throwing it in the water which was creating water pollution. Here we are providing them the option of getting rid of the waste in a fruitful manner. This material will be used as raw material for producing manure.” Three teams of 10-15 volunteers are stationed at three locations, Baina beach, Khariawada beach and Vaddem lake. The teams keep bags near the immersion point and devotees also help by dropping waste into these bags. The teams also collect any other material thrown around and help keep the spot clean. Salkar said, “The segregated flowers are sent to the vermicomposting unit of Murgaon Education Society (MES) college where the flowers are treated and converted into manure. Last few years I have been collecting it and distributing it for free of cost to people. In this way we try to give back to the nature what we have taken from it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/70-bags-of-nirmalya-to-be-composted/articleshow/86274903.cms||Ruvina Khan

As his family hoped that one day he may return through one of the goodwill repatriations from both sides, Hamza died in jail in June. The death certificate issued by the Gujarat government mentions the date of registration of his death as September 9. But Hamza died on June 13, says the same certificate. The mortal remains were repatriated four months later on September 15. His body was taken to his home in Karachi, over 1,200km from Wagah border. TOI has access to the documents related to Hamza from both the sides. The death certificate issued by the Gujarat government’s health department mentions that Hamza died at Bhuj’s civil hospital on June 13. An emergency passport was issued in Hamza’s name by the Pakistani government to facilitate the crossover of his body from Wagah. The ministry of interior in Pakistan wrote to the prisons department in Lahore for handing over the body to the ambulance operator for taking it to Karachi. TOI contacted his daughter-in-law Raziya Jafar in Karachi as his son Jafar Alam was out. “We came to know about his death only a month ago. Someone, perhaps from the government, came to our house asking if we were related to Amir Hamza and said he was no more,” said Raziya. “He was arrested four years ago. There are others like him in the jail too. Finally, when we got his body, it was strapped in such a way that we could not even see his face,” she said. Saeed Baloch, the general secretary of Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum, said they came to know through a clipping that a fisherman died in Indian jail. “After that started the correspondence to get the mortal remains back. The procedure can be made faster from both the sides,” he said. There are 90 Pakistani fishermen in Indian jails and 500 Indians in Pakistan, he said. “The entire procedure here takes too much time to ascertain the person’s identity. Hamza was a Bengali immigrant and, hence, did not even have the Pakistani identity card. Earlier, there was a judicial commission which took up such cases, but there have been no appointments since 20188,” Baloch said. Explaining the process, Bhuj SP Saurabh Singh said there is a laid down procedure for such cases. The matter has to be taken up with the state’s ministry of home, which takes it up with the Union home ministry. The latter then takes up the issue with the foreign country, which follows its own procedure of identifying the person and taking him/her back. Singh said Hamza was the last to be sent. In some cases, the last rites happened in India itself. Baloch said Hamza was from a poor family and could not afford the burial expenses. Three of his sons could not attend the last rites as they were away in the sea for fishing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/4-mths-after-his-death-pak-fishermans-body-finally-reaches-home/articleshow/86275088.cms||Shishir Arya

A circular issued by the general administration department stated that passport to citizens, including government employees, is issued on the basis of verification carried out by the CID. "The current system does not contain any mechanism as would help denying the passport to such employees who are either under suspension or facing departmental inquiry or prosecution on account of serious charges," it read. A government employee will have to inform his employer to apply for a passport. The circular said the guidelines for obtaining passport have been reviewed by the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions, department of personnel & training, in consultation with the central vigilance commission and ministry of external affairs earlier this year. Elaborate instructions have been issued for obtaining fresh vigilance clearance to government employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-vigilance-clearance-must-for-jk-staff-to-obtain-passport/articleshow/86280192.cms||---

The tsunami of transformation capped a frenetic six days for the state, starting with Rupani’s sudden resignation as CM last Saturday and the even more surprising elevation of first-time MLA Bhupendra Patel to the chief ministership. The writing was on the wall for Team Rupani on Wednesday given the no-repeat formula (reported by TOI on Sept 16) even as most of them spent the day trying to lobby with the state BJP leadership in a last-ditch attempt to save their places. While the swearing-in had to be postponed by a day amid murmurs of discontent, even that rare episode of discord in the party did not alter the central leadership’s resolve to prop up a new team of netas to lead Gujarat into the 2022 assembly polls. The overhaul is being bandied about as an attempt to wipe out any anti-incumbency sentiment after BJP’s more than two-decade stint in Gujarat. In trying to build BJP’s bulwark against the possibility of voter fatigue, veterans like former deputy CM Nitin Patel, Pradipsinh Jadeja, Saurabh Patel, Bhupendrasinh Chudasama and Kaushik Patel — each with decades of experience in government — found themselves swept away by the sweeping tides of change. Of the 24 new ministers sworn in on Thursday,10 are of cabinet rank. Five of the14 ministers of state have been given independent charge. Like the CM himself, almost a dozen of these ministers are first-time MLAs. The new-look ministry has two women — tribal MLA Nimisha Suthar and Manisha Vakil. Gujarat experiment ‘bid to create positive effect before ’22 polls’The only three members of the Patel cabinet with prior experience of running ministries are Kiritsinh Rana, Rajendra Trivedi and Raghavji Patel. The induction of Raghavji along with two Congress turncoats, Jitu Chaudhary and Brijesh Merja, is perceived to be a move to douse the resentment that had erupted over the removal of three other turncoats – Kunvarji Bavaliya, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja and Jawahar Chavda. Region-wise, the heft of central and south Gujarat in the Patel cabinet grew to 15 ministers, compared to nine in the Rupani government. Saurashtra-Kutch’s share dropped from 10 to seven. The growing influence of south Gujarat is attributed to BJP state president CR Paatil, who hails from Navsari. In the new cabinet, caste equations have been rejigged to give more prominence to OBC and SC/ST communities. The number of OBC ministers jumped from four to six, while SC and ST representation rose from three to six. The surprise element in Patel being made CM resonated in the combination of the cabinet. Patel has kept most of the key portfolios that used to be held by Rupani. The relatively low-profile Kanubhai Desai was given arguably the most important portfolio: the finance department. Ex-speaker Rajendra Trivedi was given revenue, law and justice, and parliamentary affairs. The youngest minister, 36-year-old Harsh Sanghvi, was appointed minister of state for home. Jitu Vaghani was among the notable inclusions in the cabinet after a stint as state party president. The health department, formerly held by deputy CM Nitin Patel, went to another Patidar MLA, Rushikesh Patel, who represents Visnagar constituency of Mehsana district. Besides the CM, there are now six Patidar ministers in the government. The Rupani government had eight. Although the average age of the Patel ministry is 53, one new appointee — 70-yearold Kanu Desai — beat the age band apparently set by BJP. Political observers said PM Modi had first toyed with the “change is the only constant” theory in 2007 in a taluka panchayat election in Gondal. In 2010, he implemented the “no repeat” formula in the civic body elections in Ahmedabad and Surat. The GAS (Gondal-Ahmedabad-Surat) formula’s success in cutting down anti-incumbency spurred the determination to replicate it, albeit in a limited measure in successive assembly elections of 2012 and 2017, and even in the 2019 parliamentary elections, when many senior functionaries were denied tickets. “This experiment has consistently given results and has been implemented in the cabinet formation to create a positive impression among people before the 2022 elections,” a source said. “The aim is to negate any anti-incumbency and possible negativity due to allegations of the government’s mishandling of the Covid crisis.” BJP’s Gujarat in-charge Bhupendra Yadav told reporters that the composition of the Patel cabinet was in line with the party’s strategy of implementing a “new experiment of ensuring that new leadership is cultivated and continuity is ensured”. He denied there was any discontent in the ranks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/clarion-cull-24-new-faces-replace-entire-gujarat-cabinet/articleshow/86280206.cms||---

Candidate Zaidur Rahman in a Facebook post said “ei khela kintu sakalkei khelte hobe (everyone has to take part in the game)”, in an attempt to put pressure on Pradesh Congress president Adhir Chowdhury, who had announced that he would not campaign in Samserganj. Congress block president Sahidul Alam said: “You will soon see Zaidur saheb campaigning. He is going to win.” Chowdhury had fielded Zaidur, the twin brother of Trinamool Jangipur MP and Jangipur organisation district president Khalilur Rahman, as the party’s nominee. Zaidur later came under pressure from Khalilur over apprehensions that his contesting from Congress might affect their family bidi business. According to local partymen, Zaidur had agreed to fight on a Congress ticket after candidate Rejaul Karim died of Covid. Khalilur gave his brother the go-ahead in an attempt to curb the influence of Trinamool Jangipur MLA Amirul Islam. Khalilur changed his mind after TMC made him organisation president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/veterans-visit-changes-cong-samserganj-nominees-mind/articleshow/86275759.cms||Sukumar Mahato

AIKSCC said that despite investments and good yields, farmers in the state were not getting a good price for their produce. Input costs, on the other hand, were increasing beyond their means. “CM Banerjee has extended her support to the farmers’ movement on several occasions. We are requesting the CM to enact minimum support price for farmers,” said Avik Saha, national secretary of AIKSCC. “We are putting pressure on the Centre for MSP for essential commodities. But that can’t ensure the correct price for produce like potato, tomato, brinjal or leafy vegetables. The state government will have to ensure that,” Saha added. “We have sent a letter to the CM. She had earlier made her stand against the farm laws clear. Now, we are requesting her to take measures to ensure better price for farmers. The state does not have any law regarding that,” said Pradip Singh Thakur, member of AIKSCC’s Bengal chapter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/farmers-body-seeks-msp-law-in-bengal/articleshow/86275623.cms||Rohit Khanna

Investigators probing post-poll murder cases, as part of court-ordained inquiry, questioned Sufian, one of the accused in the case, at the Kolkata Port guesthouse in Haldia. After the questioning, Sufian claimed vendetta by BJP, particularly party leader Suvendu Adhikari. “There is a conspiracy to frame me though I am in no way connected to the incident. I said what I had to say. I understand this is a court-ordained inquiry. There is a political conspiracy behind Maity’s death. BJP and particularly Suvendu Adhikari are into nasty politics,” he said. Sufian added he was a target because he happened to be the chief election agent for CM Mamata Banerjee in the Nandigram poll. “I am being victimized. I am not afraid because I am a soldier of Mamata Banerjee,” he said. CBI investigators recorded Sufian’s statement and would match it with statements from a few local witnesses. In another development, CBI reached Farakka and Asansol to question CISF officials in connection with the illegal coal mining case. Two CISF officials, CBI believe, were hand in glove with prime accused Anup Maji. CBI teams conducted raids at Satgram area of a nationalised coal company and Sugam Park residence at Kalyanpur in Asansol. Another team conducted searches in Farakka.

On Thursday, a division bench of acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj observed: “We have received a communication from Justice Manjula Chellur graciously stating that she is not inclined to receive the honorarium fixed by the court.

---||Kolkata||Mamata: Destiny brought me back to Bhowanipore||Kolkata: In a first of its kind “homely meeting” with a select group of Hindi-speaking residents from across communities in Bhowanipore, chief minister Mamata Banerjee appealed to them to uphold the unique tradition of India and Bengal where people of various religions, dialects and communities live together and stand by each other. The CM added that destiny had brought her back to Bhowanipore. “In a family, there are members of different ages and professions. Bengal too is like a family where people of different caste and community live together. But just like in a family, I don’t see any difference between them. I eat litti as well as dhokla; I eat khandvi as well as halwa; I eat cake and at the same time Jagannath’s bhog. I eat every food and mix with everyone,” Banerjee told the 200-strong gathering at Uttam Udyan in Padmapukur. “There is no difference in the colour of blood between me and you. Just our language and customs are a bit different. But we love each tradition and celebrate them together,” she added. Speaking in her trademark Bengali-laced Hindi, Banerjee also touched on the nationalism quotient, which BJP tries to introduce into every election. “My father was a freedom fighter and his words instilled patriotism in me from childhood. I believe the motherland comes before me. I will not allow my country to become Taliban or Pakistan. I will fight for my nation till my last blood. India is maa for someone, amma for someone else and mother for another,” she said as the crowd cheered. Many who were not allowed into the park due to the poll panel-mandated Covid protocol gathered outside or stood on their balconies and at windows to hear Banerjee’s 35-minute speech. She apologized for not being able to organize a roadshow or public rally. “This year, people in Nandigram requested me to contest from there and so I gave in to their request. Sovanda (Sovandeb Chattopadhyay) had also not contested from his home constituency for long. So I sacrificed this constituency for him just like soldiers sacrifice their life for motherland. But my heart was always here in Bhowanipore. I am happy I can contest from Bhowanipore again. It is destiny; if you have to be chief minister, you will have to be from Bhowanipore,” she said. Tapping the sentiments of the business community invited to the meet, Banerjee brought up the issues of demonetization and lockdown. “During demonetization, I went to Burrabazar every day and met traders to ensure they were not harassed by unnecessary raids. I didn’t even call curfews during Covid to ensure business wasn’t hampered. There is only night curfew,” she said. She also touched upon multiple issues of BJP-ruled states such as the UP government using Bengal flyover photographs in its advertisements and her banners being torn in Ahmedabad. Banerjee wrapped up by seeking the blessing of “ek vote” from everyone at the meeting and signed off with shayari and title track of the 1996 Bollywood movie ‘Agnee Prem’: “Roshni chand se hota hai sitaro se nahi, mohabbat humare saath apka hota hai aur kisi se nahi”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-destiny-brought-me-back-to-bhowanipore/articleshow/86276318.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Priyanka sparks row with EC remark||Kolkata: BJP’s Bhowanipore candidate Priyanka Tibrewal ran into controversy while campaigning on Thursday by making a remark on the Election Commission that didn’t go down well with her party colleagues. Responding to a question on the show-cause letter the poll panel sent her the day before for allegedly violating EC campaign protocol, Tibrewal said: “I get many such notices. I get 100 notices, read 150 and tear off 200.” Trinamool state secretary Kunal Ghosh found the BJP candidate’s remark “condescending” and “derogatory”. “This is BJP culture,” he said. Tibrewal later clarified she had all respect for Election Commission. She said she was talking about “legal notices” she got as a lawyer. Earlier in the day, Tibrewal traded words with plainclothes policemen, who shadowed her during campaigning following the EC letter. She snubbed a police officer when he tried to explain that they were there for her security. “I haven’t sought security from Kolkata Police. Either come in uniform or stay 50 metres away from me. Otherwise people will take snapshots of the 15-20 people behind me and lodge a complaint with EC,” Tibrewal said. While on a door-to-door campaign, Tibrewal faced some questions from a Trinamool supporter. “The National Crime Records Bureau report has called Kolkata a safe city. Can you deny this when you are talking about violence and violence against women?” the person said. Tibrewal said the post-poll violence happened in Bengal after the NCRB compiled its report. In the afternoon, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said the party would conduct campaigns in keeping with EC guidelines. Also, Ghosh went on the offensive about the NCRB report. “Fact is the state has not been sending crime data for the last two years. Despite this, Bengal stands out in the NCRB report on account of violence against women and children,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/priyanka-sparks-row-with-ec-remark/articleshow/86276361.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata private hospitals slam brakes on Swasthya Sathi admissions||KOLKATA: Admission of patients under the Swasthya Sathi (SS) scheme — a subsidized state government insurance plan that offers coverage of up to Rs 5 lakh a year — has been stalled at several city private hospitals which have “ run out of beds” to accommodate these patients. While some say their SS wards are full, others claim they are not in a position to admit more patients under the scheme due to financial and space constraints. Some hospitals also say that due to the low rates of the scheme, doctors often refuse to treat or operate upon SS patients, which is why they are forced to keep the number of these patients small. Most city hospitals have earmarked a certain number of beds for the scheme, which have been squeezed in recent weeks with a sharp rise in the number of non-Covid patients who had delayed treatment due to the pandemic. Majority of these patients are covered by non-Swasthya Sathi insurance. Fortis Hospital, for instance, has stopped admitting patients — both Covid and non-Covid — under the scheme. No official reason has been offered for the decision. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has 30 SS patients admitted currently and isn’t admitting any new ones. “The number has been hovering between 30-40 for the last several months but we have no ICU vacancy for SS patients now. While this is one of the reasons for not admitting more SS patients, the number has never crossed 40 at our hospital,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. Belle Vue Clinic, too, has stopped SS admissions after taking in 22 patients. “If vacancies happen and we believe we have the resources to cater to these patients, we might admit more. But at the moment, we are saturated,” said a Belle Vue official. AMRI Hospitals has 60 beds earmarked for SS across its three units at Dhakuria, Salt Lake and Mukundapur. The wards are currently “overflowing” with around 75 admitted under this category. It is putting a strain on the resources of the hospitals, which is why on-the-spot admissions have been stopped, said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. “We are not in a position to admit more since the clinical charges of Swasthya Saathi are not feasible for us. Patients are being asked to return after 3-7 days. That apart, delay in insurance payment has also put us under strain. While previously, it would be made in 20 days, now we are having to wait for 45-60 days,” said Barua. Peerless Hospital currently has 38 SS patients and has no further vacancy. “Patients seeking admission will now have a substantial waiting period,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. Some like RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), however, have kept its doors open for SS patients, despite a 90% occupancy now. “We have more than 60 SS patients admitted now and have no plans to stop admissions,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Admissions under the scheme would have been easier had the rates been rationalized, felt Rupak Barua, also the president of Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) . “We had appealed to the state government to rationalize the charges and are still waiting for a response,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-slam-brakes-on-swasthya-sathi-admissions/articleshow/86277089.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Police officials claim he jumped in front of a train and ended his life. While his death led to celebrations in Saidabad area, where the crime was committed, netizens trolled the police on social media for not being able to nab the accused for a week after he committed the crime. Some also wondered if the accused was first killed and later his body was dumped on the tracks. On Tuesday, Telangana labour minister Malla Reddy had referred to the rape-murder as “terrible” and had been quoted in news reports as saying, “There should be an encounter against him. He will definitely be caught. Will do encounter. There is no question of leaving him.” He later told TOI that he had been misquoted and that what he had actually said was that laws should be enacted to “encounter the culprits (sic)”. The girl was raped and murdered on September 9. Her her body was found wrapped in a bedsheet in the accused’s shanty. The brutal crime had led to angry protests in Saidabad and candlelight vigils in parts of the city. Police officials say that on Thursday morning, locals and railway employees had spotted the 30-year-old man walking along the railway tracks, about three km from Jangaon station. They told police officials that around 8.30 am, the suspect jumped before the Secunderabad-bound Konark Express travelling at more than 100 km an hour, killing himself instantly. About an hour later, director general of police M Mahendar Reddy tweeted: “#Attention-Please: The accused of “Child Sexual Molestation and murder @ Singareni Colony, found dead on the railway track, in the limits of #StationGhanpurPoliceStation.

The Government Railway Police registered a case of suspicious death. “Yes, it’s a case of suicide,” said a GRP official. Railway gangman T Kumar told reporters that he first noticed the man moving suspiciously near the tracks. Kumar says he also noticed that the man resembled the rape and murder suspect. When he asked the suspect who he was, he gave evasive answers and slipped into the agriculture fields nearby. Kumar was then joined by another lineman Sarangapani. “We both started walking along the tracks. When we came across some villagers, we alerted them about the presence of a stranger, who looked similar to the person wanted in Saidabad,” Sarangapani said. A few minutes later, a villager identified as Suresh claimed he saw a train approaching and the suspect standing close to the tracks. “I raised an alarm, but he ignored me and jumped in front of the moving train,” he said. The family members confirmed his identity.

A four-month-old boy, Mangal Dom, admitted to Malda Medical College and Hospital (MMCH) with fever and respiratory distress, died on Thursday morning. Seven-month-old Ifraj Sk from Chandipur and three-year-old Aditya Mandal from Habibpur had died at the same hospital on Wednesday. Amid allegations of negligence from bereaved families, doctors said patients had outnumbered beds at the state hospital. The 120-bed paediatric ward is currently caring for 164 children, all with the common symptom of fever, which some doctors believe may be an indicator of an outbreak of seasonal influenza along with pneumonia. While a doctor in the MMCH paediatric department said 10 children were critical, medical college principal Partha Pratim Mukherjee said there was no need for panic. “The children who died were already critical when brought in. We are nevertheless looking into the causes behind their deaths,” Mukherjee said. The hospital has formed a team of child specialists to get to the bottom of things. At Raiganj Medical College, 16 children have been admitted with what doctors there believe is an outbreak of “viral pneumonia”. However, the authorities said the situation was under control. In Purulia, 237 children have been admitted to Deben Mahato Government Medical College and Hospital, which has only 80 beds. The hospital is being forced to accommodate two or more kids in every bed. A seven-member medical board has been formed in Purulia. Director of health services Ajay Chakrabarty ruled out any “specific outbreak” and said: “Experts from North Bengal Medical College have visited Jalpaiguri district hospital (which has reported cases too). Laboratory tests have confirmed a host of causes behind the fever, including influenza, RS virus, dengue and certain respiratory illnesses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mystery-fever-claims-3-kids-in-malda-in-24-hours/articleshow/86275633.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

When she raised an alarm, he fled from the spot,” ACP, Goshamahal, M Narender Reddy said. The accused is a member of an orchestra troupe. Based on a complaint from the girl’s mother, police registered a case and launched a manhunt. After going through the CCTV camera footage, officials found that the accused spotted the girl walking alone near her house. He took advantage of the situation and raped her, police said. “From CCTV footage, we identified the accused. Our teams later arrested him from the same locality,” west zone joint commissioner AR Srinivas said. The girl was sent for a medical examination. Based on the doctor’s opinion, a rape case was registered. At around midnight on Wednesday, the girl’s mother went to the police to complain against her ‘abusive’ husband.

Health officials claimed that over 50% of the eligible population in Uttar Pradesh is now vaccinated with at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. According to data from the CoWin Portal updated till 10 pm, 7.51 crore people in the state have taken at least one dose of the vaccine. This is over 50% of the total vaccination target of 15.04 crore eligible people. The fully vaccinated population of the state reached 1.55 crore which is about 10% of the target. The total number of doses administered in the state now stands at 9.06 crore. In terms of age groups, 5.10 crore doses have been administered in the 18 plus category, while 2.48 crore doses have been provided to people in the 45 to 60 age group. Also, 1.47 crore doses have been given to the elderly. ‘For herd immunity, 80% of total popn must be vaxed’Experts said that recent researches conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have indicated that even a single dose of the vaccine provides up to 96% protection against covid-19 mortality and hospitalisation. But they said that both the doses were needed to strengthen the shield further. They also stated that to be able to achieve the desired levels of herd immunity, over 75-80% of the total target population needs to be vaccinated. An official statement said that despite being the most populous state, Uttar Pradesh is racing past other Indian states in attempting to mitigate the anticipated third wave of Covid-19 infections through vaccination. It added that in line with the instructions given by CM Yogi Adityanath, the health department is conducting a vaccination drive on war-footing. In addition to the regular work, it is holding mega vaccination campaigns to accelerate the target. Meanwhile, 24 new positive cases and 11 recoveries were reported from across the state in the past 24 hours. The official Covid-19 bulletin indicated that the new cases were reported from 14 districts. Upon adjusting the new cases and recoveries, the state is left with 193 active infections across 43 districts. The remaining 32 districts are free from the pandemic infection. Health officials warned the people against carelessness especially after the incessant rain on Thursday and advised strictest adherence to the covid-19 prevention protocol as the risk of infection was still prevalent. They reiterated that the pandemic virus could take lives and added that so far 22,886 persons have died because of Covid-19 in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/half-of-uttar-pradeshs-eligible-population-has-taken-at-least-one-dose/articleshow/86280229.cms||---

In terms of family background, over 29,000 juveniles lived with their parents and 76% of those apprehended were in the age group of 16 years to 18 years. The data shared in the Crime in India 2020 report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) is telling as it shows that 9,252 of the juveniles in conflict with law had education just up to primary level. The maximum number of juveniles (17,494) had studied up to matriculation and 4,966 had education up to higher secondary level. The data provides insights into the world of juvenile crime and while lack of education may not surprise, the fact that many lived with parents and were not street kids suggests households of low means often located in congested areas where kids are exposed to crime from a young age. ‘1,885 minors involved in 1,668 Pocso cases’A comparison with previous years shows that offences committed by juveniles declined by 7.8% in 2020 when compared to 2019 (32,269). The number of offences in 2018 was 31,591. In case of the stringent Protection of Children From Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, the data shows that 1,885 juveniles were involved in 1,668 offences against children. The age group data shows 41 of those apprehended were below 12 years. As many as 559 juveniles were between 12 to below 16 years. The maximum number of juveniles 1,285 of them were within 16 to below 18 years age group. The data also shows that among crimes under the IPC, there were 1,154 offences involving juveniles related to assault on women to outrage her modesty. Among IPC crimes, 842 cases related to murder and 981 were of attempt to murder. In the category of offences against public tranquillity, there were a total of 1,028 offences, including 875 cases of rioting and 122 linked to unlawful assembly. Juveniles were involved in offences under The Unlawful Activities Prevention Act in five cases and the NCRB data for 2020 records 260 cases under The Arms Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/only-3-juveniles-in-crime-studied-beyond-class-12/articleshow/86280275.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Kolkata||NIA team visits Arjun home, speaks to son over bomb attack||Barrackpore: A three-member NIA team, along with 14 forensic experts, visited Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh’s Majdoor Bhavan residence in Bhatpara, North 24 Parganas, on Thursday afternoon, two days after the agency took over investigations into the September 8 bomb attack on the BJP leader’s house. NIA officers spoke to Singh’s son, BJP’s Bhatpara MLA Paban Singh, in his absence and examined CCTV camera footage of the incident. The forensic team inspected splinter marks on the walls. “Two NIA officers spoke to me over the phone later. I narrated the incident in detail. I also spoke about the attacks on my house and me on at least 12 occasions. More NIA officers are likely to join the investigations,” the MP said. The national agency took over the probe after CRPF jawans on duty reported that a powerful bomb exploded near their bunker in front of Singh’s house. Three crude bombs had been hurled at the MP’s residence around 6.30am on that day. While one of the jawans had a close shave, the main gate was partly damaged. Singh had spoken to Union home minister Amit Shah after the attack, following which the MHA ordered the NIA investigation. Prior to that, the Barrackpore police commissionerate had arrested two persons, including a 16-year-old boy. A special NIA court on Wednesday directed the commissionerate to submit the case diary in three days and produce the accused on September 21, when the matter comes up again for hearing. On Wednesday, there was another explosion in Bhatpara, barely 200 metres from the MP’s residence. However, Jagaddal police said one of the bombs being stored on a vacant plot of land went off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nia-team-visits-arjun-home-speaks-to-son-over-bomb-attack/articleshow/86275739.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

---||Kolkata||Out of Rajya Sabha, Arpita may land TMC state post||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress’ Arpita Ghosh, who resigned from the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, is likely to be given by the party a state organisational post whose role “may not be limited to South Dinajpur”, a senior party leader said on Thursday. A day before resigning, Ghosh, in her letter to Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee on September 14, had said she “would be more interested” if she were given a role to “work for the party in Bengal even without being MP”. It is still unclear what party role she will be given. Ghosh didn’t respond to calls. Her sudden resignation (her RS tenure would have ended in April 2026) had taken everyone, including party colleagues, by surprise. Later, on Wednesday night, her letter to Abhishek was released by the party. In the letter, Arpita further said “her goal is clear that she would like to serve the people of Bengal under the leadership of chief minister Mamata Banerjee”. She added she felt she “would be in a better position to achieve this goal if she resigned as an MP, and return to Bengal to work directly for the people in the state”. Ghosh, a theatre actor-director, had won the Balurghat Lok Sabha seat in 2014 but lost in 2019. She was made Trinamool’s South Dinajpur president, a move that coincided with party heavyweight Biplab Mitra defecting to BJP. To Ghosh’s credit, she had doggedly fought back attempts to unseat Trinamool from the zilla parishad and municipalities. It was partly due to this and Mitra’s return to the Trinamool fold that Ghosh was given a Rajya Sabha berth in September 2021. Mitra is now a state cabinet minister. Given this backdrop, the party is largely expected to give Ghosh a state role and not limit it to South Dinajpur, sources said. Asked about the sudden resignation, a party leader said: “As per the one-person-one-post party rule, she cannot remain an MP and be given a state organisational role at the same time. Arpita is a dedicated party leader. She had expressed her desire to step down to Abhishek Banerjee on September 14 and only after the party agreed, she flew to Delhi to tender her resignation the next day.” The leader dismissed as “speculative” questions about whether the party had asked Ghosh to resign to make way for a new Rajya Sabha MP. Trinamool recently inducted several leaders who were MPs. Sushmita Dev has already earned an RS nomination. Former Union minister Yashwant Sinha is now a Trinamool vice-president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/out-of-rajya-sabha-arpita-may-land-tmc-state-post/articleshow/86275837.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||One last chance: SC allows PoP idols in Hyderabad's Hussainsagar||HYDERABAD: The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed immersion of Plaster of Paris (PoP) Ganesh idols in Hussainsagar in the city as a last chance while cautioning authorities that it would not be allowed from next year. The apex court order came after the state government sought a review of the HC ban on PoP idols’ immersion in lakes in city. A bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) N V Ramana accorded permission after obtaining an undertaking from the state government that it would abide by the HC judgment and also the Central Pollution Control Board directives from next year onwards. The state also assured that the remains of PoP idols would be removed immediately after the immersion process gets over. “We are interfering with the HC judgment to the limited extent of PoP idol immersions on the main Tank Bund for this year as the state and GHMC have said that it was not possible for them to make alternative arrangements at the last minute,” the SC bench said. All other curbs imposed by the HC would remain and the authorities have to follow them, the SC said, directing the state to file a compliance report before the HC. From next year onwards, even the making of PoP idols has been declared as unlawful by the high court in its earlier order. GHMC commissioner has assured the apex court that from next year they would make use of baby ponds for immersions. The CJI also appreciated advocate Mamidi Venu Madhav, the petitioner in the current case, for fighting to keep lakes clean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/one-last-chance-sc-allows-pop-idols-in-hyderabads-hussainsagar/articleshow/86280301.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Allahabad||Adults have right to choose their life partner irrespective of faith: Allahabad high court||PRAYAGRAJ: Observing that adults have the right to choose their life partner irrespective of the religion professed by them, the Allahabad high court on Thursday granted protection to an interfaith couple from Gorakhpur. In such a case, not even their parents could object to their relationship, the court further observed. Hearing a petition jointly filed by Shifa Hasan and her Hindu partner, a division bench comprising Justice Manoj Kumar Gupta and Justice Deepak Verma observed, “"It cannot be disputed that two adults have the right of choice of their matrimonial partner irrespective of the religion professed by them." "As the present petition is a joint petition by the two individuals who claim to be in love with each other and are major, therefore, in our considered opinion, nobody, not even their parents, could object to their relationship”, the court added in a judgment delivered on Thursday. In the joint petition, the petitioners' contention was that they are in love with each other and are living together on their own will. However, their relationship was not being accepted by some of their family members and they were disturbing their peaceful living. Ensure petitioners not harassed: HC to policeAfter hearing all sides at length, the court granted protection to the couple, saying that not even their parents could object to their relationship. Accordingly, the court directed the police authorities to ensure that the petitioners were not subjected to any harassment by the father of the girl or by any other person in connection with their relationship with each other. During the course of hearing, the petitioner - Hasan submitted before the court that she had also filed an application for conversion from Muslim to Hindu religion. According to him, on the said application, the district magistrate (DM) had called for a report from the police station concerned. As per the report, the boy's father was not agreeable to the marriage though his mother was ready for the same. Both parents of Hasan were opposed to the marriage. In view of the same, the couple approached the HC claiming that there was a threat to their lives. The Court took note of the fact that both the petitioners are major, aged 19 and 24 years respectively. Hence, the court proceeded to grant them protection, while clarifying that the order was not any final opinion regarding the age of the petitioners as the findings were only prima facie in nature for the purposes of deciding the issue regarding protection of life of the petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/adults-have-right-to-choose-life-partner-allahabad-high-court/articleshow/86280338.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||India||Australia-UK-US pact could be good news for India||NEW DELHI: India has reserved its response to the announcement of the new Australia-UK-US (AUKUS) trilateral security partnership, but New Delhi may have reason to be optimistic over the latest development in global security. The security trilateral will be a huge message to China. Most important, it will add to the global efforts to balance China in this region. It will augment the defence capabilities of Australia, which has graduated to become one of India’s closer strategic partners in the Indo-Pacific. Second, the new trilateral is likely to augment capabilities of the Quad, of which both the US and Australia are members. AUKUS will see Australia accessing nuclear submarines for the first time, amping up the defence quotient in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad is not a security grouping, so this brings a security adjunct to the Quad which is the diplomatic outreach to the Indo-Pacific by four democracies. For the present, the Quad and AUKUS will move on parallel tracks, with the possibility that in future, the two could merge. Australian PM, Scott Morrison tweeted, “Today, Australia begins an enhanced trilateral security partnership with the UK and the US to enable deeper cooperation on security and defence capabilities. This is an historic opportunity for our countries to strengthen our nations’ security in uncertain times.” Ashley Tellis, senior fellow at Carnegie, told TOI, “The AUKUS agreement is meant to build Australian capabilities to contribute to the military balancing of China. Nuclear submarines are our ace in the hole — they target China’s biggest vulnerabilities. So it’s a great investment.” The wrinkle in this stems from the bad blood generated between Australia and France, two of India’s big partners in the Indo-Pacific. France had signed a $40 billion deal to supply submarines to Australia in 2016. Now Australia has scrapped the deal, going with the UK and the US to build nuclear submarines. France is sore with both the US and Australia. This might impact the India-Australia-France trilateral for the time being, although the reasons for that trilateral remain as strong as ever.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/australia-uk-us-pact-could-be-good-news-for-india/articleshow/86280360.cms||Indrani Bagchi

The state is inoculating an average of 103 beneficiaries per session now as against 92-96 last month. In September so far, an average 7 lakh doses have been administered every day. Taking loss of dose quantity into account, Serum Institute of India’s 10-dose Covishield vial actually contains more than the required volume. In achieving ‘negative wastage’, vaccinators have been extracting and administering the extra quantity in the vials to cover more beneficiaries. Vaccination data shows that at least 16 districts, including Pune, have vaccinated more than 100 beneficiaries per session on average so far in the drive. Pune’s average was about 106 beneficiaries vaccinated per session around August 23, which increased to 112 by September 13. In Mumbai, the average vaccinations per session has increased from 158 beneficiaries earlier to 172 now. Other districts vaccinating an average 100-plus beneficiaries per session include Ahmednagar, Amravati, Aurangabad, Beed, Chandrapur, Jalgaon, Palghar, Nasik, Thane and Kolhapur. Maharashtra’s net wastage for Covishield so far has been -1.77% and 0.51% for Covaxin. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “The health department has been regularly telling low-performing districts to increase vaccinations per session.” Deshmukh said as per the original plan, districts were told to vaccinate a minimum of 100 beneficiaries per session. “However, several districts, including Pune, are now surpassing that number. In some sessions, Pune district has vaccinated over 3,000 beneficiaries on a single day during the mega-vaccination drives by deploying additional vaccinators. This was also possible since these sessions started early in the morning and continued till 9-10pm.” Deshmukh said an increase in vaccine supplies over the last one month also helped boost inoculations per session. “Pune’s average would have been much higher had sessions in private hospitals inoculated more people. The numbers being vaccinated in private hospitals has dropped considerably,” he said. Rajshree Patil, medical officer at Kamala Nehru Hospital, said, “Vaccinators are drawing more than 10 doses from each 10-dose vial. Competent vial use during each vaccination session has helped push up the number of beneficiaries to an average of 120 per session. Even if 10 vials are used per session, we end up vaccinating 110-120 beneficiaries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-optimises-use-of-vaccine-doses-no-wastage/articleshow/86280370.cms||Neha Madaan

Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will chair the 45th meeting, the first physical huddle after over 16 months. GST on fuel will help companies claim input creditThe all-powerful body, which decides on rates and policies for the new indirect tax regime and comprises state and Union finance ministers, has 18 major issues listed on the agenda. States, cutting across party lines, are seen to be reluctant to agree to shifting auto and aviation fuel to GST, away from the value added tax regime, as they will lose whatever control they have over revenues. After the introduction of GST in July 2017, states now have the power to decide on VAT on fuel along with excise on alcohol. During the Covid crisis, states, as well as the Centre, used the two groups of products to generate resources. From a consumer point of view, levying GST on fuel is unlikely to result in a sharp fall in taxes, which currently top 50%, but will help businesses get credit for tax paid on inputs. Although there is a high court order on the issue, the contentious compensation formula may also have a role to play and is sure to split the Council, which has been a divided house of late with Opposition-ruled states taking positions that are at variance with the Centre. The GST Council will also discuss extension of concessional levies on several Covidrelated drugs and products till December. Further, there are several items related to textiles, footwear and fertiliser where the Centre is seeking a correction in the inverted duty structure – where the finished product faces higher levies than inputs. While the issue has been on the agenda for over a year, the government is keen to get a resolution this time, sources said. The other aspect of recalibration of rates, something that the Centre had suggested in early 2020 has, however, been kept out of the agenda for the time being. Other matters under discussion are use of PAN card for registration under GST.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/how-long-do-you-want-to-keep-fuel-out-of-gst-centre-to-states/articleshow/86280395.cms||Sidhartha

Tharoor had reacted to Revanth’s barb in his own inimitable style in a tweet by calling the “unwarranted reaction” as “an expression of fraternal feeling.” But by then the audio clip of Revanth calling Tharoor a “gadha (donkey)” had gone viral on social media. KTR posted an audio clip of Revanth calling Tharoor a donkey and tweeted: “as the chairman of the IT standing committee, Shashi Tharoor had paid some compliments to the efforts of the state government recently, His colleague in parliament and PCC cheap calls him a donkey!!

Sources in the Congress said the party high command took a serious note of Revanth Reddy lashing out at a senior MP like Tharoor. There are already complaints against Revanth from his own party men about his language, tone and tenor.

This is the biggest ever trust board in the history of the world’s richest Hindu endowment body. The last trust board had a strength of less than 40 while the newly-formed board has 81 members including ex-officio members and special invitees. Incidentally, the TTD trust board’s strength exceeds that of the Union Cabinet by three members. The Union Cabinet has a strength of 78 including the prime minister. India Cements chairman N Srinivasan, My Home group chairman J Rameshwar Rao, Hetero group chairman B Pardhasaradhi Reddy were reappointed in the new TTD trust board. Cousin Telugu state Telangana is now represented by seven members against nine in the previous board. Sources said the state government had accommodated many VIPs under the special invitee category in view of the high demand for the board membership. With several influential devotees strongly lobbying for the berth in the trust board, the state government had decided to appoint more special invitees to give them the opportunity to serve the presiding deity of Tirumala. The state government issued three orders (GOs) constituting the TTD trust board. Earlier, it had appointed YV Subba Reddy, uncle of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, as the chairman of the trust board on August 8. Through the first order (GO Ms No 245), the state government constituted a 29-member trust board. It was followed by another order (GO Rt No 568) through which Tirupati MLA Bhumana Karunakar Reddy and Brahmin corporation chairman Sudhakar were appointed as special invitees. A third order was issued (GO RT No 569) through which 50 more special invitees were appointed to the trust board with privileges on par with the member trustees.

Responding to a query on an ICMR study that showed the anti bodies declined in around four months, Indian Council of Medicial Research (ICMR) director general Dr Balram Bhargava said measuring antibody level is not the only measure as an individual can have other kind of immunity such as cellular immunity, antibody immunity, mucosal immunity and these persist. “The important understanding is that full vaccination of both the doses is absolutely essential and there should be no breakage in that,” he said. So far, 62% of the total adult population above 18 has received at least one dose of Covid-vaccine, whereas 20% have got both doses, the government said. In September so far, the average daily vaccination stood at 74.4 lakh doses, up from 59.19 lakh in August. Some states and UTs like Lakshadweep, Chandigarh, Goa and Himachal Pradesh have achieved 100% coverage of first dose in their adult population. Sikkim has administered first dose to 99% of its adult people. Other states and UTs like Andaman & Nicobar, Dadar & Nagar Haveli, Ladakh, Uttarakhand and importantly Kerala which has seen a high number of cases, also have over 85% coverage of first dose in 18 plus population. The government aims to achieve a coverage of over 80% for first dose in adult population by October end and cover majority of this segment with both doses by end of this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/icmr-not-focusing-on-booster-at-present/articleshow/86280495.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Attention-seeking article, raises dead issues: Govt||NEW DELHI: The Centre condemned a recent New York Times article on India’s Covid response as “provocative, attention seeking” report published at a time when cases in India are low and vaccination is increasing. The article published earlier this week alleged that Indian scientists tailored science to suit the government’s optimistic narrative despite a looming crisis. “This is a provocative attention seeking article. This is published at a time when India is doing good, our vaccination is excellent and it is diverting attention. All the issues raised are dead ones and probably do not merit any attention,” Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Dr Balram Bhargava said. NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul also condemned the article. “We actually condemn this type of distorted out of context reporting. This is not desirable and it should not happen,” Dr Paul said. Officials maintained the Centre as well as state governments are focused on efforts to fight the pandemic and such reports can derail their energies. “We greatly value journalistic and editorial comment. At the same time we must also realise that all of us in the Union government as well as the state governments are fully engaged in fighting the pandemic and all our time and energy are devoted there. We cannot afford to be diverted by things that can be addressed at a later day, which are not a priority from the public health point of view,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/attention-seeking-article-raises-dead-issues-govt/articleshow/86280505.cms||---

The Solar Energy Corporation of India has already offered to supply 9,000mw solar power to the state which will help the agriculture sector get quality and uninterrupted power. It suggested that the state need not establish the solar power plant, and can instead buy power from SECI. The cabinet has accepted the proposal and decided to supply power to farmers at 2.49 per unit. The SECI said it would be able to give 3,000 mw power by 2024 and 9,000 mw by 2026. The cabinet also accepted the long-pending demand of beneficiaries who took loans from AP Housing Corporation since 1983, and proposed a one-time settlement. Beneficiaries in rural areas would have to pay 10,000, those in urban areas need to pay 15,000, while those staying in municipal corporation limits would have to pay 20,000 to get the loans cleared and avail ownership rights of their houses. The decision will benefit 56,67,301 families across the state. In cases where the houses have been purchased by second party from the original beneficiary, they can pay the minimum amount of 20,000 in rural areas, 30,000 in municipal areas, and 40,000 in municipal corporation areas to get the houses regularised. The beneficiaries can pay the required amount by December 30, 2021 and get the houses registered in their favour with ownership rights. Among other decisions, the cabinet has approved the proposal to form an organic certification authority to certify organic corps in the state. After bifurcation, AP farmers have to visit other states to get the certificates and this would solve their problems from now. The cabinet also approved the proposal for a sub-plan for minority communities on par with SCs and STs. Information and public relations minister Perni Venkatramayya said the cabinet has approved plans to hand over the vacant sites and buildings owned by the roads and buildings department to the APSRTC for commercial use. “The cabinet has also decided to ask LG Polymers to set up an environment-friendly industry in place of the present plastic industry at its premises in Vizag. Besides, the proposal has approved the proposal to extend a loan of 35,000 at 25 paise interest to woman beneficiaries of housing programme in Jagannana colonies. This is in addition to the state and central governments’ contributions for the programme,” minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/andhra-pradesh-cabinet-accepts-centres-solar-power-offer/articleshow/86280496.cms||Gopi Dara

India reported 34,671 new cases of the coronavirus (with Tripura’s data not received till midnight), the highest daily tally since 37,868 infections were detected last Friday, as per TOI’s Covid database. Kerala’s cases rose to 22,182, up from 17,681 on the previous day. The state had last reported 20,000-plus daily cases on Sunday. Despite Thursday’s spurt, Kerala’s seven-day average of daily cases continued to decline, falling below 20,000 to 19,505. This indicates that cases in the state are still dipping. Meanwhile, Mizoram reported 1,402 new cases, the third-highest daily count recorded in the state that is in the midst of a surge in infections. India recorded 318 deaths on Thursday, down from 375 on the previous day.

The division bench of the HC, headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice C Praveen Kumar, had earlier stayed the single judge order and allowed the SEC to conduct polling while directing not to declare results pending disposal of the petitions. As the interim order is now vacated, decks have been cleared for the announcement of results. TDP functionary Varla Ramaiah and Jana Sena had challenged the election notification issued by the SEC on various grounds. After hearing the petitions, the court dismissed Ramaiah’s petition but allowed the petition moved by Jana Sena in part. Observing that the SEC did not follow the Supreme Court’s order on enforcing the Model Code of Conduct for four weeks prior to the date of polling, the single judge suspended the election notification and directed the SEC to issue a fresh notification. The single judge order was challenged by SEC on same day with a house motion petition. The division bench passed interim orders the next day and allowing polling but asked the SEC not to announce results. In the meantime, the bench headed by Chief Justice Goswami and Justice J Uma Devi heard lengthy arguments from both sides before reserving orders. While the petitioners argued that the SEC did not comply with the apex court order and conducted elections in a hasty manner, the SEC argued that there was no upper limit on enforcing the Model Code of Conduct. As the election code was in force prior to postponement of elections, and only two out of five stages of elections were in pending, there’s no need to enforce code for four weeks, the SEC argued. Considering all arguments, the HC allowed SEC’s appeal petition, thereby clearing way for counting and announcment of results||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/andhra-pradesh-high-court-allows-sec-to-declare-results-of-zptc-mptc-polls/articleshow/86280540.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Under the current Covid vaccine policy, 25% of local production of Covid vaccines are made available to the private sector, whereas the rest is procured by the Centre and allocated to states for free of cost distribution. As vaccination uptake in the private sector continues to be low, there were apprehensions about unutilised stock while more supplies at the government run Centres can help faster ramp up of coverage. “There is no earmarked quota for private sector. There is a indicative percentage of what government would procure and what would be available for the private sector to procure. This in effect means that if the private sector is unable to either procure or utilise the earmarked percentage, so whatever is the shortfall would also be procured by the government so that at the end of the day whatever is produced in the country must be utilised,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said. While officials said they will soon share statistics for the number of doses administered in the private sector so far, industry executives say the average uptake is around 50-60% of available slots, though on some days it is abysmally low. The utilisation of Covid vaccine doses in private sector also vary according to hospitals and state. Of the total 58,396 vaccination sessions organised on Thursday till 8pm, only 3,268 were in private sector. With free vaccines available at government Centres, private hospitals say their target audience is limited and therefore, need innovative measures to push the uptake and reach out to those who still are unvaccinated. A total of more than 77 crore doses were administered till Thursday 8pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaccine-share-for-pvt-hospitals-not-earmarked-quota-govt/articleshow/86280543.cms||Sushmi Dey

---||Noida||In lockdown yr, bank frauds went up from 0 to 215 in Gzb||Ghaziabad: The district saw a drastic increase in bank and online financial frauds last year, when the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown resulted in a drop in traditional crimes like theft, robbery, and assault on women and children. While the district recorded several forgery, cheating and fraud cases in 2019, their numbers went up by at least 38% in 2020. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, released on September 15, shows a total of 215 bank fraud cases were registered in Ghaziabad last year while no such offences were recorded a year back. In 2020, as many as 437 forgery, cheating and fraud cases were registered, up from the 270 cases in 2019, the NCRB data states. In a sharp contrast, offences like murder, kidnapping, rape and theft recorded a significant dip in 2020. At least 48 murder cases were registered in 2019, while it went down to 23 in 2020. Rape cases came down to 18 in 2020 from 59 in 2019. Sexual harassment cases, too, were fewer at 44 — 114 cases were recorded in 2019. With more people staying indoors due to the restrictions on movement amid the pandemic, hit and run cases, too, came down to 149 in 2020, from 274 recorded in 2019. Significant dip was witnessed in theft cases — chain and mobile snatching cases — which has otherwise been rampant in Ghaziabad. While 3,297 such cases were registered in 2019, it halved in 2020. Notorious for vehicle thefts, Ghaziabad recorded a total of 1,248 such cases in 2020, down from 2,675 in 2019, the NCRB data states. Sanjay Mishra, a political science teacher in Ghaziabad’s MMH College, said, “The main reason behind a dip in traditional crimes in 2020 was because people were forced to stay indoors due to the Covid-induced lockdown. For financial fraud and cybercrimes, however, one does not need to be on the streets. It can be done within the confines of a person’s house. With job losses and financial hardships during pandemic, more and more people resorted to this kind of frauds,” Mishra added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/in-lockdown-yr-bank-frauds-went-up-from-0-to-215-in-gzb/articleshow/86277182.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||India||Opposition cold to plan, protests could end up as Congress show||NEW DELHI: With no sign of plans yet of opposition parties for state-level joint action as decided by the Sonia Gandhi-chaired meeting of the anti-BJP bloc last month, Congress has sent an urgent missive to its local units asking them to take the initiative and ensure that multi-party agitations are held as decided. It is learnt that AICC general secretary in charge of organisation K C Venugopal on Saturday shot off a letter underlining that protests and dharnas “with like-minded parties” against the Modi government should be held. The letter says the agenda of the protests is the failure of the BJP government and its high-handed actions, which was deliberated in detail in the meeting of 19 opposition parties on August 20. It says the protests are aimed at exhorting people to join in large numbers for protection of constitutional values. The letter also underlines that the protests should be held between September 20-30, as was decided by the joint opposition meeting. The call to state units to act on the agitation agenda is significant as there has been no sign of its implementation over last three weeks while the timeline is near. Far from coordinating on joint action, there are states where the “allies at the centre” are actually at loggerheads. In Bengal, CPM and TMC are crossing swords over bypolls and there is no evidence of JD(S) and Congress joining hands in Karnataka. Also, there is no unity visible in UP either. On the contrary, coming state elections appear to be dissuading parties from being seen as sharing common platform, like Congress and Samajwadi Party in UP. What seems to be further complicating the issue is that focus on key turfs has shifted to state elections, thereby relegating the agitation plank to the background.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/opposition-cold-to-plan-protests-could-end-up-as-congress-show/articleshow/86280581.cms||---

The agency recorded his statement as part of its investigation of alleged financial irregularities linked to IUML mouthpiece Chandrika. Kunhalikutty, who reached the Kochi ED office around 4pm, told reporters that it was his duty as part of Chandrika's governing body to provide clarity on issues that came up about it. The ED is probing the money laundering charges levelled against IUML leader V K Ebrahim Kunju in connection with the Palarivattom flyover bridge. It was alleged that its contractor had transferred a bribe amount to Kunju through the daily's bank. Bit of politics is there in everything: KunhalikuttyChandrika has been functioning for decades and we are all proud of this age-old newspaper... We will give clear answers to questions and we are sure that we can prove all these allegations baseless," he said. Kunhalikutty said terms being used in the media like "questioning" were not accurate in this case. “A notice has been served to me to give my statement as a witness. It is only normal,” he said. Asked if the case is politically motivated, he said a bit of politics would be there in everything. “Otherwise, there is no reason for such a case,” he said. Former minister and LDF MLA K T Jaleel had recently claimed that the money sent through the daily was directly linked to Kunhalikutty. The IUML leader has, however, dismissed the allegations. Jaleel had told reporters after appearing before ED on September 2 that he had given his statements and evidence on financial irregularities linked to Chandrika daily. He had also alleged that Chandrika, the IUML and its establishments were used as a front to launder money and amass wealth. The ED had reportedly asked Kunhalikutty to appear for interrogation last week but he sought more time. Sources said the agency had served him a fresh notice to appear on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chandrika-case-iuml-leader-p-k-kunhalikutty-gives-statement-before-ed-in-kochi/articleshow/86280625.cms||---

The country’s overall weekly positivity rate has been below 3% for the past 11 weeks. “State level preventive measures are being taken by various states and we are seeing some decrease in infection in states like Kerala. Other states are also in the path of averting future surge. However, we know that the festivals are in the anvil and sudden increase in population density creates a very conducive environment for viral spread,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Underlining four measures as the call of the hour, Bhargava urged people for increasing vaccine acceptance, maintaining Covidappropriate behaviour, travelling responsibly and not dropping Covid-caution during festivals to avoid further increase in cases. Currently, 64 districts are still reporting above 5% Covid-positivity. Despite an improvement in daily cases, Kerala continues to be the only state with active cases above one lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/64-districts-have-5-positivity-rate-govt-urges-public-caution/articleshow/86280699.cms||---
