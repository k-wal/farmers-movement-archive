A police officer said: “The FIR was registered at Budgam police station against the family members of Geelani along with other elements for raising anti-national slogans and putting Pakistani flag on the separatist’s body at his home after his death on Wednesday.” Geelani, 92, had passed away on Wednesday evening at his Hyderpora residence here after prolonged illness. The family members had alleged that police snatched away the body in the dead of the night and buried it silently, a charge outrightly denied by the cops. A video showing Pakistani flag over the body of Geelani had gone viral on social media. Meanwhile, situation across Kashmir Valley remained peaceful barring one minor stone-pelting incident in Narkara area of Budgam district. IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said several preventive measures were taken to maintain law and order following the death of Geelani. Police have made preventive arrests of dozens of miscreants so far, he added. "Mobile internet services, which were suspended after Geelani’s death, shall be restored soon after reviewing the overall security situation,” Kumar said, adding that cellular voice call and broadband services were already restored on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fir-against-geelanis-family-for-raising-anti-national-slogans-putting-pakistan-flag-on-his-body/articleshow/85934668.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The fish were taken away in trucks and destroyed as per bio-medical waste norms, Chennai food safety designated officer Dr Satish said. In addition, at least 13 samples were picked from vendors – big and small – as they were suspected to be laced with toxic preservatives such as formalin. The Tamil Nadu Food Safety Commissionerate had recently ordered inspection of fish markets following complaints from various sources including CM’s cells and collectorate about sale of stale fish and use of harmful preservatives, officials said.  On Saturday, city teams inspected three major city markets in Kasimedu, Chintadripet and Nochikuppam. “Over 200kg of fish in Chitradripet storage units and another 75kg in Kasimedu stored in deep freezers or heaps of ice were found to be stale,” Dr Satish said. Most of these fish varieties came from states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra and West Bengal by trains to Chennai.  “Fish have a short shelf life and must be stored at the right temperature during transport. Since they are expensive, vendors use excess amounts of chemicals such as formalin,” Dr Satish said. Public health experts warn that formalin, a derivative of formaldehyde, called “human carcinogen” is used to preserve bodies.  When food laced with formalin is eaten, it triggers a metabolic process and produces toxins. While in the short term it can cause digestive problems, it may eventually cause diseases such as cancer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/270kg-stale-fish-seized-destroyed-13-samples-sent-for-toxicity-test/articleshow/85934680.cms||---

The Pakistan Army chief, Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, meanwhile, was quoted by a local newspaper as telling visiting UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab on Saturday that Islamabad would "continue to fight for peace and stability in Afghanistan, as well as assist the formation of an inclusive administration". The "Pakistan Observer" said Raab and Bajwa discussed the situation in Afghanistan, among other things. Afghanistan crisis live updatesPakistan has been openly involved in Afghan affairs since the Taliban seized control of the country. As the insurgent group had captured Kabul on August 15, a delegation of powerful non-Pashtun leaders from Afghanistan had landed in Islamabad to discuss the changed political scene in their country with Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership. Rawalpindi-based military sources said that the ISI chief’s visit to Kabul was to discuss with Taliban representatives matters related to the safe evacuation of foreign nationals, border management and security in the region. Lt Gen Hameed, sources added, will also discuss with the Taliban matters related to pending requests from countries and international organisations for repatriation/transit through Pakistan.

Burns, inside sources confided, had suggested to Baradar that he include some senior officials from previous governments in his administration. The idea, sources said, was not welcomed by hardcore Taliban leaders in later discussions with Baradar. A majority of Taliban leaders, commanders and fighters see the Afghan governments of the past two decades as "US lackeys".

The delay in announcing the government, Afghan sources revealed, was caused by some irritants in the way of an inclusive setup. The Taliban have been reluctant to include former Pashtun and non-Pashtun warlords in their cabinet and, instead, Taliban sources said, want to bring in new non-Pashtun faces. Despite their earlier claim that women would be part of the government but would not serve in high-ranking positions, senior Taliban leaders are now considering giving them some representation in their government.

The armed group has ramped up its diplomatic efforts. A Taliban delegation met Pakistan’s ambassador to Qatar, Syed Ahsan Raza Shah, on Friday to discuss the current Afghanistan situation and bilateral relations. The meeting was held at the Pakistani embassy in Doha. The Taliban delegation was led by their political chief, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai. "Both sides discussed humanitarian assistance and bilateral relations based on mutual interest and respect," Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said in a tweet. Shaheen said the reconstruction of Afghanistan and issues related to facilitating people’s movement at Torkham and Spin Boldak (two border crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan) were also discussed. Over the past few days, the Taliban have held meetings in Doha with the envoys of India, Germany and the UK. Meanwhile, fresh fighting has been reported in Afghanistan’s Panjshir valley. The valley, north of Kabul, is one of Afghanistan’s smallest provinces and the only one not to have fallen to the Taliban, or earlier to the Red Army of the former Soviet Union. Afghanistan’s deposed vice-president and one of the resistance leaders, Amrullah Saleh, has admitted that conditions are difficult in the valley, with the Taliban closing phone, internet and electricity lines. In a video message sent to the media, Saleh said that there had been casualties on both sides. "There is no doubt we are in a difficult situation. We are under invasion by the Taliban," he said, adding that his forces would not surrender. But resistance leaders concede that some districts have fallen to the Taliban, while pro-Taliban social media showed clips seeming to show their fighters with captured tanks and other military gear. Rumours that the Taliban had captured Panjshir prompted celebratory firing in Kabul and other cities, which left at least 17 people dead and 47 injured.

---||India||I give credit to my teachers for shaping my career: Isro chief Sivan||Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chairman K Sivan, who is also known as the ‘Rocket Man’ of India for his key contribution in the development of cryogenic engines, credited his teachers for what he is today. Speaking to TOI on the eve of Teachers’ Day, Sivan said, “It won’t be appropriate to name one or two teachers whom I can give credit for helping shape my career. There were several teachers during my school and college days who actually inspired me to dream big and do big. Though I still remember faces of my teachers, I don’t recall their names. However, I still remember Mr Pushpam, Mr Ganeshan and Mr Paul who guided me in my school days.” The son of a farmer in Tamil Nadu, Sivan, who studied in a Tamil-medium government school in a village in Kanyakumari district, graduated with a bachelor’s degree in engineering from Madras Institute of Technology in 1980. He then got a master’s degree in aerospace engineering from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, in 1982, and later joined Isro. He earned a doctoral degree in aerospace engineering from IIT Bombay in 2006. “Professor M Krishnan encouraged me to join Madras Institute of Technology. During my BTech course, Prof Narasimhan, Prof Venkatraman and Jai Raman helped me a lot. When I was doing my masters in aerospace engineering, we were supposed to pick a subject of interest in the space area. My professor S K Srivastava at IISc inspired me to work on rocket science. Due to his encouragement, I later joined Isro and rocket became my area of specialisation,” Sivan told TOI. Sivan joined Isro in 1982 and participated in the PSLV project. He was appointed the director of Isro's Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre in July 2014. In June 2015, he became the director of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), which makes India’s space rockets PSLV and GSLV. Isro achieved a major milestone on February 15, 2017 when it made a world record by successfully launching 104 satellites with just a single rocket. The rocket, PSLV-C37, that made the world record was built under his guidance when he was head of VSSC. In January 2018, he took over the reins of the country's space agency. Under his chairmanship, Isro launched Chandrayaan-2, the country's crucial second mission to Moon on July 22, 2019. Though the Vikram rover crash-landed on the lunar surface in its maiden attempt, the orbiter, with several key scientific instruments on board, is still orbiting the Moon and making significant findings, including the discovery of hydroxyl and water molecules on the lunar surface. Under the leadership of Sivan, Isro has launched several key satellite missions and is preparing to launch several interplanetary missions like Venus and Aditya missions, and also the country's most high-profile human spaceflight mission 'Gaganyaan'.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/i-give-credit-to-my-teachers-for-shaping-my-career-isro-chief-sivan/articleshow/85936084.cms||Surendra Singh

Besides 14 states and three UTs, eight central police organisations, six central armed police forces (CAPFs) and seven NGOs have submitted views on possible changes in several British-era laws in force for decades. Addressing the 51st Foundation Day of Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) here, Shah said the organisation, a key part of the consultation process that has been on for nearly two years now, offered “constructive suggestions” as part of the Centre’s efforts to overhaul laws and bring them in sync with modern times and Indian conditions. According to sources, the home ministry’s consultation exercise also covers courts and bar associations. “It is a work in progress,” said a government functionary. In his speech, Shah referred to the fact that sometimes police face unfair criticism though they are often tasked with difficult and sensitive assignments. Though Shah did not elaborate on the suggestions, stakeholders including civil rights activists have been demanding scrapping of Section 124A (sedition) of IPC on grounds of being vague and open to misinterpretation and misuse to stifle free speech. While anti-national activities will need to be made punishable under a statute, experts have suggested restrictions or guidelines to prevent misuse. A section has also sought review of bail provisions to protect the disadvantaged who cannot arrange bail money. Another key reform sought relates to hate crimes like lynching, which currently are dealt under IPC provisions relating to murder. There is also a view that misuse of mercy petition provision by death-row convicts to buy time before facing the gallows should be stopped by suitably amending the relevant laws. Shah also referred to drone attacks, cyber attacks, narcotics trafficking, fake currency and hawala trade as the biggest challenges for police forces and asked the BPR&D to assess the nature of these problems and study best practices worldwide to devise effective and timely solutions. The event on Saturday was attended by MoS home Nityanand Rai, home secretary Ajay Bhalla, Intelligence Bureau director Arvinda Kumar, BPR&D DG Balaji Srivastava and several senior serving and retired officers of MHA and central armed police forces. Impressing upon the need to strengthen the “beat system”, Shah asked the BPR&D to step up efforts to revive and technically upgrade this mechanism for better ground-level policing. Alleging a campaign to spoil the image of police by highlighting negative stories and ignoring the positive developments, Shah suggested that the good work of police forces during Covid times should be documented by the central forces as well as all state police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/criminal-justice-system-set-for-overhaul-says-amit-shah/articleshow/85936815.cms||---
---||India||CJI must focus on speedy justice for commoners, says Kiren Rijiju||NEW DELHI: The Union government on Saturday said it expects Chief Justice N V Ramana to give urgent attention to the huge pendency of cases in trial courts where commoners exhaust their lifetime savings in litigating for justice but are often denied the legitimate due because of delayed adjudication of their grievances. “It is the lower courts where we need to look with urgency. Many persons from humble backgrounds, be it from rural or urban areas, spend their lifetime earnings in land or houses expecting justice. When that justice gets delayed, it is a big question mark on all of us,” law minister Kiren Rijiju said at a Bar Council of India’s function to felicitate the CJI. In his speech, CJI complimented PM Modi and the law minister for clearing “in jet speed” the appointment of nine SC judges and said that he expected similar expeditious appointment of names recommended for the high courts by the SC collegium. The collegium has cleared a record 68 names for appointment of judges in 12 high courts. Read AlsoCriminal justice system set for overhaul, says Amit ShahThe stage is set for a major overhaul of the criminal justice system with the Centre having received suggestions of various states, UTs, central forces and NGOs on the reform of the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and the Evidence Act, home minister Amit Shah said on Saturday.The law minister said the government is keen on speeding up justice dispensation and stressed that a delay of three years is enough to render justice meaningless. “I have said in many of our internal meetings that a delay of three years amounts to denial of justice. After three years, the justice is meaningless for the litigant. So we must ensure that the common man is given priority when we talk of justice delivery mechanism. That is what we expect from the CJI and he is doing exactly that,” the minister said, while promising the government's wholehearted support to improve the infrastructure and facilities for the judiciary. The CJI said the judiciary is woefully short of infrastructure requirements for judges, staff, lawyers and litigants. He said expeditious filling of vacancies in the HCs and SC remains his top priority but the inadequate infrastructure constantly impedes the justice delivery system from picking speed. “I have suggested to the government for the National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation to quickly address the infrastructure issues faced by the judiciary and a comprehensive proposal for its creation is under process. We have collected information from every state about the status of infrastructure and future requirements. I will compile the data and present a comprehensive proposal to the law minister very soon. I expect full cooperation from the government,” he said. Rijiju said the Union government is ready to extend all support for strengthening the independence and infrastructure of the judiciary, especially the trial courts. “In today’s time, we need a lot more facilities, including video conference facilities, for the judiciary. I will actively persuade the states to step up efforts in meeting the infrastructural demands of the judiciary,” he said. CJI Ramana said the Covid pandemic has forced the courts to switch from physical to virtual hearing. “Many in rural areas do not have internet connectivity to participate in virtual proceedings of the courts,” the CJI said and requested the law minister to take up the issue with internet service providers to set up mobile internet kiosks at taluka level to enable lawyers in the hinterland to argue their clients’ cases and not feel excluded from the justice delivery system. Rijiju said, “We have a CJI in whom the government has full trust and faith that he will do justice to the country. He is a person of high integrity and commitment, who is set to herald a new dawn in Indian judiciary." Returning the compliment, the CJI said, "When he met Rijiju for the first time, he appeared like a college student. I will not ask him the secret of his youthful looks but will tell him the secret of expeditious justice delivery - quick filling of vacancies and providing adequate infrastructure to the judiciary."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cji-must-focus-on-speedy-justice-for-commoners-says-kiren-rijiju/articleshow/85936998.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The Centre and Assam government shall release a Rs 1,000-crore Special Development Package over the next five years for undertaking specific projects for development of Karbi areas. The agreement assures greater devolution of autonomy to the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council without affecting the territorial and administrative integrity of Assam and protection of identity, language and culture of Karbi people. The Karbi-Anglong pact takes forward the Modi government’s vision of an “insurgency-free and prosperous northeast” and seeks to end a decades-old problem while keeping the territorial integrity of Assam intact, said home minister Amit Shah, in whose presence the accord was signed at North Block in New Delhi. Earlier, the government had signed three key peace accords with insurgent groups active in the north-east – the NLFT Tripura Agreement signed on August 10, 2019, Bru Accord finalised on January 1, 2020 for permanent settlement of 6,959 Bru families (37,136 persons) in Tripura and Bodo Peace Accord signed on January 27, 2020 under which 1,615 cadres of NDFB groups surrendered their weapons. Those part of the signing ceremony were Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal, MoS (Home) Nityanad Rai, Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council chief executive member Tuliram Ronghang, representatives of Karbi Longri North Cachar Hills Liberation Front, People’s Democratic Council of Karbi Longri, United People’s Liberation Army, Karbi People’s Liberation Tigers and senior officers from home ministry and Assam. Shah, while addressing the event, said it is the policy of the Centre that those who give up arms be brought into the mainstream. “We talk to them even more politely and give them more than they ask for,” he said, adding that this policy had helped to get rid of old problems that the government had inherited. The tripartite MoU was signed twice earlier in 1995 and 2011. But due to apathy by the earlier governments, despite these agreements, peace could not be established in Karbi-Anglong, he said. After the signing, Biswa Sarma said, “This is a historic accord that has not just brought the former rebels to the mainstream but also provides reservation for STs in the council (34 out of 44 elected seats), which is very significant as in the northeast, no inhabitant of a Sixth Schedule area has reservation. It started with Bodo people, and now the Karbi people. We are trying to resolve all issues of tribal people within the territorial integrity of Assam.” Overall, the present settlement proposes to give more legislative, executive, administrative and financial powers to KAAC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-assam-ink-pact-with-karbi-anglong-ultra-groups/articleshow/85937270.cms||---

Madhav later tweeted from his verified handle that the delegation apprised him of the challenges the Sikh and Hindu refugees from Afghanistan are facing and sought intervention.  Guljeet Singh, president of Gurdwara Sri Guru Nanak Sahib Ji, who was part of the delegation told TOI that the discussion was good and that Madhav had assured them of all support for the Afghan Hindu and Sikh refugees with the help of the Government of India. “He assured us that all the members of both the Hindu and Sikh communities who are presently in Afghanistan and willing to come to India on pilgrimage on the occasion of 400th Prakash Parv of Guru Teg Bahadar Ji or otherwise will be brought here. We are in regular touch with them."  Manjit Singh GK said discussions were also held on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which is yet to be implemented. “It was also discussed that there should be a separate policy for the Afghan Hindus and Sikhs who have been staying here on visas. It was urged to develop a single window so that those who came here did not face any inconvenience and harassment."  He added that Madhav told them the Government of India is serious on the matter. “He said that the problems will be solved."  “We have also demanded that the poor Afghan Sikhs who have come to India this time should be settled somewhere near Delhi."  DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa, however, said the delegation should have avoided the talks about rehabilitation as the RSS do not have any stake in the decision making. “They do not work. I do not think it is fair to put the lives of Afghan Sikhs at great risk by putting their photos on air and talking about their rehabilitation."  Guljeet Singh added that until the situation in Afghanistan becomes normal, there is a threat to the lives and properties of the Hindu and Sikh community there as it is hard to identify who is Taliban and who is not. “It is apprehended that somebody might use the name of Taliban and commit some untoward incident."  Guljeet Singh further said the Taliban has formed a law that they will not allow the Afghan nationals to leave the country. “The Afghan Sikh Sangat (community) had made a plan to visit India six months in advance to celebrate the 400th Prakash Parv of Sri Guru Teg Bahadar Ji and the visas were arranged for all those who were interested in coming here. Although, the Taliban has assured the Afghan Sikhs and Hindus to allow them come to India on pilgrimage on valid passports and visas, presently, the international flights are not operating due to the bad condition of Kabul airport. The Kabul airport has started the operations yesterday (Friday) only and we expect that the international flights will be operated soon and all those Afghan Sikhs and Hindus who are willing to come to India on pilgrimage will be able to visit here.”  He said it will be the will of the community members if they want to stay in India or return back to Afghanistan. “The organisations, including SGPC and DSGMC have assured us every kind of support to rehabilitate the Afghan Sikhs if they stay here. The Government of India has assured us of every possible support to bring them here,” said Guljeet Singh.  He went on to say that 45 members of the Afghan Sikh and Hindu communities will, however, stay back in Afghanistan to take care of the Gurasthans (Gurdwara Sahibs) and shrines in Ghazni, Jalalabad and Kabul.  Apart from Manjit Singh and Guljeet Singh, the delegation included Partap Singh, president of Gurdwara Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji in New Delhi; senator of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (IRA) Anarkali Kaur Honaryar; Manjit Singh Lamba, deputy of Minority Development Council of IRA, and other Delhi-based Afghan Sikhs and Hindus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/afghan-origin-hindus-sikhs-meet-rss-leader-ram-madhav-who-assures-them-of-help-for-refugees/articleshow/85937191.cms||JK Singh
---||India||Jan Aashirvad Yatra has rattled opposition, says BJP||NEW DELHI: BJP president J P Nadda on Saturday celebrated what he called “huge success” of the ‘Jan Aashirvad Yatra’— a public outreach by 39 new Union ministers across 19 states — calling it another testimony to the growing popularity of PM Modi and his policies, and batted aside criticism that the party had turned the exercise into a pitch for OBC votes. “The highly successful ‘Jan Aashirwad Yatras’ across the country has left opposition parties disturbed and nervous and they unsuccessfully tried to disturb and create hindrances in our yatra and programmes. It is the great people of our country who have shown their unflinching support and trust to the Narendra Modi government,” Nadda said . “All ploys and disturbances have failed to shake the strong support and trust that the people have showered on the Modi government. We have all seen how the opposition parties’ coalition government in Maharashtra tried to target our Union minister Narayan Rane. It is a direct attack on our democratic system. The people’s support forced all narrow-minded opposition parties and our political adversaries to retreat,” he said. Party spokesperson and RS member Sudhanshu Trivedirejected the criticism that the Yatra was essentially a parade of OBC leaders, inducted by the PM into his team, organised by the party to woo the politically-crucial constituencies. Trivedi denied the party’s approach mirrored that of its regional rivals, whom it has accused of casteism. “Unlike the caste-based platforms, we don’t believe in generating and exacerbating social conflicts. Our focus is on social harmony,” he said. He also targeted leaders of SP, BSP, and RJD. “These parties promote the interests of their chiefs and their families. Mulayam Singh Yadav styled himself as Dhartiputra, but he cared only for his son Akhilesh. Mayawati is called Behenji, but she has looked after the interests of only her own brother. And Lalu Prasad’s claim as a champion of ‘garib and gurba’ (poor and downtrodden) has turned out to be a smokescreen for organising benefits for his own ‘kunba’ (clan),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jan-aashirvad-yatra-has-rattled-opposition-says-bjp/articleshow/85937404.cms||---

Polling for all four seats will be held on September 30, followed by counting on October 3. EC however decided not to hold bypolls due in three Lok Sabha constituencies – Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Mandi in Himachal Pradesh and Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh – and 31 assembly seats across 15 states until after the festive season, citing constraints like Covid situation, floods and festivals conveyed to it by various states. The poll panel also announced a tougher set of restrictions to ensure a Covid-safe bypoll campaign, limiting attendance at indoor meetings to 200 persons or 30% of the venue’s capacity, whichever is less, and for outdoor meetings to 50% of the ground’s capacity or 1,000 persons at meetings with star campaigners and 500 in all other cases. Rally grounds will have to be cordoned off and guarded by the police, with candidates or political parties bearing the expenditure for the barricading. Roadshows and motorcycle or bike rallies have been banned and the number of star campaigners capped at 20 for recognised national and state parties and 10 for unrecognised registered parties. Silence period will start 72 hours before end of poll. In Samserganj and Jangipur in West Bengal and Pipli in Odisha, campaigning will be allowed for only 8 days as candidates there have already availed of campaign period from April 29, 2021 to May 3, 2021. During assembly polls in five states earlier this year, the Commission had come under sharp criticism for failing to stop huge gatherings at election rallies, even as Covid cases were rising and the country was eventually gripped by a devastating second wave of infections. While the bypoll in Bhabhanipur was necessitated after TMC MLA Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay vacated the seat, paving the way for Mamata to get elected following her defeat in Nandigram, the polls in Jangipur and Samserganj in West Bengal as well as Pipli in Odisha were deferred in view of death of the candidate. A TMC delegation had recently requested EC to hold the seven bypolls due in West Bengal. Two days back, during consultations held by EC with the chief secretaries and chief electoral officers (CEOs) of bypoll-bound states, both West Bengal and Odisha chief secretary had claimed that the Covid situation in the said constituencies was in check and good to hold bypolls. The chief secretary formally wrote to EC, citing a possible constitutional crisis in the event of the chief minister, who as per Article 164(4) must be elected to the legislature within six months of assuming office, not getting an opportunity to get elected. EC, taking note of the special request of the state government and Constitutional exigency, decided to hold the bypoll in Bhabhanipur. However, as exclusively reported by TOI on August 2, states like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and those in the northeast region, during consultations with EC, expressed concerns regarding the Covid situation while Bihar and Assam pointed to the flood situation there. EC sources said after considering all factors, the commission thought it wise to wait until after the festive season to hold the remaining bypolls. Sources said if the Covid situation is conducive, the bypolls may be scheduled in November-December 2021. As part of the stricter Covid norms for the bypolls, attendance for street corner meetings has been capped at 50 persons; for door-to-door campaign to five persons; and for campaign through video vans to 50. Also candidates must use no more than 20 vehicles for campaigning. Any candidate or political party found violating Covid norms will be denied permission to hold further rallies and meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bypolls-on-september-30-didi-set-to-fight-from-bhabanipur/articleshow/85937569.cms||Bharti Jain

The pattern was repeated in the zila parishad elections, with Congress getting 99 and BJP 90 out of the 200 seats to which polls were held. In the previous elections, BJP had won 584 out of 1,328 panchayat samiti seats, as against 1,564 that were at stake this time. It’s zila parishad tally the last time out was 100 to Congress’s 90. Independents comprised the third largest block of winners in the panchayat samiti stakes with 290 seats, leaving Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) a distant fourth with just 40. BSP got 11 seats. Two panchayat samiti results hadn’t been declared till late in the night. The overall turnout across the three phases of polling in Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bharatpur, Sawai Madhopur, Dausa and Sirohi districts was 64%. Elections were also held to the offices of six district pramukhs and deputy district pramukhs and 78 pradhans and up-pradhans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-6-years-congress-beats-bjp-in-rajasthan-rural-polls-by-119-seats/articleshow/85937702.cms||---
---||India||Credit to collegium for speedy filling up of posts, says CJI NV Ramana||NEW DELHI: Amidst showering of praises for record appointments to the Supreme Court and high courts, chief justice of India NV Ramana said it is a team effort and credit was equally due to the SC collegium members in Justices UU Lalit, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and LN Rao while promising that 90% of vacancies in high courts would be filled in next one month. At a Bar Association of India function to felicitate him, the Supreme Court judges and lawyers heaped praise on CJI Ramana for batting on the front foot to accumulate records in appointments — nine Supreme Court judges at one go, including three women judges, one of whom would go on to become first woman CJI in 2027; and a record 68 names recommended for HC judgeship. A team player, the CJI said, “I am no (Sachin) Tendulkar (who amassed records in the cricket field). Even Tendulkar required a team to achieve victory for the country.” Read AlsoCJI must focus on speedy justice for commoners, says Kiren RijijuThe Union government on Saturday said it expects Chief Justice N V Ramana to give urgent attention to the huge pendency of cases in trial courts where commoners exhaust their lifetime savings in litigating for justice but are often denied the legitimate due because of delayed adjudication of their“It has been my endeavour to address the issue of vacancies in the higher judiciary on an urgent basis. A while ago, I was referred to as Sachin Tendulkar. I must correct the perception. Like any game, it is a team effort. Unless the members of the team perform well, it is difficult to win. Here, I must place on record my sincere thanks to my colleagues in the collegium — Justices Lalit, Khanwilkar, Chandrachud and Rao — who have become active and constructive partners in this endeavour,” Justice Ramana said. He said the collegium could recommend a large number of names for appointment as judges of the apex court and high courts because of the collective effort. “I hope the government will ensure that the names are cleared at the earliest just the way the nine names were cleared for the Supreme Court. It is an ongoing process. We hope to live up to the herculean challenge of filling nearly 41% of the vacancies existing in all the HCs,” he said. “I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the law minister for clearing in jet speed the nine names recommended for appointment as Supreme Court judges. I expect similar speed in clearing the names recommended for high courts. In another month, we expect to recommend names against 90% of vacancies in the high courts,” the CJI said. The high courts cumulatively have a sanctioned strength of 1,089 judges and are reeling under a vacancy of 465 posts of judges. If the CJI’s promise to fill 90% of vacancies in the next one month were to come true, the collegium would have to recommend nearly 350 names, given the fact that earlier recommendations for high court judge appointments are pending with the Centre. This would mean, the collegium of CJI Ramana and Justices Lalit and Khanwilkar have to clear at least 10 names per day on an average to meet the self-set target.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/credit-to-collegium-for-speedy-filling-up-of-posts-says-cji-nv-ramana/articleshow/85937801.cms||---

The cabinet, which met on Saturday, approved the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Bill which seeks to ban all kinds of online games involving profit or gain. The move came following several complaints from organisations and parents seeking action. “The bill will be tabled in the monsoon session (starting September 13),” law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy said. A month ago, the Madras high court had declared a similar law enacted by the Tamil Nadu government to ban online betting games as ultra vires (action of the delegated legislation body that affects the fundamental rights guaranteed to the people) to the Constitution. Madhuswamy said all online games played using computers, mobile phones and on social media platforms and betting in the form of tokens, electronic transfer of money and virtual currency will be banned. However, lottery and horse races run on race courses within and outside the state do not come under the purview of the bill, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/karnataka-cabinet-approves-ban-on-online-betting-gaming-for-cash/articleshow/85937919.cms||---

In these states, coverage of both doses of the vaccine is “unsatisfactory” in the elderly population above 60 years of age, who are most vulnerable to SARS-CoV2 infection as well as fatality due to it, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan underlined during a meeting with them to review the vaccination status. The Centre advised states to earmark doses, days and target the completion of the vaccination exercise for people above 60 years of age as the vulnerability of this group to Covid makes this exercise of prime importance. Meanwhile, states were also asked to saturate the first dose coverage among the 18-plus population. A total of 68.33 crore doses of Covid-vaccines were administered till Saturday. Nearly 56% of the 94 crore adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccines, whereas around 17% of adults (18 years and above) have got both doses. The Centre asked states to closely monitor the stock from state-level stores to cold-chain points, check rational distribution and restrict vaccine wastage to below 2%. States have been asked to update data on eVIN (electronic vaccine intelligence network) on a daily basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ramp-up-vaccination-coverage-in-ne-states-jk-centre/articleshow/85937996.cms||---

India recorded 42,588 fresh cases of the coronavirus, nearly identical to the previous day's tally of 42,665, as per TOI's Covid database. Kerala again accounted for 70% of the cases with 29,682 new infections detected in the state on Saturday. Kerala had posted 29,322 new cases on Friday after logging 30,000-plus cases in the previous three days. The test positivity rate in the state remained high despite a marginal drop to 17.54%, from 17.91% on Friday. Meanwhile, active cases in the state topped 2.5 lakh, accounting for nearly 60% of the national count of 4.1 lakh. As deaths in Maharashtra stayed below 100 for the third straight day, the daily national toll fell to its lowest since March 29, which was the last time the country had reported less than 300 fatalities in a day. Maharashtra recorded 64 deaths on Saturday. At 142, Kerala was the only state to report more than 100 fatalities. Maharashtra logged 4,130 Covid cases while Karnataka’s tally dropped to 983, the second time this week that the state had reported less than 1,000 new cases in a day. There were no big surprises in the numbers reported by most other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-india-sees-43k-cases-kerala-logs-below-30k-for-2nd-day/articleshow/85938015.cms||---

---||India||IISc, Isro develop device for bio experiments in space||BENGALURU: In order to understand how microbes behave in extreme environments, a team of researchers from the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc) has developed a modular, self-contained device to cultivate microorganisms, which could enable scientists to carry out biological experiments in outer space. In a study published in ‘Acta Astronautica’, the team has shown how the device can be used to activate and track the growth of a bacterium called Sporosarcina pasteurii over several days, with minimal human involvement. “Understanding how such microbes behave in extreme environments could provide valuable insights for human space missions such as ‘Gaganyaan,’ India’s first crewed spacecraft set to be launched in 2022,” IISc said in a statement shared with TOI. Pointing out that in recent years, scientists have been increasingly exploring the use of lab-on-chip platforms — which combine many analyses into a single integrated chip — for such experiments, IISc said there are additional challenges to designing such platforms for outer space, when compared to the lab. Koushik Viswanathan, assistant professor, department of mechanical engineering, IISc, and senior author of the study, said: “It has to be completely self-contained. Besides, you can’t expect the same operating conditions as you would in a normal laboratory setting… and you can’t have something that guzzles 500W, for example.” The new device uses an LED and photodiode sensor combination to track bacterial growth by measuring the optical density or scattering of light, similar to spectrophotometers used in the lab. It also has separate compartments for different experiments. IISc said each compartment or ‘cassette’ consists of a chamber where bacteria and a nutrient medium can be mixed to kickstart growth, by flicking on a switch remotely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iisc-isro-develop-device-for-bio-experiments-in-space/articleshow/85938127.cms||---

The CBI had registered an FIR in March 2020 for cheating and criminal conspiracy as well as pressed corruption charges against DHFL and other accused persons, including Rana Kapoor. The CBI had filed its main chargesheet last year, where Rana and his daughter Roshini were made accused. Recently, the CBI filed a supplementary chargesheet in the matter on August 20, 2021, and the court had summoned Rana’s wife Bindu and Radha Kapoor Khanna, daughter of Rana Kapoor. Vijay Agrawal, counsel for Kapoor’s wife and daughter, argued that since the two of them were not in custody all along, they be granted bail as the probe is over and chargesheet filed and hence their custody is not warranted. The court fixed the date for next hearing on September 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rana-kapoors-wife-daughter-get-interim-bail/articleshow/85938250.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||World||First Modi-Biden summit likely in US on September 23-24||NEW DELHI: The United States and India are looking at September 23-24 as possible dates for the first bilateral summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden in Washington. There is also preparation for a Quad summit on one of these dates. However, the unexpected political situation in Japan where Prime Minister Suga Yoshide announced that he is stepping down, apparently over failure to control the Covid-19 spread, may make the Quad scheduling a little uncertain. Suga will probably leave at the end of the month. He is not a candidate for either the post of the LDP party president or the next PM. So it is unclear whether Suga will be able to travel to the US in the last week of September. If all goes to plan, Modi is likely to cram in at least three big events — an address at the UN General Assembly in a year when India is a member of the UNSC, the first bilateral summit with Biden and possibly the first in-person Quad summit. Certainly, the first two events are currently on track. PM Modi is scheduled to address the UNGA on September 25, according to the provisional list circulated.  Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who spoke to Biden on Saturday, told journalists he would be travelling to Washington DC for the Quad summit “in autumn”, which has been interpreted to mean any time in the next couple of months, due to the uncertainty of the Japanese situation. The Modi-Biden bilateral summit comes after tectonic changes in Afghanistan and regional geopolitical equations. However, the challenge from China for both countries remain high, hence the focus on the Quad meeting. Both countries have been battered by Covid-19, and both nations are hoping to take forward a vaccine partnership that could see India producing more vaccines to export to other countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/first-modi-biden-summit-likely-in-us-on-september-23-24/articleshow/85938310.cms||---

Among the 29 countries with populations of over 50 million, it ranks 14. As for percentage of population fully vaccinated, it’s at No 17. On both counts, almost all the countries with lower levels have been much less badly hit by Covid-19, with Iran and South Africa being the two exceptions. The global vaccination average is 68.4 doses per 100 people, against 47.5 per 100 in India, the world’s leading manufacturer of vaccines. China and UK top the list along with several European countries but there are developing countries like Brazil, Colombia and Mexico that have also done better. India’s rank among the 30 countries in terms of doses per 100 people has remained unchanged since mid-June, when TOI last did this analysis. In terms of the number of vaccinated or fully vaccinated people per 100, 16 of these nations have done better. On this ranking, India has slid two ranks since mid-June with the Philippines and Thailand creeping ahead. Most populous countries that are below India in vaccination coverage are also far less affected by the pandemic with very low cases per million. None have Covid vaccine manufacturing facilities supplying them with vaccines yet. The exceptions are South Africa and Iran, which have suffered more Covid cases and deaths per million than India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-india-14th-among-populous-nations-in-doses-per-100-people/articleshow/85938651.cms||Rema Nagarajan

What has come to the rescue of passengers from India is that certain destinations in Middle East opened up to Indian tourists, so they can now transit from places like Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Turkey too relaxed entry norms and did away with the 14-day mandatory quarantine for fully vaccinated passengers from India. “In the past several months, Middle Eastern airports too were shut to Indians. So the only option before students traveling to Canada was to transit via countries like Egypt and Mexico, where they underwent an RT-PCR test. With Canada open to tourists from India as well, a holiday travel itinerary with a short stop in Dubai or Abu Dhabi could be planned,’’ said Anoop Kanuga from Bathija Travels. Fares for travel to Canada with a transit halt in a third country were comparatively cheap too. For travel this month-end and return in midOctober, the return fare on offer on the Mumbai-Toronto route was a transit halt in, say, London was priced at Rs80,000-90,000. For a transit halt in Middle East, the economical options were available only threefour weeks down the line.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fly-to-canada-from-tuesday-but-with-rt-pcr-test-stopover/articleshow/85939041.cms||---

The ruling JMM has, however, dismissed BJP’s demands. Ranchi MLA C P Singh accused the Hemant Soren government of “indulging in appeasement politics and religious polarisation” “We are not against any religion and in this country, and as per our Constitution, everyone is free to practise the faith of their choice. Having said so, Parliament and Vidhan Sabhas are regarded as temples of democracy and not of any specific religion. Therefore, if the speaker can provide space for namaz, we also urge him to provide a place for the setting up of a Hanuman temple,” he said. Singh said he wasn’t aware of any such designated place. “Even when I was speaker, there was no such place. Some MLAs had demanded an early adjournment of the House on Fridays to offer namaz, but I had said they were free to go but stalling the House would not be appropriate,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-namaz-room-in-jharkhand-house-bjp-asks-for-temple-space/articleshow/85939126.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Adhikari has been asked to appear at the CID headquarters in Kolkata at 11am on Monday. This is the first time Adhikari has been summoned in the case. The CID had visited the police barrack a few metres from his residence several times in the case. Adhikari could not not be reached for comment. The politician’s brother, Dibyendu Adhikari, also MP from Tamluk, had twice spoken with investigators in the past. A special CID anti-homicide team is investigating the case and has already questioned over a dozen people — including police personnel — in this case in the past three months. There were indications Suvendu would be summoned after CID insisted everyone who was at Contai Hospital the day Chakraborty passed away would be questioned.  This decision, claimed sources, follows from the CID questioning Chakraborty’s colleagues for two days — the last round lasting seven hours and involving 11 personnel staying at the barracks since the time the incident took place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cid-summons-suvendu-on-monday-in-guards-death-case/articleshow/85939166.cms||---

Most devotees come to my shop for sweets to offer it to Lord Shiva.” Suraj Kumar, another florist near Mansapuram Hanuman Mandir at Nepali Nagar, said: “Local devotees visit the temple and buy all kinds of flowers to offer to the Gods.” Sai Mandir in the Patliputra Industrial Area remains crowded once again. “Most devotees come to my shop for buying puja materials and flowers,” said Raju Kumar, who runs a shop there. Manisha Kumari of Rajeev Nagar said she regularly visits Khajpura Shiv Temple. “I always buy colourful flowers and belpatras outside for the puja of Lord Shiva,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/small-businesses-near-temples-back-on-track/articleshow/85934219.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa government must impose strict curbs for Ganesh Chaturthi, says expert panel||PANAJI: The state’s expert committee on Covid-19, in its meeting on Saturday, has recommended strict regulations for Ganesh Chaturthi, including banning all kinds of processions. It also suggested that priests be allowed to perform pooja only if they come with an RT-PCR negative certificate. A large number of priests come to Goa from the neighboring districts of Karnataka and Maharashtra to perform pooja during Chaturthi, as locally-available priests are not able to handle the increased workload. The committee also unanimously decided that Ganesh Chaturthi processions that are part of sarvajanik celebrations be strictly discouraged, a senior member of the committee told TOI. He also said that and implementing authorities should ensure that no crowding whatsoever takes place during the festival time, It was also suggested that artis be performed online. “Since it is not possible to check each house, we have suggested that people conduct artis online,” the member said. For immersion, he said, a maximum of two members from a family could be allowed at the immersion site, and this should preferably be done in the immediate vicinity of one’s residence without procession and crowding, he said. No children below the age of 18 must be allowed at the chitrashalas, the places where Ganesh idols are sold. Besides the compulsory RT-PCR negative report for those entering Goa from Kerala, the panel recommended that they be placed in five days quarantine (either paid or in government institutions) and repeat the test on the fifth day. They should be allowed to go only if the test report is negative, he said. The panel unanimously decided that no tourist-related group activities be permitted. It stated that they will revisit this decision a fortnight after Ganesh Chaturthi only if the positivity rate drops by then, and if no rise in cases or hotspots in the state are reported. “The state’s positivity rate hovers around 2%, and about 20 hotspots have been reported in the past two weeks, so there is no scope to allow tourist activities that will encourage crowding,” he added. Over the past few days, the casino lobby has been exerting pressure on the government to permit offshore casinos. The experts also highlighted the urgency in setting up a virology lab for genome sequencing in Goa for quicker results, and to be able to keep new variants under check before any outbreaks occur. Earlier this week, TOI reported that the government received confirmation of Goa’s first Delta plus variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/expert-panel-govt-must-impose-strict-curbs-for-chaturthi/articleshow/85936615.cms||Lisa Monteiro

According to SEB officials, they were conducting checks to seize illegal smuggling of liquor from Tamil Nadu. Officials found the birds inside a cage in the car. The persons in the car had not taken permission to transport the endangered species from Chennai to Vijayawada, officials said. The birds were later handed over to the forest department. The green-winged macaw is native to South America, especially Argentina. A considerable number of birds have been kept in captivity after being declared as ‘critically endangered’ by Argentina.

---||Patna||Pneumonia cases among children on the rise in Patna||PATNA: Hospitals in the city are witnessing a rise in cases of high fever, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) among children. Though the doctors term these diseases as monsoon problems aggravated due to long negligence, some severe cases of pneumonia indicated bacterial infections affecting lungs and other vital organs of the children. “About 40 to 50% of the total number of children reaching the paediatric OPD of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) per day suffer from high fever, cough and pneumonia,” hospital’s superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said on Saturday. He said at least 20 children between two to five years of age have been admitted with severe pneumonia in the hospital’s paediatric department and most are on oxygen support. “All the doctors and nursing staff of the paediatrics department have been directed to immediately admit any child reaching there with high fever or pneumonia,” he added. There has been about 20 to 25% rise in cases of high fever, pneumonia and cold among children at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) in recent weeks, hospital’s medical superintendent Dr I S Thakur said. “Some children come with severe conditions and they are mostly referred from other hospitals. We have dedicated doctors, nursing staff and adequate facility with oxygen support in paediatric wards to take care of the children with severe ailments,” Dr Thakur added. Head of paediatrics department at All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) Dr Lokesh Tiwari said about 15 children between two to eight years of age are being treated at the hospital after being referred from other health facilities. “We treat ARDS cases as late Covid complications with immunological disturbances. In some cases, we find children as antibody positive. This suggests that they had earlier been Covid positive, though asymptomatic. ARDS affects both lungs and blood circulation of the children,” Dr Tiwari added. He advised people not to ignore problems of high fever, cold, cough and convulsions in children. Head of the AIIMS-P’s telemedicine department, Dr Anil Kumar, said people should take proper care of children and not ignore their health complications. He added several youths and senior citizens are also reaching the hospital with complaints of pneumonia and other severe diseases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pneumonia-cases-among-children-on-the-rise-in-patna/articleshow/85931703.cms||VK Tripathi

The Palle Velugu bus was going from Gokavaram to Pathakota via Gurthedu when the incident took place.  The bus driver and the conductor were unable to contact RTC authorities until evening as the place of incident was in a remote area and did not have mobile network signals. Speaking to STOI, regional manager, RTC, Nageswara Rao said the route the bus was travelling on is in bad shape. The RTC had initially stopped services on the route but restored it on the request of the project officer, ITDA, to benefit tribals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/rear-wheels-disconnect-from-rtc-bus-passengers-escape-unhurt/articleshow/85932936.cms||Samson Raj
---||Kolkata||Election Commission slots Bhowanipore bypoll on September 30 after West Bengal’s ‘special request’||KOLKATA: The Election Commission on Saturday announced the bypoll to the Bhowanipore assembly constituency would be held on September 30, paving the way for Mamata Banerjee to take a shot at entering the state legislative assembly within six months of her being sworn in as the Bengal CM. The decision, the EC said, followed “a special request” from the Bengal government that highlighted the “constitutional exigency” of having the election and the risk of a “constitutional crisis and vacuum” if it was not held. State chief secretary HK Dwivedi wrote to the EC on September 1, stressing the “constitutuional exigency” of the Bhowanipore bypoll. Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee “intends to contest the election” in view of the “administrative exigencies and public interest and to avoid a vacuum in the state”, the letter said. Banerjee was sworn in as the CM of Bengal for the third time on May 5. She will cease to be a “minister” if she does not become a member of the state assembly within six months (by November 5), according to Article 164(4) of the Constitution. The EC on Saturday said it had decided to give the nod to the bypoll in Bhowanipore “considering the constitutional exigency and special request from Bengal”. “The state chief secretary informed that the Covid-19 situation was fully under control, the flood situation in the state had not affected the poll-bound constituencies and the state was fully geared up to hold the elections. He also cited Article 164(4) of the Constitution and the possibility of a constitutional crisis and vacuum in top executive posts in the government unless elections were held immediately,” the EC said. Two other Bengal assembly seats — Jangipur and Shamserganj, both in Murshidabad — will have bypolls on the same day. Counting for all three seats will be held on October 3. Veteran Trinamool candidate Sovandeb Chattopadhyay won Bhowanipore in the assembly polls earlier this year, bagging more than 57% votes, but then resigned from the assembly a few days later. Banerjee lost the polls from Nandigram by a narrow margin of 1,956 votes to the BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari, making it imperative for her to enter the legislative assembly from another constituency. The Trinamool has contested the Nandigram result and the case is sub-judice. Trinamool leaders welcomed the EC decision and said declaring Banerjee’s candidature from Bhowanipore was “a mere formality”. Posters welcoming Banerjee as the party candidate from Bhowanipore — she also stays in the constituency — came up within hours of the announcement. “Unnayan ghore ghore, ghorer meye Bhowanipore e (Every home will see progress as Bhowanipore’s daughter returns home),” read one of them. Banerjee is learnt to have cancelled her September 6-9 North Bengal trip. The last day for filing nominations is September 13. The Bengal BJP questioned the EC’s decision. “Bypolls are scheduled for five seats. I hope the EC is not being influenced,” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said. Bypolls are not being held in Khardah (where Trinamool winning candidate Kajal Sinha died of Covid after the polls were held), Gosaba (where the Trinamool’s Jayanta Naskar died of Covid after taking the MLA’s oath), Dinhata and Shantipur (where the BJP’s Nisith Pramanik and Subhas Sarkar won and then chose to resign after becoming central junior ministers). Banerjee, for most of the past three decades, has contested elections from the constituency where she is a voter. She was the Kolkata (South) MP from 1991 to 2011 and then the Bhowanipore MLA from 2011 to 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ec-slots-bhowanipore-bypoll-on-sept-30-after-states-special-request/articleshow/85936622.cms||---

These teams criss-cross the villages, meet and urge people get themselves vaccinated and make their villages Covid-free. The committee members are also clearing the doubts of villagers about vaccination. As possible third wave is likely to affect children, the teams are also encouraging children and their mothers, especially those with underweight and malnutrition issues, to get treatment at nearest PHCs or hospitals. As per sources in the women and children welfare department, the administration has identified 81 severe acute malnutrition, 5,331 moderate acute malnutrition children in the district. Instructions have been given to the teams to regularly conduct health check-up of children. Following the government direction, nurses and doctors of PHCs have started treating children with the help of paediatricians. Though the number of active cases dropped to 80 on Friday, the authorities ramped up daily testing samples from 1,200 to 2,200 to check the possible virus spread. District health officer Dr M C Ravi told STOI they have taken necessary measures to tackle the spread of the virus, including tight screening at check-posts and raising awareness among the villages with help from the committee members. “Cooperation of the public in maintaining hygiene and ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour are vital to fight the pandemic,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/panels-formed-to-spread-awareness-on-vaccination-in-chamarajanagar-villages/articleshow/85932190.cms||---
---||Chennai||Basmati row: MP govt’s demand for GI tag to be considered again||CHENNAI: In a reprieve to Madhya Pradesh, the Supreme Court has set aside an order of the Madras high court denying Geographical Indication (GI) tag to basmati rice grown in areas falling under the state. “We are of the opinion that the high court committed an error in not adjudicating the issue relating to the over-inclusion of areas in Madhya Pradesh forming part of the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) GI application,” said a bench comprising Justice L Nageswara Rao, Justice B R Gavai and Justice B V Nagarathna. The judges were passing the order on a plea moved by Madhya Kshetra Basmati Growers Association Samiti. Remanding the issue back to the high court for fresh consideration, the apex court directed Madras HC to decide the matter within three months, considering the importance of the issue. On February 27, 2020 a division bench of the Madras high court dismissed Madhya Pradesh’s plea seeking GI tag for basmati rice grown in areas falling under the state. The court also refused to quash an order passed by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) granting GI certificate for basmati to APEDA. Noting that for a same produce, two GI certificates of registration cannot be issued and precisely that is the reason why Madhya Pradesh has approached the court, the bench said: “At the same time, we have to observe that the petitioners have an alternative and efficacious remedy available by filing an application to the registrar of trade mark seeking to cancel or vary the GI certificate issued to APEDA.” The issue pertains to an order passed by IPAB February 5, 2016 granting GI certificate for basmati in favour of APEDA. Aggrieved, Madhya Pradesh contended that such GI tag cannot be awarded to APEDA as some of the regions falling under MP which also produce basmati has been omitted in the list provided by APEDA. However, observing that the documents and evidence filed by Madhya Pradesh show the importance, special characteristics of rice cultivated in the state but not the Basmati cultivation in the traditional growing area, the IPAB rejected its claim. In May 2010, GI status was given to basmati grown only in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttrakhand and parts of Western Uttar Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. Madhya Pradesh moved a statutory opposition demanding that its 13 districts be recognised as traditional basmati growing regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/basmati-row-mp-govts-demand-for-gi-tag-to-be-considered-again/articleshow/85934532.cms||Suresh Kumar

He told this reporter on Saturday that the function would be held with a limited audience in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Patna University (PU), on the other hand, will felicitate 149 teachers, who had retired between December 2000 and May 2010. Former vice-chancellor (VC) of PU, Rash Bihari Prasad Singh, will be the chief guest of the function to be held at Wheeler Senate House on Sunday. All the university officials, including the VC, pro-VC, deans of faculties, heads of departments, and principals of colleges, will attend the event. Meanwhile, other institutes of higher education will celebrate Teachers’ Day in both the offline and online modes, keeping the Covid safety protocols in mind. The students of Chanakya National Law University, for instance, will organise a virtual event for their teachers. Irrespective of group celebrations in colleges and universities, many students have decided to wish their teachers individually. Some of them have already sent greeting cards and gifts to their favourite professors. Priyanka, a student of Patna College, said she had couriered a bouquet and a photo frame to three professors she adores.

It was a reunion of a student with his teacher, who was truly overwhelmed to see a transformed boy and the co-founder of a $10 million worth software platform. It was in 2007 when Rahman had visited Super 30 with his father, who earned a paltry Rs150 per day to sustain his family. “For a teacher, nothing can be a greater gift from a student. His humility remains unchanged, though he has achieved a lot and is set for a lot more. The memory of his first visit just flashed in my mind when he came. And when he said he still recalled his classroom experience with him and the lessons he learnt not just about mathematics, but also life, I was truly overwhelmed with emotions. Rahman epitomises the huge talent in Bihar and how a little bit of encouragement and guidance can make it blossom,” said Anand. Rahman discussed his present work with Anand and how he set up the startup to innovate with email for modern business needs. Rahman said after studies, he worked in different firms for five years to help his family and pay back loans, but he always wanted to do something of his own.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/student-makes-anand-kumar-proud/articleshow/85934250.cms||---
---||Goa||Former Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar joins Congress||PANAJI: Former Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar, a close supporter of Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate, on Saturday joined Congress along with his supporters, in yet another indication that the tide in the capital is turning. A day earlier, Tony Rodrigues, Daya Karapurkar, Nagesh Karishetty and several other Monserrate aides entered the Congress fold. This is a ghar wapsi for me because I was a member of Congress right from 1984. We subsequently worked for Monserrate, and we followed him to every party from Congress to Goa Forward Party and even UGDP,” said Madkaikar. Madkaikar, who has been a Monserrate loyalist for decades and currently part of his ruling CCP panel, parted ways with him after being dropped as mayor. Monserrate installed his son Rohit in that position. Congress appears to be on an induction spree as it looks to wrest control of Taleigao, Panaji and Santa Cruz constituencies from BJP and the Monserrate family. Along with Madkaikar, former councillor Rahul Lotlikar and several others also joined Congress. “Monserrate has betrayed the people. Today if you look at Panaji, see the pathetic state it is in. Not one promise from his manifesto has been fulfilled,” said Madkaikar. He also said that he has not joined to contest elections, and would work for any candidate picked by Congress. However, Madkaikar has made it clear that he is interested in contesting against Monserrate in Panaji. “Babush Monserrate is a habitual defector. He failed to fulfil the aspirations of the party that helped him to win the elections and also abandoned the voters,” said Madkaikar. He claimed that Monserrate sidelined all his supporters while constituting the BJP Panaji mandal. Madkaikar and Rodrigues had met AICC Goa desk incharge Dinesh Gundu Rao and former finance minister P Chidambaram on August 26, after which they announced that they would be joining Congress. Rodrigues, a former CCP mayor, said he joined Congress as he felt he needed to do something to improve Taleigao, which is represented by Monserrate’s wife BJP MLA Jennifer. Meanwhile, social workers from Cumbarjua constituency Samil Volvoikar and Rajesh Phaldessai also joined Congress later in the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/former-panaji-mayor-madkaikar-joins-congress/articleshow/85936641.cms||---

Radhakrishnan on Saturday also asked Chennithala not to make Chandy a shield and hide behind it. He also said that he cannot approve whatever Chennithala said about Chandy. “Chandy is a very important leader and nobody in the state will agree to Chennithala’s statement that Chandy is being ignored. None of us believes it. I will not say anything that will weaken my party because my party is going through a period of crisis,” Radhakrishnan said. Meanwhile, Oommen Chandy, while responding to Radhakrishnan’s statement, said that Chennithala was a leader who had occupied important positions in the party at the national level and in the state. “I don’t think he needs anyone as a shield for doing public work. I know very well that he doesn’t need me as a shield,” said Chandy. Chennithala, who had lashed out at the current leadership of the state Congress party, had said that Chandy has been sidelined in the discussions related to the organization. Radhakrishnan, till the other day was the top leader in the faction of the Congress party led by two-time former chief minister Chandy. Recently he distanced himself from the faction, and instead got closer to new state party president K Sudhakaran. Regarding talks with the KPCC leadership, Chandy, who had earlier expressed his willingness for talks, said that it is the KPCC leadership who should decide about it. Chandy had said that he would cooperate if the KPCC leadership takes initiative to hold talks. He also said that if there were issues within the party they should be solved through talks. He said he will take part in the UDF meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/thiruvanchoor-flays-ramesh-chandy-defends/articleshow/85934582.cms||---

The students have planned an array of activities, such as dancing, singing, poetry and mimicry, to show love and affection to their teachers. St Xavier’s High School celebrated Teachers’ Day on Saturday with necessary precautions to avoid spread of Covid-19. “We felt overwhelmed after attending an offline event in the school after so long,” said Arpit Singh, a student of the school. Krishna Tiwary, a student of DAV Public School, Gola Road, said, “One of our teachers is retiring this year. We have planned to do something special for her this time.” Syed Yousuf, a student of Class XI at Loyola High School, said, “Our school will organise an one-hour long virtual event on the occasion of Teachers’ Day on Sunday. The event will start with an introduction to Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan on whose birth anniversary Teachers’ Day is celebrated. Singing, dancing, skit and speeches will also be organised.” Amisha Sahay, a Class IX student of St Joseph’s Convent High School, said, “This Teachers’ Day, I want to honour my favourite teacher, Smita Sinha. She is a little strict, but an excellent teacher. Everything she says goes straight into our heads.” Priyanka Verma, a Don Bosco Academy student, said, “We will celebrate the event virtually.

---||Patna||Bihar: Are youths steering away from teaching profession?||PATNA: A large number of institutions in the state are facing an acute shortage of faculty members and managing their academic activities with less than 50% of the sanctioned strength of teachers. Consequently, academics can’t help but wonder why this profession has lost its sheen. Many of them claim that the craze for teaching has declined considerably due to the fat pay packets and perks offered by multinationals. The former principal of Patna College, Nawal Kishore Chaudhary, observes that the appointment of teachers in Bihar is not made regularly. “Instead of becoming a teacher, talented students choose other jobs. Moreover, the requirement of PhD and NET for lectureship has only worsened the situation. By the time a student qualifies NET and gets a PhD, he loses interest in academic pursuits,” he adds. Another academic, Shiv Jatan Thakur, recalls that 100 teachers were appointed in Patna University (PU) in 2017 after a gap of 14 years. “Since then not a single teacher has been appointed although numerous posts are lying vacant. Frequent experimentation with the recruitment policy in the state has led to unwarranted delay in fresh appointments,” he says. According to some, the growing indifference of the government towards the provision of necessary infrastructure and competent teachers in educational institutions has led to a decline in academic standards. “The rampant use of unfair means in examinations and results, the faulty system of recruitment of teachers and ever-increasing commercialization of higher education have tarnished the image of this noble profession,” rues a retired Magadh University teacher, Mahesh Chandra Sharma. The former head of the geology department in PU, Ramesh Shukla, points out, “Earlier, toppers were inducted into the university service under the scheme of vice-chancellor’s appointment immediately after the publication of results of postgraduate examinations. In the long run, their services used to be regularised after an interview conducted by the BPSC. But the situation has deteriorated considerably after the end of the process of regular recruitment.” Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha, the working president of the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar, however, claims, “Good teachers are still respected in society and gain popularity among the students. Teachers, who do not hanker after money and develop a better rapport with students through constant guidance, act as a source of inspiration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/are-youths-steering-away-from-teaching-profession/articleshow/85932066.cms||B K Mishra

He had earlier sought an answer from the government as to why the land adjacent to RJD’s office could not be given to the party for expansion. On Saturday, Singh also took a jibe at CM Nitish Kumar, saying one who speaks lies has frustration on his face. On Friday, Nitish had turned angry when mediapersons asked him about RJD’s demand for allotting the land adjacent to its office for expansion. “Where is the land? Should I get the land from the sky?” Nitish had asked. Reacting to the CM’s remark, Singh said, “I am not saying that he has to get the land from the sky or from Nalanda or the place from where I belong. The land is available adjacent to the RJD office in the state capital.” Singh said he had raised the issue six months back. “The government’s stand that the land in question belongs to the high court pool is a mere excuse. The land can be exchanged. Where in the law exchange of land not permissible?” he asked. Giving his own example, Singh said the bungalow allotted to him when he was the cabinet minister has now been given to a high court judge and several such exchanges have been done. Singh also alleged that public money was used in the modification of JD(U) office here. Meanwhile, JD(U) state spokesperson and former MLC Ranbir Nandan criticised Singh for “doing politics” by raking up the land issue instead of appreciating the work done by the state government in tackling Covid-19. “Everyone is thinking about how to tackle the likely third of Covid pandemic, but RJD’s attention is on expansion of the party office. Singh has adopted RJD’s culture of criticising and putting baseless allegations on others,” Nandan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jagadanand-rjd-should-be-given-land-to-expand-party-office/articleshow/85934136.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Heavy cyclonic rain for two days on May 27 and 28 had also damaged maize crops in the eastern Bihar districts. Since then, at least five phases of floods have hit districts like West Champaran and East Champaran due to periodic heavy rain in Nepal and the north Bihar plains. Paddy and sugar cane crops were damaged due to the floods in north Bihar districts. “The state government had requested the Centre to send its team to assess the damage caused by the floods this year,” disaster management department (DMD) minister-cum-deputy CM Renu Devi said on Saturday. A BJP MLA, Renu represents the Bettiah assembly seat in West Champaran district. “The floods were severe in various districts. We did everything to provide relief to people and rescue the marooned people. Now the central team will make its own assessment of the damages caused by the floods,” the deputy CM added. Departments like agriculture, water resources, road construction, rural works, education, health and animal husbandry resources are busy updating the records regarding the damages caused to the crops, roads as well as government and private buildings. After the completion of the field assessment, the central team will also hold discussions with chief secretary Tripurari Sharan and DMD principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit. While there are 28 flood-prone districts in the state, as many as 16 of them were flooded by the north Bihar rivers, like the Gandak, Bagmati, Burhi Gandak, Kosi and Mahananda this year. The 16 districts concerned include West Champaran, East Champaran, Gopalganj, Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Saran, Khagaria, Samastipur, Saharsa, Madhepura, Supaul and Kishanganj. Water resources department sources said no major embankment was breached. At least 10 villages were flooded by the breaches in the minor bunds at Dagmara in Supaul and at Madhvapur on the borders of Madhubani and Sitamarhi district close to the Nepal border. Overall, 30 lakh people were affected by floods this year and the state government has transferred gratuitous relief worth Rs 477 crore to over 7.95 lakh families at the rate of Rs 6,000 per family till September 3.

While this has been a perennial issue, heavy rains over the last few days has filled up the UCIL tail and decantation ponds, with slurry water along with the waste flowing into the agricultural fields, resulting in crop loss. Following heavy rainfall over the last two days, the embankment of the tail pond located near KK Kottala village and Erravanka rivulet has caved in. Farmers of Mabbuchintapalli, Thummalapalli, Rachakuntapalle and KK Kottala fear their farmlands have been completely damaged due to the slurry. Members of Human Rights Forum expressed concerns that the contents of the tailing and decantation ponds linked to the UCIL mines could pose danger to the lives of local farmers as uranium tailings contain over a dozen radioactive nuclides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/farmers-concerned-as-ucil-tail-pond-slurry-floods-farmlands/articleshow/85932642.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Daily Covid tally drops in Mumbai, but KDMC sees over 100 cases after 40 days||MUMBAI: Covid cases in Mumbai dropped for the second consecutive day on Saturday but remained over 400 (413). In Maharashtra, the daily tally (4,130) continued to be under 4,500, which has been the case since August 30. Daily deaths were four in the city and 64 in the state. Dr Pradeep Awate, who heads surveillance in the state public health department, said the second wave has been controlled as the total test positivity rate in each of the state’s 34 districts has been less than 5% for the last five weeks. “Even though Mumbai has seen a rise in cases in the last one week, the test positivity rate is still around 1%,” he added. While cases in Mumbai had dropped below 200 in the third week of August, they have since doubled; experts however say the slight increase could be the result of easing of restrictions on travel and entertainment. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said that while cases and the daily positivity rate in the city had gone up, the number of critical cases and admissions hadn’t gone up proportionately. The number of critical cases have been fluctuating around 400 for a week now. Around 70% of the city’s Covid ICU beds are vacant. Cases in the Mumbai circle remained constant at 951 on Saturday, while other circles have been registering a steady drop. Cases in the Pune circle dropped to 1,560 on Saturday from over 2,500 a week ago. Meanwhile, after 40 days, the twin Kalyan-Dombivli city on Saturday reported over 100 Covid-19 cases in a day. On Saturday, 112 Covid-19 patients and two deaths were reported, taking the tally of patients there to 1.41 lakh and toll to 2,731. On July 26, the KDMC belt had reported 102 patients in a day. As per KDMC’s health data of the 112 patients, Dombivli East reported 42, Kalyan West 31, Kalyan East 14 and Dombivli West reported 17 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-daily-tally-drops-in-city-but-kdmc-sees-over-100-cases-after-40-days/articleshow/85936630.cms||---

---||Mysuru||Rain opens up potholes on city roads||Mysuru: The city roads are now crying for a facelift. After a few spells of heavy rainfall, many roads have developed potholes posing challenges to drivers and bike riders. Mayor Sunanda Palanetra has assured that patch works will be taken up soon and drainages will be cleared to ensure there are no waterlogging-related issues. City residents allege that in many places, the condition of roads has become pathetic, posing a danger to drivers during rains. They allege that even after repeated complaints to the local authorities no action is taken. Bike riders say this problem is not limited to any single locality. They allege that when it rains, rainwater flows on the road as the drains are blocked in many places. They add that if they lodge a complaint with ward level officers or corporators, the common answer they get is there are no funds for any repair works. Panduranga G Shetty, a resident of Niveditha Nagar, said most roads in his area now need a facelift. “For the last one year, no repair works were taken up. The roads connecting the residential area also not an exception. There is an urgent need to take up repair works. Else, people will suffer a lot,” he said. “In many corporations, now concrete roads are being developed as a solution to potholes. MCC must stop finding temporary solutions. Instead, it must think about a sustainable, long-term solution,” he said. Mayor Sunanda said she will take up patch works and drain clearing drive on priority basis. “There are no ward-level funds now. But I will ensure these issues will be addressed soon,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/rain-opens-up-potholes-on-city-roads/articleshow/85933223.cms||Shrinivasa M
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Gurus’ leap of imagination bridged the tech gap in pandemic||AHMEDABAD: Raghav Katakiya, a teacher from Mitiyala in Amreli, for the past one year has been running ‘mobile school’ right from his bike. “My students from various villages could not reach school so I am bringing school to them,” he said. Katakiya, who’s profiled by the Ravi J Matthai Centre for Education Innovation (RJMCEI) at IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A), is part of the 800-odd teachers whose initiatives during the Covid-19 pandemic are documented as part of the innovation bank. As Sunday would mark Teachers’ Day, for the state schools it’s the day to celebrate many teachers who went out of their way to beg, borrow and innovate during the pandemic. These Gujarat teachers ensured education reached economically backward students in rural areas, who, unlike their urban counterparts, did not have access to TV screens or mobile phones. Like Katakiya, Deepak Mota in Mandvi, Kutch, developed an e-bicycle powered by solar cells to take online classes to most economically backward students. The Rs 18,000 bike provides backdrop to his open classroom with laptop and speakers. Prof Vijaya Sherry Chand, chairperson of RJMCEI, said that the pandemic exposed the existing digital divide in the society. “Teachers were quick to realize it. Their primary worry was that the students would forget the teachings, and would be devoid of formal education for a long period. Thus, they started innovating and reaching out to them,” he said. He added that the teachers from across Gujarat have networked heavily with like-minded teachers to learn the ropes of new technology and educational innovations. “Covid-19 has raised acceptance of informal schools across the country. The e-bicycle ensures children in remote areas are not deprived of education,” says Mota of his innovation which has been replicated by other school teachers in Gujarat and Maharashtra. In Mehsana, Ravi Patel of Cluster Resource Centre in Suraj village in Jotana taluka raised funds to install 75 television sets with DTH connections across 10 villages of the area. In Patan, a desperate parent and an equally desperate principal joined hands to reach education to students using the cable TV network to help tide over problems faced studying through mobile phones. After his daughter complained of difficulties in studying on phone, Mayur Goswami, a cable TV operator in Sankeshwar town met Ashok Dave, the principal of DP Prajapati School and education started beaming on people’s homes. Instead of classrooms, the teachers took their classroom sessions from a big hall with multiple cameras in action. The editing was done in a local studio and each session was telecast using the cable TV network. Some 2,000 students in over 70 villages have been receiving education during the Covid-19 school shutdown using the system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gurus-leap-of-imagination-bridged-the-tech-gap-in-pandemic/articleshow/85935072.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The government has already written to the banks through the lead bank, requesting them to post their business correspondents in every RBK. An official communication was sent to the lead bank last week, which in turn has written to the other banks, sources said. The government has established over 11,000 RBKs in the state to provide one-stop services to farmers. The RBKs provide seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and maintain records on farmers, crops and cropping pattern. They also help farmers find a market for their produce. The government has already planned provision of agriculture tools at RBKs, which the farmers can hire and use for a nominal price. The government is also procuring harvesters, tractors and other machines for farmers’ use. Similarly, the government is also constructing cold storages and godowns attached for each RBK, where farmers can stock their produce till they get a better price in the market. Having planned all these services at RBKs, the government is now planning to launch banking services. Initially, in Krishna district, the government had started these financial services with business correspondents located across 634 RBKs. The business correspondents are present in the RBKs every day for at least two hours and help farmers in particular, as well as the general public carry out bank transactions. Most banks have business correspondents posted in major villages, and who currently operate out of private premises. Now, they would be shifted to the RBKs. The government has written to the banks through the lead bank, requesting that business correspondents be posted in every RBK.

In a statement on Saturday, the finance minister said the state has not violated borrowing norms, despite the Covid-19 crisis. The minister said the government has spent Rs 7,130.19 crore in fighting the pandemic, besides spending another Rs 25,914.13 crore on children’s education, including renovation of schools under the Nadu-Nedu programme. Old age pensions alone cost the state exchequer Rs 37,461.89 crore, he said. Stating the present government has borrowed Rs 1,27,105.81 crore in the two-and-a-half years since it came to power, of which Rs 1,05,102.22 crore were given to the people under various direct benefit schemes, the finance minister asserted that borrowing and spending were both transparent and within the limits of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act. Adding that the state government is permitted to borrow at 3% of the GSDP, the finance minister said it had availed an additional 2% due to the relaxation by the Centre due to the Covid-19 crisis. He further said the opposition TDP had no right to point a finger at the present government as the TDP had increased the debt burden to Rs 2.57 lakh crore in five years, besides adding another Rs 1 lakh crore through various corporations, including discoms, APSRTC and Tidco. The finance minister added that this government was spending every rupee on peoples’ welfare. He said the present government had not gone back on the promises it made to the people, unlike the TDP, and accused the opposition party of betraying farmers and the women in self-help groups (SHGs).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/min-debunks-tdps-debt-charge-says-govt-borrowing-transparent/articleshow/85932772.cms||Gopi Dara

The EOU sleuths seized documents and related evidence of a plot of land at Digha Bagicha, two shops in a shopping mall near Saguna Mor (Danapur) and flats at Faridabad in Haryana and Delhi’s NCR. EOU’s ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said a DA case was lodged against Rawat on Friday and search warrants were obtained from the competent court. The raids were conducted at his house in Nasariganj near Danapur, a flat on Boring Road in Patna, and his ancestral house at Mianbigha village under Hilsa subdivision in Nalanda district. The house of his cousin Awadhesh Rawat at Darogakuan was also searched. Rawat was suspended as DSP of Bhojpur Sadar after initial investigation revealed that he had close links with illegal sand mining mafias operating in the district. He is the second DSP-rank officer after Tanveer Ahmed against whom the EOU has registered a disproportionate assets (DA) case after their suspension for alleged nexus with sand smugglers. The EOU sleuths had searched Tanveer’s residential premises in Patna and West Champaran on Wednesday. A senior officer associated with the investigation said Rawat had investments in share market, bank fixed deposits and insurance policies. He said Rawat had amassed huge wealth through illegal means during his posting in Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, East Champaran, Khagaria and Bhojpur districts. He has also invested huge sum in the name of his wife and relatives, who were also on the radar of the investigating agency. Another officer associated with the investigation said Rawat had accumulated properties almost 70 times more than his actual income. His father, Rajendra Rawat, retired as an engineer from railways. Besides Rawat and Tanveer, a DA case was also lodged against Sunil Kumar Singh, who was suspended earlier as the SDO of Dehri-on-Sone in Rohtas district.

The women returned home after nearly two months in judicial custody on Friday on bail. Rioting had taken place in Kalol with police and vehicles being targeted after an accused in an assault case was picked up by the police. Policemen were injured in the incident and 117 persons were arrested by police in connection with the rioting later. Deputy superintendent of police, Harpalsinh Rathod said that the women who were accused in the case were granted bail on Thursday. “They were in the Vadodara jail and were brought to Kalol on Friday,” he said. When the vehicle carrying the women reached Kalol, a crowd gathered near the fish market on the Kacheri Road and crowded the vehicle from all sides. The crowd kept swelling as time passed while slogans were also raised by the crowd present at the site. Videos of the incident show that even the balconies of houses on the street were packed with onlookers. The viral videos were even edited with addition of song and dialogue. Rathod said that not only had people assembled in large numbers, they were also not observing Covid guidelines by wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. The accused have been booked under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code, Epidemic Act and the Disaster Management Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/kalol-riot-accused-get-rousing-welcome/articleshow/85934706.cms||---

In the earlier stint of post-Covid resumption, it took five months to attain the milestone. The city’s transport lifeline registered 2,57,453 passengers on Friday, less than two months after it restarted operations on July 16. The carrier now runs 240 trains from Monday to Friday. From Monday, the last trains will leave terminals at 9.30pm instead of 9pm and Metro Railway will add six services to accommodate the increase in passenger load. Metro is currently the most viable option of transport, with very few buses plying. It is also the cheapest with skyrocketing fuel prices affecting normal and app-cab fares. Instead, one can travel the entire 32km of the North-South line, from Dakshineswar to Kavi Subhas, for just Rs 25. When the carrier had resumed services after last year’s lockdown on September 14, the passenger count was only around 20,000. But trains were chock-a-block from the first day, prompting the authorities to add trains — from 192 to the current 220 services — and extend operation hours. The passenger count jumped from 1.2 lakh to 1.7 lakh in the first seven days. During the last week, the count had been hovering around 2.4 lakh until it touched 2.5 lakh on the last weekday. Before the pandemic, Metro ran 288 services from Monday to Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-daily-rider-count-over-2-5l/articleshow/85933993.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Officials said the ASHA workers are also being trained under the aegis of Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan. They will counsel the pregnant women, inform them about the precautions to be taken during pregnancy and also figure out the expected date of delivery. Master trainers Seema Kumari, Sunil Kumar and Rajesh Kumar besides the team of doctors, including district health immunisation officer (DHIO) Dr Manoj Kumar Chowdhary, regional health director Dr Suresh Prasad Sinha, regional programme officer Arun Prakash, regional coordinator (Asha) Kunal Kumar and others are engaged in the training of ASHA workers. DHIO Dr Manoj Kumar Chowdhary said the trainers’ teams and doctors are trying to prepare the ASHA workers so that they can assist the pregnant women in rural areas and provide better healthcare services to them. “Identification of pregnant women through household surveys and providing healthcare services at the doorstep are the objectives of the training programme. The ASHA workers will assist the pregnant women if they need hospitalisation or pathological tests,” he said. He added, “The master trainers are also trying to create awareness on provisions enshrined in the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTPA) of 1971 among the Asha workers so that they can counsel the women about their responsibilities and duties for the termination of certain pregnancies.

These pressure swing adsorption plants sourced using funds from PM Cares and corporate social responsibility, officials say, are less preferred and cost more. Two bio-medical engineers have been trained in every district to run each of these machines at least once a month and continue maintenance. The state has 222 oxygen generation plants -- including 161 in government hospitals – which together can generate 235 tonnes of oxygen. After the oxygen crisis in May, the state issued orders for installation of these units at various medical college hospitals, Covid and district headquarters hospitals. At least 70 plants came with funds from PM Cares and 91 others are being installed using CSR funds. Officials say commissioning of 120 units, which have a capacity to generate 113 tonnes a day, has been completed. Yet, the amount of liquid medical oxygen the state buys continues to hover between 65-70 tonnes a day. Many hospitals are yet to use these plants to its full potential and still depend on liquid medical oxygen.Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation managing director Deepak Jacob said “This was expected.” “These plants are being installed as a backup to liquid medical oxygen for several reasons. First, maintenance and overheads such as electricity bills for running these plants make it more expensive than the liquid medical oxygen,” he said. “Some hospitals connect pipes from these plants to a particular ward and use them only when there are adequate patients in the ward,” he said.Doctors at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, where admissions are higher, is planning to use the two plants on campus in a couple of wards from next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/standby-oxygen-plants-in-hospitals-need-maintenance/articleshow/85934550.cms||---

Earlier, Mukul Roy, Tanmoy Ghosh and Biswajit Das had joined Trinamool despite efforts by Bengal BJP leaders to keep the party flock together. Soumen, a Mukul loyalist, had joined BJP after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls just like Bagda MLA Biswajit Das. After taking the TMC flag from Chatterjee, he apologised for leaving Trinamool. “Even after I quit Trinamool, my mind and soul was with the party. I do not subscribe to the divisive ideology of BJP. I want to be a part of the development work Didi has taken up in north Bengal. The state’s culture doesn’t match with BJP’s culture,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/another-bjp-mla-quits-4th-to-join-tmc/articleshow/85939193.cms||---

Head of the GMC’s department of forensic medicine and toxicology Dr Andre Fernandes and head of gynaecology Dr Guruprasad Pednekar are also part of the panel. The panel has been given ten days to submit its findings with regards to three points raised in the complaint filed by the teen’s father. The postmortem had revealed that the teen died due to drowning. While her family accepted the body and conducted the last rites, they later suspected foul play. The viscera were not retained for chemical analysis as no request was received from police. On Friday, the teen’s father registered a complaint at Calangute police station that his daughter was murdered, and raised three points to substantiate his claim. After which, Calangute PI Nolasco Raposo wrote to GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar to constitute a medical board to examine the postmortem report and give opinions on three points raised by the complainant. One of the points raised pertained to postmortem lividity — settling of blood under the influence of gravity which develops in the early postmortem interval — that was found on the back of the deceased. The body was found by lifeguards at around 7am, while the postmortem was conducted in the afternoon. An explanation has been sought about bruises found on the body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-teen-death-gmc-forms-3-doc-panel-to-review-postmortem-report/articleshow/85936668.cms||---

According to bird lovers, the majority of the dead birds were Indian spot billed ducks. In the past too many incidents of birds and fish deaths were reported at the lake. Suresh Bhatt, president of Lakhota nature club, said, “The main reason for this death is pollution. There are some hospitals and some brass factories that illegally dispose of waste material into the lake.” Lakhota is a natural lake. Its beautification project was carried out by Jamnagar Municipal Corporation (JMC) a few years ago.

Around Rs 22.5 lakh of the stolen money was transferred to the accounts of the three suspects held in Gwalior, said the police. SP Amit Sanghi said they were alerted by the Mumbai crime branch. “One of them is a director of a coaching class and the other two are his students. They are in Class 12 and were paid Rs 20,000 each for receiving the stolen money in their bank accounts,” Sanghi said. “They feigned ignorance about the hacking and said they only forwarded it to another account for which they were paid,” the SP said. The trio has been taken to Mumbai on a production warrant. The digital robbery took place on the intervening night of August 14 and 15, say police. A key accused, a Nigerian named Martin, was arrested by Mumbai police, and his interrogation threw up the Gwalior lead. The stolen money was transferred into 87 accounts, including three in Gwalior. The tutorial’s director, 28-year-old Ravi Raje, was arrested seven years ago by the Indore crime branch in another case, said police. A resident of Banshipura area in Murar, he is an MA in English and has been running a coaching centre for four years for public service or bank exams. The police are looking for a suspect named Raj who had linked up the trio with the Nigerian hacker. The police suspect the two juveniles may not know a lot about the case. It is likely they handed over their KYCs to their coaching director on the promise of money without realizing what they were getting into, said a source. “It seems Ravi was actively involved in the crime. The other two are from poor families and fell into his lure for ‘commission’ against the transactions,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rs-5-5cr-digital-theft-trail-leads-cops-to-mp-coaching-class/articleshow/85936726.cms||P Naveen

According to him, the ruling and opposition fronts in the state were trying out a new politics post the emergence of Taliban to power in Afghanistan. “What is being carried out in the state is the deconstruction of real history. Political leaders in Kerala are competing with each other to nurture zealotry. A newspaper in Kerala is speaking as Taliban’s mouthpiece,” he alleged in a news conference here. Surendran accused the state government and police of maintaining an irresponsible attitude when the presence of extremist elements is on the rise and termed very serious the recent arrest of Kashmiris for keeping guns without valid license. “It was the Telangana police who took into custody those who were running a parallel telephone exchange at Kakkanad in Ernakulam. The telephone exchange which had links with gold smuggling was controlled from Pakistan. Those who were accused in the Thiruvananthapuram and Karippur gold smuggling case also have used this parallel telephone exchange. But the Kerala police have not taken any action against the parallel exchange,” Surendran claimed. The BJP state president said that a police raj was in force in Kerala and claimed CPI leader Annie Raja was indirectly targeting CPM fraction in the police when she said RSS gang was at work in Kerala police, he said. Surendran also blamed the state government for the surge in covid cases in Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/surendran-sees-bid-to-whitewash-malabar-revolt/articleshow/85934660.cms||---

At a video conference with the deputy commissioners of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and other border districts on Saturday, Bommai said more tests should be conducted in border areas of the districts. “The district administrations should take all necessary measures to reduce the positivity rate. Meanwhile, police should ensure that people adhere to the guidelines during night curfew and weekend curfew strictly. Act against those who violate the Covid-19 guidelines sternly,” the CM directed. Interacting with reporters after the video conference in Bengaluru, Bommai said: “I have spoken to deputy commissioners of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi during the video conference and taken stock of the Covid-19 situation there.

---||Mumbai||First para-athlete to win an Arjuna spins back the wheel of time||I thought you had died," a vegetable vendor in Pune's Yerwada said to 71-year-old Shernaz Poonekar aka "rickshaw wali madam" last Diwali on seeing her trademark green hand-controlled three-wheeler after a long, Covid-induced gap. The forty-year-old vehicle--that has become a part of Shernaz's identity--was red when cricketer Vijay Merchant gifted it to her in 1979 soon after she won a coveted Indian archer-shaped trophy. The trophy's arrow had come loose before it reached her strong arms. "Disabled award for disabled athlete," Shernaz had quipped, making president Neela Sanjeeva Reddy laugh and supplying a ready-made headline to an evening daily. "Indira Gandhi invited me later. On seeing the trophy, she smiled to herself," recalls the septuagenarian who was Shernaz Kermani--a spunky, whiskey-and-soda-favouring 28-year-old--when she became the first Indian para athlete to win an Arjuna award for earning India a bevy of medals in various sports from javelin to swimming. While the medals now sit locked away in a bank vault, Shernaz--who is recovering from a fall she suffered after a bout of dengue earlier this year--cooks, cleans, cares for pet strays Caramel and Whoopi and cries inwardly on seeing the young crop of medal-winning Indian Paralympians being celebrated. Dignity was an elusive resource during her time when lack of wheelchairs meant that airplane crew lifted the differently-abled like "sacks of rice" and para-athletes-in-the-making crawled on the floor of Andheri's Cheshire Home, a residential facility for persons with disabilities built in 1955. "You swim with a wheelchair?" the ignorant would ask Shernaz, a paraplegic from birth, whose swimmer mother had introduced her to the sea (which Shernaz hated for its "creepy-crawlies") and later to a Dadar swimming pool where she learnt to float as a form of exercise. Her mother also coaxed Grant Road's Queen Mary school into giving Shernaz an admission in 1950s Bombay when kids with disabilities studied in special schools. The school principal, one Miss Shelton, not only taught Shernaz things like housekeeping and pet care but also ensured that she participated in all kinds of sport. Shernaz isn't proud of her international debut as a swimmer in 1968 at Israel's Stoke Mandeville Games, a contest for spinal injury patients started by German neurosurgeon and father of the Paralympic movement Dr Ludwig Guttmann. "I came in last," says the septuagenarian, recalling an Italian coach there who praised her strokes and told her that she needed better training. What made up was the bronze she won in a wheelchair race at the same event in 1972 when she had flown down to England with her wooden Indian-make wheelchair. Her physiotherapist managed to fetch her a racing wheelchair three hours before the contest. Later in 1976, when several countries withdrew from Toronto's Paralympic Games due to the participation of apartheid-stricken South Africa, a freedom-seeking Shernaz got on a bus from Canada to the US, applied to Pennsylvania's Edinboro University and won a full scholarship to study psychology in an institute where her nationality would become her nickname. "Professors there couldn't pronounce my name. They called me 'Indian'," recalls the veteran, who read for the blind, clinked whiskey-glasses with boyfriends, swam in Speedos and discovered while training with men that speed was her real strength. Soon, she was lapping up medals at events such as American National Wheelchair Olympics, where she always identified herself by the nickname conferred by her American professors. It was then Indian ambassador to the US, Nani Palkhivala who requested Shernaz to fill the form for the Arjuna award, following which the para-athlete moved to Pune and waded through severe opposition to marry an able-bodied Maharashtrian Brahmin army surgeon named Pradip Poonekar. While she quit both sports and whiskey after getting pregnant at age 40, Shernaz--who has seen politicians "use and abuse paraplegics" during events such as cycle distribution photo-ops--later distanced herself from the world para-sports and is now a trustee of an animal shelter. Her daughter Karishma, who runs a diabetic-friendly bakery, worries about her diabetic mother. "I've made many enemies. I'm incapable of sweet-talking," admits Shernaz, who had once discarded a scripted pro-government Marathi speech at the inauguration of a paraplegic home to place the accessibility needs of paraplegics in front of dignitaries including Indira Gandhi. "You have to speak up for what you want," believes the 71-year-old, who has lately stopped attending the local mohalla committee meetings because they tend to lack direction. As if a proverbial arrow had come loose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/first-para-athlete-to-win-an-arjuna-spins-back-the-wheel-of-time/articleshow/85936784.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

---||Allahabad||Now RO suppliers to seek NOC before extracting groundwater||Prayagraj: With multifold rise in the demand of RO water in the city and mushrooming RO plants in the city as well as rural areas, the groundwater department has made NOC must for all those who are directly extracting ground water, either for personal or commercial use. Failing to get registered, the plant could be ceased. A task force would be constituted, which would keep a tap on the number of RO plant operators or other commercial users of ground water in the district. It would also see if they duly submitting the fee against extracting the water for their plant or not. From marriage halls to domestic users, anyone who is extracting underground water would have to take NOC from the groundwater department. The NOC can be taken through online mode. A registration fee of Rs 5000 has to be paid to the department. According to rough estimates, there are around 1,200 to 1,500 RO water plants functioning in the district and more than 7,000 boring are being operated without taking NOC from the department. Due to the rapid increase in the consumption of RO water in both urban and rural areas, the price of RO water has increased. Barely six months ago, a can of 20 litres of RO water was available for Rs 20, which is now being sold for Rs 30 to 35. According to assistant engineer, UP Groundwater Department, Archana Singh, “There are four areas categorised by the department and there are different charges for water extracting in these areas. For withdrawing 500 cubic meters of water per day in a ‘safe’ area, a fee of 90 paise will have to be paid. On the other hand, Rs 1 in the ‘semi-critical’ area and Rs 1.10 in the ‘critical’ area will have to be paid. Those setting up plants in over exploited areas will have to pay Rs 1.20”. She said the department has also fixed slab of the fee to be paid on the basis of water being extracted per day. This would be from 500-1000 cubic meters, 1000-1500, 1500-2000,” she said. So far, only 12 people have applied for NOC, of which five have been approved, she added. To keep a vigil on the RO operators, a taskforce is being formed in the district, block and gram sabha level. The taskforce would include officials from the district administration, irrigation department, district industries unit, regional officer of Pollution board and ground water department. The department has also sought a list of marriage halls from Prayagraj development Authority (PDA) and Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC). After surveying them, water tax will be collected from them. The official also clarified that although procuring an NOC is mandatory, farmers and domestic users will not be charged anything.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/now-ro-suppliers-to-seek-noc-before-extracting-groundwater/articleshow/85936262.cms||---

He said he had lost peace of mind while serving in that party. This proves the situation prevailing there. Everyone had witnessed what has happened to a senior leader like A V Gopinath in Palakkad,” Vijayan said. “The problems in the Congress are natural and were expected. But I am not ready to comment further since it is their internal matter,” said the chief minister. Muttil tree fellingThe chief minister said action will be taken against all those who are involved Muttil illegal tree felling case. He was commenting on the Dharmadom connection the people involved in the case was having. “There is no connection with any of the people involved in the crime and any such links, if claimed, will not become a relief for them in the investigation,” he said. ‘Can’t blame entire police force’The chief minister said isolated incidents of police misbehaving with the people should not be seen as a character of the entire police force. “Those police officers who are misbehaving with the people will face action and there should not be any doubt in that. However, this does not mean that the police force in the state is weak. The state is known for its law and order and no communal tension has occurred in the state over the past five years. Now, the government is gearing up to increase the women force in the state police. The aim is to appoint 15% of women in the entire police force,” he added. Pay commission recommendationsThe chief minister said the recommendations submitted by the pay commission will be discussed with the people and organizations concerned before taking a final decision on implementing them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/crisis-in-cong-looks-set-to-worsen-pinarayi/articleshow/85934729.cms||---

It will be the first double-decker flyover in Patna and the second in Bihar. It will be constructed with an expenditure of Rs422 crore in three years. It will also connect the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH). Bihar’s first double-decker flyover (3.5km-long) is coming up at Chhapra in Saran district. It will be India’s longest double-decker flyover. CM Nitish had laid its foundation on July 11, 2018. According to the Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited (BRPNNL) officials, the longest double-decker flyover at present is of 1.8km in Mumbai. Speaking on the occasion, Nitish said construction of this flyover became necessary as the widening of the Ashok Rajpath was not possible due to non-availability of land in its vicinity and the increasing traffic congestion on the busy road. Recalling his student days in the Patna Science College and later Bihar College of Engineering (now NIT-Patna), Nitish said the PMCH, also situated on the Ashok Rajpath, was being developed into a world-class hospital and this flyover would also link its proposed multi-level parking. “Once upgraded, the PMCH will be a 5400-bed hospital. Work has already started. The people visiting the PMCH and students of numerous schools, colleges and other institutions located in the area would have more convenience after completion of this flyover.” Referring to the recent public protest over proposed demolition of the front portion of the Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library due to the construction of this flyover, Nitish said, “I have told officials that there would be no alteration in its existing buildings and structure. I, as the CM, have visited the library several times since 2006. How many CMs had visited the library earlier?” He said the width of the flyover will be reduced a little in front of the library to save its George Curzon reading hall from demolition. “Total length of tier-1 (from Patna Science College to Kargil Chowk) will be 1.50km, while that of tier-2 (from Kargil Chowk to Patna Science College) will be 2.20km. Each tier will have a two-lane road,” Khurshid Karim, senior project manager of Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited (BRPNNL), told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-lays-stones-for-patnas-first-double-decker-flyover/articleshow/85932766.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand: BJP demands temple in assembly after allocation of namaz room||RANCHI: Protesting against the earmarking of a dedicated room for offering namaz inside the state’s new assembly secretariat, opposition BJP on Saturday demanded that the speaker, Rabindra Nath Mahto, allots a space for a Hanuman temple on the assembly premises. Ruling JMM has, however, rubbished the BJP’s demands. Talking to reporters at the BJP office here, Ranchi MLA C P Singh accused the Hemant Soren government of “indulging in appeasement politics and religious polarization”. He said, “We are not against any religion and in this country and as per our Constitution, everyone is free to practice the faith of their choice. Having said so, Parliament and vidhan sabhas are regarded as the temple of democracy and not for any specific religion. Therefore, if the state assembly speaker can provide space for namaz, we also urge him to provide a place for setting up a Hanuman temple.” Singh stressed that their demand is genuine considering the number of MLAs in the House who practice the Hindu religion. “Of the 82 members, four MLAs are from different communities. The majority of the remaining legislators are Hindus. Moreover, there are many staff of the assembly who are Hindus. Hence, we demand a Hanuman temple so that we, too, can pray. If the assembly or the government has a crisis of funds in constructing the temple, we are ready to build it provided we get an earmarked place. The assembly and the state government must respect the demands of other religions, too,” he added. Speaker Rabindranath Mahto could not be contacted for his comments but sources said the provision for namaz existed before. It was, however, ended during the BJP’s rule between 2014 and 2019. Singh, a five-time MLA countered it saying he wasn’t aware of any such formal designated place. “Even when I was the Speaker during the previous coalition government of BJP, there was no such place. Some MLAs had demanded an early adjournment of the House on Fridays to offer the jumma namaz, but I had then told them that they are free to go and offer namaz but stalling the House won’t be appropriate since other MLAs, too, are elected public representatives and their time is crucial,” he said. Former chief minister Raghubar Das, too, criticized the move to earmark the namaz room and warned of a massive stir in the coming days against the provision. He said, “BJP will not be a mute spectator to the state government’s blatant attempt for religious polarization. This was never done before in any temple of democracy. If the order isn’t taken back, the party will launch massive stirs from sadan to sadak (assembly to streets).” Taking a strong exception to the BJP’s remarks, JMM central general secretary, Supriyo Bhattacharya claimed that the provision for a prayer room exists not only in Parliament but also in all state legislative assembly buildings across the country. “In 1950 when we adopted the Constitution, it was a conscious decision to embrace secularism but BJP is attacking every fabric of democracy now,” he claimed. Asking the party to refrain from politicking on communal lines, Bhattacharya said the provision existed in the state’s old assembly building as well and BJP, when in the ruling coalition, had no objections to it back then. Veteran congressman, Furkan Ansari, who was an MLA for many terms and was also an MP, defended the assembly’s move. The father of the current Jamtara MLA, Irfan Ansari, said after the formation of Jharkhand and its assembly, the state’s first chief minister, Babulal Marandi, in consultation with the first assembly speaker, Inder Singh Namdhari, had provisioned for a separate room to offer namaz on the assembly premises. “In 2000, it was Marandi ji, who introduced it so that the Muslim staff don’t face problems while offering namaz at the assembly. Giving space for namaz doesn’t mean that it is converted into any Idgah, but just earmarking a clean place to offer prayers. Ironically, after his return to BJP again, he (Marandi) is silent on it now. BJP’s only agenda is to stoke hate,” Furkan claimed. It may be noted that on September 2, the state assembly secretariat had notified a room (TW-348) for offering namaz. The matter, however, gained traction since Saturday morning, a day after the commencement of the ongoing monsoon session, with the notification letter going viral. Since then, a war of words erupted between the ruling and the opposition camps throughout the day over the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/bjp-demands-temple-in-assembly-after-allocation-of-namaz-room/articleshow/85941262.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: A language teacher who developed ‘learning apps’||RAJKOT: When schools were locked due to the Covid pandemic, educators were left with no option but to search for learning tools to overcome the distance barrier. But many years before the lockdown, Nahid Khan Ligari, a teacher working at a district panchayat-run school in Junagadh district, had tapped on to the benefits of alternative modes of learning and developed ‘learning apps’. What more, he also devised a way to overcome the internet connectivity issue, by developing apps that worked in offline mode too. What makes his efforts even more praiseworthy is that apart from facing the usual ‘limited or no resources issue’, Ligari also had no ‘technical or software’ background. A language teacher, Ligari teaches Gujarati, Hindi and English. Yet he took the pains of learning the basics of app developing. The desire to make education accessible to all fired him on, says Ligari. “I was always thinking of making education available to the students at their doorsteps,” Ligari said. Ligari’s work was recognized by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). He was recently conferred with the ‘National Information Communication & Technology’ award by the NCERT. Ligari has developed two apps so far — an encyclopedia and a dictionary. Once downloaded on mobile phones, the two apps work in offline mode. The Internet is needed only at the time of app update. The encyclopedia, developed in 2015, provides general knowledge to primary students. It has three sections providing information about — Gujarat state, its tourist spots and animals and birds found here. The encyclopedia opens with a map of Gujarat with detailed information about each district. By going through the map of a district, the students get information about its history, geography, tourist spots and other important aspects. The fauna section gives the students basic information about animals and birds, living in different parts of the state, along with their photos and sound. “The app has got around 20,000 downloads till date,” Ligari says proudly. “I am constantly updating this app. Students need the internet only while updating the app,” he adds. So, how come a language teacher was able to develop these apps? “It was possible thanks to my brother. He holds a Master of Computer Application (MCA) degree. I learned the basics of software engineering from him,” Ligari said. After the encyclopedia, Ligari set his sight on his forte, the language. He developed an English to Gujarati dictionary for students of Class 3 to 8 students. It has 2,500 words and is being updated constantly. It can be downloaded in PDF format so that it can be put up at school notice boards or other places. Ligari also compressed the videos prepared by Gyankunj, an initiative of Gujarat council of elementary education. He compressed 2GB videos of four subjects to 35 MB so that students can easily download and store it in their mobile phones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/a-language-teacher-who-developed-learning-apps/articleshow/85934601.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Delhi||AAP: Police don’t want to nab real riot culprits||New Delhi: AAP MLA Atishi on Saturday alleged that Delhi Police is not conducting proper investigations in the northeast Delhi riots cases and added that chargesheets in only 35 out of over 700 cases have been filed so far. Claiming that Delhi Police has no intention of catching the real culprits, the AAP functionary asked LG and Delhi Police who they were trying to protect in all these cases. “Delhi saw a horrific series of riots in February 2020. Even after 1.5 years of it, Delhi Police has taken no action or conducted any proper investigation, and it is evident from the fact that the courts have repeatedly questioned the investigation of Delhi Police, which comes under the BJP government. Why is Delhi Police not carrying out a proper investigation for these riots? Is it protecting someone in the investigation?” Atishi asked in a press conference. “In February 2020, Justice Murlidhar of Delhi High Court asked the police why they had not taken any action on the videos that contained inflammatory speeches of politicians. Delhi Police replied that they did not see those videos. Then the court pulled up the police and showed them the videos in the court itself,” she said. In one of the cases, the court granted bail to a 65-year-old man and observed that he was the victim of the riots, Atishi said. Over appointment of special prosecutors, the MLA said, “Delhi Police sent a list to the Delhi government suggesting names of lawyers to be appointed as special prosecutors. The government refused to appoint those special prosecutors because if Delhi Police appointed special prosecutors, then there are high chances of collusion. When the government appointed their own special prosecutors, the LG revoked the decision. The government also went to the high court for the same and the matter is still sub judice.” Police refused to comment on this issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-police-dont-want-to-nab-real-riot-culprits/articleshow/85936823.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Additional measures are being taken in the 13 wards, even as the number of cases is falling in rural areas. While the district recorded nearly 2,300 cases in the past 10 days, 630 were reported from the MCC limits. Out of 630 cases, 368 cases were reported from 13 wards of the city corporation. The urban public health centre (UPHC) in Kuloor has found more cases in Kavoor ward, with 51 cases being reported in the last 10 days. Similarly, Kankanady Valencia ward under the Yekkuru UPHC has reported 44 cases during the period. However, 47 wards in the city have reported less than 20 cases in 10 days. The health department has declared nearly 20 containment zones in Mangaluru city in the last 10 days. Dr Ashok H, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Dakshina Kannada, told TOI that the health department has increased the surveillance in areas under 10 UPHCs in the Mangaluru city limits. “We have been facing major issues in the management of Covid-19 in Mangaluru city now. While the district has an overall positivity rate of 2.1%, Mangaluru city has a positivity rate of 3.3%. Meanwhile, cases are very less in rural areas of Bantwal, Puttur, Sullia, Belthangady and Mangaluru taluks. We have decided to increase the number of RT-PCR tests in Mangaluru city limits with the help of the MCC. Currently, in the district, we have been conducting an average of 11,500 tests per day,” Dr Ashok said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/covid-19-more-focus-on-13-wards-of-mcc/articleshow/85932745.cms||---

They were supposed to submit the lists to Calcutta High Court on Friday but the hearing did not happen. Most lists showed 400 to 1,000 defaulters. Vidyamandir Society, which runs two campuses of Birla High School for Boys, one on Moira Street and the other at Mukundapur, and Sushila Birla Girls’ School, had given about 500 names from the three institutes to the lawyer, who will submit them to court, said major general V N Chaturvedi, spokesperson for the schools. “We want to correct the perspective. There is no question of maligning anyone. We seek directions from the court,” he said. The number is about 400 at Shri Shikshayatan. “We have drawn up names of parents who have not paid even 50% fees. All of them have been alerted,” said spokesperson Bratati Bhattacharya. The numbers at La Martiniere schools (boys and girls) had been about 1,000. But the authorities would wait till Monday as many parents said they would pay by Friday and the payment might reflect in the accounts books by Monday, said secretary of the schools Supriyo Dhar. “The numbers are less in schools, like MP Birla Foundation and South Point, where it is around 150 each. This is because of the ECS system they have,” said lawyer Sourav Bhagat, who represents these schools and Shri Shikshayatan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/defaulters-lists-sent-to-lawyers/articleshow/85934788.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Pandore’s wife is an additional collector currently posted in Gandhinagar. The ACB team, led by police inspectors S N Desai and A K Chauhan, nabbed Pandore and his associates Kishore Patel, lawyer and tax consultant, Dharmesh Goswami and Vinay Patel, both employees of Kishore while accepting bribe of Rs 1 lakh from a businessman. Pandore demanded a bribe from the complainant to reactivate his partnership firm’s GST number that was blocked as the firm did not pay GST for the year 2015-16. “A team of ACB is searching at three residences of Pandore in Bhiloda, Gandhinagar and at government quarters in Athwalines area. ACB is collecting details related to the wealth of Pandore,” said an ACB officer. At the time of filing of the report, the searches were still on, sources said. The three accused, Kishore, Goswami and Vinay were nabbed from the former’s office at the Wood Square building on L P Savani Road. Soon after the bribe money was paid, ACB also caught Pandore from his office in Nanpura. Pandore initially demanded Rs 2 lakh in bribe to reactivate the GST number. The complainant initially paid Rs 50,000 and requested to reduce the amount after which Pandore agreed to accept Rs 1 lakh. “On Friday the lawyer accepted the money and asked his employees to count it. He then asked one of them to go and pay it to Pandore when ACB caught them,” said ACB official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/acb-searches-tainted-gst-officers-3-homes/articleshow/85934786.cms||---
---||Kochi||Malayali’s social media app for micro-videos eyes global audience||Kochi: A father-daughter duo from Kochi have come up with a social media platform that allows users to share micro-videos for airing their opinions. The app called noo-gah!, developed by Kochiite Sanjai Velayudhan and his daughter Nakshatra, a 20-year-old NIFT student, was launched in India in July and is available in both Android and iOS. The app showcases short videos by its users on various topics. The founder said that he wants noo-gah! to be a platform that is accepted across countries. “I hope someday people will realize that change will come only when they put pressure on the government and we want to be the platform where people can come and talk about it fearlessly. And in the long run, we want to expand — by next year we will start it,” Velayudhan said. “We are now in India and the Middle East and next we want to move on to Asia-Pacific region. The app is new and we are waiting for it to be stabilized and once it happens, we are moving to the APAC region. And then, we want to possibly move on to Europe, where we want to make sure that we are compliant fully with all their data laws. Depending on the investments, we might open the Europe and US together,” Velayudhan said. A post-graduate from Centre for Labour Market Studies (CLMS), University of Leicester and a bachelor of commerce from Delhi University, Velayudhan had gained considerable experience across industries with a customer-centric approach and his forte is loyalty gamification---using the addictive aspects of games and using them to ensure customer loyalty. Since its launch, users have posted hundreds of videos on the platform, Velayudhan said. These are videos with a duration of 20 seconds to up to 2 minutes. Velayudhan had noted that since 2014, there is a polarization happening in the Indian community and he wanted to help people raise their voice through a common platform. “We have users who also post their TikTok or Instagram videos on our app too - the lip-syncing videos,” he said. According to him, what he needed is a short ‘cerebral’ video that could discuss any topic. To ensure the quality of content, noo-gah! has to remove manually, on a daily basis, more than 200 posts which don’t adhere to the quality standards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/malayalis-social-media-app-for-micro-videos-eyes-global-audience/articleshow/85934837.cms||Shenoy Karun

---||Mangaluru||This teacher pooled resources to improve govt schools||Mangaluru: Edward D’Souza, headmaster of Zilla Panchayat Higher Primary School in Kattadabailu, 11km from Belthangady town, will receive the state-level Best Teacher’s Award from chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday. Edward has been responsible for upgrading two government schools located in remote areas of Belthangady, over the last three decades. Edward said he owes the award to all his students and donors like parents, villagers, religious heads, people’s representatives and well-wishers, who have contributed to the development of the schools. When Edward was in the first year of BCom, he lost his parents, and was forced to discontinue his studies. Till then, his aim was to complete his postgraduate education and become a gazetted officer. After working in two private schools, he started to work at a government school in Saralikatte. “This was a turning point in my life. One day when I went to teach class III students, I yelled at them, as they did not know their lessons. In response, one girl student told me that I was not aware of the difficulties she was going through at home. That was the moment I decided to work only in higher primary schools located in remote areas,” he told STOI. Over the next decade, he raised Rs 15 lakh for development. He was then transferred to another backward school. To reach Zilla Panchayat Higher Primary School in Kattadabailu, one had to walk for about 4km from the main road. The building, which was in a dilapidated condition, was restored. Over the past two decades, he has raised nearly Rs 1 crore for its development. “At one point, I distributed 300 cash boxes to local shops, asking them to contribute Re 1 every day for a month. I too personally contributed funds for every work undertaken,” he said. The school organises community development programmes and health camps. Following the death of a physically challenged student, Akash, in 2016, he celebrates Akash Jayanti on October 2, along with the birth anniversaries of Gandhiji and Shastriji. Belthangady BEO Virupaksha said Edward has taken up a lot of development works, and is a good academician.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/this-teacher-pooled-resources-to-improve-govt-schools/articleshow/85932808.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: How Birla Industrial & Technological Museum added a Rolls, JC Bose’s Fiat to its stable||KOLKATA: Among the collections at Birla Industrial & Technological Museum (BITM) is a 1925 Fiat Tipo 103 that was used by scientist Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose and a 1926 Rolls Royce Phantom I that belonged to Sir James Lindsay, the last British MD of Metal Box Co. While the first car came to BITM through the sheer perseverance of Saroj Ghose, the man who led the science centre movement in the country, the second one was a surprise gift that Ghose received after he had given up hope of adding a Rolls to the collection. Finding artefacts for BITM, the country’s first science museum set up in 1959, was difficult, given that India was not a participant in the industrial revolution. So when Ghose read in a Bengali daily in 1969 about AJC Bose’s car lying in disrepair at his Upper Circular Road home, Ghose met Bose’s, nephew Debendra Mohan Bose, and offered to restore the car and preserve it at BITM. The proposal was met with a rebuke. “Do you think I cannot take care of the car? Banish such thoughts,” Bose told Ghose. But Ghose did not give up. He called up Bose every week, exchanged pleasantries and gently reminded him of the offer. Pursued for several weeks, Bose asked Ghose where he would keep the car if he agreed. “I sensed a softening of stance and invited him to BITM and showed him the transport gallery. He liked it and the car was ours. Bose was pleased to see the way it was showcased,” Ghose said. 1925 Fiat Tipo 103 was the fruit of persuasion by Saroj GhoseThe museum had unexpectedly added a Rolls Royce to its collection before the Fiat had rolled in. It was a newspaper ad in 1965 that had caught Ghose’s eyes. The Darbhanga Maharaja’s fleet of Rolls Royce was being auctioned at Walford Garage on Park Street. Ghose was tempted to add one to the museum’s inventory. But being a government institution, purchases had to be made through tenders. A meeting of the executive council was called and Ghose was empowered to bid for a Rolls Royce at an auction with the maximum bid price set at Rs 5,000. When the auction began, Ghose was gutted. The reserve price for each car was Rs 50,000. Within a couple of hours, all cars were sold, the crowd dispersed and Ghose sat crestfallen. Just then, a tall Englishman tapped on his shoulders. “Tell me young man, did you come here to buy a Rolls?” he said. Ghose, quite aware he didn’t look like one who could afford a Rolls, explained it was for the museum. “You will get one,” the Englishman said and left. Ghose later learnt he was Sir Lindsay. A couple of days later, the guard at BITM informed him a white man was looking for him. As ge stpped out, Ghose found a Rolls parked in the portico. Inside was the same gentleman he met at the auction. Bare-bodied and clad only in shorts, Sir Lindsay handed Ghose the key. “This is the key to your car. The transfer documents will reach you in a couple of days,” he told a stunned Ghose before leaving in another car. Sir Lindsay had decided to donate the Rolls Royce to BITM instead of selling it before leaving for England.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/how-bitm-added-a-rolls-jc-boses-fiat-to-its-stable/articleshow/85934871.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The number of honorees has gone up from last year’s 103. Announcing this on the eve of Teachers’ Day, deputy CM and education minister Manish Sisodia said, “In the tough Covid times, Delhi’s teachers have not only worked shoulder to shoulder with the administration, but also done remarkable work in vaccination and quarantine centres, in the distribution of food, mask enforcement, even airport duty. And along with these duties, while performing their basic work of educating, they also adopted new methods for online teaching and did not let the children's education stop.” Appealing to the people, Sisodia said, “Our teachers have contributed a lot to our lives, so on Teachers’ Day, call at least one of your teachers and express gratitude to him or her. Tomorrow, along with Teachers’ Day, let us also celebrate Gratitude to Teachers Day.” Sisodia said that there was large-scale migration of people following the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic and so many children left the city for their home states. “Our teachers not only worked to locate these children, but also called the kids to Delhi at their own expense, made smart devices available to the children for online classes, got their internet connection recharged and prevented their studies from coming to a halt.” He also remarked that the number of awards had increased from 103 last year to 122 this time. The changes this year included the application process for the awards in all major categories going online, allowing individual teachers to vie for the awards directly. Earlier, heads of schools had to verify the applicants’ credentials and submit their comments online within a stipulated time. There were other changes. Earlier, only four teachers from any school could apply for the awards. Now, any number of teachers doing great work in one institution can apply for the honours. The education department received 1,108 applications for the awards, much higher than the 234, 148, 204, respectively, in the last three years. Also, the eligibility for state awards was lowered from 15 years of service to three years. Even guest and contractual teachers could also apply for the awards. Of the 80 teacher category awardees, 57 are female and 23 are male. While 52 are from Directorate of Education schools, 15 teach in private recognised schools and 13 in municipal corporation schools. Schools were divided into three categories for the purpose of the awards, each with a fixed quota of awards. All categories of applicants could thus be evaluated on the basis of enrolment in their schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-observe-sunday-as-gratitude-to-teachers-day/articleshow/85936952.cms||---

Added with a tourist coach having wide glass windows allowing travellers to enjoy the scenic beauty of the hilly terrain, the train restarted after a hiatus of 17 months owing to Covid and was flagged off by BJP state president and Navsari MP, C R Paatil on Saturday. As it rolled by on the more than a century old heritage route amid the lush green dense forest of Dang again on Saturday, travellers who knew its charm couldn’t resist revisiting old memories by hopping in. The rainy atmosphere only made the ride even more magical making the entire journey a memorable one for the travellers. It was discontinued in early 2020 due to limited passenger traffic and pandemic. The flagging off ceremony was attended by other BJP leaders, while Congress MLA from Vansada held a protest against the hike in fare at Unai. Earlier, the train was a daily means of transport for a number of farm workers and villagers. “I used to travel often through this train due to its picturesque view. I was disappointed when it was discontinued last year but many travellers like me are happy with its restart,” said Naresh Patel, an environment enthusiast. Patel plans to take his elderly parents too on a ride. “Due to its heritage value, we appreciate that the train was started again. It is useful for tribal people, but they should not have increased the fare. The fare should be kept minimum,” said Tabrez Ehmad, a Waghai resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bilimora-waghai-train-chugs-again/articleshow/85934841.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Of the 1.3 lakh students who had participated in the second round, 60,037 were allotted seats. They have to take admission by Monday. Of these, 13,282 students have got their first preference colleges. At St Xavier’s College, the sought-after arts stream’s cut-off in the second round closed at 94%. In the first merit list, it was among the few colleges to have seen a rise in its cut-off to 95.2% compared with last year’s 94.6%. Viceprincipal Hasnain Naqvi said, “There is a marginal drop of 1% in arts and about 2% in science.” St Xavier’s arts cutoff in the second round last year was 94.6%. Ruia College’s science stream cut-off dipped 0.2% compared with the first round’s 93.4%. Jai Hind College cut-off in the second round fell 3.2% to close at 88.4%. At NM College, among the top in commerce, the second round cut-off was 93.4%—a dip from 94% in the first list, which was the same in 2020. KC College’s commerce cut-off in Round 2 was unchanged from Round 1’s 91.4%. Vaze College’s commerce cut-off in the second merit list was 0.2% lower than that in the first at 91.8%. Minority quota and first general merit list in city colleges saw a dip in cut-offs compared with 2020. Minority institutes attributed the dip to stringent internal assessment of Class X students. The drop in the first general merit list was attributed to non-state board students dropping out of the admission race. “Chances of students having opted for colleges closer home due to the pandemic cannot be ruled out. Far-flung colleges can benefit in the second round of admissions,” said a principal. Some colleges’ second round cut-offs have been higher than last year’s Round 2, an indication that students may have selected colleges closer home. KES Junior College of Arts and Commerce in Kandivli managed a cut-off of 72.45% for arts this year, up from 70.2% in last year’s second round. In case of CHM College, Ulhasnagar, arts cut-off in the second round stood at 71.4% compared with 70.6% in 2020. “Last year, we had several vacant FYJC seats. This year, we have managed to fill more seats,” said the principal of a suburban college. So far, a total of 38% seats have been filled across Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Two more rounds, including a special one for those who missed out on admissions, are expected. At sought-after colleges, HR College’s commerce cutoff dipped to 93% from 95% in last year’s second round. At Ruia College, the science cutoff dipped 1.6% as compared to last year’s 94.8% in Round 2. The 10,544 students who did not take admission in their first preference colleges in Round 1 have to wait for the special round to get seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fyjc-cut-offs-in-down-1-2-in-top-colleges/articleshow/85936919.cms||Sandhya Nair

The major objective of the CITIIS challenge is to replicate the initiatives taken up under the smart city project outside the ABD area. The French Development Agency (AFD) launched the challenge in 2018. The selected cities will receive a maximum funding of Rs 80 crore for each selected project, or 80 per cent of the project cost. The GVMC’s ‘social inclusion through modernising public school as smart campus’ project made the final cut in the competition. The project is being implemented at a cost of Rs 65 crore in Vizag city. While the GVMC will get a Rs 52 crore grant from the AFD and the European Union, the remaining Rs 13 crore (20% of the project cost) will be spent by the GVMC from its own funds. The CITIIS Apex Committee had recently accorded its approval to the GVMC to go ahead with the tendering process. The Apex Committee consists of the deputy director (ministry of housing and urban affairs), project manager (European Union), members from the AFD and project management unit members from the National Institute of Urban Affairs. GVMC additional commissioner Dr V Sanyasi Rao said the concept of modernising GVMC schools as smart campuses includes comprehensive upgrading of the school facilities. “Out of a total of 147 GVMC schools, five schools were already covered under Smart City Mission and 50 schools under the first phase of ‘Mana Badi-Nadu Nedu’ programme. These schools were excluded from the CITIIS programme. Of the remaining schools, 40 schools were shortlisted to be taken up under the CITIIS programme. This project focuses on addressing the needs and aspirations through lessons learnt from the already implemented smart campus projects, stakeholder engagements and on the basis of requirements for schools,” said Dr Rao. The additional commissioner added the project is expected to provide a clean and green education campus to enhance learning and teaching environments and more outdoor activity areas for students to increase opportunities for greater physical activity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/gvmc-invites-tenders-to-revamp-40-schools/articleshow/85934814.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

On Saturday, more than 10,000 farmers from Agra region managed to dodge the local police and travelled through different routes — particularly the smaller village roads — to reach Muzaffarnagar by evening. Police and local intelligence officers had been putting pressure on them not to leave for the event, they alleged. Samyukt Kisan Morcha has, meanwhile, arranged over 200 buses to ferry farm association workers from Bihar, Bengal, Odisha, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to Muzaffarnagar. Senior members of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) claimed 50,000 farmers left for the city venue from Rajasthan and Haryana on Saturday afternoon. BKU (Charuni) Haryana chief Gurnam Singh Charuni on Saturday claimed around 1 lakh farmers from the state will attend the mahapanchayat, which he said would be fitting reply to Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar’s claim that only Punjab farmers were protesting. Muzaffarnagar’s five main gurdwaras have opened their doors for the farmers and began offering their services with langar facilities on Friday. Meanwhile, six companies of provincial armed constabulary (PAC) and two companies of RAF other than police forces from various districts have been deployed here for the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/thousands-of-farmers-reach-muzaffarnagar-for-mega-rally/articleshow/85939204.cms||---

A bench of chief justice Arup Kumar Goswami and justice Ninala Jayasuriya upheld the order of a single judge bench on December 31, 2019 to develop service road adjacent to the first flyover near Novotel hotel. Residents of Bharati Nagar and nearby colonies had challenged the state government and NHAI after the service road adjacent to Novotel hotel got shrunk after the construction of the first flyover. Locals faced difficulty in reaching a short distance with closed service roads. Single judge directed NHAI to take up land acquisition and develop a service road not less than 8 meters as per the norms. The NHAI challenged the decision of the single bench.  Meanwhile, locals filed a writ petition seeking orders to develop the service road adjacent to the second flyover which is under construction. They also requested the court to direct the NHAI to build an underpass at Fakheer Gudem Junction. Court clubbed both the matters since they were similar in nature. High court heard the arguments of both the parties and opined that public interest should be considered and service roads be laid. The court dismissed the writ appeal filed by the NHAI and observed that it is bound to develop the service road. The court said the NHAI and state government should negotiate to bear the cost of land acquisition for the second flyover since the works are underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/court-orders-service-roads-on-both-sides-of-benz-flyovers/articleshow/85934878.cms||Venu Lanka

The CBI had registered an FIR last March for cheating and criminal conspiracy as well as pressed corruption charges against DHFL and other accused persons, including Rana Kapoor. The CBI had filed its main chargesheet in 2020, where Rana Kapoor and his daughter Roshini Kapoor were made accused. Recently, the CBI filed a supplementary chargesheet in the matter on August 20, 2021, and the court had summoned Bindu Kapoor, the wife of Rana Kapoor, and Radha Kapoor Khanna, daughter of Rana Kapoor. Vijay Agrawal, counsel for Kapoor’s wife and daughter, argued before special judge S U Wadegaonkar that since the two of them were not in custody all along, they be granted bail as the investigation is over and chargesheet already filed and hence their custody is not warranted. He cited a recent Supreme Court order to back his submission for bail. The bail application by the duo was a bulky 250-page document. It said the Kapoor wife and daughter were already granted bail by the special PMLA court in a related case and hence it shows there are no chances of them absconding or tampering with evidence. Agrawal said Bindu Kapoor is a housewife, and Radha is the mother of two young children. The public prosecutor said since the bail applications are bulky, he needs time to file a reply. Agrawal insisted for grant of interim bail till the next date of hearing. The court granted them interim bail and fixed the matter next on September 8. The other accused in the case are Yes Bank officials. The CBI filed a separate plea for judicial custody of Roshini Kapoor for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, and the special court issued her notice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dhfl-case-interim-bail-for-yes-bank-founders-wife-daughter/articleshow/85936930.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Hyderabad||Sanction more IPS officers for Telangana: CM K Chandrasekhar Rao to Amit Shah||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao urged Union home minister Amit Shah to sanction more IPS officers for Telangana and to appoint them in territorial and critical posts. He said the present strength of 139 IPS officers was inadequate as the state government had added 23 more districts to 10 districts. In a representation to Shah during his meeting on Saturday, KCR said the Centre should consider Telangana as a special case, which has 20 police districts and nine police commissionerates in place of nine police districts and two police commissionerates. “There is an imminent need to create new territorial posts in tune with the notification by the Centre approving new zones, multi-zones and districts as per the Police Act, 1961,” the CM said. He said the earlier IPS cadre review for Telangana was done by the ministry of home affairs in 2016 and a total 76 senior duty posts and resultant 139 authorised posts were approved for the state. “The government has sent a proposal to the MHA for review of IPS cadre for Telangana,” the CM said. During his 45-minute interaction with the home minister, the CM is believed to have discussed about fund requirement for laying roads in the Maoist-affected areas. He reportedly told Shah that except in some places on the borders of Chhattisgarh, Maoist activities were totally under control. KCR, who met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, made a similar request on IPS cadre strength, funds for backward areas and infrastructure development in the left-wing extremism areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sanction-more-ips-officers-for-telangana-cm-to-shah/articleshow/85936925.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to an RTI reply by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, about 124 human lives were lost in the conflict with elephants in the state in the past six years (2014 to 2020 December), while the number of deaths at the national level is 3,310. The reply secured by RTI campaigner K Govindan Nampoothiry states that the highest number of deaths were reported from Odisha (589) followed by West Bengal (526), Jharkhand (480), and Assam (479). In the deaths per year statistics the highest number of human casualties was reported in 2019–20 with 585 deaths. In 2020 – 21, as many as 359 deaths were reported till December. The highest number of casualties caused by elephants reported in Kerala was in 2016 – 17 with 33 deaths. Since then there has been a decline and only 11 deaths were reported till December in 2020 – 21 in the state. Experts are of the view that instead of getting emotional there should be site-specific mitigation measures and cooperation from local residents to bring down the conflicts between humans and wild animals. “Most deaths caused by elephants are accidental encounters. We have to figure out the pattern of conflicts and circumstances from data on past incidents, and figure out site-specific mechanisms to mitigate the issue. Earlier, Valparai region in Tamil Nadu used to witness 130 to 160 conflicts annually within a 220sq km area. It has come down to 50 to 55 per year because of early warning systems introduced in the area. In central and southern Sri Lanka, farmers are able to harvest crops properly for the past five years; thanks to maintenance of fences by community members themselves. Mitigation measures can be implemented with the participation of all stakeholders, particularly local residents,” says Sreedhar Vijayakrishnan, principal scientist at Centre for Wildlife Studies in Bengaluru. Former director of Kerala Forest Research Institute Dr P S Easa said that people should not venture into places where wild animals frequent, especially during early morning hours as visibility will be low and approaching elephants would not be seen. “Site-specific precaution should be taken by the stakeholders. People think that the forest department is the sole authority to take measures. Such a notion is foolish. The problem is that mitigation measures currently taken are without analysing the situation on what led to the conflict. Sadly, no local bodies are creating awareness on mitigation and people too are not willing to accept facts,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/wild-elephant-attacks-claim-124-lives-in-6-years-in-state/articleshow/85934907.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Mumbai||Setback for great-grandson of Frontier Gandhi in Bombay high court||MUMBAI: In a setback for the great-grandson of ‘Frontier Gandhi’ Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, the Bombay high court refused to grant any relief on his plea to appoint him the legal guardian of his ailing aunt and to allow him to take her to Pakistan to be with her family. “We are not inclined to grant any interim relief,” said a bench of Justice K K Tated and Justice Prithviraj Chavan on Friday, expressing a prima facie view that Mashal Khan can go before the committee under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. A resident of Breach Candy, India-born Zarin Ghani Walsh (76) is a Canadian national and has resided in India since 1983. She is the daughter of Frontier Gandhi’s eldest son. Mashal (40) is the son of her late brother. In February, the high court was informed that she had Alzheimer’s disease and dementia and was “virtually in a vegetative state”. On August 4, Mashal’s advocate, Mayur Khandeparkar, said that an air bubble had again opened between India and Dubai and she could be taken from Dubai to Pakistan. The Centre’s reply, submitted by its advocate Advait Sethna, said Mashal may approach the designated authority under the RPWD Act for appointment as guardian under Section 14 (provision for guardianship) and other reliefs. Khandeparkar said that the Centre’s stand was not correct. “I will not get covered under Section 14 at all. The act contemplates limited disabilities and lists 21 ailments. I (Walsh) don’t feature under any one,” he said. The judges pointed to Mashal’s petition. “It is your own pleading that she is mentally and physically unstable and cannot take decisions. You have to go before the committee (authority),” said Justice Tated. Khandeparkar said Walsh suffered from “old age related problems”. He said that while the state’s anxiety was that she would be taken out of Indian territory, Mashal was willing to subject himself to whatever terms. “She needs to be looked after day to day. He is around and in a position to look after her. Ultimately, we are concerned about her frail state of health,” he said. But the judges were not inclined to grant interim relief and posted the matter for further hearing on October 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-setback-for-great-grandson-of-frontier-gandhi-in-hc/articleshow/85936973.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Four years on, acid victim waits for compensation||AHMEDABAD: While Gujarat government has assumed a strict posture against acid attack and come out with a compensation scheme for victims, an acid attack victim has been waiting for justice four years after filing a petition in the Gujarat high court. The government is still undecided on extending financial assistance to her. The 29-year-old woman is now seeking medical aid for surgery that she needs to undergo in a private hospital for her damaged oesophagus because she was forced to consume acid allegedly by her husband and in-laws on August 13, 2012 in Alvar in Rajasthan. Her parents, who live in Gujarat, brought her to Ahmedabad and she was given treatment at the Civil Hospital. In 2017, she moved the high court seeking Rs 5 lakh financial assistance from the state government under the Central Victim Compensation Fund, and compensation of Rs 1 lakh under the Prime Minister National Relief Fund (PMNRF). In January, the Centre rejected her demand for compensation under the PMNRF by saying that she fell victim to the acid attack in 2012, and the provision extending financial assistance for acid attack victims was introduced only in 2016. While the victim has little hope from PMNRF, the state government is still unsure about whether to compensate her. The Rs 3.9 crore fund that the state government had received for the year 2017-18 according to the Central Victim Compensation Fund Guidelines, Rs 3.08 crore was utilized and the remaining amount was surrendered back by Gujarat to the Centre. According to the victim’s advocate N M Kapadia, while the state government did not commit itself to extend any financial assistance to her, it has lately raised another contention that the incident had taken place in Rajasthan and not in Gujarat. Since there was no clarity on providing financial assistance to the victim, the high court on Friday said that if the governments does not take any decision on the victim’s claims, the court would have to adjudicate the problem. Advocate Kapadia said that as the victim’s oesophagus was badly damaged, she has not been able to eat food with her mouth since the incident took place. She required plastic surgery, but the doctors at the Civil Hospital expressed their inability to deal with the case. A team of doctors at a city-based private hospital has expressed willingness to perform the surgery, but funds are required for the same. “We have urged the court to direct the government to grant compensation so that the victim’s medical expenditure can be met,” the lawyer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/4-yrs-on-acid-victim-waits-for-compensation/articleshow/85934954.cms||---
---||Kochi||46 jumbos died in 3 years in Nilambur: Kerala Forest Research Institute study||KOCHI: A study conducted by Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) said that 46 elephants were found dead in Nilambur division between 2013 and 2016. In 66% cases, the carcasses were found in and around croplands, showing that they were maybe due to victims of retaliatory action by the farmers. The finding is part of study to assess crop damage in the area following elephant raids on farmlands. It found most crop damage by wild elephants in places with high arecanut cultivation. The study was conducted in Nilambur forest division, Malappuram, in three years to assess the crop damage and ensuing economic loss. A major finding is that the bark of rubber trees, less than 15 years old, has been found eaten by elephants in two forest ranges, Karulayi and Kalikavu ranges. This is the first such sighting in India. “Rubber bark feeding was seen from 2014. Besides feeding on existing food plants, elephants normally add new plant species in their diet over time to meet demand for mineral contents and availability. But we need more study on why elephants feed on rubber bark. It has been reported in China,” said Dr Riju P Nair, wildlife researcher. He conducted the study along with Dr E A Jayson of KFRI. It was noticed that elephants take cover in rubber plantations. Elephants move upto 6km away from forests due to rubber plantations in vast areas on forest fringes. It helps the elephants reach croplands without being noticed. The study, published in the journal Current Science, found most crop damage during monsoon, between June and September, contrary to the common belief that elephants venture into human habitations due to scarcity of food in the forest. The major crop damage due to elephant raids is plantain, an intercrop with arecanut trees. It has been found that crop damage is 18 times higher in arecanut plantations. Another finding of the study is that proximity of farmland to forests raises elephant-raid incidents. The potential economic loss due to crop damage per year in the area is about Rs 50 lakh. Like several other studies earlier, the current study also calls for farmers to desist from cultivating intercrops like plantain and pineapple in the proximity of forest areas to avoid economic loss and save elephants from attacks by local residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/46-jumbos-died-in-3-years-in-nilambur-kfri-study/articleshow/85934964.cms||T C Sreemol

I have requested all traders in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi to abide by the DC’s order by closing their shops on Saturday and Sunday,” Kamath said. He added that many of the merchants are not in a position to go through more weekend curfews, as they have already borne losses due to the pandemic. “We have decided to cooperate with the district administration this week, with a hope that the government will discuss our problems and take a favourable decision by the next weekend,” he said. The DC said that the positivity rate in the district is expected to reduce further in the next one week. “Many of the people’s representatives in the district are also in favour of withdrawing the weekend curfew,” he added. Social welfare and backward classes’ welfare minister Kota Shrinivas Poojari and Mangaluru City South MLA D Vedavyas Kamath had met chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday, and demanded that the weekend curfew in Dakshina Kannada be withdrawn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/traders-withdraw-protest-call-over-weekend-curfew/articleshow/85932987.cms||---

The preparations started after chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced that performances at open-air theatres, including jatra, could be resumed, but with not more than 50% occupancy at a time Subhalakshmi Opera and Nagmata Jatra Sanstha conducted their ‘Muhurat’ on Friday, inaugurated by Kamarhati MLA Madan Mitra; it was followed by an indoor script reading session at a banquet hall in Shyambazar. Sonar Bangla Jatra Sanstha have started their closed-door rehearsals. Other organisers, like Lakshminarayan Opera and New Jatralok Opera, will start rehearsals from next week. “Grappling with losses running into several crores of rupees owing to the shutdown during the pandemic, jatra organizers said they were doing everything to turn the scene around. Aggressive marketing policies, large discounts, roping in tele-faces to popularize their plays and booking as many dates as possible during the Pujas and the rest of the festive season were some of the measures they have taken. After the first wave of the pandemic had waned, the groups had done brisk business with back-to-back shows in rural Bengal between December and February but the second wave swept away all their efforts. Aiming to repeat last winter’s performance, the organizers pray that the predicted third wave does not halt their run again. “We are hoping for business during and after the Pujas. We already have 12-odd confirmed bookings for winter and are in talks with rural clubs for shows during the Pujas and on Lakshmi Puja and Bhaiphota. But all depend on the Covid situation in the next two months. We have our fingers crossed,” said Nepal Dutta, manager-cum-director at Sonar Bangla Jatra Sanstha, who are ready with their new play, ‘Shib Thakurer Bou’. According to organisers, clubs in Midnapore, Burdwan, Purulia, Bankura and the Sunderbans had done most of the bookings so far. Bapi Ghosh, owner of New Jatralok Opera is also hoping for a turnaround. “Many of our artists and technicians had to do odd jobs and sell vegetables for a living. We hope business is better this year and all our staff can have a proper living,” said Ghosh, who has a few bookings in rural Bengal, where he will take two of his plays, ‘Bouma 420’ and ‘Sindur Poro, Bouma’. Ghosh hoped that the chief minister would consider reviewing the night restrictions as most plays were performed late at night, starting only after 9pm in most of the rural belts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jatra-para-comes-alive-with-rehearsals-muhurats-before-curtains-go-up/articleshow/85934956.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

A huge screen behind it shows clips from a nearby vaccine centre along with songs playing on an attached loudspeaker. Corporator Atul Shah, who started the initiative, said that after several meetings with workers from this area, he realized they do not feel the need to get vaccinated. The centre gets 100 doses daily, which goes up to 200 as well, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-van-with-screen-urges-workers-to-get-vaccinated/articleshow/85937020.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Residents of Vejalpur society lock horns over feeding strays||AHMEDABAD: The residents of Venus Parkland in Vejalpur found themselves in a dogged mess when a verbal spat over feeding stray canines landed some members in the Vejalpur police station, filing cross-complaints against each other on Friday. The issue has been a major bone of contention in the society for the past five years. While society members claim they have designated a space outside the society as feeding area for dogs, canine lovers opine that putting up boards asking people not to feed dogs and stopping dog lovers from feeding strays amounts to harassment No less than six police complaints have been filed over this issue during this period. With no paw-sitive outcome to the tale, the situation seems to have worsened. In the past 20 days, this has been the second time that complaints regarding harassment of dogs have been lodged. On Friday, the security in-charge stopped a resident from feeding a stray inside the society. Dipti Acharya, society office-bearer and in-charge of security, said, “I was talking to the security guard in view of the forthcoming Ganesh festival. I noticed a youth, Yash, feeding dogs and asked him to do so in the feeding area outside the society. After an altercation, Yash agreed to feed the dog outside. Later he called up Prerna Kalyani, another resident, who returned to the society and began abusing me. “I asked Prerna to be civil, but she continued her verbal tirade. Reacting to her abuses, I slapped her. On Friday morning, agencies were called to take the dogs for sterilization, but Prerna stopped this too.” Dipti said that she along with other office-bearers are currently out on bail in a complaint filed by Prerna on August 14. Prerna, who filed the second complaint against three office-bearers and a resident on Friday, said, “Residents informed me about dog harassment on Friday. When I arrived at the society, Dipti abused me, pushed me, and slapped me. The issue is old. One of the dog lovers, Falguni, who has shifted from the society, has lodged four complaints, and two have been lodged by me.” She said no one can stop any one from feeding any dog in the society and this is inhumane. She also alleged that society office-bearers also took videos of people who fed dogs within the society. To this, society chairman Harish Makwana said it was a big society and there are about 30-odd dogs. “We earmarked a 15x15 feet area outside the society for feeding dogs. This was done after the society received several complaints of dogs biting residents,” he said. He added, “Prerna has been threatening to involve Maneka Gandhi and her organization in this issue. She does not follow any rules. She does not allow security guards to carry sticks. Even safai workers have stopped coming here because there’s dog shit everywhere.” Meanwhile, Prerna said that the issue had been going on for five years but has worsened over the past six months since the new office-bearers were elected. She said that she has given all proof of harassment to dogs to Maneka Gandhi and People for Animals has issued a notice to the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/residents-of-vejalpur-society-lock-horns-over-feeding-strays/articleshow/85934993.cms||---

The farmers boarded hundreds of buses hired by the farmer organisations to cover over seven-hour journey from various locations. From Haryana, farmers are mainly from Sirsa, Fatehabad, Hisar, Bhiwani, Dadri, Rohtak, Sonipat, Karnal, Panipat, Jind, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar and Amabala The farmers are relying on the national-level mahapanchayat to be held at Muzzafarnagar on Sunday to kickstart the Mission UP and Uttarakhand for putting pressure on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government to concede demands of farmers of repeal farm laws, make law for legal guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) for all crops to all farmers. Rajesh Kumar, one of the farmers from Bheri Akbarpur village of Hisar district who went via Jind-Panipat-Shamli to Muzaffarnagar, said, “The farmers will show their power to the Modi-led government by mobilising lakhs of people in Muzaffarnagar. Farmers have started their journey for kisan mahapanchayat a day before as they will not get space to ply vehicles on road following a massive mobilisation to show the saffron party that farmers have gained more power with the passage of time.” According to Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the mahapanchayat will be held at GIC ground but the live broadcast will be telecast in the surrounding grounds and it will make the Yogi-Modi governments realise the power of the farmers, farm labourers and supporters of the farm movement. The 500 langar services have been started for arranging meals for farmers, including mobile langar system run by hundreds of tractor-trolleys. To take care of the medical needs of the farmers attending the mahapanchayat, 100 medical camps have been set up and 5,000 volunteers have been deployed for all the arrangements. The mahapanchayat will be addressed by prominent leaders of the SKM. Farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said 5,850 activists, including 1,050 women, have left for Muzzafarnagar in 123 vehicles from different districts. They will spend the night at Kurukshetra. Similarly, the leaders of other farm groups told that thousands of farmers have left for Muzzafarnagar by buses and trains and many others will leave in the wee hours of Sunday in train. Azad Singh Palwan, Jind BKU president, said as many as 19 khaps from Jind district would ensure two vehicles from each village registered their presence in UP. “Around 50,000 farmers from bangar area are expected to take part in the kisan mahapanchayat. The slogan ‘bil vapisi to hee ghar vapsi’ is still our clear message to the Modi government,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/battleground-shifts-to-muzaffarnagar-as-farmers-from-pb-hry-head-to-up/articleshow/85937042.cms||Neel Kamal

The Narcotic Control Bureau (NCB) had last week arrested Kohli after raiding his Andheri home from where they had recovered 1.2gm of cocaine. The court also rejected bail applications of two other accused — Ajay Raju Singh and one Mohammed Ajaz Chiya. The NCB had booked him under charges procurement, possession, sale, purchase, transport and illicit trafficking and harbouring. However, on Saturday his lawyer argued that the amount of drugs recovered from him was a ‘very small’ quantity. Special public prosecutor Advait Sethna opposed the application, claiming that he had direct links with the two prime accused arrested in the case from whom a ‘commercial quantity’ of contraband was recovered. Kohli has featured in a few films and was a contestant of a TV reality show.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bail-plea-of-arman-kohli-rejected-in-drugs-case/articleshow/85937096.cms||---
---||Mumbai||With 1,600 manuscripts, this 1903 mosque library in Mumbai attracts global research scholars||MUMBAI: A way from the bustling bazaar, a stone stairway at the iconic Juma Masjid near Crawford Market leads you to a quiet space. From the racks peep out carefully-arranged hardbound manuscripts and books. “This is a treasure trove of knowledge handed down to us by people who valued scholarship,” says Mufti Mohammed Ashfaque Kazi, secretary of Juma Masjid library. Built in 1774, Juma Masjid was in the news recently when the ancient pond on which it stands was cleaned. No less important, at least for the scholars and researchers who trawl through the old, brittle pages, is the Majid’s library. Not many mosques in India can match the richness of this library. Among its over 1,600 manuscripts is a commentary by Andalusian scholar Ibn Rushd or Averroes (1126-1198) on a work of Ibn Sina or Avicenna, the 11th century polymath, thinker and father of modern medicine. The likes of Averroes and Avicenna represent an era which is called the Islamic Golden Age. This library stocks some of the tomes which attract students and researchers eager to understand that period of Muslim renaissance. A cursory glance through pages of the visitors’ book at the library shows it has attracted innumerable scholars from India and abroad since it opened in 1903 at Madrassa Mohammadia on the Masjid premises. Philanthropist Mohammed Ali Roghe who had built the upper floor of the Masjid also funded the construction of the Madrassa. “Many people contributed books and manuscripts to the library which was formally opened in 1903 at Mohammadiya Madrassa. The Madrassa was turned into Mohammadiya High School and moved to Mohammed Ali Road in the 1960s though the library stayed back at the Masjid premises. The library was moved to the Masjid building in 2015,” informs Shoeb Khatib, chairman of Juma Masjid of Bombay Trust. Among those who nursed the library were noted 20th century scholar Maulana Yusuf Khatkhatay who, besides collecting manuscripts in Arabic, Urdu and Persian, also indexed them and wrote notes on them. Noted Urdu linguist and retired Professor Abdus Sattar Dalvi and his late wife Maimoona Dalvi would spend hours here in the 1960s and 1970s. “Khatkhatay sahab contributed immensely. It is strange how his personal collection reached Mumbai University’s library where they are kept under Khatkhatay collection?” asks Dalvi who found ‘Man Sanmjhawan’, Urdu translation of Shivaji’s guru Sant Ramdas’s Marathi slokas by Shah Turab Chishti. Dalvi edited and published it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/with-1-6k-manuscripts-this-1903-mosque-library-attracts-global-research-scholars/articleshow/85937093.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Delhi||Teacher’s Day: Delhi govt to felicitate teachers who went above and beyond teaching||NEW DELHI: This year’s state teachers awards honour the work done during the trying Covid-19 pandemic, when schools and teachers suddenly found themselves confronting new realities and the need to adapt to the circumstance. Some realised students, especially those from economically disadvantaged families, had to have smartphones to be able to follow online lessons while others ensured a sense of normality by focusing on sports and cultural activities. Bharti Kalra, 51, vice-principal of Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8, Rohini, can look behind with satisfaction at the work she did in getting smartphones for needy students. She mobilised people in her circle to donate smartphones and benefited 321 students, most of them in classes X-XII. Kalra will receive the Special Award on Teachers’ Day on Sunday. The honour is also being conferred on Sarita Rani Bhardwaj, 57, who was then in a Paschim Vihar school and took extra steps to connect the missing Class VI students to online learning during the lockdown. Bhardwaj, who is now a teacher in Mangolpuri, recalled, “I first asked students on the WhatsApp group to take the help of their fathers and go around their colony locating missing schoolchildren. When this didn’t yield the expected results, I asked people at a local shop to visit the addresses of the students. given. Even after this, there still were many children not participating in online classes, so I paid a courier delivery boy and asked him to reach the addresses and give them my phone number.” Maths teacher Suman Arora, 44, is being honoured as the Face of Directorate of Education for her contribution in creating support material for the Class XII students. Under her guidance, over 20 students have been able to clear the engineering entrance exams. Asked what she did differently, Arora said, “I give students the short fixes for solving maths questions. I also counsel them and have even assisted them financially.” Music teacher Raj Kumar too has been deemed the Face of DoE. Professors and assistant professors at the District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) are also being honoured this year. Meena Sehrawat, assistant professor, at DIET, Ghuman Hera, has been involved with research work related to the teacher development co-ordinator at Delhi government schools. She also has come out with several publications. “English is a second language for our students, so I have been working for 22 years to teach the language in a play-way method,” said the 47-year-old. Like her, there are some writer-teachers on the honours list. Tej Pal, history lecturer at GSV Hiran Kudna, has authored books on sports, especially on wrestling, while Anil Kumar, Sanskrit lecturer at Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School, Tikri Kalan, has been conferred with Sahitya Ratan Samman 2020 for his significant contribution to uplifting Hindi and Sanskrit language and literature among the teaching fraternity. Happily, Lalit Kumar, the wrestling coach who had trained Tokyo Olympics silver medallist Ravi Dahiya, will also receive an award. Kumar has been working at Chhatrasal Stadium as a wrestling coach on contract since 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/they-went-above-and-beyond-teaching/articleshow/85937099.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Chandigarh||We should aim for Sams and Sagats for top brass||Media reports indicated that government intends to adopt merit as the new criteria for selection of top leadership in armed forces. This assertion itself is baffling to say the least and likely motivation could be to generate signals to prospective candidates, to fall in step. But as we celebrate Golden Jubilee of 1971 war, it pays to remember our evergreen heroes — most fondly remembered are FM Sam Manekshaw and Lt Gen Sagat Singh, brand ambassadors of non-conformist streak, also referred to as perpetual ‘panga-takers’. Thanks to Gen Sagat, we held on to Nathu La in Sikkim in 1967. Again in 1971, he exceeded expectations of planners, bouncing Meghna from the least invested direction, to capture Dhaka. Sam had his run-ins early with likes of Krishna Menon. Exploits of conformist chief in ghost, writing columns for Calcutta-based daily have been documented by Jairam Ramesh in his book. On the other hand, Harbakash, Bhagat, Pereira and Baba Mehar will remain evergreen heroes in bar banter. It is open secret that junior leaders’ hero worship senior ones, who stand up for them — some amount of defiance being an occupational hazard. Risk taking and audacity are defining operational qualities. National interests are best served in breeding the likes of Sagat and Sam. We need commanders not only expounding ‘effects-based’ operations theoretically, but generating them in field. The other possible reason for proposed reforms could be desire to overlook seniority in appointing theatre commanders. This is less likely, as supersessions have becoming fairly common and even acceptable, specially at the apex levels. It was also rumoured that one Service Chief may be granted an extension, which is another worrying development, as second extension to same officer, will amount to acceptance of inability of system to groom suitable replacements for critical appointments. The current government had very enviable track record in first term of stemming the culture of extensions. However, it appears that bureaucracy is getting around the system. Unlike Pakistan Army, our armed forces have steered clear of this malevolent practice, which destroys inter-batch camaraderie and motivation. Forces are driven by unique course-mate spirit, where all batches aspire for representation in top hierarchy. We are witnessing hype and camaraderie, with all three chiefs being from the same NDA course. It is important to remember that steep pyramidical system of forces, unlike civilian cadres, precludes elevation of entire batches to chief secretary or DGP status, accompanied with pay and perks. Armed Forces already follow merit-based system, which is indexed on quantified parameters and aided by value judgement. However, the latter forms only small component. Modified selection system was evolved after years of effort, comparison with contemporary global models, periodically reviewed and has been subjected to judicial scrutiny. In one famous case, defence minister and his bureaucratic advisors, out to junk the system, conceded that it was certainly better than all known systems. The strength of the system is that final call is with the government. In this case, defence minister granted extension and benefit of selection, to his country cousin, but through separate government order and additional vacancy. The saving grace was maintaining some semblance of sanctity of system. The problem is in implementation and hesitancy to record reasons through ‘speaking orders’, which are court mandated norms. The same defence minister recently boasted that his solution to famous scandal was to order vanishing of file itself. The government order and files can meet similar fate in non-functional system. Apprehensions on proposed system being utilised to pick and choose leading to politicisation of top rungs are being debated. There is no clarity on additional parameters to be included for fine tuning existing selection system to discover merit. Another query begging response is: what additional competencies will be required by selection body and how will so called designated august panel imbibe them? It is settled principle of law that rules affecting career progression, specially at the apex rungs, should not be tinkered with and changed only after due consideration. They should also be applied prospectively, after reasonable notice, giving fair chance to batches in pipeline at least mitigating shock effect. The refinements have to be made in implementation, as even the best model can be compromised by motivated application. The system has to build accountability and transparency by recording ‘speaking-orders’ and sharing them with affected candidates. The recent example of Supreme Court granting promotion benefits to two retired Brigadiers, four years after retirement, reinforces this requirement. System needs suitable correctives in placements, vacancy allocations, scheduling of boards and batches. In all these, we have objective and comprehensive policies but challenge lies in policing and their fair implementation. The government needs to introduce peer review in selections to make the process more objective and participative, helping to weed out manipulators. Ideally, system with four levels of selection boards should create pool of equally competent officers assured of autonomy. Some of the recent tweaks like reduction of Army Commanders’ tenures from 24 to 18 months by erstwhile defence minister, purportedly to achieve uniformity in three services, requires review. The stated purpose has not been achieved and organisational interests should override urge for uniformity. The need is to increase all command and staff stints to three years, making them meaningful and viable. It is important to invest in the grooming of our top hierarchy and developing capability to identify potential beyond parochial and regimental silos. Calculated risk taking and capability of ‘pushing boundaries’ are pre-requisites for senior commanders. It is axiomatic to accept that Forces deserve special eco-systems, commanded by autonomous tigers.

According to Marayoor SHO PT Bejoy, Nadirsha Ali, 30, and a 28-year-old woman, from Pathadipalam near Marayoor, were in a relationship for the last two years. On Thursday, Ali reached Marayoor and asked the woman to go with him to discuss an important matter. They reached Kanthalloor Bhramaram viewpoint in the evening and recorded a video stating that they planned to end their life. Then both of them cut their veins and Ali jumped into the gorge and died. The woman was found injured near the viewpoint and admitted to a private hospital, and she survived. “While recording their suicide video, the woman said that she was not willing to end her life and the youth forcibly cut her vein. Before the incident, the youth asked her to keep the ornaments and mobile in the car. But she took the mobile along and sent the videos to relatives and urged them to save her. But the youth had destroyed his phone, cut their veins and jumped into the gorge,” police said. “The woman did not jump into the gorge but she was injured and sought help.

Asha Thakore approached the Gujarat University police station on Friday and cops lodged a complaint of breach of trust, cheating, forgery, and passing off forged documents as genuine. Thakore stated that she has been alone since the death of her husband Mukundrai in 1996. She said that 30 years ago, she and her husband had given a shop outside their house on rent. That tenant is identified in the FIR only as Atul. She said that Pavan Shah, a resident of Ambawadi, was a regular customer of the shop. After the death of Atul, Shah rented the shop for Rs 500 per month. Thakore told police that she had, in time, directed Shah to vacate the shop and he promised to do so. However in 2019, she received a tax bill in Shah’s name. She made inquiries and discovered that Shah had on May 25, 2018, created a bogus irrevocable general power of attorney by forging her signatures. He had even created a fake sale agreement showing that Rs 1 lakh was paid to Thakore. Thakore said that Shah made the sale agreement in the name of his wife, Padma. Further inquiries showed that Shah and his wife had used bogus documents to transfer the lower portion of Thakore’s bungalow to their names. She approached authorities over the land grab and the Shahs cancelled the registration on March 2, 2021. Eventually, Thakore decided to file a police complaint against the couple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/paldi-widow-82-fights-back-against-tenants-land-grab/articleshow/85935001.cms||---

According to the details provided to the HC by Ajay Maluja, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Bathinda, the company has removed expired/likely to expire goods consisting 22 trolley loads, three tankers and two oil trucks from the premises. Strenuous efforts are persistently being made to persuade the farmers’ unions to finally lift the blockade, the SSP has informed the HC. The reply from the SSP was placed before the HC last week in response to a petition filed by the company against the blockade. The company is not able to use its store, which is spread in around 50,000 square feet, because of the blockade by the farmers protesting against the Centre’s agriculture laws. During the hearing of the case before the HC, counsel representing the company informed the HC that removal of all the goods lying on the premises should be permitted. On this, counsel representing Punjab informed that apart from continuing efforts for complete removal of the blockade, steps shall be taken to facilitate removal of the entire goods from the warehouse, which includes food items. After hearing all the parties, the HC adjourned the matter for October 5 observing, “Needless to say, respondent-authorities shall make earnest and strenuous efforts to facilitate removal of all goods lying on the premises in question.” The matter had reached before the HC in the wake of a petition filed by the company informing that they are operating a store namely ‘Best Price Modern Wholesale’ at Bathinda. Due to the ongoing blockade by farmers outside petitioners’ premises since September 25, 2020, petitioners are unable to resume commercial activity. Ingress and egress to the premises is not possible due to the blockade. Company’s counsel had also submitted that large quantities of edible and perishable goods lying on the premises have gone to waste having expired but even these cannot be removed from the premises. Hearing the petition filed by the company, the HC had sought a report from the Punjab government and the district administration Bathinda on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/walmart-manages-to-move-expired-goods-from-bathinda-store/articleshow/85937100.cms||Ajay Sura

Thamadathil Sindhu Babu, who was living with her neighbour Manikkunnel Benoy (48), had gone missing on August 12. A manhunt has been launched to trace Benoy who has gone into hiding. It was the Sindhu’s relatives who found her body in the kitchen buried in a pit beneath a newly-built clay stove. Sindhu’s mother had filed a missing person complaint with Vellathooval police on August 15. Police said the body was found below the clay stove where a 6ft deep pit was dug. The body was naked and the face was covered with a plastic cover. Strangely, a lot of green chillies were put along with body into the pit and it was firmly covered with mud. The accused also scattered ash over the area before covering the spot with a sack cloth with a pile of cardamoms on it, said police. According to preliminary findings, the woman was strangled to death. There were signs of assault on the body. One rib was broken and there were several injury marks on the body. Idukki SP R Karuppa Swami said the body was found in a decomposed state and police are awaiting the post-mortem report to find out the cause of death. The SP said that the allegations against the police that they did not probe the case properly are baseless. Sindhu’s elder son told media that when she went missing, Benoy first told him that she had gone to collect grass. The next day, he said she took a bag and left. We informed police of our suspicions. When we looked in the house we found a new clay stove built in the kitchen,” he said. Sindhu, with her 12-year-old younger son, lived in a rented house after her marriage broke up. She then got close with Benoy, and moved to his house with her son. On August 11 evening, she sent her son to stay with Benoy’s relative. The next day her son noticed that Sindhu had gone missing and informed her relatives. The family alleged that though they informed police, they did not conduct proper investigations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/womans-body-exhumed-cops-suspect-she-was-strangled/articleshow/85935079.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Will give jobs to all, even if I get capital punishment: Ex- Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala||AMBALA/YAMUNANAGAR: Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) patriarch and former Haryana chief minister (CM) Om Prakash (OP) Chautala addressed a large gathering of public and his party workers at grain market in Jagadhri town of Yamunanagar district on Saturday. Chautala is visiting different districts of Haryana under INLD's ‘Kartyakarta Milan Sammelan’ (workers’ meet), and he visited Panchkula and Yamunanagar on Saturday and had visited Ambala on Friday. While addressing the public at the grain market in Jagadhri, OP Chautala said, “The government is delaying the Ellenabad by-polls. According to the norms, the elections are to be conducted within six months but the government is running away from the same. If the Ellenabad election is conducted, the INLD candidate will be winning with a big margin for sure and all other party candidates will lose their security deposits." In Jagadhri, OP Chautala speculated that, “After the Ellenabad by-polls, the BJP-JJP coalition will break in Haryana and mid-term polls will be held in the state and the INLD government will be formed.” “The farmers, who are the backbone of the nation, are today sitting on the protest against the black farm laws of the Centre. The government today is in the hands of the wrong people, due to which, all sections of the society are suffering hardships,” said Chautala. Chautala said he will work to give job to every youth in Haryana, even if he have to serve capital punishment for the same, adding that the Congress got him jailed in 2005 over giving jobs to 3,206 youths. "The Congress and other political parties thought that INLD would now break completely, but our organisation has strengthened more in my absence due to party workers. I will work to give job to every youth of Haryana, even if I have to serve capital punishment for the same. I have already served the 10 years of imprisonment and will now work to give more jobs than before,” said Chautala. Expressing concern over higher unemployment rate in Haryana, Chautala said the youths are roaming for the jobs but they are not getting them anywhere. “The BJP-JJP coalition government was making claims to give jobs to Haryana youths on priority but all their claims have fallen flat. The people are struggling for their livelihood in the state and the entire state is under the debt of about Rs 2.50 lakh crore. Therefore, problems are also faced in releasing salaries to the employees,” said Chautala. He said every newborn baby is taking birth under the debt of Rs 1 lakh and the political circumstances in the country and the state are not good. “The government has done no work in the public interest and even the grievances of public are not heard at the CM Window. The present government is of the robbers and it is involved in corruption entirely. Soon, the government will fall by its own weight,” said Chautala. Apart from Chautala, his grandson Karan Chautala, national in-charge of youth wing of INLD, INLD Haryana state president Nafe Singh Rathi, INLD national vice-president Prakash Bharti, former MLA Shyam Singh Rana Radaur and other party workers were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-give-job-to-every-youth-even-if-i-am-given-capital-punishment-chautala/articleshow/85937133.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Agitate for school reopening instead of temples: Min to BJP||Nagpur: Expressing concern over the anticipated third wave, state cabinet minister Vijay Wadettiwar said reopening process has to be initiated cautiously keeping the greater good in mind. Reacting to BJP’s demand of reopening of temples, Wadettiwar said the party should have at least fought for reopening of schools. “At least agitate for reopening of schools, for the academic future of our kids,” said Wadettiwar. While the statement was clearly a sarcastic swipe at BJP, Wadettiwar clarified that experts have reservations regarding school reopening, and it will be considered at the right time. Currently, schools in rural areas (Std VIII onwards) are open while those in city remain closed. On the OBC reservation issue, Wadettiwar said thought is being given on accommodating people who trace their lineage to outside of Maharashtra. “Due to different spellings of surnames, people from other states find it difficult to get included in OBC list in Maharashtra. Gawali in Maharashtra is Yadav outside, Teli in Maharashtra is Shahu elsewhere. Same is the case with Kunbi and a few others. A delegation of these communities met me and said that in other states, they fall in the OBC category while in Maharashtra, it’s open category,” said Wadettiwar. The minister assured a delegation of OBC leaders that said soon a decision will be taken regarding this. “I told them that their proposal will be first sent to the OBC commission. We will ask the commission to look into these demands from all angles and revert. Based on their suggestion, the government will take proper steps,” said Wadettiwar. About political reservation for OBCs, Wadettiwar said certain ground realities have to be taken into account. “As of now, there is zero reservation for OBCs in Maharashtra. If we are able to implement it, then the situation in various districts will change because at some places, like Gadchiroli, the reservation will continue to be zero. So, we have to think about all these issues before going ahead,” he said. “In fact, in our all-party meet at Mumbai, all these issues have been discussed. We are focusing on trying to collect empirical data on OBCs so that we can proceed on a strong footing,” said Wadettiwar. When asked about plans to postpone polls till the OBC reservation is sorted out, Wadettiwar said this issue also figured in the all-party meet. “The polls are due around February 2022, so we have time till then to collect empirical data. Suppose we are unable to do so in that time limit, then maybe we can postpone polls for a bit. This was something that everybody agreed upon in the all-party meeting,” said Wadettiwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/agitate-for-school-reopening-instead-of-temples-min-to-bjp/articleshow/85935083.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Taking part in Praja Sangrama Yatra of Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar at Shivareddypeta in Vikarabad district on Saturday, Fadnavis alleged that KCR was selling daylight dreams to poor people in the name of double bedroom houses and waiver of farmer loans. He went on to charge that KCR would formulate new schemes sitting in his Erravelli farmhouse, while his colleagues work out how to fill their pockets and embezzle public money. Fadnavis also said Sanjay’s padayatra would change the fate of Telangana. Addressing a public meeting at Vikarabad district headquarters later, the Maharashtra BJP leader urged the people to bless the BJP to form a democratic, corrupt-free, pro-poor and farmers government in Telangana. Sanjay and Fadnavis interacted with farmers at Shivareddypet village on their way to Vikarabad. “Farmers, women and youth are extending tremendous support to the Praja Sangrama Yatra,” Fadnavis said. He said the yatra was receiving a tremendous response, which only indicates that people want a change of government in Telangana. “People are not happy with KCR government,” Fadnavis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-kcr-busy-focusing-on-enriching-family-wealth-maha-ex-cm-fadnavis/articleshow/85937128.cms||Koride Mahesh

This was also the first time NCP admitted it had recommended the name of Shetti. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar have on Wednesday submitted a list of 12 eminent persons from different walks of life for appointment on the legislative council as the governor’s nominees. We have recommended the name of Raju Shetti in view of his contribution in the field of agriculture and cooperation. There is no change in our proposal. I am surprised over reports in the media saying Shetti’s name has been dropped,” Pawar told mediapersons in Pune. Pawar said as per procedure, the state cabinet has approved the list of 12 eminent persons, and it has been submitted to Koshyari. “We have done our work. We had assured Shetti his name would be recommended for appointment on the legislative council. We have kept our word, now it is for Koshyari to take a final decision,” Pawar said. After the weekly cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Thackeray, Ajit Pawar and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat had called on Koshyari to urge him to take a decision on the nominations. Speculation was then rife in political circles that Thackeray and Ajit Pawar had urged Koshyari to drop the name of Raju Shetti from the NCP’s quota. As per the understanding reached between Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena, each party will get a quota of four persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/shettis-name-on-council-list-no-change-in-mumbai-pawar/articleshow/85937166.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The Mumbai zonal unit of the directorate general of CGST arrested Nilesh Jadyar (35) under various sections of the GST Act of 2017. Officials said Jadyar and his group of seven shell companies availed of ineligible ITC totalling Rs 118 crore on the strength of invoices, without actual receipt of goods or services. Jadyar was produced before the CGST court and remanded to judicial custody. Last month, CGST officials had arrested Santosh Doshi for allegedly controlling the seven fictitious companies —Amal Overseas, C-Kluster Expotrade, Ekon Crystalmerchants, Meticulous Overseas, Ninad Overseas, Parees Overseas and White Opal Expotrade. Later, they learnt Doshi was a director in the companies while Jadyar was the authorised signatory and handled sales and purchase. The modus operandi involved creating dummy units in Jharkhand and West Bengal on the basis of forged documents and passing on the bogus ITC to shell trading firms acting as intermediary entities in Chhattisgarh, said a ministry of finance statement last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cgst-dept-arrests-juhu-bizman-in-rs-118cr-itc-fraud/articleshow/85937160.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Thane||Three swank cars seized, 2 held for sale scam in Thane||THANE: Two men have been arrested for allegedly running a racket involving sale of high-end cars by cheating their owners. The accused offered to sell the cars on behalf of the owners, instead used to sell the vehicles directly without informing the owners of the cars. The police arrested Kamlesh Jadhav and other accused Wasim Qureshi from whom the police, so far, have seized three high-end cars worth Rs 71 lakh while eight more cars are yet to be recovered which are worth over Rs 1 crore. “Our team delved deeper while investigating a cheating case registered with the Manpada police way back in December 2019. In this case, the accused had promised the victim that he would sell his car Innova Crysta to a person and directly sold it to another person without informing the victim and thus cheated him,” said Anil Honrao, the senior inspector of the central crime detection unit. The police during the probe identified that it was Kamlesh Jadhav who had sold the Innova Crysta for Rs 13 lakhs to a person from Karanjade of Panvel, the officer informed. The arrested accused during the probe revealed that he had, along with one of his associates Qureshi, cheated many persons in the same fashion and sold their car to another person without giving them any documents and duping them of millions and that there are as many as 11 people who have been duped, said the officer. The police have so far identified the theft of 11 cars which include two Innova crista, One Honda Accord, Five Ertiga, One Fortuner, One Range Rover, and one Mercedes. The police have urged that if anyone has been duped by the duo they can be approached. The police seized three of the cars which were sold by them and which include Innova Crysta, Honda Accord and Mercedes collectively valued at Rs. 71 lakhs. The police are now trying to find out the details of the eight more cars which had been stolen by them, deceiving the owners and selling them out and out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/3-swank-cars-seized-2-held-for-sale-scam/articleshow/85937196.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

Under this application, micro-algae in photo-bioreactor can clean up to 90% impurity of wastewater by setting appropriate temperature, light intensity, carbon dioxide content, pH level, which is better than the current bacterial-based water treatment process. “The research has been published in the Netherland-based ‘Biochemical Engineering Journal’,” said the team leader Dr. Vishal Mishra, assistant professor in the department. He said that according to the United Nations World Water Development Report 2021 ‘Valuing Water’, global freshwater use has increased six-fold in the last 100 years. Despite this, more than 80 percent of the wastewater is discharged into water streams without treatment. He said that the conventional water treatment process currently in place is extremely costly. These include high electricity costs, sludge disposal and huge amounts of carbon dioxide emissions. Keeping these problems in mind, he said that biological wastewater treatment mediated by micro-algae is a better option. “This will not only clean the waste water up to 90% but also high-quality compost in the form of micro-algae biomass will prove to be very useful,” he claimed. Vishal Singh, a PhD student in the research team with him, informed TOI that machine learning tools have been successfully implemented to optimize micro-algae based wastewater treatment processes. The information gained from this research can aid in experimental design and lead to large-scale wastewater treatment. The extracted information can be easily used for designing micro-algae based tertiary wastewater treatment plants that can be easily integrated with current secondary wastewater treatment plants, where treatment is carried out by bacteria. He further said that the micro-algae wastewater treatment plants can even entirely replace the current conventional wastewater treatment plants. The treated water generated from the micro-algae based treatment plant meets the criteria set by WHO, and can be easily discharged in the rivers. Moreover, the treated water can be used for irrigation and cleaning purposes, thus decreasing the load on available natural freshwater resources. This will benefit society by solving the problem of the shortage of drinking water, he added. Not only this, the protein supplement microbial biomass produced after water treatment can be used for the production of animal feed, fertilizer and biofuel, he said. “In addition, micro algae consumes a large amount of carbon dioxide from atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis and generates oxygen. Decreasing the load of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by micro-algae will resolve the issue of global warming to a great extent,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/micro-algae-to-treat-wastewater-of-90-impurity/articleshow/85937172.cms||---

Krishna Mohan, an assistant professor in chemistry has done exactly that by dedicating five years of his hard work to the fond memories of late professor Hisham Abdul Khader who kindled the passion of hundreds of chemistry students who studied in the University College in the late 1990s. A copy left simulation software for the study of materials science developed by Krishna Mohan will be released by academician Rajan Gurukkal on Teachers Day on September 5. The open-source modelling software created by Krishna Mohan, who did his post-doctoral research at Pohang University of Science & Technology in South Korea, could be of substantial use for students and researchers in the field of chemistry, nano technology, materials science and molecular physics. The software for prediction of molecular properties is the first of its kind developed in the state. It was developed with the support of Indo-Korea Science and Technology Centre, Bangalore. An article about the application software has been published in the latest edition of Wiley’s Journal of Computational Chemistry. “The software-DJMol-is expected to fill the long-felt vacuum in the study of material science in academic institutions in the state. It’s designed in such a way that it would be useful for an undergraduate student to a post-doctoral researcher. The core code is written in Java and Python, using a set of open source libraries and it uses the possibilities of Google Cloud and Git. Since this application software would remain copy left, anybody can develop it further according to their needs and vision,” Krishna Mohan said. He used the open-source libraries, including those in University of Notre Dame in the US and Barcelona University in Spain in conjunction with the DJMol application. “The key to material science studies is available in copy left form. But they are scattered across. By shaping up this software, we have tried to bundle this scattered knowledge into a ready-to-use format,” he said.He said he received assistance from student developer Rahul Sunil of Mar Baselios Engineering College and Dr Kapil Gupta and Dr Seung-Cheol Lee of Indo-Korea Science and Technology Centre, Bangalore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/student-dedicates-simulation-software-in-honour-of-teacher/articleshow/85935120.cms||B S Anilkumar

---||Ahmedabad||Equity beats other asset classes as markets scale new highs||Economic growth picked up pace in 2021, despite a sinister second wave of Covid-19, which temporarily slowed the pace of commercial activity and industrial output. Notwithstanding the challenges, Indian equity markets scaled record high levels through the year assuring handsome returns to investors in equities and equity-based mutual funds. Unlike gold, which was the apple of the investors’ eye last year, stocks have emerged as the best asset class this year. TOI maps the performance of various asset classes from January to August this year, and how it fared for investors. Shares are star performersWith the benchmark equity indices Sensex and Nifty scaling new peaks, equity has beaten other asset classes such as gold, real estate and bank deposits to deliver the best returns to investors in 2021. Sensex has yielded 20% return as the index rose from 47,868.9 points on January 1 to 57,552.3 points on August 31. The return works out to be a handsome 50% in one year till August-end. "There are not many opportunities for returns in other asset classes. As against this, equity index Nifty has offered 9% return in the past one month alone and 49% over the past twelve months. Only stock market is currently offering returns higher than inflation level," said Nilesh Kotak, an Ahmedabad-based stock analyst. "Immense inflow of liquidity, new investors, and investor euphoria contributed to the strong rally in the equity market," added Kotak. Market rally drives up NAV of equity-linked MFsInvestors made good money from mutual fund (MF) investments as well throughout 2021. Overall performance of equity-linked MFs was good with small cap mutual funds delivering up to 46.5% and midcap MFs providing 35% returns between January and August. "Three factors which assisted equities to deliver better returns include a robust vaccination drive coupled with receding cases of Covid-19 after the second wave; no increase in the US Fed rate this year, and the resilience showed by the economy. Market sentiment stayed up, especially in face of the second wave and after it, causing indices to touch new highs," said Mumukshu Desai, director of a city-based financial advisory firm. "Retail as well as High Networth Individuals (HNIs) have invested in MFs. Moreover, institutional investors too have also parked surplus money in debt funds as capital expenditures were halted since the pandemic," Desai added. Buoyed by promising returns, retail investors turned to equity markets, pushing up overall AUM. "Increasing awareness among investors was clear, causing them to choose MFs," said Jayesh Vithalani, a city-based financial advisor. IPOs give handsome rewardsIt is not just the secondary market, but investors have also made good money from the primary market with most initial public offers (IPOs) getting listed at premium.Sample this: Out of seven IPOs launched by Gujarat-based companies, six have yielded positive returns over their issue price. Only Nuvoco Vistas Corporation has offered a negative return of 2% as of August 31. Companies such as GR Infraprojects Ltd and Tatva Chintan Pharma Chem Ltd have each delivered a 90% return over their issue-price by the end of August. Other Gujarati firms like Anupam Rasayan Ltd and Heranba Industries Ltd have yielded 37% and 29% returns, respectively. Fixed deposit returns continue to remain lowFixed deposit rates have continued to remain low with banks having higher liquidity due to the rise in cash deposits. Investors have received returns of 4.9% on bank fixed deposits during Jan-Aug this year. "With interest rates plunging as low as 4.9%, people have slowly begun pulling money out of fixed deposits as they mature and investing them in other asset classes," added Vithalani. Property price hike results in 15% gainsWith real estate developers raising property prices to pass on the increase in construction cost, consumers who bought residential properties in earlier schemes have received returns in the range of 10-15%. "The prices of units in new residential schemes have gone up following a surge in steel, cement, sanitary ware items prices, as well as the increase in transportation costs," said Ashish Patel, president, CREDAI-Gujarat. "As a result, the valuation of properties purchased in schemes launched before the price hike has also gone up by 15% in Ahmedabad, offering the same percentage of returns to those home buyers," Patel added. However, the commercial segment, according to real estate developers, continued to remain muted in terms of returns. "Investors dealing in land have received returns of about 30% this year," added Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/equity-beats-other-asset-classes-as-markets-scale-new-highs/articleshow/85937298.cms||Niyati Parikh

Irked by the lack of action from the civic body and serious inconvenience caused due to foul smell, encroachment on road, advocate Nitin Lalwani and five more residents of Jaripatka had filed a petition in the HC through advocate Shyam Dewani. In the order passed on September 2, judges Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said, “We request commissioner, NMC to set up a team of responsible officers with a direction to them to visit and inspect the area in respect of which this petition has been filed and take immediate action against the hawkers/shopkeepers who would be found to be in violation of the law and the guidelines as afore-stated and submit its report to this court on the next date.” The judges said that if any police-aid is required, same be provided by commissioner of police. “We also request the commissioner to remain present before this court personally or through some responsible officers deputed for rendering an effective assistance in the matter,” they said while adjourning the hearing to September 15. The petitioners mentioned that a hawker zone is located behind the bus stand at Jaripatka. They stated that the area is completely under the grip of shopkeepers, owners of poultry farms/shops and slaughter houses who made permanent structures violating the norms of hawkers zone. The judges referred to the Supreme Court guidelines which stated that hawkers should do the business in an area of 1x1 meter on one side of footpath wherever they exist or on an extreme side of the carriage way, in such a manner that the vehicular and pedestrian traffic is not obstructed and access to shops and residences is not blocked. As per the guidelines, poultry farms engaged in dressing, slaughtering and packing activities are considered under red category and therefore such units are required to be located at a suitable distance away from the human habitation and water body to avoid pollution and infection. Proper arrangements for cleaning and maintaining hygiene at these places on daily basis are required to be made by the owners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-directs-nmc-to-take-action-against-shops-at-hawker-zone/articleshow/85935112.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The arrested duo allegedly threatened to upload the man’s videos and photographs with a woman on social media sites. A search is on for their accomplice. A case has been registered against the trio with the Vishrambaug police. The victim, a building material supplier having an office at Karvenagar, had approached the crime branch officials on Friday. Subsequently, a trap was laid at a spot on Shivaji Road. A team headed by deputy commissioner of police (crime) Shrinivas Ghadge, and inspector Balaji Pandhare and assistant inspector Sandeep Buwa, arrested real estate agent Gaikwad. The woman, pursuing second-year studies of business administration in a city college, was arrested later. The duo were produced before a court on Saturday. They were remanded in police custody till September 8. “The arrested woman’s mother and the victim are good friends. She came to know about her mother’s relationship with the victim and decided to mint money out of it,” Buwa said. “The accused shared the details of her mother’s relationship with Gaikwad and his friend. She then shared her mother’s internet-based messaging service credentials with Gaikwad,” Buwa said. “In May, the accused got all the photographs and videos of the victim and his friend. They used the same credentials to send threat messages to the victim. Gaikwad and his aide visited the victim’s office and demanded Rs15 lakh from him,” he said. “The victim sold his car and mortgaged his motorcycle to pay Rs2.6 lakh to Gaikwad and his accomplice. But the suspects kept on demanding money from him. So, he approached police,” Buwa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-aide-arrested-for-extorting-rs-2-6l-from-bizman/articleshow/85935101.cms||---

---||Nagpur||20k aspirants set to miss SRPF recruitment drive||Chandrapur: Around 20,000 applicants from Chandrapur, Gadchiroli and Gondia districts are likely to miss SRPF recruitment drive, slated for September 9 in Gadchiroli, as they have been denied hall ticket for the exam following failure to upload their domicile certificate. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leader and corporator Sachin Bhoyar has taken up the issue with chief minister, home minister and guardian minister and demanded 2 more days for the aspirants to upload the certificate. Former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar has backed the demand and dashed a letter to home minister Dilip Walse Patil. Bhoyar said recruitment for 176 posts in State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) was announced in 2019 and around 27,000 youths from Chandrapur, Gondia and Gadchiroli had applied through Maharashtra government’s Mahapariksha portal. However, the drive was postponed following Covid-19 pandemic and in the meanwhile state government closed down its Mahapariksha portal. The task of handling the data of 27,000 valid applications was handed over to one Ginger company. This company sent messages and e-mails to the applicants asking them to change their user ID and password. As the applicants complied with the directive, they got a message of ‘registration successful’. Bhoyar further said now that the intensity of the pandemic has eased, state announced September 9 as the exam date for the withheld recruitment drive and accordingly messages were sent to all the applicants. However, when the applicants tried to download their hall tickets, they were denied access by Ginger portal stating that they had not uploaded the domicile certificates. Bhoyar claimed that none of the applicants had received any message for uploading their domicile on the portal. He has estimated that nearly 20,000 applicants are going to lose the opportunity, due to the blunder by the company. Bhoyar on Friday forwarded a memorandum to chief minister through district collector demanding more time for the applicants to upload their certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/20k-aspirants-set-to-miss-srpf-recruitment-drive/articleshow/85935125.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Pune||Pune: Some colleges log higher cut-off marks in second round of admissions||PUNE: There is an interesting twist to the admission process for First Year Junior College (FYJC) with some colleges in the city registering higher cut-off marks in the second merit list as compared to the first one. The second allotment list was announced on Saturday. At HHCP High School and Junior College for Girls, the cut off in the Commerce division was 422 in the first round but the number rose to 436 in the second round. The change in cut-off marks varies from college to college as some of the top colleges have maintained a dip of only two marks as against their first list. At the same time, the qualifying marks at other colleges have reduced considerably. Hrishikesh Soman, principal of Symbiosis College of Arts and Commerce, said, “Many a times, students do not take admission in the first round for various reasons. By the second round, the number of seats available are fewer and the number of students wanting those seats is high. Hence, obviously, the cut-off marks are higher in the second round at some colleges.” At Symbiosis, the cut-off marks in the first list for Arts was 467 but it was 469 in the second list, while in Commerce stream the marks rose from 455 to 459. Meena Shendkar, assistant director of education for Pune division, urged students to check the cut-off marks of each college and change their preference form accordingly for the next round. She also cautioned students, who had been allocated their first preference of college, that once they reject or cancel their admission, they would be blocked for the next regular round and can only apply in the special rounds. Only 15,967 out of 35,694 students eligible for Std XI admission in the centralised admission process (CAP), were allotted colleges in the second round of admissions. After the allotment list in the second round of admissions was released on Saturday, 63,629 seats remained vacant in junior colleges across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits. Of the students given admissions, almost 6,040 have been allotted their first preference of college. Shendkar said that the vacancy is high because the registration for admissions itself was low and one probable reason for the low turnout is because many students from Marathwada and Vidarbha regions have decided not to enroll in Pune colleges, unlike previous years. “This year the turnout has been lower than last year. Covid-19 can be a reason as many parents, especially from villages, may not want to or are unable to send their children to Pune due to financial constraints and otherwise,” said Shendkar. The students allotted colleges in the second round will have time till 6pm on September 6 to confirm their admissions. Since the admission process is online, students can apply for admissions even on holidays that may come up during this period. If a student wants to take admission in the allotted junior college, then they should click on ‘Proceed for Admission’ in student login and then upload the required documents before confirming admission in the allotted college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/some-colleges-log-higher-cut-off-marks-in-2nd-round-of-admissions/articleshow/85935130.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Delhi||Gahlot challenges order that denied injunction against BJP MLA’s charge||New Delhi: Delhi government minister Kailash Gahlot has challenged a single-judge order refusing to grant an ex parte injunction in a defamation suit filed against BJP MLA Vijender Gupta. Gahlot had filed the case against Gupta for allegedly sharing posts on social media against him in connection with alleged irregularities in the procurement of 1,000 low floor buses by Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). A division bench is likely to take up the plea on Monday. A single bench had earlier refused to issue any order without hearing Gupta and noted that “prima facie, no personal allegations appear to have been specifically made against the plaintiff except to the extent of saying that the entire transaction appears to be a 'scam'. At this stage, therefore, no ex parte injunction is called for.” Gahlot has sought a decree of mandatory injunction directing Gupta to immediately delete from his Twitter and Facebook accounts all tweets and posts made against the minister. Justice Asha Menon had granted 30 days to the BJP functionary to respond to the suit as well as the application for an interim order and noted that Gupta’s tweets showed he was “either raising queries in respect of the placing of the order for 1,000 low floor buses and the costs involved in their maintenance or was commenting upon newspaper reports.” The single bench had added that “Some tweets are also in respect of some political action and protest to be organised against the plaintiff.” The high court also earlier observed that a timeline of social media content and the proceedings in the assembly reflected that “the topic was being discussed during the time period i.e., from March to July 2021”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gahlot-challenges-order-that-denied-injunction-against-bjp-mlas-charge/articleshow/85937261.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Varanasi||Learn hard work from CM,Sharma tells oppn leaders||Varanasi: Praising the management skill of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy CM Dinesh Sharma on Saturday asked the opposition leaders to learn hard work and this skill from Yogi and BJP-led government, which has made people happy but demoralized the opposition parties. Talking to the reporters here on Saturday, Sharma attacked Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav without mentioning his name. He said, “Instead of going on the field, opposition leaders are doing politics through twitter and other social media platforms only. They should take lessons from Yogiji, who is staying in the field to know ground realities and manage it well. But, despite getting defeated repeatedly, the opposition leaders are not ready to take lessons.” Reacting to the SP chief’s claim that the BJP-led government is busy in its publicity only, Sharma said it shows his frustration as the opposition leaders have nothing to compare with the development work done by the BJP-led government. “People are happy with the work being done on social issues, development of basic infrastructure, health, education and law and order. Due to the same reasons, the opposition is upset,” he added. Regarding reopening of junior classes despite anticipation of a third wave of Covid-19, Sharma said that safety of children is top priority of the government. Effective measures would be initiated immediately in case of any threat for children, he said. On the occasion of Teachers’ Day on Sunday, he said, 75 teachers of higher, secondary and basic education will be felicitated in the 75 districts by making their performances during Covid-19 pandemic as a base. Talking about education policy, he said that other states are now following the new education system of UP, which is creating new opportunities. He also highlighted the measures initiated by the government for the welfare of the teachers. He also spoke about the growing economy of the state and cautioned the people not to adopt a casual approach against Covid-19 as it has not been eliminated completely so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/learn-hard-work-from-cmsharma-tells-oppn-leaders/articleshow/85937248.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Panel for cut in width to save 233 trees||CHANDIGARH: Finally as many as 233 fully grown trees would be saved from being uprooted for widening of the Panipat-Gohana road near Panipat city in Haryana. A high-level committee constituted on the directions of the additional chief secretary, PWD (B&R) Haryana, has recommended that only 17 trees would be required to be felled for this purpose. The decision not to cut trees has been taken after inspection of the site by a specially constituted committee comprising V S Tanwar, principal chief conservator of forest Haryana; G D Goel, engineer-in-chief (roads) Haryana; Jagdish Chander, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife); and S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana state Pollution Control Board. The committee visited the site on August 18 and observed that the road passes through habited area and felling of trees could be reduced significantly by decreasing the width of the central verge as maximum trees were standing near the earthen shoulders of the original proposal. Accordingly, the committee decided that the PWD should reduce the centre verge from four meters to 1.5 metres. The committee also decided to reduce the width of road from 8.5 meters wide on either side of the central verge to 7.25 meters wide. It was observed by the committee that by adopting this methodology a large number of fully grown trees would be saved. Besides this, the available space of parking will also increase giving relief to the public. The committee has concluded that only 17 trees were required to be felled for the widening of existing road in the public interest and 233 fully grown trees can be saved by reducing width of the central verge. A copy of the committee report was also placed on record before the Punjab and Haryana high court by additional advocate general Deepak Balyan on Friday. The HC had taken cognizance of the issue in the wake of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Amit Kaushik, a Panipat resident. Grievance of the petitioner, who is the resident of a colony situated on the Panipat-Gohana Road, was that the PWD (B&R) department had started the work of widening the road from NH-44 to Dahar village and the same involves cutting of hundreds of trees. Cutting of many trees may be avoided if the width of the divider is reduced, he had pleaded before the HC. The work entails four-laneing of Panipat GT road NH-44 to Dahar upto NH-709. Earlier the HC had restrained the state from cutting the trees in the area till the issue is determined by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/panipat-gohana-road-widening-panel-for-cut-in-width-to-save-233-trees/articleshow/85937249.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Pune||Pune: Residents oppose smart footpath on Pashan road||PUNE: Some residents have criticised the smart footpath project along Dr Homi Bhabha Road (Pashan road) till Sus Road and said the reduction in the carriageway would lead to traffic congestion, especially during peak hours. Sameer Uttarkar, an activist living in Sus, said traffic is less as most offices and all schools, colleges are closed. “Once more things reopen, there will be a lot more traffic,” said Uttarkar. Civic authorities should have acquired additional land for a bigger footpath, he said. Pashan resident Pramod Nimhan said the extended footpath will also mean that vehicles will be parked on the road, leaving even less space for moving traffic. “We had requested the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) not to build these footpaths in places where the road is narrow,” said Nimhan. Dinkar Gojare, executive engineer of the PMC road department, said the civic body had taken residents into confidence before finalising the project. He also said the footpath and cycle track being built are in congruence with the urban street design guidelines (USDG) and the pedestrian policy of the PMC. “We have developed roads with a focus on vehicles for so many years. Pedestrians and cyclists are equally important, if not more. We are building better footpaths and cycle tracks on the 2.5km-stretch of Pashan road and then at a 500m stretch of Sus Road,” said Gojare. Irrigation dept, PMC to hold joint survey along canalThe irrigation department and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) are planning to hold a joint survey to identify encroachments along the 27km-long canal which passes through the city, from Sinhagad Road, Dattawadi, Swargate and Hadapsar. Action will be initiated on basis of outcome of the survey. The irrigation officials said that a meeting will be held soon to chalk out a plan and further course of action. Some encroachments were removed recently by the irrigation department along the canal in Hadapsar and Swargate area. Similar steps will be taken at other places, the irrigation officials said. “Encroachments along the canal is a recurring issue. We will write to the PMC to initiate measures to ensure that both banks of the canal remain encroachment-free. There are some spots like Janata Vasahat, Swargate and Hadapsar where illegal huts and constructions come up. The PMC has a separate department and teams to keep an eye on encroachments and illegal constructions. We want the civic administration to conduct similar checks along the canal,” an official said. Dhiraj Sangade, a local resident from Janata Vasahat area, said that the safety wall has been broken at various locations and the safety mesh is missing at many spots. The officials need to fix it to prevent encroachments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-oppose-smart-footpath-on-pashan-road/articleshow/85935164.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Shimla||Geologists to promote geotourism in fossil-rich Ladakh||MANALI: The Ladakh Science Foundation and IndianGeoparks have come together to protect and preserve the geoheritage sites of Ladakh to educate the children and to promote geotourism in union territory of Ladakh. Concerned about the rich geoheritage sites of Ladakh that are unknowingly being destroyed by the need and greed of rapid urbanisation, some geologists and scientists have come up with an idea to preserve these sites for future generations besides using them for tourism promotion. Geologist Ritesh Arya, an alumnus of Panjab University, Chandigarh and a Guinness world record holder, who is volunteering for IndianGeoparks, said Ladakh has rich heritage and many geoheritage sites which can be integrated to make them geoparks. “The geoheritage sites can be preserved for promotion of geotourism and educating the children about geological evolution of Himalayas and climate changes. The study of these sites can tell us about the changes that this place has undergone in the past. Preservation of sites can leave a good legacy for our future generations,” he said. These sites can be preserved with a little care and they can provide a lot of information about our rich geological past to our future generations and scientists visiting from different parts of the world. Tsering Tashi from Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), who is founder of Ladakh Science Foundation, emphasised the need to protect and preserve our rich geoheritage by educating the community and locals about the need and significance of preserving our glorious past. “A pilot project will be taken up at Shey and Spituk in Leh under guidance of Arya. Research scholars Ilyas Mehnaz Salim and Kunzang will work in different capacity to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental of a lake and try to establish its relationship with the stupas located on its banks. These stupas coincide with the boundary of the lake,” he said. Arya said the area of the lake has been studied by Geological Survey of India, Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences and many universities but today the area is being destroyed due to indiscriminate sand mining. “Same is the case of Spituk clay section, which represents the remnants of a palaeolake. Protection and preservation of these sites, as geoheritage sites is need of hour so that it can be helpful in promoting education, geotourism and studying the past.” Ladakh is rich in fossils that date back millions of years. Arya, who has discovered dozens of precious fossils, had discovered a 20 million-year-old fossil of palm leaves from fragile rocks of Ladakh last year in October, which confirmed that Himalayas have emerged from the Tethys ocean. Hailing from Himachal, hydrogeologist Arya had established country’s first geological laboratory-cum-museum in a school at Choglamsar village of Ladakh where different fossils and rocks have been placed for study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/geologists-to-promote-geotourism-in-fossil-rich-ladakh/articleshow/85937282.cms||---

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said that he (divisional commissioner) should submit a report fixing the accountability for violations and irregularities committed, if any, along with suggestions regarding regularization of the construction already made using the government funds, if that is possible within the provisions of existing Development Control Regulations (DCR). Petitioner Inyatullah Khan, former assistant teacher in Municipal Urdu High School, filed a petition through counsel Firdos Mirza alleging that the proposed school building was never built and a civil suit was filed for claiming legal possession of the land. Earlier, there was a small veterinary hospital, but its building was later used for storing books. However, the Umarkhed Municipal Council office-bearers now want to construct a library and reading room at the same place, despite the fact that its sanctioned plan was rejected by the collector stating that it was meant for the primary school. The council was also told to seek technical sanction from the authorities concerned before starting construction for the school. The petitioner contended that without obtaining the sanctions, the council started school building construction. Moreover, the building map still has all details of a library, which the council authorities are terming as a school building comprising one big hall that looked like a reading room and four small rooms. “The land should not have been put to use exclusively for the library and study room. If at all the library and study room were to be constructed, the same ought to have been done along with the construction of primary school,” the judges said. They further said that the first phase of construction appears to be in violation of DCR and also appears to be without any proper sanctions by the authorities concerned, including the collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/probe-irregularities-in-school-construction-hc-to-div-commr/articleshow/85935155.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The petitioners were arrested by police in Maharashtra in 2018. They were granted bail by the Maharashtra High Court the following year, but were arrested soon after at the Banbasa border in Champawat district while they were on their way to Nepal. They were charged with carrying fake Indian voter ID cards and booked under sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security) and 471 (whoever fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine any document which he knows or has reason to believe to be a forged document) of the IPC. They were presented at the district court and sent to the Champawat district jail. They moved the Uttarakhand high court after which the court granted them bail on the grounds that “there wasn’t strong evidence against them”. But the court said in its order that the Chinese nationals would remain in India and report to the Banbasa Police Station every week. On Friday, the foreigners moved the high court again, seeking deportation to their home country. Ram Singh Bisht, petitioners’ counsel, said the petitioners had the right to plead for their deportation under Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution. The case will be heard by the single judge bench next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/4-chinese-nationals-booked-for-gold-smuggling-cheating-move-hc-for-deportation/articleshow/85933271.cms||Mohammad Anab

Speaking with the media during his visit to the city, Jain — former minister of state in the ministry of rural development — accused the Modi government of selling the wealth created by the blood and sweat of poor people to its industrialist friends. “Many decisions are being taken in Parliament without proper discussions and debate. Congress will fight against it,” he said. Congress leaders have opened fronts in different cities in protest of Centre's monetization policy. Jain’s visit was part of the grand old party’s plans to take on the BJP on this subject. “Due to one after another wrong policies of the government, the people are suffering. Demonetization had left over seven crore people jobless. The telecom sector is already into the hands of private players. The decision to privatize Railways was taken without holding any discussions in both houses of Parliament. Now, they are selling off the profit-making public sector units while adopting the same tactics,” Jain said, accusing the Modi government of misusing the majority in Lok Sabha. The former minister further flayed the saffron party for its plans to privatize the road construction which would lead to hike in toll charges. “Crores are being spent in the name of smart cities, but the infrastructure has hardly improved,” said Jain, who was accompanied by spokesperson Atul Londhe, Umakant Agnihotri, Vishal Muttemwar, Atul Kotecha and other leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/modi-govt-selling-profit-making-psus-without-discussions-in-parliament-cong-neta/articleshow/85935196.cms||---

A century later, the Gandhi Memorial Museum in Madurai is all set to commemorate the historical event on September 21 and 22 with his granddaughter Tara Gandhi Bhattacharjee in attendance. An invitation has also been extended to chief minister M K Stalin for the event.Recalling the historical event which happened 100 years ago, museum vice-chairman M Manickam said Gandhiji came out of 251, West Masi Street, where he had been staying, wearing a loincloth and shawl on the day much to the surprise of his followers who were waiting outside. “This event is known as `Aadai Puratchi’ (dress code revolution or loincloth revolution) in Indian history. The father of the nation did it so as to be identified as one among the masses. As part of this centenary celebration, we have decided to release a book titled, ``Development and Democracy’’ which would be a compilation of essays,” he said.Manickam said ministers and member of parliament will participate in the event. They had invited the chief minister too to attend the event. School students had participated in a drawing competition on the topic, ``Arai Aadiyil Annal’’ and the winners would be given prizes during the celebration. A competition was also held for college students on Gandhiji’s simple life in today’s context and the need for khadi and village industries among various topics.A handbook on Gandhiji’s dress code change was to be released in coordination with INTACH, Madurai chapter which would be circulated among students. He said that they had also requested educational institutes to create awareness on the importance of the historical event on the centenary day. Gandhi Museum director Nanda Rao, treasurer Jawahar Babu and National Gandhi Museum director A Annamali among others were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/gandhi-museum-to-celebrate-centenary-of-mahatmas-loincloth-revolution/articleshow/85935192.cms||---

The university had given similar waiver to students in the 2020-21 academic year too on account of the Covid-19-induced interruptions in academic discourse. “Due to the situation prevailing on account of the Covid pandemic, the matter of waiving the minimum credit requirement was discussed in the sixth meeting of the syndicate standing committee on academics and research and the SSC resolved to place the matter before the consideration of the academic council. Accordingly, the matter was placed before the 12th meeting of the academic council and it resolved to extend the relaxation of waiving minimum credit requirement (for registration to higher semesters) to the academic year 2021-22 also, as granted for the AY 2020-21,” an order issued by the university on September 1 said. The university is currently conducting semester examinations in offline mode by offering another chance for students who won’t be able to appear for the examinations on account of Covid-19-related difficulties. Following the UGC directive, the university had cancelled examinations for lower semesters in 2019 and gave marks to students based on their score in previous semesters. The Kerala high Court and the Supreme Court had rejected the pleas by a section of students seeking cancellation of the offline mode of examination. The university had on several occasions rejected the demand for online examinations, citing inadequate infrastructure and monitoring mechanism for the conduct of the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tech-varsity-waives-minimum-credit-criteria/articleshow/85935225.cms||B S Anilkumar

Her father, a farmer in Kota Muradnagar near Piran Kaliyar, had given wheat for grinding at the flour mill in the village. The teenager was going to pick up the flour and took along a few children of her locality to help in carrying it back to the house. But the routine trip turned terribly tragic. One of the children, 5-year-old Arsh, out of curiosity, ventured close to the moving wheels of the flour mill and got caught in its blades. Seeing this, Sonam tried to pull him out but her dupatta got entangled in the wheel and she, too, was sucked in. While the girl died on the spot, Arsh, who was grievously injured, was rushed to a hospital in Roorkee where he died during treatment. The deaths left the entire village mourning. “Without caring for her own life, Sonam tried to save Arsh which is commendable. The deaths of the two children have shaken all of us. It was an extremely tragic incident,” said Mange Ram, a villager. Farman Ali, the gram pradhan of the village, said that the flour mill motor was located in an open area which made it dangerous for small children. “If the area had been covered, the children would not have been able to access it and the mishap could have been averted.” Meanwhile, police officials said that they have not received any complaint from the families of the two children yet but they have started an inquiry to find the exact reason for the accident. Dharmendra Rathi, SHO of Kaliyar police station, told TOI, “We have recorded the statements of eyewitnesses in the matter and are proceeding with our investigation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/14-yr-old-girl-jumps-on-moving-wheels-of-flour-mill-to-save-5-yr-old-boy-both-dead/articleshow/85933305.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Kanpur||NSA invoked against Jaikant Bajpayi, his aide in Bikru case||Kanpur: The police have invoked the National Security Act (NSA) against Jaikant Bajpayi and his aide Prashant Dubey alias Dabbu on Saturday. Jaikant is the alleged financier of slain gangster Vikas Dubey, who masterminded the Bikru massacre in which eight policemen were killed on night of July 2, 2020. Bajpayi is accused of providing Vikas 25 cartridges of .32 bore revolvers and cash worth Rs 2 lakh on July 2 prior to the Bikru ambush. He had also attempted to help the gangster flee soon after the massacre. All this came to fore during investigation and subsequently the police had included his name in the Bikru case. For invoking NSA, the police had presented the report in front of the district magistrate (Kanpur). “After the approval of the DM, a notice of NSA action was served on both of them in jail,” SP (Outer) Ashtbhuja Singh told TOI on Saturday. The police had also stated in its report that Jaikant was aware that Vikas was hatching a big conspiracy against the police. Even after that, he (Jaikant) did not try to inform the police about it. The police had said in the report that due to the help of Jaikant Bajpai, the Bikru incident happened. As a result, panic spread in the entire area and the villagers had to flee. Apart from this, Prashant Shukla alias Dabboo was also involved in this scandal. The report was prepared by Chaubepur police station of Kanpur (Outer) and produced before the DM. Earlier, NSA action has been taken against three people in the Bikru case. To recall, the police on July 1, 2021 just before the anniversary of the Bikru incident, had invoked NSA against Bablu Muslim and Ramesh Chandra. Prior to that, the police had in the third week of June invoked NSA against one Shivam Dubey, an aide and cousin of Vikas who along with the gangster was also allegedly involved in gunning down eight cops. Under the NSA, a person can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if the authorities feel he or she is a threat to national security or law and order. Eight policemen were ambushed by Vikas and his aides in Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur when they were going to arrest him and fell to bullets fired from rooftops shortly after midnight on July 2 & 3, 2020. Dubey was killed in an encounter in the morning of July 10 when a police vehicle carrying him from Ujjain to Kanpur met with an accident and he tried to escape from the spot in Bhauti area in Sachendi. Prior to his encounter, five of his alleged associates were killed in separate encounters, while 45 including two cops and four women were arrested and sent to jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/nsa-invoked-against-jaikant-bajpayi-his-aide-in-bikru-case/articleshow/85937293.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Dehradun||U’khand BJP leader alleges ‘land jihad’, DGP asked to submit report||Dehradun: Uttarakhand BJP leader Ajendra Ajay, who had earlier opposed the release of Bollywood film 'Kedarnath' and headed protests that led to its ban in the state, has now written to chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami objecting to “members of a certain community” buying land in the hills and setting up places of worship, terming it “land jihad”. A source told TOI that the home department has asked the director general of police (DGP) to submit a report on the matter. In a letter to the CM last month, the senior BJP leader said the population of a certain community was on the rise in the hills. “Apart from setting up religious places, the members are buying land in bulk. This is forcing locals to migrate and also leading to communal clashes in the state,” he alleged. Ajay, former media in-charge of the BJP, told TOI he is demanding curbs on sale of land in the hills. “Our state shares international borders with Nepal and China. The border villages need to be well-populated. But if land purchase by a particular community is driving out another, we need to rectify the situation,” he said. The BJP leader, who previously held a position equivalent to the rank of a minister of state, added that construction of places of worship by a certain community in the land of Char Dham shrines “must also be checked”. In 2018, Ajay had protested that the movie ‘Kedarnath’ promoted "love jihad" and got it banned in the state. The film, starring Sushant Singh Rajput and Sara Ali Khan, showed the lead characters from different communities falling in love with the 2013 flash floods in the backdrop. The Opposition Congress, meanwhile, said the BJP had no data to support its claims of “land jihad” and was raising the issue to gain “political mileage” ahead of 2022 polls. “In any case, why is a BJP leader objecting to something that was a decision of his party? It was their government which lifted all land purchase restrictions in the hills,” said Congress MLA from Kedarnath, Manoj Rawat. In 2003, an amendment was made to the UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reform Act 1950 by the N D Tiwari government to prevent outsiders from buying more than 500 square metres of land in Uttarakhand. In 2007, BJP chief minister B C Khanduri reduced the area of land that could be bought in the state by the outsiders to 250 square metres. In 2018, however, the Trivendra Singh Rawat government set aside the 2003 amendment, paving the way for outsiders to buy any amount of land in the hill state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-bjp-leader-alleges-land-jihad-dgp-asked-to-submit-report/articleshow/85933322.cms||Kautilya Singh

The committee has acted against 70 units by ordering temporary closure for not complying with the safety norms. Showcause notices were issued to 116 more units where drawbacks were detected.District collector J Meganatha Reddy said the special committee inspected 758 fireworks units in Sivakasi, Vembakottai, Sattur, Virudhunagar, Rajapalayam, Srivilliputtur and Aruppukottai.Similarly, the committee also conducted surprise checks in houses and shops where fireworks were being manufactured or sold. The empty cases for fireworks are usually made by women as a cottage industry in their homes as it does not involve the use of any chemicals. But sometimes, units illegally outsource manufacturing of the fireworks to houses in their regions.Six cases of violations were booked under sections 9(B)(1)(b) of Indian Explosives Act of 1884, the collector said. The collector also warned that action would be initiated under the Goondas Act against repeat violators.Complaints about violations and illegal manufacturing of fireworks can be communicated to the special tahsildar (match and fireworks industries inspection) on 9342694959, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/special-team-acts-against-70-fireworks-units/articleshow/85935230.cms||---
---||Pune||Squatters returned soon after action: Hadapsar industries||Pune: Representatives of the Hadapsar industrial estate have claimed that joint action by the state irrigation department, Pune Municipal Corporation and police to remove squatters along a canal running through the area failed to bring about any change as they returned to their settlements minutes after the teams left the spot. The authorities conducted the anti-encroachment drive on Friday on the land belonging to the irrigation department, with department officials saying that the settlements violate the flood lines demarcated along the canal. “The situation went from bad to worse after the action by the authorities. The squatters came back almost immediately, and they have been threatening and verbally abusing us since then,” said Sandeep Kankariya, a member of the Hadapsar Industrial Association. In a letter to various authorities, the association said the settlements came up during the night intervening August 29 and 30, adding that the people who have set up there are the cause of “anti-social” activities, including threats, alcohol consumption, and gambling dens. They added that previous complaints have not been adequately addressed. “A few weeks ago, some of them broke a window of my vehicle, when I got into an argument with them regarding their activities in the area. Before these settlements came up, there have been encroachments and settlements near that spot by the canal, which have caused flooding and drainage issues. We have approached multiple authorities, but they have referred us to others,” said Sandeep Kankariya, one of the members of the association Since the irrigation department does not have a full-time anti-encroachment squad, they had to engage the PMC’s squad to execute the action, for which the irrigation department paid the civic body around Rs 1.4 lakh. “Of course this is a problem we need to solve. We paid the PMC the required amount to carry out the anti-encroachment drive, but now it seems that the process needs to be done all over again. It is also not possible to erect a boundary wall overnight. We will approach the police over the next couple of days, and we shall try to figure out a solution,” said a senior irrigation department official. Police had earlier said they were ready to provide support whenever the irrigation department and the PMC are ready.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/squatters-returned-soon-after-action-hadapsar-industries/articleshow/85935264.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Primary school teachers to work 2 hours more daily||AHMEDABAD: The state education department seems to have woken up from its slumber after a gap of 11 years to increase the daily working hours for teachers by two hours. It has cited a rule in the Right To Education (RTE) Act, 2009 for this decision. However, teachers’ associations have opposed this decision, claiming that the government is trying to settle a score with teachers for not attending the recent ‘assessment survey’. In a notification issued by the department recently, the daily working hours for primary school teachers have been increased by two hours to eight hours from Monday to Friday. On Saturdays, they will work for five hours, which is the current scenario. From 35 hours a week, the working hours have been increased to 45 hours, according to the notification dated August 26. Ghanshyam Patel, president of Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh Gujarat, said the government was holding a grudge against the teachers who did not participate in the August 24 survey that was carried out to evaluate the preparedness of primary teachers in imparting quality education. The decision is likely to impact 2 lakh teachers in the state. “We have made a representation to the state government in this regard and plan to launch a protest if the government does not roll back its decision,” said Patel. The state government faced a major setback recently as only 37% of primary teachers participated in its survey called ‘Shikshak Sajjata Sarvekshan’. Senior officials in the state education department had earlier expressed confidence that more than 80% of teachers would participate in the survey. The association was of the view that the survey was nothing but an exam and is an insult to the teachers. They had given a call to teachers to boycott the survey. For the latest decision, the government has cited the 2009 RTE Act as the reason behind its decision, as per which, primary teachers of Class 1 to Class 5 are supposed to work for 800 hours a year and teachers of Class 6 to 8 are to work for 1,000 hours per year. Digvijay Singh Jadeja, president of Gujarat Primary Teacher’s Association (GPTA), said that the government should roll back its decision. “The government has suddenly woken to realize that it has to implement this rule? Also, the timings in different schools are different in the state. The government has to ensure that there is uniformity here. We feel that the government is holding a grudge against teachers for the debacle they faced in the recent survey,” said Jadeja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/primary-school-teachers-to-work-2-more-hours-daily/articleshow/85937324.cms||---

Action will be initiated on basis of outcome of the survey. The irrigation officials said that a meeting will be held soon to chalk out a plan and further course of action. Some encroachments were removed recently by the irrigation department along the canal in Hadapsar and Swargate area. Similar steps will be taken at other places, the irrigation officials said. “Encroachments along the canal is a recurring issue. We will write to the PMC to initiate measures to ensure that both banks of the canal remain encroachment-free. There are some spots like Janata Vasahat, Swargate and Hadapsar where illegal huts and constructions come up. The PMC has a separate department and teams to keep an eye on encroachments and illegal constructions. We want the civic administration to conduct similar checks along the canal,” an official said. Dhiraj Sangade, a local resident from Janata Vasahat area, said that the safety wall has been broken at various locations and the safety mesh is missing at many spots.

---||Meerut||UP: Thousands of farmers reach Muzaffarnagar for mega rally||MUZAFFARNAGAR: Farmers on all kinds of vehicles – from several districts of Uttar Pradesh as well as from other states – began to reach Muzaffarnagar earlier this week for the Kisan Mahapanchayat to be held at GIC Grounds here on Sunday. On Saturday, more than 10,000 farmers from Agra region managed to dodge the local police and travelled through different routes -- particularly the smaller village roads – to reach Muzaffarnagar by the evening. Police and local intelligence officers had been putting pressure on them not to leave for the mega event, they alleged. Samyukt Kisan Morcha has, meanwhile, arranged over 200 buses to ferry farm association workers from Bihar, Bengal, Odisha, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to Muzaffarnagar. Senior members of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) claimed 50,000 farmers left for the city venue from Rajasthan and Haryana on Saturday afternoon. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) Haryana president Gurnam Singh Charuni on Saturday claimed around 1 lakh farmers from the state will attend the mahapanchayat on Sunday. According to Charuni, the farmers’ display of strength will be a fitting response to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s recent statement that in Haryana, the farmers were “happy” and it is only farmers from Punjab who are protesting. Meanwhile, Muzaffarnagar’s five main gurdwaras and several others on its outskirts have opened its doors for the farmers arriving in the district. The city's gurdwaras have started welcoming the farmers and the community representatives began offering their services with langar facilities on Friday. Automatic roti-making machines, that can make 1,000 rotis every hour, have been set up for rolling out the supplies on a mass scale. Mathura-based BKU member, Gajendra Singh Parihar, said, “Despite the attempts of police to stop us, over 10,000 farmers from different parts of Agra region left for Muzaffarnagar for the mahapanchayat. At least 200 more groups of farmers will travel in the evening. Local heads have been tasked to ensure farmers coming from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan do not face any inconvenience while passing through the Agra region.” Maharashtra-based farmer leader and core committee member of Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh, Sandeep Gidde Patil, said, “Five hundred farmers associated with different organisations from Vidarbha region have already reached the Singhu border. Besides, 1,000 others from across the state are on their way and will be joining others at the Delhi border. From there, they will travel to Muzaffarnagar early on Sunday”. Senior farmer leader from West Bengal, Avik Saha, said, “Over 100 groups of farmers from southern states are on their way to Singhu border via trains. They will be leaving for the venue early on Sunday. Buses will take them from Delhi borders." Meanwhile, six companies of the provincial armed constabulary (PAC) and two companies of rapid action force (RAF) other than police forces from various districts have been deployed here for the mega event. DIG (Saharanpur range) Preetinder Singh said on Saturday that the event will be videographed while five SSPs, seven ASPs and 40 police inspectors will be posted on the security duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/thousands-of-farmers-reach-mnagar-for-historic-mahapanchayat-today/articleshow/85933337.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Mangroves too need virus jab to survive pest attack, says study||MUMBAI: The Institute of Wood Sciences and Technology, Bangalore, has suggested different bio-control methods to eradicate the pest infestations that are largely seen across mangroves along Mumbai and Maharashtra coasts after winter season. One of these is injecting nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) in the surrounding teak forests such as Sanjay Gandhi National Park from where it spreads to mangroves to get rid of the disease. The pest that virtually eats and blackens mangroves comes from the bamboo and other plants located in the nearby forests during pre-summer months and goes back to reappear in February every year. Mangroves are considered as an integral part of the coastal ecosystem and are protected by law. The report also recommends more study to know if the pest also led to several beneficial and positive impacts on the ecosystem as viewed by some experts and environmentalists. The study revealed that the infestation of five defoliating pests among 20 pests as major pests. “Eco-friendly approaches such as biological control, application of botanical-based biopesticides, and entomopathogenic fungi are considered as the best alternatives to chemical pesticides. The snails can be effectively controlled by sprinkling common salt. Nimbecidine, a commercial neem product and an entomopathogenic fungus were effective in controlling the defoliating pests in the field,” the study opined. While confirming the outcome of the report, deputy conservator of forests (mangrove Cell), Neenu Somaraj, said the study was commenced to understand the causes and remedies. “Based on the findings, the next line of action will be decided. Of the five bio-control methods recommended, which one to adopt based on their financial feasibility will be decided in the next move before implementing biocontrol methods,” she pointed out. The study revealed the fact that when food resources were exhausted in teak plantations situated in and around mangrove areas, the pest might be migrating into the mangrove plants to sustain its generations and move back when teak gets new leaves. Thus, this insect is probably using mangrove habitat as a carryover habitat. Further studies are required exclusively for the migration from teak-grown areas from Sanjay Gandhi National Park towards mangrove areas. Indepth studies are also required to see the possibility of using Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (NPV) in the mangrove ecosystem to control the pest on a larger scale. “Moreover, it is also viewed that outbreaks of pest incidence may also lead to several beneficial and positive impacts on the ecosystem. This promotes mangrove diversity, contribution to nutrient cycling and thereby enhances fishery resources and allows food sources for birds etc. More studies are required...” the report stated at the end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mangroves-too-need-virus-jab-to-survive-pest-attack-in-mumbai-study/articleshow/85937378.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

---||Pune||Minor climate variations can lead to huge socio-economic effect: Study||PUNE: Minor fluctuations in climate can lead to vast scale socio-economic disruptions, a recent study has revealed. Using records spanning over 220 years, the study found that only a 14% drop in the average annual rainfall led to vast scale socio-economic disruptions and human impacts (famines) over two centuries ago in semi-arid parts of British India (then Bombay and Madras presidencies under the British rule). The study was conducted by climate scientists from the University of Colorado-Boulder, US, and Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), among others. It was recently published in international journal Nature. The study assumes significance, especially in the backdrop of below normal monsoon in India so far, and IMD’s forecast of monsoon ending on the lower side of normal this season. Based on the findings, researchers suggested that apart from extreme rainfall deficits, climate change risk assessment should also consider the potential impacts of more frequent low-level rainfall reductions in drought prone semi-arid regions in India. Atreyee Bhattacharya, senior climate scientist from the University of Colorado, told TOI, “Famines that caused such severe disruptions and loss of lives over 200 years ago in India were not caused by severe deficits in rainfall. The study, which analysed the impact of climate variability on the socio-economic conditions in the two presidencies during the British rule, also suggests that drier climate cycles, especially in a warming climate, appeared to be prone to an annual rainfall reduction threshold of nearly 14%. This was further worsened by colonial economic practices and policies, leading to extreme negative socio-economic disruptions that came at a steep human cost.” The Bombay and Madras presidencies during the British rule stretched from Maharashtra in the west to Tamil Nadu in the south. To arrive at the findings, researchers turned to 18-19th century British Colonial documents, archived at the National Archives of India (NAI), New Delhi, and IMD data. They extracted information and mapped results of famine incidence (both local and regional) onto high-resolution independent records of rainfall variation (historical rainfall from IMD, tree ring reconstructions and cave carbonate based reconstructions). She said the repeated nature of famine incidence during the 1800’s, every 5-10 years, had a huge socio-economic impact. “Every time there was a fluctuation in rainfall, there would be a famine. Thus, famines caused by rainfall fluctuations was not a one-off incident. There were close to 20 famine instances over 200 years, and every time, they caused a major impact, such as starvation and deaths,” she said. Bhattacharya said NAI documents contained a chronological sequence of socio-economic stress triggered by ‘rain failures’, which lasted for at least one, but often two consecutive years leading to crop failures, grain price hike, food scarcity, farmer migration, increase in starvation and mortality, slavery, epidemics, riots and death. Other institutes involved in the study included Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS)- Bengaluru, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT)-Delhi, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, and University of California-Berkeley.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/minor-climate-variations-can-lead-to-huge-socio-eco-effect/articleshow/85935258.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Nagpur||Helping Hands: People realized the power of supporting each other||Nagpur: Though the pandemic made physical distancing mandatory in both waves, it was the kindness and positivity of some that brought humanity together as a community and society. The first lockdown was a testing time for many. While the government, political outfits, associations and NGOs continued to help people with all their might, a unique spirit of helping each other on a personal level was experienced. Individuals took a stand and raised help for the needy. During the lockdown, many donated food and money to the needy in their personal capacity. Many even donated mobile phones to students for their online classes. It was not possible to organize blood donation camps so voluntary blood donors arranged blood for those who needed regular transfusion. In tough times, people realized that even individuals could make a huge difference. “People went out of their way to help others during the pandemic,” said well-known social worker Khushroo Poacha. “It was the responsibility of social organizations and dedicated groups like us to help people. But hundreds of such people, who were not associated with any group or NGO, came forward in their personal capacity and helped others,” he said. Poacha also thanked donors who generously donated for his work. “It was all right to donate in the first wave. But by the time the second wave hit, many people were not in a position to take out money. Still, in the second wave, we got massive support from local as well as NRIs,” he said. There are some heroes who got recognition through the media. TOI highlighted the contribution of many of them via the series titled ‘Lockdown Heroes’. However, there were many unsung heroes, who did their job silently and became a part of the crowd again. “During the second wave, we noticed some people who helped needy patients get beds. Even before the NMC started he bed information platform, these people were actively calling hospitals all the time,” said Dr Mukul Deshpande, a resident doctor from GMCH who worked in the Covid hospital. TOI talked to at least 25 such individuals who either donated food in their personal capacity or provided oxygen concentrators and medicines to the needy. They said, not their name, but the spirit of helping the needy should be highlighted as this practice should continue even post-Covid. “Many families tested positive during the second wave. I used to call up such families and ask them if they needed groceries, vegetables, medicines and milk,” said a 19-year-old college student. “I used to leave the parcel near their closed door. They used to transfer money into my account. I don’t think I did any great. But I still have the screenshots of their messages full of gratitude which bring a smile to my face,” he said, adding, many people did such things during the lockdown and realized the power of helping. FOR A COMMON CAUSE* Health care workers worked hard to take care of people * Teachers adapted online format to teach students * Grocery stores worked extra hours to ensure home delivery * Restaurants shifted to home deliveries and takeaway options * Many individuals provided medicines, oxygen concentrators, searched beds for needy * Many provided cooked food, grocery kits and financial help to those who lost income * Many came forward to respond with kindness and hope * A fine example of community service was witnessed||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/helping-hands-people-realized-the-power-of-supporting-each-other/articleshow/85935287.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Congress trumps BJP, wins 670 panchayat samiti seats, 4 out of 6 zila parishads||JAIPUR: In a boost for Congress amid the festering internal conflict in Rajasthan, the party on Saturday won 670 panchayat samiti seats to BJP's 551 in the rural polls held across six districts, reversing the 2015 result when the saffron party – then in government – had emerged victorious. The pattern was repeated in the zila parishad elections, with Congress getting 99 and BJP 90 out of the 200 seats to which polls were held. Congress had a clear majority in four out of the six zila parishads — Dausa, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Sawai Madhopur — while BJP swept the Sirohi zila parishad. In Bharatpur, there was no outright winner, with BJP getting 17 seats to Congress's 14 and Independents bagging four. BSP won two seats there. In the previous elections, BJP had won 584 out of 1,328 panchayat samiti seats, as against 1,564 that were at stake this time. Its last zila parishad tally was 100 to Congress's 90. Independents comprised the third largest block of winners in the panchayat samiti stakes with 290 seats, leaving Hanuman Beniwal-led Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) a distant fourth with just 40. BSP got 11 seats. The results in two wards couldn’t be declared as polling was not held. “In one of the wards of Baijupada panchayat samiti in Dausa district, the forms of both the candidates were rejected. This seat remains vacant. Also, in one of the wards of Tunga panchayat samiti in Jaipur district, voters boycotted the election. So, not a single vote was cast in this ward,” deputy secretary Ashok Jain of the state election commission said. The overall turnout across three phases of polling in Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bharatpur, Sawai Madhopur, Dausa and Sirohi districts was 64 per cent. Elections were also held to the offices of six district pramukhs and deputy district pramukhs and 78 pradhans and up-pradhans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-trumps-bjp-in-raj-rural-polls-sweeps-4-out-of-6-zila-parishads/articleshow/85937359.cms||---

---||Delhi||Unchoking streets: Four multilevel parking lots planned in Karol Bagh||NEW DELHI: To address the long-pending demand of traders for developing off-street parking in Karol Bagh and neighbouring areas to decongest roads, North Delhi Municipal Corporation has prepared a fresh proposal for constructing multilevel parking lots on Ajmal Khan Road (Bank Street), Old Rajendra Nagar, Shastri Park and Pusa Lane with a total capacity of 1,922 cars. The proposal will now be placed in the standing committee meeting. Earlier, the civic body had invited tenders, but the high reserve price and lease amount led to no parties expressing interest in taking up the projects. The municipal commissioner submitted the revised plan highlighting that Karol Bagh remained a “very congested area” and efforts were needed to decongest it. An official said the proposal was updated after recent amendments made by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) in Master Plan 2021 gave relief in the height of parking facilities. The corporation had created a committee in June, which recommended that a new policy should be adopted on the pattern followed by DDA for conversion of commercial properties from leasehold to freehold. “There won’t be any restriction on the height of parking lots, provided they get the approval of the agencies concerned, such as Delhi Urban Art Commission, Archaeological Survey of India and the fire department. However, the amendment has put restrictions on areas for commercial use. For a parking lot on a 3,000 sqm plot, FAR for commercial use can be 100%, but for plots above 3,000 sqm, 60% FAR will be allowed,” said a senior north corporation official. The official added, “We have also changed the reserve price of plots earmarked for multilevel parking lots at the four sites.” The development of more vehicle spaces is being monitored by Delhi High Court and the high-powered committee of Union ministry of home affairs. “The parking project at Ajmal Khan Road will be constructed on a public-private partnership for a lease period of 99 years with a payment of 2.5% annual lease rent. The area earmarked for the parking lot is 4,115 sqm and space will be created for parking at least 500 vehicles. Earlier, the reserve price was Rs 157.6 crore, but no response was received for the tender,” the proposal stated. In the fresh proposal, the reserve price has been increased to Rs 175.6 crore. According to the project report, the Shastri Park facility would be the biggest of the four units with a provision of 577 vehicles and a site area of 4,806 sqm. The reserve price for this facility has been kept at Rs 119.4 crore. For the Old Rajendra Nagar parking project, the civic body reduced the reserve price five times and brought it down to Rs 95.9 crore as there was no response to the tender. The area of the plot is 3,871.3 sqm with a provision for parking 464 vehicles. For Pusa Lane, the reserve price has been fixed at Rs 148 crore. Unlike other projects, it was conceived recently with a provision for 381 cars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unchoking-streets-four-multilevel-parking-lots-planned-in-karol-bagh/articleshow/85935269.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Mumbai||Bombay high court reserves order on NCB plea opposing LSD paper ‘re-test’||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday raised several queries on how other forensic laboratories test the weight of LSD and also sought to know whether the Narcotics Control Bureau was willing to send the blotter papers seized from an alleged drug peddler, Anuj Keshwani, back to laboratory for a re-test, after his lawyer said the paper’s weight ought not to be counted. The HC was hearing a petition filed by NCB which challenged an April 2021 order of the special trial court directing it to send the sample to the forensic science laboratory, Gandhi Nagar, Gujarat, to ascertain the weight of the purported Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), a hallucinogenic narcotic drug, sans the blotter paper. The additional solicitor general Anil Singh, representing the NCB, said it was not necessary to send the seized material for a re-test to the laboratory, but the agency was willing to file a clarificatory additional affidavit on whether the lab had tested the entire seized material too. The HC bench of Justice Revati Mohite Dere concluded hearing the matter and reserved it for judgment, on merit. The battle over weight of the drug and the legal point on whether the paper weight matters assumes importance as offences under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act depend on the drug weight for punishments. If the amount is ‘small,’ punishment is less; for ‘commercial’ value, the sentence is severe and there is a bar on bail. The commercial value of LSD is 0.1 gram due to its potency. Keshwani was found in possession of 0.62 gm, said NCB last September when 31 blotter papers with LSD were recovered during a search, apart from other drugs. The FSL report in Keshwani’s case was silent on whether blotter paper was weighed too, his lawyers said, and thus “defective.” His case is that the seizure panchnama on September 6, 2020, was for 42 blot papers weighing 0.62 gm, and the FSL report records weight of LSD as 0.62 in 31 papers on March 2, 2021. LSD is placed as small dots on the blotter paper for consumption. The ASG, along with advocate Shriram Shirsat for NCB, said since the paper is consumed too, it forms a part of the mixture and when seized, its weight has to be factored in too. An earlier HC order had held the blotter paper to only be a carrier material and not part of the mixture. The NCB is relying on a recent Supreme Court ruling in Hira Singh’s case, which said the weight of mixtures of drugs sold on street ought to be considered including a neutral substance, not just its pure form. Merchant assisted by advocate Gayatri Gokhale in his arguments said while he agreed with the SC ruling in the Hira Singh case, the judgment would not apply to the facts of Keshwani’s case since LSD contained on paper blots “is not a mixture or preparation according to the definition in NDPS Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-reserves-order-on-ncb-plea-opposing-lsd-paper-re-test/articleshow/85937414.cms||---
---||Pune||Water release from dams stops after shower-break||Pune: Breaks in rainfall has led to stopping of water release from Khadakwasla and other dams. State irrigation department officials said that discharge from Panshet has been stopped, while water release into the canal has been brought down by half and will be stopped on Sunday.  Currently, water is being discharged from Panshet, while Khadakwasla is releasing water into the Mutha canal. “Water release into the canal was initiated after the catchments received heavy spells of rain. The released water is meeting water requirements of rural areas and Kharif crops. A review was held in the last few days on the water requirements for rural areas. The ponds are filled to maximum capacity. Hence, the supply is being stopped now,” said Popat Shelar, deputy engineer, Khadakwasla irrigation circle. Shelar said that inflow of rainwater into the reservoirs has reduced since the last two weeks because of scanty rains in the catchments. Hence, it has been decided to stop release of water. The discharge will be resumed if heavy rains return to the catchments, he added. The water stock in the dam has reduced due to the dry spell for two consecutive weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/water-release-from-dams-stops-after-shower-break/articleshow/85935305.cms||---
---||Jaipur||One shooter arrested from Panipat in NHAI consultant murder case||JAIPUR: Police on Saturday arrested one of the two sharpshooters, involved in the murder of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) project consultant Rajinder Kumar Chawla, from Panipat in Haryana. The sharpshooter has been identified as Dharmendra Singh, 27, additional commissioner of police (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba told TOI. The second suspect is on the run. Police have learned that the sharpshooters were promised jobs in constructions projects. Singh was arrested following the interrogation of four key conspirators — Karandeep Sheoran (29), the owner of E5 Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, Naveen Bisla (31), Vikas Singh (33) and Amit Nehra (26). They were arrested on Friday. “Initial probe pointed out that the sharpshooters were allegedly hired for Rs 15 lakh to kill Chawla on August 26. However, as more facts emerged, it turned out that Singh and the second shooter were also promised jobs at constructions sites,” Lamba told TOI. Sources said two shooters were ferried from Haryana to Jaipur on August 26. They were dropped near Amrapali Circle. From there, they walked to the NHAI office. They were given a “signal” shortly before 2.40pm, that the man walking out of the NHAI office to smoke a cigarette is their target. The shooters walked near Chawla and fired a single shot from a weapon (suspected to be a pistol). Police said, the shooters were told that a black SUV would wait to take them back to Haryana after the crime. Plans soon went awry when the accused could not get to the getaway vehicle (the black SUV), driven by two of the conspirators. “Singh and his aide were completely bewildered when they could not find the promised ride back to Haryana. In panic, they moved around Vaishali Nagar area, looking for auto-rickshaws and buses to get away,” an official said, adding neither Singh nor his partner knew anything about Jaipur. “The two were completely confused and thought that it would be best to return to the crime scene. They later realised that police would be at the spot and fled to different cities,” the police official added. Commissioner praises cops who cracked case:City police commissioner Anand Shrivastav on Saturday felicitated the police team that cracked the Vaishali Nagar murder case. Speaking at the Vaishali Nagar police station, Shrivastav lauded the team led by additional commissioner, crime, Ajay Pal Lamba, DCP crime, Digant Anand, DCP west, Richa Tomar, Additional DCP, Ram Singh, ACP Rai Singh Beniwal, and SHO Anil Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/one-shooter-arrested-from-panipat-in-nhai-consultant-murder-case/articleshow/85937386.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Over 200 Covid cases recorded for 3rd consecutive day in dist||Coimbatore: Over 200 Covid-19 cases were reported for the third consecutive day on Saturday in the district. Positive cases are going up in the district as it did last week after the Onam festival. Positivity rate, which was 1.6 about 10 days ago, has gone up to 2.2. A total 244 cases were reported on Saturday, which is more than 239 and 215 cases reported on Friday and Thursday respectively. Previously, the most number of cases was reported on July 31. Roughly 48% of the positive cases were reported from the city, which also has a highest of 30 containment areas out of total 68 in the district. Cases keep fluctuating in the district for the last few weeks, which is also recording the highest number of daily cases in the state. It was after Onam festival last month that there was a slight increase in the cases. While cases subsided for a few days, they have started increasing in the last few days. There was a substantial increase in the vaccination rate in the district, from 12,000 to 40,000 in the last two weeks, thanks to the vaccination camps conducted by the district administration. A sudden influx of people from Kerala and other places after relaxation of lockdown norms could be a reason for the slight increase in cases, Coimbatore collector G S Sameeran told TOI. “But there is no substantial increase in cases compared to the recent days. We could see that cases stagnate between around 200. It has neither reduced nor increased substantially. We are using it as an opportunity to vaccinate most of the population so that even if cases increase substantially, mortality and morbidity is reduced,” he said. As many as 194 patients returned home after treatment on Saturday, leaving 2,180 active cases in the district. Four deaths were reported against three on Friday. The district has recorded 2,280 deaths due to Covid so far. Out of the 23,6965 cases reported so far, 23,2505 people were cured and returned home. In Tirupur district, 87 cases were reported on Saturday which was less than 98 reported on Friday. There were no deaths in the last three days. So far, 932 people have died due to Covid. With 91 people getting discharged on Saturday, 752 active cases are undergoing treatment. Out of the 90,657 cases reported so far, 88,973 got discharged and returned home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/over-200-covid-cases-recorded-for-3rd-consecutive-day-in-dist/articleshow/85935301.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: ‘26 administration & revenue officials patronized don Vikas Dubey’||LUCKNOW: The judicial commission probing into all aspects of slain gangster Vikas Dubey’s rise and fall have endorsed the findings of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) which had found that as many as 26 officials of the district administration and revenue department inappropriately helped him and his associates in getting arms licences and fair price shop permits. The Supreme Court had mandated a three-member inquiry commission headed by Justice (retd) BS Chauhan to probe into the encounter of Dubey and five of his alleged associates. The panel also probed the circumstances which led to the rise and fall of the ganglord. Before this, the state government had formed an SIT under the chairmanship of senior IAS officer Sanjay Bhoosreddy just after the encounter of Dubey. According to the SIT report, the officers in collusion with the gangster included six sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs), an additional city magistrate (ACM), seven block development officers (BDOs), two tehsildars and two sub-tehsildars, along with a revenue inspector and two supply inspectors. The list also included two village development officers and three lekhpals. The commission, which submitted its report a fortnight ago, has recommended action against all of them. The report also states that the block development officer posted in Chaubeypur was in constant touch with Dubey and in one year from December 2019 to March 2020 they had spoken 22 times. Similarly, the then revenue inspector, village development officer, supply inspector were all in constant touch with Dubey. This report was prepared by the SIT on the basis of call detail records of the last one year. While endorsing these findings of the SIT, the commission states that it shows that revenue officials had friendly relations with Dubey. It also categorically states that all these officials were so friendly with the ganglord that if any common man complained against him then he would know in advance and used to thrash the complainants. The commission also endorsed the view of SIT that departmental inquiry should be conducted against four SDMs, and an ACM, while administrative action must be taken against four SDMs and eight tehsildars, and other revenue officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/26-admin-revenue-officials-patronized-don-vikas-dubey/articleshow/85937417.cms||---

He has revealed details of the other doctor and we will summon him for questioning,” said sub-inspector Vishnu Wadkar on Saturday. Wadkar added, “The 34-year-old doctor was busy attending a patient when the suspect walked into her clinic. He opened the register maintained at the reception counter and started clicking photos. The receptionist stopped the man from taking photos and alerted the doctor. She rushed out of her chamber and snatched the phone from the man’s hands. After the doctor sought to know why the man was clicking photos without seeking her consent, he started arguing with her.” “In a fit of rage, the suspect charged at the doctor. He caught hold of her collar and misbehaved with her before fleeing the spot. The suspect was taken into custody after the doctor registered an FIR against him relating to molestation and criminal force under Sections 354 and 352 of the Indian Penal Code on September 2,” he added. The doctor refused to comment when contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/21-yr-old-held-on-charge-of-molesting-doctor/articleshow/85935304.cms||---

The dropout rate, especially among girls, was extremely high. That’s when Rangaiah Kaderla stepped in. Then the lone teacher of the school, he admitted his two children – a girl and a boy – there. Not just that, his wife too started taking classes at the school for free. Result: The enrollment numbers began to rise and currently stand at 281. Many of them are girls. "It’s a remote village where there’s a lot of hesitancy among people to send their kids to school. My move helped instilled confidence among them," said Kaderla the now acting headmaster. He also went from door to door to encourage and educate people, thereby boosting enrollment numbers. Today, the school has 15 teachers and tech facilities like projectors and computers. His Super 100 programme launched amid the pandemic, where selected students teach their peers and lower classes, and initiatives like the ‘FM Sawarkheda’ (managed entirely by students) that has listeners across the mandal or ‘Ghar Ban Gaya Vidyalaya’ won him a national teacher award this year. Kaderla was honoured with this recognition by the department of school education and literacy, union ministry of education. …................................. Turning walls into blackboards Removed from the world of online classes, the pandemic could have marked the end of education for students of Puttapalli village (Karimnagar), but for their teacher, S Bhagyalakshmi. Aware that the children of the small Mandal Parishad Primary School had no access to gadgets, she took the lessons to their doorsteps by converting walls into blackboards. It started with common walls in public spaces – where the children gathered to play etc -- and moved to the houses of locals. Now, almost all walls of Puttapalli village have lessons written all over them. Every day, students sit in front of them and attend class. “I realised students were forgetting what they were taught in school, as they were away from their classrooms for months. So, I identified some spots and turned them into blackboards. I started writing the alphabet, numbers, tables etc. To create a visual memory. Eventually, I also turned walls in students’ houses into blackboards. It’s proved to be very effective,” said Bhagyalakshmi. Her initiative was soon replicated by many teachers in other districts of Telangana. -- S Bhagyalakshmi …................................... Taking English to T villages Nothing else gives Nula Purnachander as much pleasure as hearing a student of his speak in fluent English. To ensure that rural kids do not fall behind those from upscale corporate schools, this 49-year-old teacher from the Zilla Parishad school in Medak’s Maktabhupathipur village has taken it upon himself to teach the language to his students. And for it, he even provides them with a dictionary, in case they cannot afford one. “It is a sheer joy for me to see my students learn to speak English,” said Purnachander who worked in the Maldives before joining the government school. And not just English, he even takes his children around the globe with an Atlas, helping them understand where a place is, how far it is from where they live, its geography and the present-day context – all this so that they can be on par with other children from bigger cities and towns. -- Nula Purnachander Setting up free live streams Amid the pandemic, Mutyala Ravindar realised that many students might miss out on learning with schools being shut. To bridge this gap, the teacher dipped into his own resources to conduct live classes, share material and organise tests for them. He also realised that many students weren’t able to follow lessons broadcasted through television and TSAT and, therefore, curated special sessions to clear their doubts – all out of his own interest and funds. “I bought a pen tablet and other accessories and to conduct live sessions through a live teaching app. Even now that physical classes have resumed, I am continuing with the live stream so that students, who are unable to attend class physically, can make use of it,” said Ravindar working at the Government High School, Nallakunta. It’s come as a huge help particularly to students down with fever, cold, or other such ailment.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Funds raised for 75 TVs at informal schools||The state government started the home learning initiative to ensure that school students did not miss their education amid Covid-19 restrictions. However, there are many areas where students face difficulties in pursuing online education, as there is no internet connectivity or they do not have mobile phones and other such digital mediums required for ‘home learning’. To overcome the challenge, the Cluster Resource Centre, Suraj, in Jotana taluka of Mehsana district raised funds to install 75 television sets in 10 villages. Each village has three learning centres where students learn from the DD Girnar channel. The informal schools in this area have been running smoothly since then. The cluster raised about Rs 2,25,000 from locals and other donors for 75 television sets with DTH connections. The initiative was started by CRC Suraj’s Ravi Patel and was supported by teachers and principals of the villages. The education department had last year issued guidelines for home-learning in all primary, secondary and higher secondary educational institutes in the state. To encourage participation in informal schools, posters and banners were also put in villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/funds-raised-for-75-tvs-at-informal-schools/articleshow/85937543.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Everything was going according to plan for the talented left-winger and he was moving up the ranks at Sporting Clube de Goa. Then, in one moment of madness, it all fell apart. In May 2019, Trijoy lost his cool in the Taca Goa (U-20) final against FC Goa and assaulted the match referee. He had to pay a heavy price as the Goa Football Association imposed a one-year ban on him. “A major twist came into my life because of the referee incident. It was a dark phase in my life. Whatever may be the reasons, I still regret doing it,” said Trijoy in a video released by his new club, Churchill Brothers FC. Without football, the 22-year-old was like fish out of water. He tried to stay positive and maintain his fitness, but it wasn’t easy. He felt humiliated, like when match officials refused to start an Inter-Ward game until Trijoy left the field. His loved ones couldn’t see him in such a state. They advised him to move abroad and start a new life. But football was Trijoy’s life. “Things were tough for a couple of months till I got a second chance, that is when I got an offer from Churchill Brothers. All credit goes to coach Severino (Fernandes) who had full faith in me. It was really unexpected, but this was a turning point in my life,” said Trijoy. The youngster from Cuncolim got a new lease of life when he joined Churchill last season for their Goa Professional League team. He was initially used in the first two games, then benched. However, with the arrival of former Dempo SC and India head coach Armando Colaco, things started to look good again. He made four starts and three appearances from the bench and scored three goals. “During the ban it was very difficult for me to handle it. I almost went into depression, but my family and friends always supported me. Thankful to Churchill (Alemao) sir for giving me this opportunity to become something in life,” said Trijoy. His patience and hard work is likely to pay off this season as Churchill are building a strong team for the I-League where they finished runnersup. As he has now been handed a chance to return to the top with Churchill’s senior team, Trijoy will hope he can make news again, this time for the right reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/trijoy-gets-new-lease-of-life-with-churchill-bros/articleshow/85960007.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

The murder took place late on Friday night in Amroha. The man was arrested on Saturday based on a complaint lodged by the deceased’s brother. The deceased, Shama, 36, of Rajabpur had married Fazil from Anwarnagar of Moradabad seven months ago, a year after her first husband’s demise. She had a 14-year-old son from the previous marriage. The couple moved into a rented house in Rajabpur. Fazil purchased old clothes from rural areas and supplied them to Moradabad-based traders. Shama's sister, Farha, who is staying with the couple, was sleeping in the adjoining room when she woke up on hearing the gunshot report. She rushed to her sister’s room and found her lying in a pool of blood with a gunshot wound on her temple. She raised an alarm and called neighbours. Someone informed the police. Shama’s family members alleged that Fazil had started beating Shama within a few days of their marriage. According to superintendent of police Poonam (who goes by her first name), police recovered three spent cartridges from the spot. Amroha's additional superintendent of police Chandra Prakash Shukla also inspected the spot. Further investigations are on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/suspecting-affair-man-shoots-wife-dead-for-talking-over-mobile/articleshow/85933377.cms||Harveer Dabas

A salon owner from Aundh cited what is humorously referred to as ‘Indian stretchable time’ and said people will take a while to adjust to an appointment system. “We keep an hour as buffer between appointments because customers tend to be late,” said the salon owner. Manasee Dogra, who owns a salon in Kalyaninagar, said though people have been adhering to norms better since the second wave, there are still some who simply walk in. “We tell them to wait or come back with an appointment. Also, clients are late for their appointments most of the time. I tell them to come half-an-hour early — for a 2pm appointment, I tell them to be in by 1.30pm,” said Dogra. In contrast, the number of people making reservations at restaurants and bars has increased after the second wave. Restaurateur Sandy Singh said reservations have increased by 50% as customers don’t want be turned away. “While we have been insisting on reservations, there will always be some who make last-minute plans,” said Singh. Senior epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee, meanwhile, urged commercial establishments to implement infrastructural measures as well, in addition to ensuring social distancing and masking. “Shops should be well-ventilated as they see more footfalls. ,” said Banerjee. Urging caution, Banerjee said that due to vaccinations, people are more keen on going out. “But it gives a false sense of security as vaccination does not prevent transmission, and so, even after inoculation one has to be careful,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/appointment-system-yet-to-catch-on-with-clientele-as-businesses-open-up/articleshow/85935335.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Starting at about 4 pm, the rain lashed the city in intensive spells, turning several roads into rivulets, and resulting in severe traffic blocks during the peak hours. At Amberpet, the Moosarambagh bridge turned into a virtual nightmare, with no outlet for the water to drain. Similar scenes were witnessed at Bapu Nagar of Amberpet, Krishna Nagar in Yousufguda, Moosaram Bagh, Dilsukhnagar, Shivam Rao, Malakpet, P&T Colony and Kodandaram Nagar of Saroornagar, where a nearby nala overflowed due to heavy downpour. Traffic situation turned from bad to worse on several stretches, including Malakpet, where a traffic gridlock blocked an ambulance for several minutes. Videos of the ambulance that went viral on social media showed a traffic cop, G Balavardhi, asking people to make way for the ambulance that was caught in heavy traffic which occurred due to the rain. “Much respect to him. Looks like he is on barefoot and completely drenched already,” tweeted Feed The Needy Trust @Feedtheneed8. In Bapu Nagar, an autorickshaw driver was seen seeking help from bystanders after his vehicle got stuck in knee-deep water in the middle of the road. The scene was equally bad in the southern parts of the city with areas such as Yakutpura, Alijah Kotla road near Charminar, Mir Alam Mandi and Shalibanda facing severe waterlogging issues. The downpour left a trail of destruction behind, with several roads being damaged and sewage from overflowing nalas entering several residential areas. “Several houses in Reddy Brothers lane, P&T Colony and Sheeshala basthi near Saroornagar lake saw sewage entering into the houses. This is the situation in these areas every single time it rains. There has been no respite even after the authorities came for inspection last month after several houses were inundated,” Kota Sai Kumar, member of a resident welfare association in P&T Colony, told TOI. Weather officials said rains were likely to continue in the city for another two days. On Saturday, the heavy rains saw the Telangana State Development Planning Society’s (TSDPS) weather station near Government Boys High School near Kurmaguda recording the highest rainfall at 104.3 mm, followed by Asmangadh in Malakpet with 92.0 mm rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/citys-battle-with-waterlogging-continues-as-roads-turn-rivulets/articleshow/85935368.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Industry bodies hail removal of 1% cess on cotton, cotton waste||Coimbatore: The Southern India Mills’ Association (Sima) and Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (Citi) have thanked chief minister M K Stalin for removing the 1% cess on cotton and cotton waste. The decision would attract several private cotton traders and cotton corporation of India to open depots in Tamil Nadu and sell cotton to small-scale spinning mills. It would considerably reduce working capital requirements and also the cost, time and transportation. Citi chairman T Raj Kumar and Sima deputy chairman Ravi Sam attended a joint press meet held at Sima conference hall on Saturday. “It would benefit the open-end spinning sector that accounts 50% of the country’s spinning capacity and would make them to source all their raw material requirement within the State that would increase SGST revenue substantially,” said Raj. Global brands and retailers prefer and pay premium for sustainable textile products produced out of waste and therefore, Tamil Nadu would get good export opportunities, said Ravi. The decision would immediately benefit two lakh cotton farmers, the representatives said. The state has envisaged to increase cotton production from five lakh bales to 25 lakh bales by 2030. This would encourage farmers to switch over to cotton crop from other cash crops which will benefit 10 lakh farmers in the long-run. Tamil Nadu agricultural market committee started levying 0.5% cess on cotton and cotton waste from 1959. It was increased to 1% from 1987. No other state levies cess on cotton waste. Tamil Nadu produces around five to six lakh bales (170kg/bale) cotton, but it consumes 110 to 120 lakh bales per year. The state was sourcing the remaining cotton from other states and also other countries by spending huge transportation cost ranging from Rs 2 to Rs 6/kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/industry-bodies-hail-removal-of-1-cess-on-cotton-cotton-waste/articleshow/85935337.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The party has asked its cadres to streamline logistics to ensure the September 5 mahapanchayat is a big success. Pledging his “full support” to the mahapanchayat, RLD president Jayant Chaudhary said, “I have asked my party workers to reach the venue and offer their support to make it a huge success.” After repeated electoral defeats, RLD workers got a much-need shot in their arms when the party won the post of district panchayat president in Baghpat — its stronghold — during the recently-held polls. BJP had bagged 67 out of the 75 district posts. Buoyed by the victory, Chaudhary held a series of farmer panchayats across western UP districts to maintain the momentum while attacking the BJP on the farm laws, fuel prices, rising price index, etc. Speaking to TOI, party general secretary for west UP Anudin Shah said, “Farmers have now understood that one political party they can associate with, and which can serve their interests, is the RLD. Their alienation from the party had hurt their interests drastically. Now, they are returning to the RLD fold to reclaim their lost honour. If the Bhartiya Kisan Union provides organisational strength to the farmers, the RLD is their political face.” Elaborating on the arrangements being made for the mahapanchayat, RLD state spokesperson Sunil Rohta, “Our cadres have fanned out in the vast rural belt across western UP districts, including Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar, Amroha, Bijnor, Mathura, etc, and have been carrying out mass contact programmes along with BKU workers. Our workers are managing the Mahapanchayat venue and 50 langar stalls. We are also arranging buses and other transports to ensure farmers reach Muzaffarnagar in a large number for the cause.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/rld-aims-at-reclaiming-lost-political-ground-through-mahapanchayat/articleshow/85933403.cms||Sandeep Rai

Residents of Chaderghat, Bandlaguda, Asifnagar, Shaikpet and adjoining areas along the Musi have been informed about the current situation and were asked to shift to safer places as a precautionary measure. However, with no let-up in rain, residents living in these low-lying areas said that they had nowhere to go if their localities were inundated. “The officials have alerted us about the flood for the third time this year and yet not enough temporary shelters or other arrangements made for us in case of an emergency,” Fatima Begum, a resident of Shaikpet, said. Similar concerns were expressed by residents from other areas that were prone to flooding in case the water level increases. “We stayed in a mosque last time when the gates of both the reservoirs were opened, while many families went to stay with their relatives in the city. What about those who do not have any relatives here? The mosque and the GHMC community hall cannot accommodate so many families,” said Imtiaz Khan, a resident of Shanker Nagar. However, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB) and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials, who were monitoring the situation, said that they have already issued a high alert in these areas and made necessary arrangements. “We have personally visited these areas and informed the locals that we are making all necessary arrangements and there is enough space for the families in our community halls. Some of them go and stay with their relatives by choice,” GHMC deputy commissioner, Charminar zone,G Rajnikanth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/flood-hit-victims-prepare-for-another-deluge/articleshow/85935339.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In a letter to Stalin on Saturday, the Congress leader said entrusting a private company with the drinking water project for 26 years would eventually burden the public, as the firm was likely to hike water charges over a period of time. “Private companies should not be allowed to operate any project for more than 10 years.” He said the Rs 3,167-crore project was awarded to the private firm in an opaque manner, raising suspicion. “People may get the water connection disconnected for a few days delay in paying water charges. The project will only benefit the rich people in the long run, while putting the poor in difficult situations. Drinking water supply should be managed only by the government or its agencies,” Jayakumar said while urging the civic body to immediately cancel the agreement with Suez. It is to be noted that the DMK had vehemently opposed the project and staged several projects against it when it was the opposition party. However, the DMK made a U-turn recently with municipal administration minister K N Nehru clarifying that the project would not be scrapped.

---||Delhi||N corpn plans to give premium lands for free, claims AAP||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj alleged on Friday that North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to give away premium lands worth thousands of crores to private clinics and its own people for free. The proposal, which was put forth as a resolution, was passed by the corporation’s standing committee on September 1. In a press conference, Bharadwaj asked Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta to tell why the BJP is bringing such a policy. “BJP is doing so in anticipation of their defeat in the upcoming municipal polls and is preparing to run away with bags of money,” he alleged. “BJP is preparing to distribute all the assets and income sources to its own people for free. The north corporation is selling every expensive plot of land it has for very cheap prices. Preparations are under way to auction the hospitals. All the parks of the corporations are going to have shops inside them. BJP is preparing to earn money by handing over the roads to food vendors. It sold Novelty Cinema land worth Rs 150 crore for Rs 34 crore, Dangal Maidan will be sold for one-fourth of its price,” Bharadwaj claimed. “It is written in the proposal that they are preparing to give the lands to NGOs without any fee. If these NGOs want, they can also charge some fee from the people for convenience. The corporation will provide vacant buildings and land through a licence without charging any licence fee. This will be the first such licence in the world. They are practically going to use municipal lands for free and earn money,” the AAP spokesperson claimed. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the allegations were baseless. “For decades, dozens of charitable organisations have been working out of lands provided by the corporations. They are running charitable dispensaries, schools for handicapped and orphans. Most cremation grounds in Delhi are owned by municipal corporations but are being maintained and run by charitable NGOs. In fact, the corporations extend financial aid, too, to some NGOs,” said Kapoor. He added that the north corporation’s proposal to handover few vacant health department premises to charitable NGOs for running health dispensaries is in line with decades old tradition. “AAP is trying to malign this good scheme with political vendetta.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-plans-to-give-premium-lands-for-free-claims-aap/articleshow/85937469.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune: Farm soil, papier-mâché Ganesh idols make sustainability push||PUNE: City-based duo Akshay Kauthale and Anay Marathe have created ‘Vruksha Gajanan’ idols, which are not only eco-friendly but also help grow saplings once immersed. They said that the idols, made with farm soil purchased from local farmers, dissolve completely in a bucket of water within an hour. They took the initiative after witnessing that so-called “eco-friendly” idols did not dissolve completely in water. “Each Vruksha Gajanan contains a sachet of wild tulsi (Krishna Tulas) seeds. We also provide a pot full of farm soil. The water from the dissolved idol can be poured into the pot for the tulsi plant to grow. After launching last year, we sold out 25,000 idols. We have been manufacturing throughout the year in our factory in Uruli Kanchan to meet the demand,” said Marathe. Papier-mâché idols comprise 90% handmade paper pulp, and 10% clay and adhesive“Since the market is riddled with fake eco-friendly idols, we have inserted an identification ribbon inside the idol which floats after the idol is dissolved to assure authentication of our claims,” he added. Collaborating with rural artisans in Pen to usher in the festival in a sustainable way, Pune Handmade Papers, Shivajinagar, has launched papier-mâché Ganesh idols, comprising 90% handmade paper pulp and 10% clay and adhesive. An artist unwinds at an idol workshop on Satara Road on SaturdayThese idols dissolve easily in a bucket during immersion and can be turned into paper pulp again or retained and coloured next year. eCoexist in collaboraion with artisans from Pune, Pen, Goa, Shimoga and Amaravati have also developed a range of idols made from natural clay (shaadu), red earth (lal maati), Papier-mâché and cow dung. Manisha Gutman, founder, eCoexist, said, “People spend a lot of money during this festival, but we want to encourage them to set a portion of it aside to help elephants.

---||Lucknow||ACJM junks plea to file case against Maurya||Prayagraj: The additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) on Saturday rejected an application seeking registration of a criminal case against UP’s deuty chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya for his alleged use of fake educational degrees for contesting five elections at different places and also obtaining a petrol pump. While rejecting the application filed under Section 156 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) by a social activist Diwakar Tripathi, ACJM (Prayagraj) Namrata Singh said that prima facie no cognizable offence appears to have been committed. Hence, the application is rejected, as the same is found to be baseless and groundless. District government counsel (criminal), Gulab Chandra Agrahri informed TOI that the additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) court had on August 11, 2021 directed the police to hold a preliminary inquiry into the alleged fake degrees of the deputy CM. In the order dated August 11, the ACJM had directed the station house officer of Cantonment, Prayagraj to submit a report on certain points. Firstly, authenticity of the degree like Uttar Madhyama second year issued by the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Prayagraj to the deputy CM. Secondly, regarding the allegation of use of fake certificates by Maurya in the affidavit of elections. Besides, there should be an inquiry regarding the use of a fake certificate of high school by the deputy CM to obtain a petrol pump, the order had added. Subsequently, the police after conducting an inquiry had filed its report in which it was stated that none of the alleged offences took place in the jurisdiction of Cantt police station of Prayagraj. Hence, no FIR was registered by the Cantt police on the application of Tripathi. Besides, as per the report filed by police, the alleged fake degrees were not obtained by the applicant from any authentic sources, rather only the xerox copies of the documents have been filed, which were not credible evidence. Further, no complaint was filed by the applicant against Maurya before the Election Commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/acjm-junks-plea-to-file-case-against-maurya/articleshow/85937456.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

Despite having to put in twice the effort to help their students learn, special teachers often receive only little to no recognition. For years, special educators continue to fight even for decent basic pay for their work.Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, it has been even more difficult for special educators to keep their students engaged in learning. “The pandemic is something new for everyone and was difficult to adapt to. Online classes often fail in direct monitoring of children and we cannot feel or notice the external factors affecting them. It was difficult to communicate and understand, especially in the beginning. The children are also greatly affected as they have lost their routines. However, over time, we were able to manage with online classes, at least for those with mild intellectual disabilities,” said R Ravikumar, chairman, Tamil Nadu Council of Special Schools (TCSS). He further said that while last year was a nightmare for special educators, this year, things are a little better as both special teachers and students have adapted to online learning.Another special educator, A Anbuselvi, said that parents also had to be counseled to help them understand the situation and support their children learn from home. “Slowly, both parents and students started responding better to us after we started using video lessons. We also connected with students over video calls. However, the only issue is that parents cannot give the same training as we do. So we would have to start from a low level and recover them back to doing their best,” she said. Special educators further said that they have to constantly put in efforts to connect with children individually, assess their capabilities and accordingly form a plan for teaching. Meanwhile, despite special educators catering to hundreds of children with special needs, their efforts often go unnoticed. “The services of special educators are not given due recognition. In fact, for years, the remuneration for special educators from the government is only Rs 14,000. Even that amount is given to only two special educators in an institution, while others are paid only by the school management, which is much less. A minimum salary must be fixed by the government,” said R Vetrivel Murugan, a special educator and psychologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/despite-endless-toil-educators-of-kids-with-special-needs-yet-to-get-due-recognition/articleshow/85935377.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The double murder case of a Jain couple against Sahu has been pending since 1991. Recently, a sessions court had issued a non-bailable warrant against Sahu for non-appearance in court. After the NBW was issued, Sahu’s advocate filed a transfer petition in the court, which was accepted on September 3. Sahu, who was once among the top history sheeters of Bareilly, managed to get clearance in all the criminal cases against him barring this one where a witness identified him in the court. However, the trial was delayed after the case was stolen from the court’s record room in 2013. Eleven people, including Sahu, now 59, were accused of killing the Jain couple inside their Bareilly house in the presence of their daughter in 1990 over a land dispute. The couple’s land was allegedly transferred fraudulently by Sahu and his aides and the couple had raised objections after they came to know about it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/murder-case-against-ukhand-mins-husband-shifted-to-new-court/articleshow/85933493.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

On Saturday, four of 15 floodgates of Osmansagar were lifted as inflows into the reservoir increased due to heavy rainfall during the last few days in the upstream areas of the reservoir. With the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing red and orange alerts for Telangana, heavy to very heavy rainfall is very likely to occur over the next three days and the floodgates are likely to be lifted. A team of senior officials, led by HMWS&SB director, technical, Ravi Kumar is assessing the inflows into the reservoir on an hourly basis. A couple of days ago, an alert was sounded by the HMWS&SB urging the revenue machinery and police to take precautionary measures and evacuate the people living in low-lying areas. However, residents of these areas say that they have no place to go to if their areas get flooded. “Four out of 15 floodgates of the reservoir have been lifted to release the surplus water into Musi river. By 9 pm, Osmansagar reservoir had been filled up to 1,788.95 feet, against the FTL of 1,790 feet. A few more floodgates would be lifted soon,” a senior HMWS&SB told STOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/four-osmansagar-floodgates-lifted/articleshow/85935405.cms||Sunil Mungara

The first phase of the programme was launched in 2018 and more than 13,000 students and 570 teachers in 24 schools are being covered. “Mental health awareness is still low. Teachers spend most time with children as they grow up. Hence, they must ideally become capable of taking care of both physical and mental health of students,” said Dr C Ramasubramanian, founder, MS Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation.The senior psychiatrist said that teachers must remind and reinforce Covid-19 safety measures among students and also help alleviate fear about Covid-19. “Many children have lost their parents or family members due to Covid-19 and on the other hand, there is a fear that children will be most affected in the third wave of the pandemic. The children have also had less social interactions and have developed addiction to mobile phones. Teachers must monitor them and notice their behaviour,” he said. A round-the-clock helpline (9375493754) is also functional with counselors cater to the needs of students in distress. Any student can reach out to the helpline if he/she has any concerns over their mental well-being or feel any mental distress.

Conservator of forest (CF) and TATR field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar said, “SUPs, also referred to as disposable plastics, are commonly used for packaging and include items intended to be used only once before they are thrown away or recycled.” Many villagers and people visiting Tadoba use grocery bags, food packaging, bottles, straws, containers, cups and cutlery. “Plastic is turning out to be a big menace, posing a serious threat to not only environment but also animals,” said Ramgaonkar. “We have appealed to all the visitors, residents, resort owners and tourists to stop the use of SUPs, failing which appropriate action will be taken as per the provisions of the law,” he added. As per the Act, use of SUPs and littering them in public places near the park can invite a penalty of Rs500-25,000. The park management has appealed to people to use steel bottles or good quality plastic bottles for drinking water, and to stop carrying snacks and meals in plastic inside the park. Deputy director (core) Nandkishore Kale said, “Though tourists have been sensitized over the years, the real menace is from day-long visitors to the butterfly garden at Agarzari, and people visiting resorts for dining from Padmapur-Mohurli road.” “We hope to implement the ban strictly from October 1, when tourism season starts. We have already installed automatic water vending machines at Kolara and Mohuril gates. Besides, water coolers are being installed at the gates which do not have this facility. This will deter tourists to carry packaged plastic water bottles inside. They can bring steel water bottles,” said Kale. Naturalist Himanshu Bagde welcomed the move, stating the menace needs to be checked at small eateries near the tourism gates and paan kiosks. “Most resort owners offer iceboxes to their visitors during the safari. The water machines can stop the use of packaged bottles,” he said. However, Nikhil Abhyankar, a resort owner from Tadoba said, “Though the ban has been imposed, the results will be seen after October when full-fledged tourism starts. Presently, most of the tourists are visiting buffer zone during weekends.” Abhyankar called it a good decision. In January this year, a subadult tiger cub was seen chewing a plastic bottle in the Alizanza tourism zone in the buffer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tadoba-bans-single-use-plastic-warns-of-action/articleshow/85933472.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The shuttler, who shared the podium with fellow Indian shuttler Pramod Bhagat who won gold, has a story of misfortune, dreams and determination. According to Manoj’s younger brother Manmohan Sarkar, it was the family’s poor financial condition, lack of awareness and a corrupt doctor that robbed the badminton player of his right leg. “When he was around two and a half years old, Manoj developed high fever. My parents took him to a doctor who gave him expired medicines. My parents were uneducated, daily wage labourers. They trusted the treatment without realising the effect it had on Manoj. Within months, Manoj lost his right limb. We tried to confront the doctor but he had fled Rudrapur by then.” Young and disabled, Manoj immersed himself in watching neighbourhood boys playing badminton. He eventually realized he wanted to play it too. “Manoj would take on able players, that’s what made him a better player. While in school, he participated and mostly won at district and state level matches with able players. However, it became difficult for him to play at the national level with a disability,” Manmohan revealed. The 26-year-old fitness trainer said that Manoj was in class 12 when he came to know about Paralympics. “There was no looking back after that,” he said. In order to afford quality equipment and make sure his family was taken care of, Manoj took up odd jobs. He tutored kids, worked as an insurance agent and at one point, even worked as a construction labourer. “As a labourer, my brother painted walls of local homes. He used to get a dihaadi (daily wage) of around Rs 80-90. All this was just to make sure our family got two square meals a day,” said Manmohan. In 2017, the two brothers lost their father and the following year, their mother passed away too. “It deeply affected Manoj’s performance but he picked himself up. He also got married last year,” he said. After news of his win reached home, residents of the locality burst into celebration, as Sarkar happens to be the only sportsperson from Uttarakhand to bring home a medal from Tokyo this year. Chief minister Pushkar Dhami congratulated Manoj over a video call after his win, saying he had made “not only Uttarakhand, but the whole country proud”. Dhami invited the shuttler to visit him at his office in Dehradun once he is back from Tokyo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhands-only-paralympic-medal-winner-this-year-worked-as-a-labourer-to-afford-meals-training/articleshow/85933525.cms||Mohammad Anab

Dismissing the bail application of Irfan, Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar said his past record was “very disturbing and dangerous” and his release at this stage would be fatal to all the other pending cases where witnesses were turning hostile one after the other. “One cannot lose sight of the fact that the petitioner is involved in 25 cases of heinous nature and he is claimed by the prosecution to be the leader of infamous Chhenu gang. “Fourteen cases against the petitioner are still pending trial and the release of the petitioner at this stage may hamper the trial of those pending cases,” said the judge. The court rejected the petitioner’s argument that he was not present at the spot of the alleged murder and opined that for the offence of conspiracy, physical presence was not mandatory. The case of the prosecution is the petitioner was the kingpin and he hatched the conspiracy due to inter-gang rivalry. In these circumstances, the presence of the petitioner at the spot is not required as conspiracies are hatched in secrecy and it is not for the conspirators to be physically present at the spot, the judge said. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/past-record-disturbing-no-bail-now/articleshow/85935432.cms||---

Some of them were good at singing, while some others were very good actors. We had identified around 30 prisoners there and trained them in acting. When they came out after serving their sentences, they were given an opportunity to act in my film ‘Pagaivanukku Arulvai’. They have sung songs too in the film, which will be released soon.” Anis said the Coimbatore Central Prison was open to conduct prison theatre to identify acting skills among the convict prisoners. “After the release of my film, we are planning to start the programme for the prisoners here.” G B Senthamaraikannan, superintendent, Coimbatore Central Prison, said presently a musical troop was functioning in the prison. “Its members were about to attend the first-grade keyboard and drums examination of Trinity College, London, in 2018, but it was not conducted because of various reasons. However, they are practicing daily on the prison premises.” He said music and acting would provide hope to the convict prisoners and help them lead a good life after their release. “Once we start prison theatre, they will get chances to act in Tamil movies after their release.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/kollywood-director-to-give-acting-tips-to-jailbirds/articleshow/85935438.cms||A Subburaj

EAC had returned the proposal of Vedanta Limited for upgradation of the BF to enhance production capacity. “Review and evaluation of the proposal by EAC is part of the regular process towards obtaining the respective clearances. Hence, Vedanta is in the process of responding to the observations raised by EAC,” Vedanta said in a statement. During the public hearing for expansion of the plant, villagers living in the vicinity strongly opposed the upgradation plans. Most of the attendees opposed the project expansion citing pollution, health, education and unemployment issues. The project proponent (PP) failed to submit a point-wise response to the issues raised at the public hearing, EAC said. “The committee recommended to return the proposal in its present form to address the shortcomings as enumerated. Further, the project proponent is required to undertake necessary corrective action on the said non-compliances, and latest compliance report on the same from the regional office of MoEFCC is required. MoEFCC may issue a show cause notice to the PP for the non-compliance to the existing EC conditions as mentioned above,” EAC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-respond-to-observations-by-moef-panel-vedanta/articleshow/85937625.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While she is well versed in Tamil folk art forms like parai, oyilattam, kolattam, sattaikuchi nadanam, kummi and karagattam, she is also abled in incorporating these art forms in her teaching. Her method of teaching has brought down the dropout rate in her school. Suguna is one of the 13 teachers selected for state government’s Dr Radhakrishnan Award in the district this year. Overwhelmed by the recognition, Suguna said she will take the award as an encouragement for her future endeavours towards making learning interesting for students. T Franklin, 45, a science teacher from the Corporation Higher Secondary School, Okiliyar Colony, is selected for the award within a few months after he became eligible. It is mandatory for teachers to complete 15 years of government service without any black mark to qualify for the award. Recipient of Kanavu Aasiriyar Award of the state government, Franklin is recognised mainly for using online resources to teach his school students. Before the pandemic made online studying a norm, Franklin helped the school to establish a computer lab with 33 systems in 2014 by crowdsourcing funds. When the school did not have a mathematics teacher for some time, he exposed students to self-learning videos on the subject. “These videos helped the students to learn the basics of mathematics with ease,” he said. “I am trying to make children aware of all kinds of online learning resources so that they are not left out when new technological intervention creates disruption in the way students are learning.” When G Indira, 54, headmistress of the Municipal Girls Higher Secondary School, Mettupalayam, was in a government school at Parali near Pillur dam five years ago, she had helped 14 tribal girl students to complete their studies. To ensure that the students could write their board exams without any hassle, she found an accommodation for them and their family members near the exam centres and ensured that their basic needs were met. That helped the 14 girls to complete their schooling. As a headmistress, Indira has been able achieve 100% pass percentage in Class XII board exams for five consecutive years in her school. The award carries a medal, a certificate and Rs 10,000 cash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/13-teachers-from-dist-selected-for-dr-radhakrishnan-award/articleshow/85935464.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Meerut||‘Fought against Pakistan in 1965, I’m at war again’||MUZAFFARNAGAR: The influx of farmers for today’s Mahapanchayat began early on Friday as farmers from various districts and states started pouring into Muzaffarnagar. Among these farmers are dozens of Army veterans who consider the farmers’ movement nothing less than “a war against three farm laws”. One of the farmers and former Army jawan, Disha Singh, 75, a resident of Pilibhit, reached Muzaffarnagar wearing the bravery medal given to him during the 1965 war with Pakistan. “I was awarded this medal in the 1965 war. And now, I feel I am at war again. Sadly, this time with my own people. This is a war against the three draconian farm laws.” “Farmers do hard work in their fields, but they don’t get what they deserve. I appeal to the government to abolish all the three farm laws,” Singh said. Mani Deo Chaturvedi, 53-year-old farmer who was in BSF, has been protesting at the Ghazipur border in Delhi for weeks. He arrived in Muzaffarnagar on Saturday. “We are both soldiers and farmers. I am here for my countrymen and family. I am here to handle the security management, as many as 300 volunteers will work under my supervision,” Chaturvedi said. Gurcharan Singh, 69, a resident of Lakhimpur Kheri, is also a former Army jawan. “It is quite unfortunate that farmers in this country are fighting for a life of dignity. The three farm laws are not in the interest of the farmers. I have been at the Ghazipur border protesting along with other farmers for months. Now, I am here. We will fight till the end for scrapping these laws,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/fought-against-pak-in-1965-im-at-war-again-this-time-with-my-own-people-army-vet-in-mnagar-for-kisan-mahapanchayat/articleshow/85933553.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Hyderabad||Raising the learning bar||Drawing more kids to classUp until 2011, just about 54 students were enrolled at Sawarkheda’s Mandal Praja Primary School – a nondescript village in Telangana’s Komaram Bheem Asifabad district. The dropout rate, especially among girls, was extremely high. That’s when Rangaiah Kaderla stepped in. Then the lone teacher of the school, he admitted his two children – a girl and a boy – there. Not just that, his wife too started taking classes at the school for free. Result: The enrollment numbers began to rise and currently stand at 281. Many of them are girls. "It’s a remote village where there’s a lot of hesitancy among people to send their kids to school. My move helped instilled confidence among them," said Kaderla the now acting headmaster. He also went from door to door to encourage and educate people, thereby boosting enrollment numbers. Today, the school has 15 teachers and tech facilities like projectors and computers. His Super 100 programme launched amid the pandemic, where selected students teach their peers and lower classes, and initiatives like the ‘FM Sawarkheda’ (managed entirely by students) that has listeners across the mandal or ‘Ghar Ban Gaya Vidyalaya’ won him a national teacher award this year. Kaderla was honoured with this recognition by the department of school education and literacy, union ministry of education. Turning walls into blackboards Removed from the world of online classes, the pandemic could have marked the end of education for students of Puttapalli village (Karimnagar), but for their teacher, S Bhagyalakshmi. Aware that the children of the small Mandal Parishad Primary School had no access to gadgets, she took the lessons to their doorsteps by converting walls into blackboards. It started with common walls in public spaces – where the children gathered to play etc -- and moved to the houses of locals. Now, almost all walls of Puttapalli village have lessons written all over them. Every day, students sit in front of them and attend class. “I realised students were forgetting what they were taught in school, as they were away from their classrooms for months. So, I identified some spots and turned them into blackboards. I started writing the alphabet, numbers, tables etc. To create a visual memory. Eventually, I also turned walls in students’ houses into blackboards. It’s proved to be very effective,” said Bhagyalakshmi. Her initiative was soon replicated by many teachers in other districts of Telangana. -- S Bhagyalakshmi Taking English to T villages Nothing else gives Nula Purnachander as much pleasure as hearing a student of his speak in fluent English. To ensure that rural kids do not fall behind those from upscale corporate schools, this 49-year-old teacher from the Zilla Parishad school in Medak’s Maktabhupathipur village has taken it upon himself to teach the language to his students. And for it, he even provides them with a dictionary, in case they cannot afford one. “It is a sheer joy for me to see my students learn to speak English,” said Purnachander who worked in the Maldives before joining the government school. And not just English, he even takes his children around the globe with an Atlas, helping them understand where a place is, how far it is from where they live, its geography and the present-day context – all this so that they can be on par with other children from bigger cities and towns. -- Nula Purnachander Setting up free live streams Amid the pandemic, Mutyala Ravindar realised that many students might miss out on learning with schools being shut. To bridge this gap, the teacher dipped into his own resources to conduct live classes, share material and organise tests for them. He also realised that many students weren’t able to follow lessons broadcasted through television and TSAT and, therefore, curated special sessions to clear their doubts – all out of his own interest and funds. “I bought a pen tablet and other accessories and to conduct live sessions through a live teaching app. Even now that physical classes have resumed, I am continuing with the live stream so that students, who are unable to attend class physically, can make use of it,” said Ravindar working at the Government High School, Nallakunta. It’s come as a huge help particularly to students down with fever, cold, or other such ailment.

The report said the man’s body had ante-mortem injuries which caused his death. Now, police are questioning various suspects in this case. However, an FIR is yet to be lodged by the deceased’s family. The fire broke out at the residence of Manoj Mishra (35) in Premnagar area of Bareilly past midnight on Thursday. Mishra, who ran a tiffin service from home, was alone as his wife, Sunita, and their son, Manu, nine, were away visiting her maternal home in Shahjahanpur. No FIR has been registered in this case as the deceased’s family members claimed that this was an accident as the room was locked from inside. According to police, Manoj’s body was found inside his room on the first floor of his house. He used to live in a separate portion of the house with his wife and son while his father and brother live in another part. Three tenants live on the ground floor of the house. All of them are students who are preparing for competitive exams. His father and brother claimed that they were sleeping at the time the fire broke out and came to know after neighbours informed them. Piecing together the events of the day, police said Manoj came home at about 8.30 pm after distributing tiffin to his customers. One of the tenants met him in his room at nearly 9 pm. Around 12.30 am, neighbours saw smoke billowing out of Manoj’s room and immediately informed his father and police. Police doused the fire and broke open the door to enter the house. They found Manoj’s charred body. Neighbours said they did not hear Manoj scream for help. Police surmise that a lighted bidi that Manoj was smoking fell on the mattress he was sitting on and it caught fire as a couple of butts were found along with a bottle of liquor. Sheetanshu Kumar, SHO of Premnagar police station, said, “The family has not given a written complaint so far as they are still claiming that it was an accident. But the autopsy report has confirmed deep injuries on the head which caused his death. We will register an FIR after taking self-cognizance if no one from the family lodges a complaint.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-charred-in-fire-was-murdered-says-post-mortem-report/articleshow/85933527.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

A complaint has been registered against Santosh Tippanna Gudagi, who was reportedly dismissed from the police force, at the Mundgod police station. The complainant Gururaj Raikar allegedly lost Rs 2 lakh to the fraudster.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Teachers who walked the extra mile to bring smiles||LUCKNOW: The coronavirus pandemic posed a challenging situation for teachers across the country as they had to shift to online teaching. However, for the ones who have been helping out specially-abled children, it has been a never ending journey. On the occasion of Teachers’ Day, TOI spoke to educationists who have gone the extra mile for students with special needs, especially during the pandemic. Rita Srivastava, an educationist who looks after hearing-impaired children at Bachpan Day Care Centre for disabled kids, alters her daily routine plan according to her students. Sometimes she even works longer than her usual work hours, which she finds meaningful since at the end of the day she gets to see smile on the faces of her students. “Ever since I was a kid I wanted to help specially-abled children in some way or the other. I had seen my family members helping and being affectionate towards such kids. As we are now teaching online, it has been extremely challenging for teachers, students and their parents,” she said. “Some of the parents do not have a mobile phone or computer for online classes, we have to take out extra time from our schedules to make students sit and learn,” said Rita, who teaches students in the age group of two-and-a-half years to seven years. “For us, they are like any other student. Our job is to help them in their growing years. If we have to work extra hours or at odd times, we do so happily. We try to do fun activities as well. Some children respond, others don’t. We stay connected with them round-the-clock,” added Rita, who has been working as a special educator for more than 13 years. Rajendra Kumar (31), who teaches visually-impaired students at the centre, says it is important to be friendly to to such children as it helps in interaction and teaching. “We have to make teaching fun and easy for which extra efforts are needed. Not only children, we have to teach their parents too. If they have difficulty, we ask them to visit the centre. We help them in understanding the needs of their children, how they can convey their message through Braille and teach them written language so that they can help their child at home. I personally believe that every teacher should be able to handle special kids. They are like any other normal schoolgoing student and are very talented. This is the only way we can make education inclusive,” said Kumar, adding that his students also went on to join regular schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/teachers-who-walked-the-extra-mile-to-bring-smiles/articleshow/85937584.cms||Aditi Singh

But many years before the lockdown, Nahid Khan Ligari, a teacher working at a district panchayat-run school in Junagadh district, had tapped on to the benefits of alternative modes of learning and developed ‘learning apps’. What more, he also devised a way to overcome the internet connectivity issue, by developing apps that worked in offline mode too. What makes his efforts even more praiseworthy is that apart from facing the usual ‘limited or no resources issue’, Ligari also had no ‘technical or software’ background. A language teacher, Ligari teaches Gujarati, Hindi and English. Yet he took the pains of learning the basics of app developing. The desire to make education accessible to all drove him on, says Ligari. "I was always thinking of making education available to students at their doorsteps," Ligari said. Ligari’s work was recognized by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). He was recently conferred the ‘National Information Communication & Technology’ award by NCERT. Ligari has developed two apps so far — an encyclopedia and a dictionary. Once downloaded on mobile phones, the two apps work in offline mode. The Internet is needed only at the time of app update.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/language-instructor-who-built-learning-apps/articleshow/85937570.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The authorities wanted to launch the bus tour from August 1, but had to postpone it due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The 40-seater buses, which have been painted with motifs representing the rich culture and heritage of the city, will take tourists to 35 heritage and cultural places in two hours. KSTDC has four such buses, and each bus will make four trips a day, where tourists will be briefed about the sites in English and Kannada, through an audio guide. The bus, which had already completed trial runs to ensure that power cables and tree branches on its route did not obstruct its movement, hit the roads at 9.30 am on Saturday. They started their journey from the KSTDC office on JLB Road. The first day saw a lukewarm response to the service from tourists, with only a few of them travelling in the bus. However, the authorities said that as the Dasara festival is around the corner, they expect more tourists to enjoy the city in the coming days. The KSTDC authorities told TOI that in the first trip there were seven tourists, while in the second trip there were just four tourists.“Initially we will run the buses on weekends, and based on the response from tourists, we will run the buses on weekdays as well,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/kstdc-launches-ambaari-service-for-tourists-ahead-of-dasara/articleshow/85932869.cms||---

The NCDC team is yet to send its report to the Union ministry, but health department officials privy to the findings told TOI that a dengue outbreak has been detected in the district — the epicentre of the viral disease where 75 patients have died, 56 of them children. Four deaths have occurred in the last 24 hours alone. Additional director of the health department, A K Singh, said the team had found a dengue outbreak, but was yet to confirm how many cases were of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), a more severe form of dengue. “Some samples have been sent to Delhi to confirm whether it is DHF. Some isolated cases of malaria and scrub typhus (a bacterial illness spread by larval mites) have also been detected in the region,” Singh said. According to the health department officials, 105 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Firozabad in the last three weeks. A day earlier, UP officials had said the World Health Organisation had suggested that DHF could be behind the deaths that are preceded by prolonged fever, dropping platelets, severe dehydration and bleeding of gums. Besides Firozabad, at least 15 patients have died in Mathura, eight in Mainpuri, five in Kasganj and two in Etah district. Concerned parents are sending children to live with kin in unaffected areas as a precautionary measure. “There are no beds here. And we don’t know for sure what this fever is or how it is spreading. I don’t want to risk anything, I have sent my kids to my brother's house in Noida,” said Sandeep Agarwal, father to two children, seven and 14. Humayunpur resident Vinod Kumar has also sent his 10-year-old son away to live with grandparents in Delhi. “Two children in my neighbourhood have died in the past two days. The situation in Firozabad is not safe at all. Patients can’t get hospital beds, blood or platelets.” Chief medical officer (CMO) Dinesh Kumar Premi said 36 health camps have been set up and 3,700 people were undergoing treatment in them. At the Firozabad medical college, 383 patients, including 345 children, were getting treated for the viral fever on Saturday, according to chief medical officer of Firozabad medical college Hansraj Singh. At least 5,000 people in the district are estimated to be bedridden with fever at home or in private hospitals, sources told TOI. Shortage of beds is forcing patients to seek treatment in other districts. There were reports of ambulances charging up to Rs 20,000 to get patients to neighbouring districts. Ram Kumar, who lost his 15-year-old daughter to the fever, left for Aligarh district with his family so his two sons — who have high fever — could get proper treatment. “I have already lost one child, I can’t lose the other two,” he said. UP DG (health) Dr Ved Vrat Singh told TOI the situation in Firozabad is being continuously monitored. “To ensure time-bound treatment at government centres, we are diverting senior doctors and paramedical staffers to the district. Senior officials are camping in the district to control the spread of dengue and other vector-borne diseases. Hospitals have been instructed to use isolation beds and oxygen facilities reserved for Covid patients to treat people diagnosed with viral diseases,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/toll-100-ncdc-says-dengue-outbreak-in-west-up/articleshow/85933582.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Agra||Dodging police, 10,000 farmers leave Agra to attend historic 'Kisan Mahapanchayat'||AGRA: More than 10,000 farmers of Agra region have managed to dodge the local police and are on their way to Muzaffarnagar for Sunday's historic 'Kisan Mahapanchayat'. The farmers avoided taking tractors and travelled in public buses and private vehicles, without any caps or flags of farm unions. They also travelled through different routes - particularly the smaller village roads. Police and local intelligence officers had been putting pressure on them not to leave for the mega event, they alleged. Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), meanwhile, arranged over 200 buses to ferry farm association workers from Bihar, Bengal, Odisha, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar. Senior members of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) claimed 50,000 farmers left for the city venue from Rajasthan and Haryana on Saturday afternoon. Mathura based BKU member, Gajendra Singh Parihar, said, “Despite the attempts of police to stop us, over 10,000 farmers from different parts of Agra region left for Muzaffarnagar for the mahapanchayat. At least 200 more groups of farmers will travel in the evening. Local heads have been tasked to ensure farmers arriving from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan do not face any inconvenience while passing through the Agra region.” Maharashtra based farmer leader and core committee member of Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh, Sandeep Gidde Patil, said, “Five hundred farmers associated with different organisations from Vidarbha region have already reached the Singhu border. Besides, 1,000 others from across the state are on their way and will be joining others at the Delhi border. From there, they will travel to Muzaffarnagar early on Sunday.” Senior farmer leader from West Bengal, Avik Saha, said, “Over 100 groups of farmers from southern states are on their way to Singhu border via trains. They will be leaving for the venue early on Sunday. Buses will take them from Delhi borders." Saha, who is also the secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, added, "It is going to be a historic event, aimed to unite farmers from different caste, religions and geographical locations. After Sunday, farmers' protest will only intensify." Meanwhile, mega arrangements have been made for the event under the SKM's banner. According to BKU members, over 20 LED screens and microphones have been set up within a four-km radius from the venue. From Friday, 500 langars started. Another 500 mobile langars, tractors carrying food and drinking water, started providing services on the routes leading up to Muzaffarnagar. Twenty banquet halls have been booked by the farmers’ body as well. Also in place will be 100 medical camps, 50 ambulances and a temporary hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/dodging-police-over-10000-farmers-of-agra-region-left-for-mnagar-to-attend-historic-mahapanchayat/articleshow/85933566.cms||Deepak Lavania

She has not only taught me how to make a plain page bloom with colours, but also how to be humble, patient and kind. -- Prisha GuptaIt is my maternal uncle, Surendra Naik. He is a retired professor of Physics who dedicated his life to teaching and career counseling. He has guided and shaped the destiny of his students, including mine. He inculcated the values of simplicity, honesty, truthfulness and sincerity in us and taught us never to equate knowledge with money. -- Parimala G Tadas Sometimes, a teacher almost becomes a second parent. Such is my relationship with Ram Murthy sir, who taught me Physics and Math almost two decades ago. But to this day, at every crossroad of my life, I look up to him for guidance. He is a blessing to thousands of students. -- Prathyusha ParakalaIt has to be my high school science teacher, Girija Gopinath, who had a unique style of teaching. Even at 64, she is still very active today and inspires me with the social service she does, to make learning a joyful experience for students. Through her initiative she helps several government primary schools with infrastructure and basic facilities.  —Anitha Sunkari My Mathematics teacher, Mrs Syamala, who also happens to be my mother. She not only teaches us but also inspires and motivates us apart from caring for us. She loves her students as high as the sky and as deep as the ocean. -- V Niyati ApoorvaThough I was studying at a Hindi medium school my English teacher, Baburao Sir, helped me strengthen my grip over the latter. He also encouraged me to opt for English medium in my intermediate. He used to say, 'English is a tricky but magical language’. I am eternally grateful to him for that.  -- Rajan SharmaI admire my mother for so many things she teaches me every day. She taught me how to read and write in different languages, good manners, healthy eating habits and how to treat everyone with respect and kindness. -- T V Sri AnshI don’t know where I would be today without Beena ma’am. Her belief in me made me believe in myself. I gave her a really hard time in my 10th grade, but she still put up with me. Today, I just want to thank her for everything. -- Mayukha MohanThere was a time when I feared Mathematics but now, I am in love with the subject, and it is all because of the efforts of Shahina ma'am. Mathematics is all about concepts and she is all about working with her students to help them understand that. I cannot thank her enough for being so patient and dedicated. -- Simone Singh The reason I look up to Madhumathi ma’am is because of her professionalism and character. She taught me how to strike a balance between my personal and professional life. Her behaviour with students is amiable and something one can learn from. -- Suman Vikram I am in awe of my Science teacher, Nupur Jain ma’am because she not only educated me about the importance of protecting the environment but also helped me be a better person. Her talks on spirituality, during free periods, changed me for the good. Now, I do not get angry unnecessarily. -- Adithya Komatineni||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/04-teachers-day-readers-quotes/articleshow/85935530.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand HC nixes MLA’s FIR, says ‘will beat with sticks’ not a threat||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court has quashed an FIR as well as a chargesheet filed against two residents of Haridwar’s Jhabrera village who were accused by the BJP MLA from the constituency of criminal intimidation and passing “casteist slurs” at him. The court observed that alleged threats to "beat the leader with sticks” made by the accused was their way of registering grouse against their elected representative. The court held that the FIR appears to have been lodged to “silence the voice of those who questioned the non-performance of the victim (MLA). “It may well be termed as malafide criminal proceedings,” it said. Pankaj Chaudhary, Mehkar Singh and a few unidentified men were booked under various sections of the IPC, including rioting and criminal intimidation, and charged with sections of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act after lawmaker Deshraj Karnwal alleged in a police complaint that they had threatened him and passed casteist slurs. The two accused had then approached the high court which had stayed their arrest. The MLA was visiting a local health centre in Jhabrera on May 19 this year when the accused had surrounded him and questioned him over poor health facilities during the second wave of the pandemic. According to Karnwal, the accused had threatened to beat him with sticks. The single bench of Justice Ravindra Maithani said the transcripts and videos of the incident revealed no casteist remarks. The court also cited a judgement of the apex court where it held that unless there is an intention to humiliate, the offence under the SC/ST Act cannot be attracted. It said that in the present case, the intention of the two accused was not to insult or humiliate but to complain. The court held that the statement of the witness — Karnwal’s personal assistant — that “caste coloured remarks were made by the petitioners, appears to have been made with ulterior motive to wreak vengeance and it is malafide.” The court held that the statements of the accused “did not promote any breach of peace nor was there any intimidation or threat”. “The conversation between the petitioners and the victim was not for the purpose or intention of insulting or humiliating the victim. It was a complaint against the victim. It was questioning of the victim, who happened to be the local MLA,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-quashes-mlas-fir-against-locals-says-will-beat-with-sticks-a-complaint-not-threat/articleshow/85933570.cms||Prashant Jha

Cops from Savli police station laid a trap on Friday on receiving a complaint from victim Suresh Parmar and nabbed the accused identified as Sanjay Pandit, Sunil Prajapati, Girish Prajapati, Salim Saiyed, Kala Parmar, Pravinsinh Solanki, Vitthal Patel, Soyeb Bidani and Israr Pathan. Police said that Suresh got trapped after Solanki, Pandit and Prajapati kept calling him and informing him of the benefits of black turmeric after they had a brief conversation at a roadside provision store in Savli around three months ago. The trio told Suresh that black turmeric has radioactive properties and alpha, beta and gamma rays are emitted from it. They told him that it is used in making a chip that is installed in a satellite by scientists. To convince Suresh, they went on to tell him that black turmeric can open a lock without a key and if camphor is placed near black turmeric, it gets lit on its own and even a nail gets bent due to the rays. As Suresh got convinced, he went with the trio to Udaipur and gave Rs 5.7 lakh cash as token money to Solanki to pay to the man having the stock of black turmeric. They returned to Vadodara as Solanki told Suresh that due to rough weather, the stock cannot be exposed to atmosphere so the person will bring it to Savli and the remaining amount of Rs 2 crore can be paid to him then. On Friday, Solanki called Suresh to come to Savli with the remaining amount as the man from Udaipur has reached with black turmeric. However, Suresh realized that he was being cheated so he approached the police and gave a complaint. Suresh went to a shop at Gandiyapura village in Savli as instructed by Solanki and later cops too reached there and nabbed the entire gang. Police said that the gang formed different teams to con people in different areas and villages through a similar modus operandi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/gang-con-retd-teacher-into-buying-radioactive-black-turmeric-busted/articleshow/85934773.cms||---

He met Ashok Dave, the principal of DP Prajapti School and together they decided to reach out to students using cable TV network. This not only did away with the issue of internet connectivity but also made learning comfortable with large TV screens replacing mobile phones and tablets. Instead of classrooms, the teachers took their classroom sessions from a big hall with multiple cameras in action. The editing was done in a local studio and each session was telecast using the cable TV network. Initially, the teachers of DP Prajapati School took the classes, but later about 350-400 teachers volunteered from various schools in the taluka in using this classroom teaching initiative. More than 2,000 students in over 70 villages have been given education during the Covid-19 school shutdown using the system. At a time when many students from economically deprived families do not have access to mobile phones or internet connectivity, this method of reaching out to the students has proved to be a runaway success.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/success-is-in-the-air-as-school-students-switch-to-cable-tv/articleshow/85937600.cms||---

---||World||Indian vs black: Vigilante killings upend a South Africa town||PHOENIX: The blows rained down — bats, hammers, a hockey stick — as Njabulo Dlamini lay on the pavement. He and five friends, all of them black, had been driving in a minibus taxi through the streets of Phoenix, a predominantly Indian suburb created from the forced racial segregation of apartheid South Africa. A mob dragged them from the car and beat them furiously, according to witnesses and video footage. Other people were chased and beaten by the crowd, which had been whipped up in recent days by WhatsApp warnings and reports of violence and looting by black people. Dlamini later died of his injuries, his family said. South Africa was convulsed this summer by some of its worst civil unrest since the end of apartheid. The imprisonment of former President Jacob Zuma for refusing to appear before a corruption inquiry set off violent protests by his supporters. Soon, riots and looting erupted in parts of the country, fed by poverty, inequality and the government’s failure to provide basic services, like water or electricity. Officials have called the violence an insurrection — an attempt to sabotage Zuma’s rival and successor, President Cyril Ramaphosa, in part by stoking some of the nation’s oldest racial tensions. Nationwide, over 340 people died in the mayhem. But officials have been alarmed by what they say undermines the social order: dozens of vigilante killings by ordinary citizens. The vigilantism was pronounced in Phoenix. The country’s police minister said 36 people there — 33 of them black — were killed. Fifty-six people have been arrested in connection with the Phoenix violence. Read AlsoHate crimes hit 12-year high in United States in 2020: FBIThe 2020 FBI data identified 7,759 hate-crimes in 2020, a 6% increase over 2019 and the highest tally since 2008. The number of offenses targeting Blacks rose to 2,755 from 1,930 and incidents against Asians jumped to 274 from 158.Mobs of mostly Indian residents, worried that their community was under siege, erected roadblocks. They stopped black people and sometimes beat or killed them, police said, inflaming the fragile relationship between black and Indian South Africans — two marginalised groups under apartheid rule. Interviews with dozens of black and Indian residents, as well as a review of video footage, show that at least some of the violence and deaths could have been prevented if police had provided basic security. While the apartheid government deemed black and Indian people inferior to the white population, Indians were placed above black people in the hierarchy. This afforded them access to better education, freer movement and sturdier homes than the blacks. On July 11, after days of watching TV footage of shopping centres in other places being looted, and cops nowhere to be found, many Phoenix locals got an anonymous, unverified message on WhatsApp. “Tomorrow we coming in all your Indian people town to close everything,” it read. “You’ll wake up and see flames.” Residents began to brace for an attack. Videos and messages left many feeling that their city was being overrun. One video showed hundreds of people charging into Phoenix from a predominantly black settlement. Gunshots rang out as looters made their way toward a shopping plaza, said Marc Chetty, a resident. A bullet tore through the kitchen window of Chandramati Bhagwati, 66, grazing her as she cooked, she said. Two shopping plazas were looted. Scared, many residents armed themselves and flocked to the streets to erect makeshift roadblocks. People argued they were not accosting black people because of their race, but because they seemed to be doing most of the looting. All around Phoenix, Indians asked how anyone could say this was about race. Indian said that while the government failed to create opportunities for their black neighbours, they employed them as gardeners and housekeepers. But for Linda Khawula, one of Dlamini’s friends who was with him that night, everything has changed. “Now I have hate in my heart,” she said. “I feel hate toward Indian people when I didn’t feel it before.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/indian-vs-black-vigilante-killings-upend-a-sa-town/articleshow/85938247.cms||John Eligon

Thirty-two students between the ages of 8 and 13 of the government primary school of the village have become writers and poets, penning 5-35 original stories and poems already. While 20 students of the village have already participated in state-level story and essay writing competitions, school principal Dr B G Patel and languages teacher Rita Parmar are looking to compile the stories and poems written by the children into a book even as some of them are intent on taking up writing as a profession. “We began the concept of creative writing in 2015-16 with the intention of ensuring overall development of the children. However, to our surprise, many students have shown great promise and have been writing quality original stories,” said Jorawargadh primary school principal B G Patel.

We love to write original stories and poems,” said Kajal, whose parents depend on farming to earn their livelihood. Her classmate Kinjal Chaudhari, who also has written more than 35 original stories, said that she wants to be a writer when she grows up. “I spend a majority of my free time writing. I want to be a writer when I grow up,” said the 13-year-old. Both girls have been writing original stories since they were in Class IV. Rita Parmar, who teaches languages to students from Class 6 to 8 in the school, says that when the authorities began the experiment in 2015-16, it was not so successful, but gradually, students picked up the flair of creativity and writing. “Now, students of lower classes are getting inspired by the feat of their seniors,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/village-school-produces-32-child-writers/articleshow/85937645.cms||---

Dr Ashish Bavdekar, the principal trial investigator at KEM Hospital Research Centre, told TOI, “The enrolment has started at the Delhi trial site and we would start on Monday... Vadu is the same area where adults have taken part in Covovax trials for the adult cohort. So, people are aware of the paediatric trials. They are happy to have their children volunteer.” Bharati Hospital in Dhankawdi and KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch are among the 10 sites across the country, where 920 minors fitting the criterion would undergo the advanced trials. Dr Jitendra Oswal, the deputy medical director at Bharati Hospital, said, “Nearly 100 participants would be enrolled per centre.” Dr Bavdekar said the trial would be held in phases -- beginning with the 12-17 age group, followed by 7-11, and then two to 6 age groups. “The safety data for the first age group would be submitted to the DSMB (Data and Safety Monitoring Board) and DCGI (Drugs Controller General of India) for assessment and approval. Once they give their nod, the next phase for the other age groups would begin,” he said. He said though 10 sites in India would conduct the trails, initially only 100 children would be enrolled for data assessment. “Then, there may be a two-week gap, after which more children would be enrolled,” said Dr Bavdekar. The study objective in this cohort is to evaluate the safety of Covovax in comparison with placebo and immunogenicity of the vaccine in children in the age group of 12 to 17 years of age and those between two and 11 years of age in comparison with the adult participants. Two doses of the vaccine would be given to the study participants 21 days apart.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/enrolment-of-12-17-age-group-for-covovax-trials-starts-tomorrow/articleshow/85935700.cms||Neha Madaan

Fortunately, the production of both the vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) has been scaled up last month. All states will get adequate supplies in September and October,” she told TOI. On the state’s demand of three crore monthly doses, the Union minister said it would depend on the production. “According to the production, the states are conveyed about the supply 15 days in advance and are directed to make the necessary arrangements to increase vaccination. This has been the routine. We are aware that states such as Kerala and Maharashtra have high number of cases. The vaccine distribution would be done accordingly,” she said. Additional chief secretary, health, Dr Pradip Vyas said the state was allocated 1.7 crore doses in September for the government sites and 22 lakh for the private hospital sites. Ahead of the possible third wave, Bharati Pawar, the Union minister, said the Centre has allocated funds for readying the health infrastructure. “Maharashtra has received the first instalment of Rs123 crore for the purpose under the National Health Mission,” she said. The minister said the funds could be used to hire human resources for all activities in health management and even ambulances. She, however, pointed out that some districts in the state had still not installed the ventilators sent by the Centre. “The PSA (pressure swing adsorption) oxygen plants assured by the state are not ready in some districts. We have directed the state authorities to do it at the earliest,” the minister said. ‘Yatra didn’t have a huge crowd’The Union minister of state for health and family welfare, Dr Bharati Pawar, said the Jan Ashirwad Yatra did not involve any huge gathering. The minister conducted the yatra in four districts — Nashik, Palghar, Dhule and Nandurbar — between August 16 and 21. Reacting to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s statement that the yatra could cause a spike in Covid cases in the state, she said, “The yatra was not carried out with much crowd. It was an effort of the central ministers to reach out to the state’s people to understand various issues faced by them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-will-get-enough-doses-says-union-minister/articleshow/85935709.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Cleaner Yamuna unlikely before 2023: Delhi Pollution Control Committee report||NEW DELHI: Delhi will have to wait till at least 2023 to start seeing any form of visible improvement in the Yamuna’s water quality with most timelines to complete sewage trapping projects and sewage treatment plants (STPs) running up to mid to late 2023, a new report prepared by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) shows. The interceptor sewer project is also expected to fully trap sewage only by March 2023. Delhi has 35 STPs at present with a combined capacity of 2,715 million litres per day (MLD), while the capital generates 3,273 MLD of sewage. This results in a gap in the treatment capacity of around 559 MLD, the report states. To bridge this gap, key STPs, such as the Yamuna Vihar STP, Kondli STP, Rithala STP, Coronation Pillar STP and Okhla STP, are in the works. While the upgradation of Kondli and Rithala STPs is expected by March 2023, 36 per cent of work has been completed for the Okhla STP so far. The project has a timeline of December 2022. For the Yamuna Vihar STP, a revised timeline will soon be submitted. To carry out upgradation work for 16 STPs, 3-4 years will be required, the report states. The interceptor sewer project is expected to trap the entire flow of 1,082 MLD by March 2023, according to the timelines provided by the report. “About 771.5 MLD (169.7 MGD) is being trapped and treated out of 1,082 MLD (238 MGD). Entire flow shall be trapped and treated by March 2023 after construction/rehabilitation of Coronation Pillar, Rithala and Kondli STPs under YAP-III,” the report reads. It says that out of 18 major drains in Delhi between Wazirabad and Okhla, 13 have so far been trapped. “Two major drains—Najafgarh and Shahdara—are included in the ISP project where substantial flow of sub-drains under their command areas will be trapped and treated. Further, in situ treatment in these drains is also being proposed,” the report says, stating an action plan has been prepared for the remaining three drains, including the Maharani Bagh drain, Mori Gate drain and Barapullah drain. DPCC in its report says STPs will be constructed on the mouth of both Mori Gate and Barapullah drains, with completion only expected by December 2023. For the Maharani Bagh drain, sewage has partially been trapped to the extent of 9-10 MLD. Manoj Mishra, convener of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, claims multiple deadlines have been violated in the past as well, with very few projects meeting the initial timelines. “Until these projects are completed, the sewage problem will not go away,” said Mishra. Delhi government is, meanwhile, working towards rejuvenation of major drains flowing into the Yamuna. “Najafgarh, Supplementary and Shahdara link drains will be cleaned and beautified. All major drains will be converted into clean water channels again. After these drains are cleaned and beautified, only clean water will flow into the drains entering the river,” water minister Satyendar Jain said on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cleaner-yamuna-unlikely-before-2023-dpcc-report/articleshow/85934148.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The new colleges would be in Dehradun city, Haridwar city (Bhupatwala), Haldwani, Gadarpur, Danya Almora, Kaljikhal Pauri, Khirsu Pauri and Dewal Chamoli. Dhami made the announcement while laying the foundation stone of the Science faculty building at Government PG College at Maldevta on the outskirts of Dehradun. Seven colleges of the state would be upgraded, the CM added. These include the government colleges at Munsyari (Pithoragarh), Gairsain (Chamoli), Kapkot (Bageshwar), Someshwar (Almora), Halduchour (Nainital), Laksar (Haridwar) and Thalisain (Pauri). Meanwhile, before the event was scheduled to begin, BJP’s Raipur legislator Umesh Sharma ‘Kau’ and party members had a heated verbal argument in presence of higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat. Before CM Dhami was to arrive at the venue, Kau expressed annoyance over his posters being torn by party members.  This led to an altercation between Kau and a few other party members with the MLA accusing a section of the party members in his constituency of not accepting him as their legislator. He went on to say that the locals of Raipur were annoyed over the fact. Incidentally, Kau had joined the saffron party along with other Congress rebels in 2016 and had won the Raipur seat with the highest victory margin in the state in the 2017 assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-announces-more-pre-poll-sops-8-new-colleges-in-state/articleshow/85933696.cms||---

He was speaking after inaugurating the virtual launch of the second edition of the dragonfly festival titled ‘Thumbimaholtsavam’, organized jointly by WWF India, SOS (Society for Odonate Studies) and Thumbipuranam on Saturday. “More studies and awareness programmes are needed to understand these lesser-known species,” he said. This year, the frontline staff of the Kerala forest department are also specially included in documenting the odonate species seen in protected areas. Suresh Elamon, renowned wildlife photographer and filmmaker, released the mascot of the festival ‘Piku’, which was inspired by Onathumbi or the Rhyothemis variegata (Common Picture-wing), which he said is a symbol of ‘good hope and prosperity’. Zoological Survey of India head Dr Subramanian delivered the lead talk on the importance of odonates in conservation of wetlands as they are an indicator species which can be used to monitor the health of wetland ecosystems. This festival will be held from September 2021 to February 2022. This year, the main aim will be to integrate school kids into the conservation spectrum. Main activities planned are Bioblitz (backyard odonata watch), photography competition, creative activities, webinars and quiz. Colleges interested in conducting small projects on biomonitoring are especially invited for this festival. All the information regarding the competitions and webinars will be available on the official website of WWF India, its social media pages in Facebook and Instagram handle (wwfindia). Earlier, the e-copy of the report of the dragonfly festival 2020-21 held in Kerala was released by Pramod Krishnan. Last year, the Thumbimaholtsavam was launched as a ‘backyard odonata watch’ in keeping with the Covid lockdown and restrictions. As many as 112 participants took part and 118 species were documented from the 2,281 observations recorded in 62 days. The report said that since odonates have well-known habitat requirements (freshwater ecosystems that vary from coastlines to tropical rainforests) and are easily identifiable, they are one of the best indicators of ecosystem quality and biodiversity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dragon-fly-fest-to-raise-awareness-among-public/articleshow/85933693.cms||---
---||Delhi||STPs to augment wastewater treatment: Delhi Jal Board||NEW DELHI: Construction of a sewage treatment plant (STP) in east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar Extension led to protests last month, but the city will need several such plants to meet the increasing demand. In the next three years, many decentralised sewage treatment plants will be built to augment the wastewater treatment capacity in Delhi. A DJB report stated that 56 STPs would be built in the next three years to treat 92MGD of sewage. It is estimated that by 2041, Delhi will need to treat 1,200MGD wastewater against the current installed capacity of 597MGD. Besides upgrading the existing plants, DJB plans to set up new plants at Sonia Vihar, Rohini, Delhi Gate, Mori Gate and Barapullah. Delhi gets a daily supply of 935MGD water, from which nearly 80% wastewater is generated, an official said. While the city generates 748MGD wastewater every day, the present sewage treatment capacity is 597MGD. “There is a shortage of around 150MGD wastewater treatment capacity, which needs to be plugged, while progressively increasing the capacity to meet the future needs,” the official said. Delhi’s 79% area is sewered through sewage lines running to 8,800km. According to the draft MPD 2041, Delhi will have an estimated population of 30 million and a demand of 1,500MGD water supply, which will lead to generation of 1,200MGD sewage. According to DJB’s plan, the land pooling areas will use a combination of zero liquid discharge systems and decentralised STPs (DSTPs), which will cover 240MGD sewage, while 110MGD will be met by rehabilitation of the existing plants under Yamuna Action Plan, National Mission to Clean Ganga NMCG and AMRUT schemes. DJB also plans to develop 56 DSTPs across the capital with a combined capacity of 92MGD. “DDA has notified the policy for land allocation for these DSTPs recently. Land will be required at 73 locations, of which 10 are already available with DJB. For the remaining 63 locations, land will have to be made available by DDA, gram sabha land and land and building department,” the official said. In case of five new STPs that will be built, a consultant has been appointed and a tender document is under preparation for Sonia Vihar 7MGD plant. Estimates are being prepared for 25MGD Rohini plant the allotment of land is awaited in case of 10MGD Dilli Gate, 10MGD Mori Gate and 20MGD Barapulla plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stps-to-augment-wastewater-treatment-djb/articleshow/85934194.cms||Paras Singh

In addition to this, Rs 4 lakh will also be given to the kin of those who died in the floods. Financial assistance will also be given after the death of domesticated animals and compensation for crops that have been destroyed, he said. “This area faces floods every year and this time, the administration was prepared to deal with the situation but there was incessant rain over the past 12-15 days in the region and downpour in Nepal. Because of this, Rapti is flowing 2.5-3 metres above the danger mark and other rivers are also above the danger mark, a situation that has not been this bad in the past 50 years” the CM said. As many as 2 lakh people in 200 villages are affected in the district, where Naugarh and Domariyaganj tehsils are the worst impacted. Crop damage has been reported from 400 villages in Gorakhpur district while 304 villages have been affected .

Sunanda Lokhande from Narwat village in Bhokar taluka cannot stop smiling, as she takes pride while pointing at the nameplate of the house. It displays the names of Sudanda and her two daughters-in-law. In her village, more than 200 families have put up such nameplates at the entry of their homes. “We have put up three name plates, one with my name, and two with those of my daughters-in-law (Vishranti and Priyanka), on each of the three entrance doors,” Sunanda told TOI.

---||Kochi||Kochi corporation to finally introduce e-governance services||KOCHI: After a delay of around one-and-a-half decades, the Kochi corporation authorities are planning to introduce at least a part of e-governance services within three to six months. As part of the plan, the Information Kerala Mission (IKM) will start preparatory measures for online distribution of birth and death certificates soon. “We are planning to arrange facilities for issuance of certificates of birth and death which occur now online. The IKM will start measures to issue the certificates online through its platform,” Mayor M Anil Kumar said. “It will take some more time for issuing online certificates pertaining to the deaths and births which occurred in the past. Data entry for the purpose is a time consuming exercise. We are trying to get the support from TCS for the purpose,” Anil Kumar said. “Now, we are giving physical certificates on the very day of submitting the application,” he said. A meeting with TCS, which had been entrusted with the e-governance project earlier, will be convened soon. TCS, which had failed to complete the e-governance project even after nine years, had backed out from the project in 2020. Now, the corporation requires data available with the TCS for providing online services which are based on the documents prior to 2021. The state government may intervene to get the data from TCS. The provisions for online payment of building tax will also be completed within a few months. “We are also planning to expedite the measures to facilitate online payment of building tax. Instructions have already been given to the officials for expediting the process,” the mayor said. In the absence of online facilities for the payment of various taxes, the residents are facing hardships in clearing the dues. Given the Covid situation, most of the residents are not ready to turn up at the corporation office and pay the taxes physically. This has caused a dip in the tax revenue of the corporation which had been facing financial crunches for the past several years. Collection of data is the major constraint before the corporation authorities and the IKM Non-cooperation of officials with the corporation had been cited as one of the reasons for delay in implementing the e-governance project. There are allegations that the employees did not cooperate with the efforts to provide e-governance services as they would lose the chance for getting bribes once the online services are in place. Another hurdle in is the huge investment required for it. Now, the local body will have to find fresh funds for the projects. The hardware bought for the facility more than a decade ago has become either outdated or defunct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-to-finally-introduce-e-governance-services/articleshow/85933714.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Due to this doctors see more cases of noise induced sleeplessness and anxiety and many have taken to social media to complain about the issue. “The menace of loudspeakers-based-selling has frustratingly grown in residential areas in #HyderabadSpeaker with three sound waves,” tweeted @hydyoudeserve. Residential areas in Manikonda, Mehdipatnam, Nizampet, Miyapur and even old city areas have reported an upswing in such cases. “While earlier this wasn’t a frequent thing, now I see at least 2-3 sellers daily visiting our area and they do not have any fixed timing. While it is true that the vendors have not been seeing much sales and have started venturing into residential areas more and they should not be driven away from these areas but some limit should be put on the volume used,” said Rajesh Singh, a techie living in Miyapur area. Another tweet by @abidrazvi pointing out the menace read, “Everyday i have to go out n tell them to reduce their volume. Can we take video and send somewhere. More problem is the beggars on wheel chair with speakers.” Meanwhile, doctors say that patients who had seen some relief in headaches during the lockdown have started seeing the symptoms of stress return. “Often elderly and patients suffering from other ailments have a low tolerance for noise pollution, even if it is within the permissible range. We are seeing patients return with symptoms of stress induced by noise off late. It is due to increasing noise from traffic as well as other sources like loudspeakers,” said Dr Mehdi Hasan, a general physician working in the Dilsukhnagar area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vendors-with-loudspeakers-on-rise-create-nuisance-in-colonies/articleshow/85935686.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Uttara owner keen to adopt old New Empire format||KOLKATA: Despite poor sale of tickets at New Empire, this iconic single screen theatre in Kolkata will never be remodelled. John Mantosh, the director of Humayun Properties Ltd that owns the building that houses New Empire and the properties where once stood Lighthouse, Tiger and Uttara cinemas, is now keen on reviving the old New Empire model that used to once host both film screenings and theatre performances. He has drawn up the plan to build a theatre for 150 viewers on the Uttara premises to host live performances. Along with that will be a shopping arcade, cafeteria and two cinema screens with car parking facilities. The New Empire auditorium was built in 1927. Initially, it would host operas, ballets and plays. The likes of Yehudi Menuhin, Zubin Mehta, Uday Shankar, Amala Shankar, PC Sorcar Sr and theatre giants including Sombhu Mitra and Tripti Mitra performed there. Films were also screened here alongside theatre performances. This module was stopped in the 70s after Warner Brothers took it on lease in 1969. They renovated the theatre and screened only their movies till their lease ended in 1989. New Empire is now one of the few standalone cinemas in central Kolkata with an approximate seating capacity of 600. “I think it will be the only iconic single screen theatre in central Kolkata that will remain untouched even in future. I like to see the façade and will never touch it,” Mantosh said. He now wants to revive the 50s model of New Empire for developing Uttara, which currently runs as a market. Madan Company used to screen films in tents at Hatibagan before setting up Crown cinema. It was renamed as Uttara in 1935. “The old structure, which was semi-pucca, was completely gone by the late 60s. It returned as a proper cinema hall after that. It started running as a departmental store in the late 90s. I purchased it in 2004,” Mantosh said. Work on developing Uttara can only begin once the issue over the property’s heritage status is resolved at a Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) meeting. “While West Bengal Heritage Commission (WBHC) still enlists some buildings in Kolkata as heritage property without giving any gradation, Uttara is not there on our list,” said WBHC chairperson Shuvaprasanna. But Uttara’s address (138/2 Bidhan Sarani) is mentioned in the ‘heritage list grade pending’ section of the KMC portal. “Subject to KMC giving me permission, I will begin work on developing the property,” Mantosh added. Hatibagan, he added, is “heavily neglected”. “Almost all the theatres in that stretch are gone. This place will greatly benefit if I get the permission to develop Uttara,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/uttara-owner-keen-to-adopt-old-new-empire-format/articleshow/85933719.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Pune||Residents go the extra mile, open heart & purse strings for needy||Pune: Even before Pune detected its first Covid-19 case in a husband-wife duo early last year, the residents of Palash Cooperative Housing Society in Wakad were lockdown-ready. By the second week of March, they had chosen vendors to deliver essentials like vegetables directly from the farm to their society. They even managed to get cash delivered at their doorsteps through ‘mobile ATMs’. Chairman Kiran Vadgama said he was in Goa in February last year where he met some international tourists who told him about restrictions being implemented in their respective countries due to Covid-19 spread. “I realised that some curbs might be imposed in India too. So, the first thing we did was to choose four vendors to deliver fresh vegetables and fruits, among others, directly from the farm to the society,” he said. Homemaker Rachana Raul said the society members also kept a close watch on the happenings across the globe. “So, even before the lockdown was imposed, we started stocking up on rations and told our domestic helps to do the same. We paid them their full salaries for the lockdown period and also extended monetary help to various organisations working for migrants. My son donated all his savings in a piggy bank for buying rations for the police staff,” she said. The residents followed the government guidelines and barred entry/exit of outsiders, except for those involved in essential services, during the lockdown months. “Soon after the curbs were relaxed, delivery boys were allowed inside the society. We also sanitised the entire society from time to time and ensured RT-PCR tests of the staffers every 45-60 days,” Vadgama said. The society now has almost 100% of its eligible population vaccinated with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. And about 60% of its residents have already got both the doses. “All these steps and more helped us keep Covid cases restricted to just 54 since the pandemic started in the city early last year,” Vadgama said, adding that the society members have donated 50 smartphones to the domestic workers and others to ensure easy access to online education for their children. Sambhu Ghasita, another resident, said, “We were always ready to help out in whatever way possible in our capacity. Whenever a staffer was sick or in need, we helped him or her without having a second thought.” Swati Korde, an educationist and environmentalist, said the society members did what any citizen would have done during the testing times. “I also designed a special composter for Covid-affected residents so that they could keep all their wet garbage in it. This ensured that the housekeeping staffers didn’t come in contact with the infected,” she said. The society has many feats under its belt, including its sustainable development model, for which it has won the best society award from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation multiple times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-go-the-extra-mile-open-heart-purse-strings-for-needy/articleshow/85935691.cms||Ardhra Nair

The Hyderabad-based pharma player had acquired the exclusive global rights (excluding Japan and Asia) to E7777 from Eisai Co Ltd in March 2016. Dr Reddy’s will receive an upfront payment of $40 million from Citius on closure of the transaction for sale of the engineered IL-2-diptheria toxin infusion protein, Dr Reddy’s Labs said in a regulatory filing to the bourses on Saturday. This upfront payment will be followed by a milestone payment of $40 million related to the approval of the CTCL (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma) indication and up to $70 million for additional indication approvals, it added. Dr Reddy’s said it will also receive certain sales-based milestones and tiered earn-out payments. Commenting on the development, Dr Reddy’s CEO Erez Israeli said: “Addressing unmet patient needs in oncology remains a prime focus area for us. E7777 has significant potential as an important component of systemic therapy for CTCL and other cancers. Post acquiring from Eisai, significant progress was made on the CTCL development front.” “We are confident of Citius’ ability to realize the full potential of E7777 in the treatment of CTCL as well as in their ability to develop this promising drug for additional oncology and immuno-oncology indications,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dr-reddys-selling-anti-cancer-agent-to-citius-pharma/articleshow/85935716.cms||---
---||Pune||Take action against laggard labs: Health dept to dists||Pune: The state public health department on Saturday directed the administration of seven-eight districts — where the Covid-19 negative test result data updating was being delayed — to take strict action against the faltering laboratories because it was affecting their weekly positivity rate. State surveillance officer Dr Pradip Awate told TOI that all the districts had been told to hold regular meetings with the laboratories and ensure that the Covid test data — both positive and negative reports — were updated within 24 hours or a maximum of 48 hours. “They have to ensure that the data entry operators are given time for updating the records. If they still fail to adhere to the timeline, the district administration should take strict action against them,” he said. Recently, the Pune district’s weekly positivity rate (WPR) was reported to be on the higher side because of the delay in entry of the negative test reports. It affected the calculation reflected in the note submitted to the state cabinet. “While the state cabinet note showed Pune district’s WPR at 6.15%, it was actually around 4%,” said a source in the know of developments. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh confirmed that there was an issue in data entry and efforts were being made to address it. Awate said the test report data formed the baseline for the administration’s planning. So, he stressed, there should be adequate focus on data entry. There are 609 laboratories approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which include 200 private labs in the state. “These laboratories are under the district administrations. If any laboratories fail to comply with the set guidelines, the administration can take action against them. They may be even removed from the list,” said Awate. ICMR had earlier clarified that the states could take action against the laboratories not complying to norms. Before Pune, Nandurbar district had faced a similar situation. The state cabinet note showed it as a district of concern because its WPR was 11.7%. But in reality, the district’s WPR was just 0.7%, which the district authorities corrected later. “Districts have been told to constantly take corrective measures and inform the state public health department if such issues are there,” a senior official of the public health department. Another public health official said the data was collated at three levels. There are two portals — CV Analytics (based on real-time data from laboratories) and that of ICMR. Also, he said, each district had data at their own level and these hardly matched. “The dynamic data leads to confusion in the final data,” he added. Public health expert R Jotkar told TOI that updating data correctly by every district was essential. “Ahead of the third wave, all districts and the state authorities have to ensure that the data collation and reporting are being done properly because the state authorities’ decisions depend on it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/take-action-against-laggard-labs-health-dept-to-dists/articleshow/85935733.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: These teachers used novel ways to tackle pandemic challenge||LUCKNOW: When the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country last year forcing closure of schools, there were teachers who made sure that learning did not come to a grinding halt. A few of them turned out to be silent heroes who helped the underprivileged by using alternatives to regular classroom study. On Teacher’s Day, TOI profiles the unsung teachers who brought about a change amid pandemic. Hansmukhi, a 44-year-old head teacher at a primary school in Sarsawa block of Saharanpur district went door-to-door convincing parents to allow their kids for a free class every day. “Most kids in our village do not have smart phones. So, I began taking classes over phone. Kids enjoyed and they were ready for notes,” she said. She even bought notebooks and got learning material printed. For 45-year-old Mithilesh Mishra, closure of schools never made a difference. She got students together and held open-air class in Ikauna block of Shravasti district. “There was no open area near our school. So we decided to sit under a tree near a temple where physical distancing can be followed,” said Mithilesh. Jyoti Kumari, 41, made use of technology and ensured that no student of English medium upper primary school in Koilara block of Bhadohi is deprived of learning material. “At my own expense, I got printed all worksheets and travelled to school weekly to distribute them among students. I was delighted to see students who came just to take and submit the worksheet,” she said. “Many teachers in UP reached out to students during school closure to ensure continuity of learning. They grabbed every opportunity overcame all obstacles,” said UNICEF’s education specialist Ritwik Patra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/these-teachers-used-novel-ways-to-tackle-pandemic-challenge/articleshow/85937714.cms||Isha Jain

Development works passed during the house meeting in January include revamp of community centres, growing of grass on all footpaths, beautification of entry and exit points, non-motorised traffic corridor, storm water drainage system in sector-8, 9, 10 and 19, among others. During the F&CC meeting, it was decided that facilities at all community centres would be upgraded and articles like air-conditioner, LED, gym, table tennis, chess, carrom, reading table, badminton net, among other electronic items would be purchased.

When asked about the slow speed of development work in the city, mayor Kulbhushan Goyal said, “We had passed important agendas to beautify and develop the city in the house meeting on January 27, but due to the slow speed of officials, work was delayed. If officials had started the works earlier, the city would have looked different.” BOX: Tenders to be placed in F&CC meeting: - Revamping of Sector 10, 12 community centre at Rs 12 crore - Revamping of Sector 15 community centre at Rs 4.50 crore - Recarpeting of city roads at Rs 5 crore - Purchase of dumper placer, pick-up van, 2 JCB machines, Shaktiman machine, bush cutter machine at Rs2.63 crore - Storm water drainage system to be installed in sectors 8, 9, 10 and 19 - Painting of road berms yellow and black, tender to allot - Non-motorised corridor work to be completed by October 15 - New Gaushala to be built over 5 acres of land - Repair of 29 e-rickshaws - Night food street tender in 15 days||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mayor-hauls-up-mc-over-8-mnth-delay-in-devp-works/articleshow/85933721.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

As per the official forecast, showers accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning are likely to take place in parts of Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Osmanabad, Parbhani, Hingoli, Nanded and Latur districts over the next 24-hours. Some places are likely to witness heavy to very heavy rainfall activity during the subsequent 72-hour period till September 8. K K Dakhore, the agricultural meteorologist at the Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, Parbhani, on Saturday said a depression is forming over the Bay of Bengal and it would produce rainfall activity in Marathwada and other parts of the state. “In our agricultural advisory, farmers have been asked to take care of their harvested kharif crops such as green gram and black gram. The pest-control treatments should be avoided till September 9 as the rain could wash away the chemicals. The overall weather conditions would be conducive for other standing kharif crops including cotton, soyabean and maize, unless very extreme weather conditions are observed in the days to come,” he said. Marathwada, comprising eight districts, has received an average 658mm rainfall since June 1, which accounts for 97% of the expected showers. Three districts — Jalna, Beed and Nanded — have already got the season’s quota of rainfall, with other districts are lagging by about 4% to 15%, revealed the official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/another-round-of-heavy-rain-likely-in-parts-of-marathwada/articleshow/85931880.cms||---

The pre-auction price has been kept at Rs 20 lakh. The surfacing of this painting in the public domain has created a lot of excitement — not only because it is a national treasure that cannot go out of the country but also because the painting is of Buddha, a figure Roy was not known to paint often. The canvas is 122cmx71cm, making it one of the larger ones of the Navratna artist. It is a tempera on cloth painting and shows Buddha in a meditative state, eyes half closed, on his lotus seat. The style reminds one of Tibetan thangka. “Roy is not known to have painted too many Buddhas. Perhaps the motivation to draw the Buddha was the same as what inspired him to draw a Christ,” said art historian R Shivakumar. AstaGuru will be conducting the auction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jamini-roys-1950-buddha-canvas-to-be-up-for-auction/articleshow/85933734.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The appointed agencies have been asked to work as per detailed instructions given,” the civic administration has said. Even as the AMC had decided to appoint experts for preparing proposals for regularizing Gunthewari properties, a section of affected citizens were apprehensive over the fate of their proposals submitted in the past. Former chairman of the standing committee of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, Renukadas Vaidya said the past proposals in question would be considered by the civic administration and affected residents need not have to submit any proposal afresh. “The civic administration has asked the private agencies to help the private players appointed to help citizens in pushing forward their proposals from its past status. It means, citizens can pick up from where they left and there is no need of duplication of efforts,” said Vaidya, who was following the demand for regularization of Gunthewari properties with the state government. As per terms and conditions spelt out by Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, private agencies need to complete 100 proposals initially , followed by which their service charges will be released. The official start to the regularisation of Gunthewari properties has offered a relief to many citizens as the municipal limits of Aurangabad have around 118 Gunthewari areas, which together house over four lakh population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/gunthewari-regularisation-process-rolled-out-past-applicants-need-not-file-proposals-again/articleshow/85931909.cms||---
---||Kolkata||No birth certs from hosps, parents at KMC for docu||Kolkata: Parents of many infants born in city government hospitals in the past year are yet to get their birth certificates. One such harassed mother called up KMC board of administrators chairman Firhad Hakim on Saturday to narrate her plight. The problem is peculiar to government hospital births as the state had, a year-and-a-half ago, announced that birth certificates would be issued by the hospitals concerned instead of KMC. Hospitals were authorized to issue additional copies of the birth certificate against payment. It was intended to spare new parents the trouble of queuing up at KMC and reduce the burden on the KMC births and deaths section. However, the idea appears to have failed. A section of parents is regularly visiting KMC with the allegation that their babies were being refused admission at some of the city’s schools as they don’t recognize birth certificates issued by government agencies other than the KMC health department. “We are regularly meeting people who want additional copies of birth certificates of their children from our health department as that will enable them to secure admission to schools. Originally, they got a copy of the birth certificate from the government hospital. But now want us to deliver either a fresh certificate or additional copies of the certificates issued by the government hospitals,” said a KMC health department official. However, a civic official made it clear the KMC health department was not in a position to issue duplicate or additional copies of birth certificates issued by state-run hospitals. “We have stopped receiving official records of births at government hospitals for the past year-and-a-half,” the official said. Hakim assured he would take the matter up with the state health department. But he stopped short of making a commitment on when the issue would be resolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-birth-certs-from-hosps-parents-at-kmc-for-docu/articleshow/85933746.cms||Saikat Ray

Officials with Ernakulam rural police said that a fish vendor in Aluva fell for such an attempt recently. He received a call from a person who had claimed that he was a military man. The man spoke in Hindi and somehow convinced the vendor that a military contingent was camping nearby and needed 10kg of fish. The man, who has great respect for the Army, agreed to deliver the fish and the scamster told him that a driver would be sent to get the fish. The vendor, who accepts payments through UPI, asked the caller to make the payment through his UPI ID. The caller, however, told him that the military personnel can only pay through ‘card-to-card’ and asked him to send a photo of both sides of his cards. When he sent the photo via WhatsApp, the caller even sent him an image of a fake ID card to convince the vendor. Soon, the caller asked for an OTP number sent to his phone. The gullible salesman gave the OTP number and within seconds Rs 2,650 which was all that was left in his account was taken out by the fraudster, police said. Rural police said that a chicken stall owner at Keezhmad also received a similar call from someone claiming to be a military man, but he escaped the trap. He was asked for 15kg of meat for the military camp, which was being held secretly in Aluva. When he was asked to send photos of his debit card, he became suspicious and sent the images of the debit card of an account that only had Rs 2 left in it. The caller then asked for a debit card with at least Rs 1,000 left in it. The man understood it was a scam and cut the call. District police chief SP K Karthick said that the police had been getting such complaints from various persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-warn-of-spurt-in-online-frauds/articleshow/85934410.cms||---

After a meeting on Saturday, the associations announced to keep the markets shut on September 11 (Saturday) as a mark of protest. The shopkeepers also decided to keep lights of their shops off once a week if their the decision was not rolled back. Jaipur Vypaar Mahasaang president Subash Goyal said, “Our aim is to send the state government a message their our trade is in the dark. We will also request our customers to participate in the campaign and meet chief secretary in this regard.” Bot the covic bodies, Greater and Heritage, have decided to impose the trade licence that will include private hospitals, nursing homes, coaching centres, clinics, libraries, hostels and PGs, kiosks for selling tobacco etc. The traders will will have to procure a licence after paying a fee on a yearly basis. A fixed amount according to every business has been decided which owners have to pay. Association member claimed, “It will be an additional burden on the traders at the times of pandemic. The shopkeepers pay UD tax to the corporation, register themselves under GST, firm registration fee under the labour department. This is a black law that is being imposed on us.” Municipal corporation has said Jaipur is not the first urban body to impose it. In Jodhpur Municipal Corporation, the trade licence was implemented 25 years ago. Moreover, recently the 15th Finance Commission has stopped the grant for any civic work to municipal corporations in the country. The grant from now on will be given for National Clean Air Project and solid waste management. This money will also be given looking at the performance of the corporation. Now, corporation has to bear its entire financial liability. A senior offical at JMCGreater said, “There is a need to impose this taxation on every business as they are using corporation facility. We are charging as per the business size and it is important. During pandemic, income of corporation has been impacted. If we don’t charge other businesses, than no income will be generated.” It’s a black tax: RajeFormer chief minister Vasundhara Raje said the trade license is a black tax, which is forced on small traders who struggle for livelihood daily. It is injustice on traders in the times of pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/markets-to-be-shut-on-sept-11-to-protest-jmc-move-on-trade-licence/articleshow/85937727.cms||---

The All-India Students Federation (AISF), along with other leftist leaders, criticised the decision, stating that it would pave way for the privatisation of the health sector and deprive the masses of basic healthcare services. To register their protest, members of the AISF’s Parbhani unit have started a campaign, as a part of which, they are sending blood-stained letters to the MVA government demanding that the proposal be scrapped. “Parbhani and other districts in Maharashtra that do not have government medical colleges, must get the desired healthcare facility purely on a state-run basis. Free and quality healthcare is the basic right of every citizen, which should be respected by the government,” AISF said. Rajan Kshirsagar, the state working committee member of the Communist Party of India (CPI), said that it was harrowing to see the state government being so keen on privatising the healthcare sector. “We saw many cases of private hospitals looting patients during the pandemic. The PPP model for setting up medical colleges and attached hospitals would officially endorse such a loot,” he said. While Maharashtra has government medical colleges and hospitals in 18 districts, the new proposal for setting up more such institutions will be considered under the PPP model, as declared during the recent Cabinet meeting. Kshirsagar also pressed for the demand to set up a state-run medical college at Parbhani at the earliest. “While the government recently sanctioned a medical college in Osmanabad, Parbhani has been ignored despite a long-pending demand,” he said. Maharashtra medical education minister Amit Deshmukh could not be reached for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aisf-opposes-ppp-model-for-medical-colleges-hosps/articleshow/85931918.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Delhi||Why probe roads lead to Nov 2008 Noida board meet||Noida: An inquiry into the sequence of events that eventually led to approvals for the height of Supertech’s Emerald Court twin towers to be doubled has zeroed in on a board meeting of the Noida Authority that was held on November 3, 2008 where the concept of purchasable FAR (floor area ratio) was introduced in the NCR city. It was through purchasable FAR in 2009 and 2011 that the height of the twin towers, Apex and Ceyane, was increased after the Noida Authority sanctioned amended building plans. On August 31, the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of both towers, holding that they were built in violation of law and observing that there was collusion between officials of the Noida Authority and Supertech that led to the towers’ construction. The court also directed prosecution of erring officials. The UP government has set up a special investigation team (SIT) to fix responsibility for collusion. Supertech, meanwhile, issued a statement on Saturday, announcing it will file a review petition before the Supreme Court against the order to bring down the twin towers, insisting the project had necessary approvals and maps were sanctioned by the Noida Authority. Sources said the introduction of purchasable FAR was proposed as an amendment to the Noida Authority’s building regulations of 2006 and the state government issued a notification on February 19, 2009 to approve the Authority’s demand. Besides the permissible FAR that was purchasable, construction companies were given an option of buying an additional 33% FAR by paying up charges for that to the Authority. The planning section of the Authority had cited the need to increase FAR on an immediate basis, said senior officers. The explanation offered was that Noida Authority needed to augment its financial resources and release the stress on available land for housing by encouraging vertical development. As metro connectivity was needed to improve mobility within the city, the view that was circulated was that selling additional development rights in the form of FAR would enable the Authority raise the required capital to improve the infrastructure in the city. The Noida Authority probe team that has been tasked with inquiring into decisions taken since the allotment of land to Emerald Court in 2004 and the revisions in its building plans in December 2006, November 2009 and March 2012 has focused on the 2007-2013 period, when the maximum number of group housing projects were launched in the city, to understand if private developers and Authority officials colluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-probe-roads-lead-to-nov-2008-noida-board-meet/articleshow/85937775.cms||Shalabh

The Hyderabad MP Owaisi held a closeddoor meeting in Jaipur on Saturday. He came with his party leaders who left for Ajmer Dargah for prayers while he stayed in Jaipur for six hours before returning to Hyderabad. Talking to TOI, he said his party had started studying the political scenario in the state. “The locals are in touch with the party leaders and a couple of delegations have visited Hyderabad expressing resentment over the non-performance of the present government. They (delegation) told us that minorities and other vulnerable communities are facing apathy from the state government leading to leadership crisis. This can be filled by our party,” said Owaisi. His party is taking feedback from people of different backgrounds to understand the scope of the third party in the bipolar politics of the state. “Our party is not in a hurry and we will take a call only after detailed discussion with various stakeholders. Our party is committed to giving a better alternative to the people of the state especially minorities and the deprived communities. Hitting at the Congress government for ignoring its core vote bank, Muslims, Owaisi said the community, which has voted them to power by granting overwhelming support, has no say in the government. “The most common complaint people make is the Gehlotled government doesn’t have time to listen to the grievances of the minorities. Most of the meetings they held are mere tokenism or photo ops. This will not help anyone. The voters should see track record of our elected representatives inside state assemblies and in the field to see our style of politics,” said Owaisi. The AIMIM has not yet been formally launched in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/owaisi-eyes-political-space-in-raj-holds-closed-door-meet/articleshow/85937755.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Jayant Patil assures Marathwada of at least 4 TMC water||Aurangabad: Maharashtra water resources minister Jayant Patil has assured at least 4 TMC water for Marathwada from the west-flowing rivers. Patil said the design of the proposed link-up involving Vaitarna dam and Mukane dam has been modified in a bid to divert 10 TMC water from the former into the latter dam. “Of the 10 TMC water, 4 TMC can be easily transferred into Godavari basin for the benefit of Marathwada,” he told the reporters on Saturday in Aurangabad. Stating that the earlier design of link-up was planned to divert only 1 TMC water, Patil said the new arrangement would involve an expenditure of Rs 80 crore. “The efforts are on to tap more water for Vaitarna dam by using lift-irrigation schemes and other measures. The water from the dam can be diverted into Mukane dam after different water needs of Mumbai are fulfilled,” he said. On the status of the entire project involving the diversion of water from west-flowing rivers towards Marathwada, Patil said seven canal works have been completed and the work on the remaining 10 more canals is in progress. Patil, who is also the state president of NCP, earlier visited the rain-affected areas in Kannad taluka of Aurangabad district and neighbouring Jalgaon district. Later, he told the media that assessment of crop damage due to rain was on. “The preliminary assessment of the damage is over and a survey involving field visits is on. The affected farmers, including those whose farms have witnessed heavy soil-erosion, would get compensation as per norms,” he said. Patil, who visited the site of the percolation tank in Kannad taluka that was damaged due to the recent heavy rain, said the alternate drinking arrangement would be made for the affected population. He avoided queries on the alleged delay on the part of the Maharashtra governor in approving the list of 12 members of the State Legislative Council sent by the ruling parties from the MVA government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jayant-patil-assures-marathwada-of-at-least-4-tmc-water/articleshow/85931954.cms||Prasad Joshi

He added that it has been a trend in the state the ruling party has the upper edge in the panchayat polls and this time the results are no different. “The results also reflect that Congress misused the government machinery and influenced the voters by various means.

For the last 21 days, student organisations have been staging a dharna in front of the vice-chancellor's office and PU administrative block in protest against delay in conducting the last phase of Senate elections. The PU administration has deferred polling for the graduate constituency five times in the last one and a half years. Addressing the students, Charuni said, “PU is playing with the future of thousands of students. Efforts are being made to completely destroy the democratic system in the university. Neither are students studying nor are elections of the governing body of Panjab University being conducted. We will not allow voice of students to be suppressed at any cost. The Kisan Morcha will stand by students at all times on both these issues.” Charuni was accompanied by farmer leader Surjit Singh of Bharatiya Kisan Morcha and advocate D P S Randhawa, former member of the Panjab University Senate and a contestant from the graduate constituency. Farmer leader Surjit Singh, a PU alumnus, said the Senate is the apex body which decides issues related to students’ interests. He said PU vice-chancellor Professor Rajkumar wants to abolish the Senate system and implement the agenda of BJP and RSS on campus. He also called for immediate opening of the university for students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmer-leaders-join-pu-fray-as-charuni-visits-campus/articleshow/85933783.cms||---

They said that a committee should be formed with educationalists and retired judges to study the ground reality and take appropriate decisions to improve the education sector based on the report. “It is not right to take up rationalization amid the pandemic as students are unable to come to school or attend digital classes due to lack of resources. The state should first withdraw its decision to rationalize schools and take measures to strengthen government schools,” said K Laxminarayana, general secretary of the committee. The committee said that students are not joining government schools because of a lack of teachers and added that the state now is showing less strength as a reason to shut down schools instead of taking measures to improve enrolment. They said that the number of classrooms should be increased in government schools so as to conduct physical classes and that each primary school should have at least two teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tsec-to-govt-form-panel-to-study-reasons-for-less-strength-in-schools/articleshow/85935844.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Will get pradhans in 60 samitis, says Congress||JAIPUR: The hand of the Congress has been strengthened with the ruling party leading in the results of panchayat elections held in six districts. Congress claimed that the party made big gains in five out of six districts where panchayat samiti elections were held. Party chief Govind Singh Dotasra while addressing a press conference said except Sirohi, the ruling party won the panchayat samitis in the remaining five districts. He said as a strategy, the Congress had not given symbols to candidates and supported independents in Bharatpur and would elect pradans in all the 12 panchayat samitis there. He said 171 party supported independents came out victorious in Bharatpur. Similarly, in Dasua the Congress had a majority in all the 12 panchayat samitis. In Jodhpur which is the home turf of chief minister Ashok Ghelot and union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhwat, the Congress party leads in16 out of 21 panchayat samitis. In Sawai Madhopur also the Congress won majority in 4 out of seven panchayat samitis. He claimed that while the BJP got absolute majority in 14 panchayat samitis the Congress would get its pradhans in 60 out of 78. In seats wise the Congress got 10 % higher seats including party supported Independents than the BJP while in voting percentage the ruling party got 3% more votes than its nearest rival BJP, claimed Dotasra. In the zilla parishads, both parties are neck and neck while the Congress got a majority in Dausa. Last time four out of six Zilla parishads that went to the polls were with the BJP, but that time the party was in power. But this time around the saffron party is struggling while Congress is leading. The enthusiastic party workers have gathered at the party chief Govind Dotasra's residence to congratulate him for the good performance. Excited Congress workers celebrated with fireworks. The workers said that the PCC chief Dotasra has been very active in the elections holding consultations with MLAs and micro planning. The impact of the government's people-friendly schemes also clearly visible on the ground in the election results, they claim.He had formed committees to monitor each seat and fielded youth along with veterans for campaigning. "This victory is dedicated to Congress workers. The party has won on the basis of hard work of workers, schemes of the government, good governance of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot's government and booth management. The party also performed well in the civic and panchayat elections held earlier. It is expected that on the strength of Congress workers this kind of performance will continue," said Dotasra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/will-get-pradhans-in-60-samitis-cong/articleshow/85937767.cms||---

A corporate house that has been looking after the park has written to government agencies for urgent intervention but there has been no help forth-coming yet. “The steps leading to the water body have collapsed. Large sinkholes have developed in the pathway. The entire zone has turned hazardous. The park had to be shut down to prevent any accident,” said Nandini Chakravarty, managing director of mining electrical equipment manufacturing firm Mine Line Pvt Ltd that has been looking after the park and the water body as part of its corporate social responsibility programme for a decade and a half. The subsidence that was first noticed around three years ago has increased due to heavy rain this year. Conceived by Kolkata Improvement Trust (KIT), the agency that has been merged with KMDA, Indrani Park was set around a 3.5bigha waterbody. Jadavpur University civil engineering department created it in 2006. Chakravarty’s company that is located in the vicinity took over its maintenance. The manicured lawns and flowerbeds of the park is a contrast with the natural wilderness around the water body, making the latter a perfect biodiversity hotspot. “I have a clear view of the Indrani Park water body from my room. Not only does it act as a filter for the traffic noise and fumes on the main road in front, it is a balm for tired eyes. I can look up from my desk to see kingfishers, night herons, ducks and swans, wild parrots and lots of fish. We study about the importance of preserving the civic ecological balance through the maintenance of water bodies, and I can see why guarding these spaces is so vital,” said Modern High School Class X student Debashmi Chakrabarti. The park has received the agri-horticultural prize for best maintained park in its category for four years in a row. Now the park needs help. KMDA officials said they were aware of the issue. “We have discussed it with KIT and are looking into the matter. The park is under KIT, which has now come under KMDA board. It first needs to be sorted out as to which agency will take up the work. It may not require more than Rs 4 lakh-Rs 5 lakh but an estimate will have to be prepared and placed before the government for approval and clearance. This will take time,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/subsidence-hit-south-kolkata-oasis-cries-for-urgent-repairs/articleshow/85933855.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Faizabad district was renamed Ayodhya by the Yogi government in 2018. Calling it a polarisation tactic of the Hyderabadi politician and an insult to Ayodhya, seers on Saturday threatened to stop his rally under the aegis of ‘Shoshit Vanchit Samaj Sammelan’, if Faizabad was not dropped from posters. Owaisi is scheduled to address a public meeting at Rudauli, a Muslim-dominated constituency 40km off Ramjanmabhoomi, on September 7 after a visit to the shrine of an 18th century Sufi saint. Mahant Raju Das of Hanumangarhi said, “Why is Owaisi renaming Ayodhya as Faizabad? We condemn his communal ideology and demand removal of the posters.” Mahant Paramhans Das of Tapasvi Chavni mutt said, “Owaisi’s anti-Hindu move is also an insult to chief minister Yogi Adityanath. If posters bearing the name Faizabad are not removed, Owaisi’s entry in Ayodhya would be barred and the public meeting at Rudauli will be disrupted.” One of the oldest plaintiffs in the Ayodhya title suit, Iqbal Ansari, too condemned the Owaisi’s political inroads into Ayodhya. “Muslims should be cautious about Owaisi, who should stick to Hyderabad and not play with the sentiments of lakhs of Muslims in Uttar Pradesh. I appeal to the people not be influenced by his polarisation tactics.” AIMIM district president Shahnawaz Siddiqui said, “We are habituated to calling Faizabad by its old name. It takes time for the new name to sink in. This is a minor issue and should not be blown out of proportion.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-seers-vow-to-stop-owaisi-entry/articleshow/85937789.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

Firstly, he made a 2-BHK promise to the poor but did not deliver it. He promised three acres of land to poor Dalits, did not give it. KCR backtracked from his word of making a Dalit as the CM. The previous Congress government brought SC/ST sub-plan but KCR did not spend the total budget allocated for it and the list is long,” said former deputy chief minister Damodar Raja Narasimha while addressing a dandora meeting at Khairatabad. He along with AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan appealed to the people, especially Dalits, not to fall into the ‘election stunts’ trap of KCR who has now unveiled the Dalit Bandhu scheme with an eye to win the bypoll to Huzurabad Assembly constituency. “Congress cadres should educate Dalits and Girijans about KCR’s election stunts. If we work hard for the next two years, Congress will come to power in Telangana,” said Raja Narasimha. Sravan said KCR was promising that he would give Rs 10 lakh to every Dalit family. But in the last seven years, while 9.15 lakh SCs/STs applied for loans through SC/ST corporation, just 1.05 lakh beneficiaries were given loans. “While Rs 6,491 crore was allocated to SC/ST finance corporation just Rs 2,246 crore was spent. How can a CM who did not even disburse Rs 10,000 to poor families who lost all their belongings and homes in GHMC due to floods will give Rs 10 lakh for every Dalit family,” Sravan asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dont-fall-for-kcrs-election-stunts-cong/articleshow/85937787.cms||---

She however stressed on that the female sex workers (FSWs) working in the area should have been rehabilitated before such action.The police are under fire from the various NGOs working for FSWs along with some political leaders and social workers for their action to close all establishments in the area to prevent prostitution.“We had a meeting in this regard in Mumbai where the issue was discussed in detail. We have also talked to the city police. Their action is completely justified considering the fact that minors were forced into prostitution. They must be appreciated for the way they handled the situation,” she said.Thakur, who is also Amravati’s guardian minister, added that forcing minor girls into flesh trade must be immediately stopped and condemned. “We all know that prostitution business was going on in the area since several years. Their activities must be curbed but in a proper way. My only objection to the police move is that they should have kept rehabilitation plan for the sex workers ready before stopping their illegal activities,” she said.The Teosa MLA stressed that the officials from the home department and her ministry should have sat together and prepared a plan to settle the inhabitants from that area. “If the women are minors, we need to take care of them. Their rehabilitation is a big issue, but we can’t leave them to fend on their own. I have heard that the police are not stopping them from doing their other activities and even allowing them to collect their belongings, which is a good sign,” she said.The minister’s statement came as big endorsement for commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar and his team, who are facing the brunt of criticism from leaders like NCP’s urban cell president Jwala Dhote, author activist Aruna Sabane, social worker Sunil Chokhare and Raje Mudhoji Bhosale. Several protests had taken place under Dhote’s leadership by the CSWs, who demanded to reopen their establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/min-applauds-police-move-to-seal-ganga-jamuna/articleshow/85933867.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Uttam, along with railway officials, visited the Miryalaguda railway station and Thipparthi railway underpass—which was flooded—and asked them to upgrade the passenger facilities in the station on a war-footing. He urged the railway authorities to ensure that all the main trains are halted on platform number one and not platform number two, as the approach to platform-2 is difficult for women, aged and specially challenged. The Congress MP asked senior officials to send proposals for construction of new quarters to the Railway Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uttam-allot-1-min-stop-at-miryalguda/articleshow/85937795.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Haryana firm MD fled to Nepal after NHAI consultant murder, say Jaipur cops||JAIPUR: City police claimed on Saturday that Karandeep Sheoran (29), the chief accused in the murder of a National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) project consultant, had immediately shifted to Nepal after the crime. The managing director of a highway construction company, Sheoran, was arrested with three others on Friday for plotting the murder of consultant, Rajinder Kumar Chawla. Additional commissioner police, crime, Ajay Pal Lamba, said that Sheoran had moved to Nepal after Chawla’s murder where his company had also undertaken some projects. Police added that the accused had got the whiff that police were on his trail. “He went to Nepal sometime around August 29. And returned on September 1,” said additional DCP, west, Ram Singh. Sources said that pressure was mounting on Sheoran when cops had sifted through multiple files and learned that his company’s representatives were present in the meeting with Chawla in Jaipur on August 26. Police claimed that Chawla had raised multiple objections due to which Sheoran’s company wanted to move away from the construction of 14 foot-overbridges (FoBs) on the Jaipur-Delhi national highway 8. According to DCP, west, Richa Tomar, the accused could not move out easily because there are rules which stipulates that no party can unliterary step down. Police said that attempts were made to first “win over” Chawla. But he remained adamant on strict adherence to rules and technical conditions specified in the tender. “Chawla was an astute civil engineer. Having worked as superintendent engineer with the Haryana government, he was technically very competent. Sheoran’s men found it difficult to counter Chawla’s technical objections,” an official said, adding that Chawla was very methodical in his approach and even chided Sheoran once in a meeting. “All these made the accused exasperated, but arguments over extension of time to complete the projects proved to be the last straw following which it was decided by the conspirators to bump off Chawla,” the official said, adding that it was also a way to send a message to other consultants. Meanwhile, the four accused were taken to a local court which sent them to seven-day police remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/haryana-firm-md-fled-to-nepal-after-nhai-consultant-murder/articleshow/85937791.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Groundwater pits leading to seepage in mkt basement’||New Delhi: Traders of Nehru Place have complained to the authority about the recently-constructed groundwater recharge pits leading to seepage in their basements. They argued that the work, which was part of the ongoing redevelopment project, was implemented without soil testing of the area and no experts’ opinion and technical knowledge. The officials, however, contradicted the claims and clarified that the drawings for all projects here (including rainwater harvesting) are approved by IIT and thus no question arises about the technical glitches in the project. Inder Kohli, member of Nehru Place Traders Association (NPTA), said that the pits should have been constructed at least 10 feet below the basement level. “The area is located at the foothill of Aravali and ideally, proper soil testing should have been conducted before. Because as of now, when the pits are 10 feet deep, the rainwater is percolating in basements rather than the ground,” said Kohli. Traders also pointed out that the missing drainage system in the area is adding to the nuisance, especially during rains. “Either there is no drain or it has been damaged at places. We also doubt that these are connected into the DJB lines, which is another cause for waterlogging,” said Jitender Kumar Gupta, Chairman, NPTA. Traders said that there are 110 buildings in the area and after waterlogging in the basement, the power supply is often discontinued to avoid incidents. “Even in the last rain, 20 towers faced this issue resulting in losses of office hours,” said Gupta. DDA officials said that they agree with the traders’ concerns and on their request also visited their offices where waterlogging happened in basements. “But there are multiple reasons for waterlogging in basements including choking of sewer lines (belonging to DJB) as well as chambers of under-constructed rainwater harvesting pits. The staff from DJB even came to do some cleaning work later and from our side, we are also making efforts. We have asked for 10-12 days to address all issues from our side,” said a DDA official on the condition of anonymity. Officials said that due to heavy downpour on Wednesday-Thursday, flooding happened all over the city, markets and residential areas as the civic amenities could not take so much pressure. Explaining the problem, another official associated with the project said, “The work for constructing rainwater harvesting pits is in process and these are yet to be connected and cleaned properly at places. Traders need to understand that rainwater takes time to percolate at a certain speed and increasing depth won’t accelerate the process,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/groundwater-pits-leading-to-seepage-in-mkt-basement/articleshow/85935870.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Chandigarh||Plastic ban: Chandigarh asks depts to submit monthly action taken report||CHANDIGARH: The UT administration has asked different enforcement departments of the municipal corporation and health department to submit monthly progress report of action taken against violators of the Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules, 2016. UT administration has banned single-use plastic to preserve the environment and make Chandigarh plastic-free. A senior UT official said instructions to the effect were issued during a recent review meeting. Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) officials also informed their seniors about the recent meeting of stakeholders. To sensitise the health superintendent, chief sanitary inspector and sanitary inspectors about the notification of the UT administration issued on September 27, 2019, CPCC officials held a meeting last week, in which the notification and its amendments on complete ban of identified single-use plastic/thermocol items were discussed. Authorities requested people to refrain from using any of the banned single-use plastic items. As the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is keeping an eye on disposal of plastic items and waste, the Chandigarh administration notified the plastic ban in the city in 2019. Last year, on the demand of manufacturers, the UT administration removed three plastic items from the list of banned articles. The administration kept plastic refill pouch having quantity less than 500ml; straws attached with tetra packs and multilayered packaging used for food/snacks packing, under extended producer responsibility (EPR) instead of the ban list. In September 2019, UT administration banned plastic plates, cups, party bloopers, plastic ribbons and many other single use plastic items in the city. After getting approval of former Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator V P Singh Badnore, the UT administration issued the final notification to ban all one-time-use plastic products. In July 2019, the UT issued a draft notification and sought suggestions and objections from people within 60 days. The committee received around 32 objections, including those from different resident welfare associations, traders and industrialist organisations. The administration took these steps after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed it to submit its action plan on systematic disposal of plastic waste. The NGT had ordered that any person found using, storing, purchasing, dealing with or distributing plastic bags, plastic plates or plastic glasses and such allied items shall be liable to pay environmental compensation at the rate of Rs 5,000 per event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/plastic-ban-ut-asks-depts-to-submit-monthly-action-taken-report/articleshow/85933844.cms||---

The police recorded 6,712 such cases last year, while 1,442 violations were registered till March 31 this year. A majority of the violations — 70% or 1047 cases — occurred due to loudspeakers and public announcement systems not adhering to the prescribed noise standards. The cops also stated that construction equipment were the second biggest source of noise pollution in Delhi, with 273 cases registered so far this year, followed by 99 cases where generator sets were not following noise norms. The report states while Delhi Police acted on violators, the traffic police also issued fines for noise pollution on roads. The capital recorded a total of 2,883 fines from January 1 till March 31, 2021, out of which 2,070 were for modified exhausts and silencers. A total of 560 fines were, meanwhile, issued against the use of pressure horns, 224 for playing loud music in vehicles and 29 fines against blowing horns in silent zones. To register noise-related complaints, Delhi government has set up both a website, as well as a helpline number. While online complaints can be submitted on Ngms.delhi.gov.in, people can also call the helpline number 155271 for noise-related violations. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) recently notified a new set of fine limits for noise-related violations, which could go up to Rs 1 lakh, if the prescribed noise standards are not adhered to. While the use of loudspeakers or public address systems beyond permissible limits could attract a fine of Rs 10,000, DG sets that are too loud could bring a fine of Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Loud construction equipment can meanwhile attract a fine of Rs 50,000, while there is a fine of Rs 1,000 if firecrackers being burst are not adhering to the fixed limits. A senior DPCC official said they were in the process of compiling data for the rest of 2021, which includes the latest fines. “Once compiled, we will know the biggest sources and whether or not the increase in the fines has reduced the number of cases or not,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/70-noise-pollution-sparked-by-loudspeakers-public-announcement-systems-submit-police/articleshow/85935908.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Doctor in judicial custody for forging Smriti Irani’s signatures||LUCKNOW: A dental surgeon was sent to jail in judicial custody by a court in Sultanpur for allegedly forging signatures of Union minister Smriti Irani on a fake document related to the appointment of international shooter Vartika Singh as a member of the National Women’s Commission (NCW). The court proceedings came in connection with the November 23, 2020 FIR lodged by Vijay Gupta, an aide of Irani, Union minister for women and child welfare. In the FIR, lodged with the Musafirkhana police station in Amethi, Gupta had accused Vartika and former Congress MP Kamal Kishore Commando of circulating prima facie bogus documents on social media to malign the image of the Union minister. In the documents, Vartika Singh had alleged that Gupta had duped her of Rs 25 lakh assuring her appointment as a member of the NCW through the minister. Inspector Parshuram Ojha told TOI that during investigations, it came to the fore that the documents circulated by Vartika with the help of the former MP, were actually prepared by a dental surgeon Dr Rajnish Kumar in connivance with Vartika with the intention to target the image of the Union minister. “We had filed a chargesheet against Vartika and Dr Kumar under charges of dishonesty, forgery, forgery of valuable documents,” said Ojha. Once the chargesheet was filed Dr Kumar reportedly went underground after which police approached the court seeking a non-bailable warrant against him. Ojha said that on Friday, the dentist surrendered before court as police had mounted pressure by initiating proceedings to attach his property. Dr Kumar appeared before court of special judge MP / MLA PK Jayant which sent him to judicial custody till September 17. Meanwhile, Vartika has also filed a petition in the court stating she is also a victim in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/doctor-in-judicial-custody-for-forging-iranis-signatures/articleshow/85937802.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

The Highway Virodhi Kruti Samiti wants the Nagpur-Ratnagiri highway diverted via the Wathar-Warna Nagar-Borpadale route. The local residents fear that the new highway route via Shiye will further contribute to heavy flooding in the city and the adjoining villages. A meeting of residents was held at the Nigwe Dumala village in the Karveer taluka along with other party members. Addressing the meeting, former MLA Chandradeep Narke said: “A proper study was not done during the layout mapping of the highway. If the national highway is created in the Shiye region, then the risk of flooding in Kasba Bawda and other city areas will increase. Therefore, we don’t want this road.” He also said that a rail route and a ring road are proposed along this areas. As a result, the farmers will not be left with any farmland here. “The highway authorities are making false promises to the villagers and farmers. The way we had wiped out the toll plazas, we will similarly wipe out the plans of this highway,” said Sanjay Pawar, the Shiv Sena district president. “The Nagpur-Ratnagiri highway should be diverted via the existing Wathar-Borpadale route, instead of creating a new route from Shiye to Kerli village,” he said. Manik Shinde, a member of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, said, “We know on whose directions these highway authority officers are working. If the highway work does not stop, we will torch their cars.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/villagers-want-nagpur-ratnagiri-highway-diverted/articleshow/85932065.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The arterial road —connecting BT Road with Dum Dum Road — was lying in disuse because a motor parts market had encroached upon a major portion the 30ft wide road. The encroachments have now been removed and the road has been prepared for traffic movement. “We wanted to remove the encroachments and divert vehicles to Dum Dum Road. With the repair of a culvert on Dum Dum Road leading to bus services being terminated between Dum Dum station to Nagerbazar, we wanted to divert even some auto routes through this new road so that commuters have an alternative to travel to different parts of Kolkata,” said an officer. The road will ease the pressure on BT Road considerably. As a first step, cops approached the market shop owners. “We were delighted when they voluntarily agreed to remove all encroachments when we explained to them the road situation,” said an officer. The help from civic agencies, thereafter, in the next step made it easier,” said the officer. “To ease south-bound traffic of BT Road, this arterial road will be of great help. This road was not motorable earlier owing to the Phoolbagan motor parts market. At present, we have made the road encroachment-free. The width of the road after repairs will be 30 feet. This road connects B T Road and Dum Dum Road via Samar Sarani (Radio Galli). One can also avail Samar Sarani for South Sinthee Road to reach Dum Dum station. Sinthee police station may also be reached through this road,” explained an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/old-route-revived-to-take-traffic-load-off-bt-road/articleshow/85933893.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The notification has left behind a substantial question on the livelihood of around 1,000-1,500 sex workers here.Though the imposition of the notification under ITPA has returned the horror of similar high-handedness of police in 2015 when sex workers had to resort to stir under social activists like late Jambuwantrao Dhote for their livelihood, CP Kumar refuted their claims of being thrown out of profession. “Their premises are good enough for alternative businesses or trades rather than running them as brothels with number of women helping their keepers and owners earn illegal profit,” he said. “The arguments of compulsion and insistence of retaining the buildings necessarily as brothels as the only means of survival is something incomprehensible,” said the top cop.In the meantime, it's learnt the sex workers have informally had a meeting among themselves insisting each other to ensure no minors could be found by cops or solicitation on roads. Sources also stated that some of the younger generations of the sex workers have moved out fearing police action.Police are also keeping a vigil on the movements of the auto-rickshaws after receiving tip-off that some women are going out to meet clients elsewhere.It’s learnt senior police officers are set to meet the sex workers for a mutual discussion soon to help the needy ones get rehabilitated on their consents. “Customers for sex work would not be allowed. The sex workers can seek any other help for which we are open to extend assistance,” said a senior officer from Lakadganj police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/barricades-removed-prohibitory-notification-stays-at-ganga-jamuna/articleshow/85933885.cms||Soumitra Bose

After the video of the incident went viral on social media, city police top brass issued a warning to citizens against fuelling tension or spreading misinformation over the issue on social media platforms.Sources said that a group of students from a particular community were found at Walker’s Street requesting girls from different communities to experience covering their faces with a hijab (veil) or naqab. On World Hijab Day, which is celebrated every year on February 1, women who wear veil or naquab appeal to their counterparts across religions to experience the same.The students ran into a rough weather when some walkers started confronting them. Though some girls, claiming to be from different community, stated to have worn hijab on their own will, the argument started reaching a high pitch. In the meantime, a rightist outfit too reached Sadar police station to alert cops after some residents raised a hue and cry. The outfit termed the incident as an attempt at conversation.Cops from Sadar police station too rushed to the Walker’s Street but by then both the groups had dispersed.In a video taken by an eye-witness, which has gone viral, he can be heard saying that the women in veils had rushed towards Ramgiri, the chief minister’s bungalow, to flee with some men waiting on scooters and bikes. The registration numbers of the vehicles were shared with police.A walker even wrenched a pamphlet, having the names of Jamat-e-Islami Hind (North west) and Girls Islamic Organizations (GIO) on it, from one the students. It was later handed over to police. “We are investigating the incident,” said senior inspector Vinod Choudhury of Sadar police station.Sources stated that police, along with the intelligence agencies, are now questioning a few people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/students-found-asking-girls-for-hijab-trial-at-walkers-street/articleshow/85933927.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Nagpur||One discharged, five patients sent to AIIMS from MLA CCC||Nagpur: On Saturday, the first person to be placed in institutional isolation as per new rules was discharged from MLA Covid care centre after he his second swab, which was collected 10 days after first one, tested negative. The man was placed in institutional isolation on August 25 after Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) stopped home isolation for asymptomatic Covid patients. The man has been advised home isolation of another seven days, officials said.Five patients had to be shifted to AIIMS Nagpur as they developed mild symptoms. Some had fever, cough and hypertension. As a result, they no longer could be kept at the CCC.Now, the CCC has around 15 patients with around three more admissions taking place on Saturday evening. Though over 14 persons have tested positive in the last three days, the civic zonal teams have allowed home isolation under exemption rules of the revised policy. Asymptomatic bedridden people and pregnant women are given exemption from institutional isolation.Those admitted at the CCC have to stay there till their second RTPCR sample tests negative. The patients developing symptoms are shifted to AIIMS-Nagpur from where they can opt for private hospital as per availability, nodal officer Dr Varsh Deosthale said.Second samples of three more patients were collected on Saturday and the results will determine their discharge. Dr Deosthale said that saline gargle RTPCR swab samples are also collected from patients soon after admission at the CCC.The NMC has tied up with CSIR-Neeri’s environmental virology lab to conduct genomic sequencing of these patients. Samples of not only these patients but also of those who were testing positive in groups are being placed under the surveillance to keep a tab on new variants.So far, Neeri has reported only Delta variants and sub lineages. Ahead of the second wave, the lab had conducted whole genome sequencing and reported the Delta variant which was behind acceleration of cases in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/one-discharged-five-patients-sent-to-aiims-from-mla-ccc/articleshow/85933895.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

There is no clarity whether the NMC or the NIT is the planning authority for land situated under green belt schemes.On January 1, TOI had highlighted the plight of 317 families unable to build houses on their plots due to an overhead water tank on the approved road and a road on plots by the NIT in the layout of Crown Co-operative Plot Holders’ Association in Chinchbhuvan six years ago. The plot owners were running pillar to post to get NIT’s mistakes rectified. The state government withdrew powers of the NIT as a planning authority in August 2019. After that, the issue shifted to NMC which said it would take time to find a way out.“Officials of the NMC’s town planning department visited the layout and suggested shifting the road to an adjacent area. It was the responsibility of the NIT to shift the road but it did not paid heed. The problem was solved after we collected funds and constructed a new road,” one of the office bearers of the society told TOI.“NIT had approved a road adjacent to the public utility (PU) land in the layout. The NIT did not measure the exact area of the PU land as the entire layout was vacant. The NIT constructed an overhead water tank on some part of the PU land and the approved road. As the tank is a giant structure, it cannot be demolished or shifted. The road needs to be shifted so that it does not affect the plots. We submitted a revised layout plan showing the road in another place but NMC officials are saying the government has given back powers of the planning authority to the NIT in February. NMC officials say they don’t know whether to send the case back to NIT or to revise the plan,” added the office bearer.NMC officials say the layout comes under the Green Belt scheme and was regularized by the NIT. “The government again made NIT the planning authority for seven schemes and Gunthewari areas that need regularization. It’s not clear whether Green Belt areas too were given back to the NIT. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B wrote to the government seeking clarification on the planning authority for Green Belt areas,” they said.IN A NUTSHELL* 317-plot layout * Road approved adjacent to PU land* NIT constructs overhead water tank * Tank also covers approved road* NIT constructs approach road * Road built on 16 plots* NMC made planning authority in 2019* Suggests shifting road made by plot owners * Says no clarity on authority||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-nit-dispute-prolongs-dreams-of-317-families-to-construct-houses/articleshow/85933905.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The Mumbai Naka police have registered a case of accidental death. The deceased has been identified as Rupesh Gaikwad, a resident of Rane Nagar. Gaikwad’s body was found in the storeroom of the hotel in the Mumbai Naka area. Fireman Sham Raut, of the Shingada Talav fire station, said they received a call around 12.15 am on Saturday. One fire-tender was rushed to the spot and another reached after some time. The storeroom had only one exit for ventilation and was filled with smoke. The firemen initially extinguished the blaze using the fire extinguishers available at the spot, and later used water to completely douse it. At this time, the body was still undiscovered. However, after an hour of the firemen leaving the spot, they got a call that a body was spotted in the room concerned. Raut said the hotel staff was told to report the matter to the police. Raut said since the lights were off and the entire room was filled with smoke, they had not been able to see Gaikwad’s body there. Senior PI of the Mumbai Naka police station Bhagirath Deshmukh said there was no foul play suspected in the death of the chef. He had died from suffocation. He may have fallen down while trying to escape and the goods in the storeroom may have fallen on him, hiding his body. Nonetheless, an accidental death case will be investigated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/chef-dies-in-nashik-city-hotels-storeroom-fire/articleshow/85932071.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cops conduct safe ride crash course for delivery boys||KOLKATA: The Kolkata traffic police has been focusing on two-wheelers during the Road Safety Week. East, Beliaghata and Jorabagan traffic guards offered crash course to courier and food delivery boys on how to ride safe at odd hours when they tend to speed on empty roads. Some of the delivery staff who have warehouses in Dhapa were even taken to various accident prone zones on EM Bypass and explained why speeding and lane jumping can prove fatal. The Beliaghata traffic guard said its course included an interaction with delivery agents. “We know that they race against time. They work under tight deadlines and often end up flouting norms. However, we shared with them incidents and related photographs that showed how a small mistake can cost them their lives,” said an officer.  At the East traffic guard, the onus was on safe lane riding. All these bikers were asked to take up a lane riding challenge and those successfully completing were handed a token of appreciation. Many two-wheeler riders travelling through the Park Circus seven-point crossing in south Kolkata on Friday were stopped and asked to drive through an 80-metre-long and eight-inch-wide lane as part of a small test. “Almost 40% of all accidents involving bikers take place due to illegal lane jumping. The delivery boys are sometimes forced to take risks. We tried telling them that taking risks were not worth it,” explained an officer. Several other neighbouring guards, like south and south east, have pledged to run such awareness classes at least once a week. “We know that they work under a tight deadline. But that cannot be an excuse to break rules and put their lives at risk,” said an officer from Lalbazar. Several traffic guards in areas with restaurants have decided to write to companies asking them to consider the actual road condition before setting deadlines to its delivery boys. “Suppose there is more fog at night, the speed at that time cannot be same as that of a clear night,” explained an officer. The Jorabagan traffic guard, which too, held a Safe Drive Save Life campaign got minister Sashi Panja and actor Paoli Dam to stress on how two-wheeler accidents have claimed over a thousand lives in the city. Joint CP (traffic) Santosh Pandey was also present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-conduct-safe-ride-crash-course-for-delivery-boys/articleshow/85933933.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

While Jalgaon district administered 99,184 doses of Covid vaccine, Nashik vaccinated 67,452 beneficiaries on Saturday. The previous highest number of doses administered on a single day was on September 1, when 78,352 doses were administered in Jalgaon and 59,959 doses in Nashik. “Our system for conducting vaccination sessions is well set now. Moreover, there is no vaccine hesitancy among the beneficiaries. All the 265 vaccine centres in the district have been instructed to finish their daily allotment of the doses on that day,” said Jalgaon district collector Abhijit Raut. According to him, Jalgaon district is capable of administering over 1.5 lakh doses per day if there is greater availability of the vaccine. Ganesh Misal, the vaccination programme coordinator of Nashik and deputy collector, said the improved availability of the vaccine coupled with huge keenness among the beneficiaries to get their shots is leading to the increase in the daily vaccination numbers. Ahmednagar district also registered a significant number of doses administered on Saturday by vaccinating 61,880 people. In the meantime, the state health department has requested all the five districts of the region to go all out to further enhance the pace of vaccination. Dr P D Gandal, the deputy director (Nashik division) of the state health department, said with greater availability of vaccines, the pace of vaccination in all five districts have improved significantly. “We have requested these five districts to further enhance the pace depending on the vaccine availability so that more beneficiaries can be brought under the vaccination coverage,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/jalgaon-nashik-dists-record-highest-single-day-vax-figures/articleshow/85932121.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Nashik||MUHS likely to declare PG exam results by month-end||Nashik: The Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) is likely to announce the results of the postgraduate (allopathy) and super speciality offline exams early. As many as 2,500 students, including 2,300 in PG (allopathy) course, are appearing for the exams, which started on August 16. While the theory papers are over, the practical exams will be concluding on September 9. The varsity’s move on the issue is to make more specialised doctors available in Maharashtra since the health experts have predicted a third wave of the pandemic. The varsity’s acting vice chancellor, Nitin Karmalkar, is guiding the examination department to declare the results early. MUHS sources said that under the norms, once the exams (including the practical) gets over, the examination department has to declare the results within 45 days. “The examination department has a deadline of October 24 for declaring the results. But the department is likely to announce the results by the end of this month,” a top varsity official said. The varsity’s controller of examination, Dr Ajit Pathak, told TOI that his department is making all efforts to declare the results much before the stipulated deadline. MUHS sources maintained that it is a ‘challenging task’ for the examination department to declare the results much before the deadline as the answer scripts have to be brought to the varsity from various exam centres and then send them to the different examiners for evaluation. Each answer script has to be evaluated twice by two different examiners. “The assessment of the answer scripts of the exams held on August 16 and 18 is over. The examiners would complete the evaluation of the answer scripts of the exams that were held on August 20 and 23. We have requested the examiners to complete the evaluation as early as possible so that the varsity can declare the results early,” added a MUHS official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/muhs-likely-to-declare-pg-exam-results-by-month-end/articleshow/85932135.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

We have been repeatedly raising the issue that the RFID sensors at toll plazas are not working at several places and collection is done in cash in areas such as Kalindi Kunj, Gurgaon (NH-8) and Rajokri (where some work is going on), Ghazipur and Noida toll). In fact, there have been instances where the amount is taken in cash and later it’s also deducted from the account when the vehicles cross the toll and no SMS is received by users,” said Sanjay Samrat, president of Delhi Taxi, Tourist Transport Association. He added that even the officials accepted some glitches in the system and assured to address them soon. “To resolve the matter and minimise chaos, we demand attaching the RFID to FASTag accounts, if no alternative is possible,” said Samrat. During the meeting with the additional commissioner, SDMC, on Friday, taxi operators also claimed that taxis are making multiple trips in NCR in a day and thus a charge of Rs 100 as toll tax every time they cross is not justified. A senior SDMC official said that they are working on certain points but the system aims to help everyone and avoid jams at toll points. “They have to understand that the system is for their benefit also as they don’t need to stand in queues to pay cash toll,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rfid-transport-unions-seek-no-hassle-recharge/articleshow/85936003.cms||Vibha Sharma

Bhujbal said currently 26.42 lakh people in the district have taken either the first shot or both the shots. In a bid to vaccinate more people, plans are afoot to set up more vaccination centres, he said. Over the past couple of months, a large number of people are registering or rushing to the vaccination centres to get inoculated. Meanwhile, the pace of the vaccine supply has also improved due to which the district administration is confident that more centres could ease the rush at the existing centres. However, Bhujbal said the drop in Covid cases was not as sharp as it was witnessed earlier. He said that in a month, active Covid cases have dropped by approximately 100. As on September 3, the number of active cases in the district stood at 978 as against 1,076 on August 5. Among other things, he also said 22 medical oxygen plants, which work on Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA), are proposed to be set up at various government facilities in Nashik city. Of these, the work of 13 is completed while the remaining nine are in the process of installation.

Sagnik Sinha, a BTech graduate, suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. The 30-year-old had a job in an IT company, but lost it due to the illness. Now in a rehab centre with West Bengal Forum for Mental Health for about two years, the Salt Lake resident has bagged a job as a probationary officer in a nationalised bank. “I am loving this process of making a drone and trying to fly it. It is a wonderful feeling and I will keep this as a hobby,” said Sinha. The organisation that deals with people with different mental health issues conducted assessments to determine the kind of creative activity each person can be engaged in as part of the therapy. Sinha, along with Abhirup Nag (15) and Jyotishman Biswas (23), were chosen to be trained in making drones. While Nag suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Biswas suffers from autism spectrum disorder and OCD. “Someday, I want to set up a school where children like me will be taught how to make drones,” said Abhirup, a Behala resident. “Parents should not brood if their kids have mental health issues.

The department had considered applications of 9,838 students in round II of CAP. However, seats could not be allotted to 5,200 students due to technical reasons, including errors in the filled-up admission forms. The cut-off for admissions in the top 8-10 colleges of the city in round II of CAP was around 90% in the science stream, about 89% in the commerce stream and roughly 74% in the arts stream. Apart from the state board students, the department has received applications from students of other boards like CBSE, ICSE etc. This year, over 25,000 seats are available for first-year junior college admissions in 60 colleges and in the first CAP round last week, more than 7,900 students were allotted seats in all streams.

As the faculty opened the door of its exhibition hall that was closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with a pictorial tribute to the teachers who were instrumental in shaping the faculty which has made Vadodara known as a major arts hub. The show — Pathfinders — was inaugurated on Saturday jointly by Padma Shri awardee professor Jyoti Bhatt and former dean Vijay Bagodi. “The show is a collection of 44 portrait photographs of the former teachers of our faculty right from its inception in 1950,” said Dr Jayaram Poduval, officiating dean of the faculty. The photographs included that of the first dean professor Markand Bhatt who was entrusted with the responsibility of creation and formation of the faculty by MSU’s first vice-chancellor (VC) Hansa Mehta. If royalty of Baroda had patronized the idea of setting up a world-class residential university in Vadodara, it was Mehta, who as founder vice-chancellor ensured that the university branches out in the faculty of fine arts with the support of teachers like Bhatt. Interestingly, most of the photographs displayed at the exhibition were taken by professor Jyoti Bhatt during his students days and later as a teacher serving at the faculty. The photographs also include many Padma awardees that the faculty has gifted to the country like late professor K G Subramanian, who was fondly known as ‘Mani sir’; late Bhupen Khakhar; professor Gulam Mohammed Sheikh; Sadashiv Gorashkar and G R Santosh as well as that of professor Jyoti Bhatt. “We felt this is an apt time to organise such an exhibition as many of the senior teachers who studied under the pioneering teachers are finishing their service and the new generation have to take inspiration from these pioneers whom we lovingly call – Pathfinders,” said Poduval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msu-salutes-teachers-who-made-vadodara-an-art-hub/articleshow/85934991.cms||Prashant Rupera

So, the chance of a third wave due to Delta is low,’’ said Dr Awate. Experts said the third wave would be huge only if a new variant emerges with the high transmissibility of the Delta variant. “However, there is no indication from recent genome surveillance reports that a Delta-like variant will come about,’’ the state government’s chief epidemiologist said. The second wave is under control, with the test positivity rate in all districts under 5% for the last five weeks. “However, from H1N1 experience, we know it takes a few years for a disease to become endemic. There is no way to predict when exactly the Covid-19 pandemic will be downgraded to endemic level,’’ he said. The state public health department, along with district administration officials, prepared a detailed plan to tackle the possible third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3rd-wave-may-skip-maharashtra-but-1-5-times-upgrade-is-on/articleshow/85936228.cms||---

Traffic officers will be deployed at pickets for the purpose even as special teams will keep an eye on driving under the influence. Muktesh Chander, special commissioner of police (Traffic), said that since the city had largely reopened and bars and restaurants were back in business, it was necessary to rein in intoxicated drivers. However, given the Covid situation, special care will be taken to prevent infection. “We will use disposal pipes for breathalysers with a new one used every time,” revealed Chander. “We had to stop testing people for alcohol levels when Covid broke out because this required being in close contact with a driver. Now, since cases have reduced and people are out partying, it is important to keep a check.” In 2019, around 36,000 people were prosecuted for driving under the influence, but Covid restrictions brought the figure down to 3,000 in 2020 and a mere 300 this year. For the first couple of weeks of the drive, there will be surprise checks on weekdays with stricter prosecutions on weekends. Senior traffic police officers said that since people had started venturing out of their house for late-night parties and for recreation and dining, unlike during the days when the coronavirus infection was rife, there was a need to prevent people from driving in an intoxicated state. “The crowd is back at the bars and pubs mainly because the virus infection load has gone down in the city,” pointed out a traffic officer. “That is why we thought starting the drive to haul up drivers for excess alcohol consumption beginning on the weekends should be fine. All Covid-19 safety precautions will be taken. All officers at the checkpoints have been asked to keep an adequate number of breath analyser pipes, hand sanitisers and masks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-opens-up-cops-all-set-to-restart-drunk-driving-checks/articleshow/85934428.cms||Sakshi Chand

---||Nagpur||‘20-year vision plan for Tadoba to give more space to tigers’||Conservator of forests (CF) & field director Dr Jitendra Ramgaokar (40) is an IFS officer of the 2006 batch. A veterinarian by education and training, he heads the over 1,700 sqkm Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). The park is preparing a ‘Vision-2020-40’ document with the support of all stakeholders to address a host of problems pertaining to the tiger district of Chandrapur. A maiden workshop of stakeholders was held recently at Tadoba to hold preliminary discussions and more such meetings will be organized to finalize the document. In an exclusive interview with TOI, Ramgaokar talks about the pros and cons and the plan in place. Excerpts...  Q. With Tadoba already having an exhaustive tiger conservation plan (TCP), how did the need for ‘Vision 2020-2040’ come about? A: It’s true that a government-approved comprehensive TCP for 2016-26 is in place, but most of the data is from 2010-14. Over the years things have changed rapidly, especially the population of tigers and leopards and the resultant rise in human-wildlife conflict. Important activities such as relocation cannot be part of a time-specific plan as it is voluntary. Also, some other aspects such as eco-development and employment generation, the carbon footprint of management activities, tourism infrastructure and diversifying ecotourism activities needed to be dealt with in much more detail with a longer horizon. With the rising aspirations of people in and around forest areas, we need to work towards meeting their aspirations and at the same time not only secure the area but to expand the inviolate areas for wildlife. This is not achievable in a short time and hence, we felt the need for guidance and new ideas from stakeholders — local communities, public representatives, wildlife managers, scientists, NGOs and media persons. We’ve received encouraging responses and we hope that we are able to put together a holistic document. We know that 20 years is a long period and considering the pace of change, it will be an adaptable document with specified areas of work and direction of efforts to be made. Q. How was this concept visualized? A. NTCA has started an exercise to evaluate the functioning of tiger conservation foundations across the country and having a long-term vision for the landscape has been considered as a sign of vibrant and purpose-oriented foundation. Taking a cue from this process, we began with the effort to make a vision document for the TATR Conservation Foundation. We are now moving in the direction of preparing a holistic vision document covering all aspects of management that will impact long-term conservation of wildlife in this landscape and people’s participation and support towards coexistence with wildlife. Q. Is only Tadoba doing it or are there other tiger reserves working on such a vision document? A. We are not aware of other tiger reserves. We at Tadoba were convinced that a guiding document with inputs from all was required to plan future management strategies. Q. Is this vision confined to Tadoba or its larger landscape? A. Tadoba today cannot be seen in isolation but as a part of a larger landscape, including territorial forests of Chandrapur, Bramhapuri, central Chanda, FDCM and Kanhargaon, Ghodazari, and Chaprala wildlife sanctuaries. At the same time, we need to focus on TATR as it is important for long-term conservation objectives of the area. Q. TATR is known for providing livelihood through tourism. After 20 years what will be the scenario? A. It’s difficult to say what will be the scenario in 2040, but our efforts shall be directed towards increasing non-forest dependent livelihoods, skill development, moving to low volume premium experience-based ecotourism activities. We would like to visualize the TATR of 2040 to be far more resourceful in terms of high-earning sustainable livelihood options. Q. But the Supreme Court in 2012 has already ruled that tourism has to be phased out from the core. A. Wildlife tourism today sustains a large number of families. Unless an alternative source is developed for all dependent communities it would be detrimental for conservation to stop tourism. We have enough understanding today about the criticality of the goodwill of people for the success of conservation. This goodwill is our biggest resource. A large part of it is due to the livelihood that wild areas offer. At the same time, we are making efforts to develop tourism in buffer and even territorial forest areas. One can imagine the pressure that would have been created on the core area had the buffer tourism not been there. Once it develops to a reasonable level and is able to benefit all dependent communities, we can move away from core areas in a phased manner. Q. Is addressing flared-up human-animal conflict part of the vision? A. Coexistence is going to be a major theme for this vision document. We are consulting all stakeholders and experts to suggest the best strategies to manage conflict situations and to reduce the direct interface between people and wildlife. Q. How will you address this issue? A: We do have some strategies that have worked for reducing conflict. We have seen that with practices that reduced dependence on forests for non-timber forest produce (NTFP), fuelwood, protection of crops without harming wildlife and promotion of non-extractive uses of forest-like ecotourism and eco-development activities, we can achieve some degree of reduction in conflict. We need to build on this experience by expanding our efforts by using modern technology to track and identify potential conflict animals, make our land-use practices less intensive, and bringing about behavioural change in people who live close to forests. Q. Is translocation and sterilization of tigers the solution to tackle conflict? A. Some ways to manage or manipulate the population will have to be tried with proper studies and experiments. For translocation to work, we need to prepare recipient areas with a good prey base and less human disturbance. At the same time, the population in the source areas, especially areas considered as unnatural habitats for tigers such as industrial areas and the vicinity of major towns, need to be controlled by adopting various modern scientific tools and techniques. We are still receiving inputs on the issue and will include appropriate suggestions in the document. Q. There are so many tigers in Tadoba and even in CSTPS, but there is no conflict? A. Tadoba is largely inviolate with low human disturbance as compared to areas like CSTPS. Naturally, there is less conflict in TATR. The CSTPS habitat is unnatural with intensive human activities. There have been incidences of conflict in such areas and it can occur in CSTPS also. Q. Can community nature conservancy (CNC) be a solution to the problems? A. There is no one thing that can be called a solution to a situation that is as complex as we see in the TATR landscape where big carnivores and people are trying to co-exist. We need to look at all possible measures that can be taken especially those which can economically benefit small and marginal farmers who depend on agricultural activities without any improvement in productivity or change in the cropping pattern. It is here that the concept of CNC comes into the picture. It has the potential to transform how people look at an agricultural land in terms of its use. With assured income from sources like ecotourism, farmers are expected to change their attitude towards wildlife in such a way that they might stop considering them as pests but as a resource. Even with CNC, we may not achieve a complete change in land use from agriculture to the forest, neither is it intended. With CNCs, we might restore those low productivity practices with a supplementary source of income in the form of tourism or in the form of payment for ecosystem services. Q. Is CNC more about benefiting private parties than communities? A. It’s a new concept and will take time for people to realize. They need to see the working models and how they can benefit. All safety measures against loss of ownership and income is in place in the policy document of the government and it should be implemented in letter and spirit by following all the due process laid out in law. Unless it is beneficial to both, farmers and private parties, the CNC concept cannot be successful. The key to success lies in identifying important areas from a conservation point of view and organizing farmers in a strong cooperative that can negotiate with private entities on mutually-beneficial agreements. Q. With land being diverted for FRA, linear and non-linear projects will there be forests to implement Vision 2040? A. The delicate balance between the demands of development and conservation interests will continue to be there. But with the new understanding of mitigation measures and strong support for its implementation before any major infrastructure project is undertaken augurs well for wildlife. I believe that in spite of enormous pressures on forest and wildlife habitats, we have been able to increase our wildlife population in the last decade which is a testimony to the better future that awaits us. The path towards that is not going to be easy and we will be required to work more to expand the strategies that have worked for conservation. There are no new encroachments that are taking place under FRA in TATR and pending claims are being expeditiously decided upon by the authorities. Q. Should the district administration and other agencies be part of implementing Vision 2040? A. Definitely. Tadoba is the pride of the district and the way TATR has come up over the years is only because of the concerted efforts of the district administration and other agencies. One of the most important aspects of our vision is going to be the creation of more inviolate space for wildlife and safe passage for wildlife wherever they need to instinctively disperse. We are aware of the role being played by all the agencies of the district when it comes to voluntarily relocating villages from the core areas of the tiger reserves. Since the vision document will be holistic involving all, it is not possible for the forest department alone to implement all aspects without support from the administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/20-year-vision-plan-for-tadoba-to-give-more-space-to-tigers/articleshow/85942901.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

This is also the 23rd time since the start of the second wave of the pandemic in Delhi that zero fatality has been reported in a day. On March 2 this year, the city saw zero deaths due to the virus. On the same day, the number of new infections stood at 217 and the positivity rate was 0.33%. The new cases took the national capital’s infection tally to 14,37,929. A total of 70,303 tests, including 48,510 RT-PCR and 21,793 rapid antigen tests, were conducted in the past 24 hours, the bulletin said. On Friday, 35 cases were recorded, while the positivity rate stood at 0.05%. On Thursday, the daily case count stood at 39 with a positivity rate of 0.06%. The death toll due to the coronavirus infection in Delhi stood at 25,082 on Tuesday. The capital had not reported any death due to the coronavirus since then. Despite the fall in daily cases in the last several days, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had cautioned that the chances of a third wave were real and asserted that his government was preparing on a “war-footing” to combat it. Delhi recently battled a brutal second wave of the pandemic that claimed several lives, with the shortage of oxygen at hospitals across the city adding to the woes. On April 20, the national capital had reported 28,395 cases, the highest in the city since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. On April 22, the case positivity rate was 36.2% — the highest so far. At 448, the highest number of deaths reported in the capital was on May 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-death-0-for-the-fourth-day-positivity-rate-a-little-up/articleshow/85936151.cms||---
---||Delhi||Birds of prey: Experts to help you identify species for vulture count||NEW DELHI: The World Wide Fund launched a two-week-long nationwide vulture count for Nature India (WWF India) on Saturday, which will see citizens being encouraged to venture out and spot vultures near them. Experts will be assisting locals in identifying vultures, with pictures to be submitted on the portal e-bird. Experts will go through the submissions in the form of photographs to identify the bird species. The count — aimed to be a citizen birding initiative will help determine the total number of endangered vulture species sighted in each state and city. Rinkita Gurav, manager for the raptor conservation programme at WWF India, said that several vulture counts had been conducted in the past to assess the vulture population after its decline in the 1990s. However, this particular count aims to involve citizens more, with nearby locations assigned to participants. “Some vulture hotspots have already been identified where certain vulture species are spotted. In addition to this list, the participants can also venture out on their own in areas where they feel they may spot them,” said Gurav. For Delhi-NCR, the identified hotspots include the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, Sultanpur National Park and Bhondsi in Haryana. WWF India said with a platform like e-Bird, it has become easier to collect bird sightings and understand the trends in the population over the years. “Over the years, hopefully, we will have enough data to understand the trend in their population as well as find out presence or absence of vultures at specific locations. This initiative will also help generate awareness amongst the general public about the current situation of vultures, bird watching and recording in general, and the use of e-Bird. Venturing out in nature for bird watching can make us patient and observant,” said an official. A recent raptor census by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) recorded 18 raptors. Conducted at the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary between 2017 and 2020, it included vulture species such as the critically endangered red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus) and the endangered Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/birds-of-prey-experts-to-help-you-identify-species-for-vulture-count/articleshow/85936248.cms||---
---||Allahabad||ACJM court rejects plea to file criminal case against Maurya||Prayagraj: The additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) on Saturday rejected an application seeking registration of a criminal case against UP’s Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya for his alleged use of fake educational degrees for contesting five elections at different places and also obtaining a petrol pump. While rejecting the application filed under Section 156 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) by a social activist Diwakar Tripathi, ACJM (Prayagraj) Namrata Singh said that prima facie no cognizable offence appears to have been committed. Hence, the application is rejected, as the same is found to be baseless and groundless. District government counsel (criminal), Gulab Chandra Agrahri informed TOI that the additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) court had on August 11, 2021 directed the police to hold a preliminary inquiry into the alleged fake degrees of the deputy CM. In the order dated August 11, the ACJM had directed the station house officer of Cantonment, Prayagraj to submit a report on certain points. Firstly, authenticity of the degree like Uttar Madhyama second year issued by the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Prayagraj to the deputy CM. Secondly, regarding the allegation of use of fake certificates by Maurya in the affidavit of elections. Besides, there should be an inquiry regarding the use of fake certificate of high school by the deputy CM to obtain a petrol pump, the order had added. Subsequently, the police after conducting inquiry had filed its report in which it was stated that none of the alleged offence took place in the jurisdiction of Cantt police station of Prayagraj. Hence, no FIR was registered by the Cantt police on the application of Tripathi. Besides, as per the report filed by police, the alleged fake degrees were not obtained by the applicant from any authentic sources, rather only the xerox copies of the documents have been filed, which were not credible evidence. Further, no complaint was filed by the applicant against Maurya before the Election Commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/acjm-court-rejects-plea-to-file-criminal-case-against-maurya/articleshow/85936188.cms||---

Following the initiative of AU’s vice-chancellor, Prof Sangita Srivastava, a dedicated team has been formed on the campus named ‘Committee for the elimination of single-use plastic’. The committee is headed by prof Sheo Mohan Prasad of the Department of Botany and regular events like awareness drives, visits to departments to motivate teachers and students to embrace a more environment-friendly style of working by shunning single-use plastics have been planned. According to the public relations officer (PRO) of AU, “Varsity administration is determined to make the campus free from single-use plastics and therefore the same has been banned on the campus”. The committee formed for the task includes professors and head of the departments (HODs) such as the head of the Department of Geography, Prof AR Siddiqui, who undertook an awareness mission in this regard and visited all departments and offices located in the Arts faculty campus and have urged teachers, staff and students to stop using polythene, fibre plastic cups and glasses among others informed the PRO.The faculty members, research scholars and students also took a pledge to free AU campus from single-use plastics and resolved to make all teachers, staff, and students aware of its ill effects, she added.The University Grants Commission (UGC) in September 2019 had issued guidelines to higher education institutions across the country to impose a ban on single-use plastic. The move had come ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi launching a mass movement against single-use plastic from October 2, which had marked the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The guidelines had mandated that every higher education institution in the country should ban single-use plastics in canteens, hostels and shopping complexes in the institution’s premises and carry out awareness drives and sensitisation workshops on the harmful impacts of single-use plastics. The guidelines also mandated all students to avoid bringing non-biodegradable plastic items to the institution, install necessary alternative facilities like water units to prevent the use of such plastic.Through a letter dated June 9, 2021, UGC secretary Rajnish Jain once again urged institutions to implement these guidelines and also undertake various activities while following Covid-19 prevention guidelines including essay competitions among students and Hackathons among students and start-ups to promote innovation in the areas of alternate materials, recycling, circular economy etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/single-use-plastic-products-to-be-banned-in-au/articleshow/85936207.cms||---
---||Delhi||From 14k, Red Pockets In City Down to 128 In Three Months||New Delhi: In three months, the number of active containment zones in Delhi has come down from 14,324 to 128. It is at one of the lowest since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in the capital triggered the creation of the containment zones. On June 4, there were 14,324 containment zones across the capital and on September 4, the city had just 128 active containment zones. It marks a significant improvement in the Covid situation. “Due to the capital witnessing a very small number of daily Covid cases, few fresh containment zones are created. Many containment zones have been de-contained as well leading to a rapid decline in the number of active containment zones,” said a district official. Till September 2, two of the 11 districts in Delhi did not have any active Covid containment zones, while the rest of the nine districts together had 131 active containment zones. According to an official report, North East and Central districts had zero containment zones, while East and South West districts each had only three containment zones as on September 2. South East district had only two containment zones. Till Thursday, 87,527 Covid-19 containment zones had been created across 11 districts in Delhi and 87,396 of them were de-contained. In March-April 2020, Delhi had a small number of containment zones because the district authorities used to create massive containment zones. One containment zone in Central district was so huge that there were over 40,000 people within it. Now, micro containment zones are created and even one flat with multiple Covid cases is converted into a containment zone if the authorities feel that it may lead to further spread of the coronavirus. The number of containment zones witnessed a dramatic jump in the last fortnight of April and reached up to 58,000 towards the end of May first fortnight. Between April 13 and May 13, on average, around 1,700 containment zones were created in Delhi every day. The containment zones serve as areas for surveillance for the coronavirus. The authorities say that they screen all the residents within the containment zones for Covid-19-like symptoms. The strategy includes focus on hotspots areas and tests. Covid norms are also strictly enforced in containment zones. A district official said that some districts were creating containment zones even for one patient so that the cases were contained effectively. All the districts have been asked to ensure that a minimum of 50% of the active cases in the districts are located inside containment zones. Currently, a containment zone is de-contained after 14 days from their creation if the patient recovers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/from-14k-red-pockets-in-city-down-to-128-in-three-months/articleshow/85936199.cms||AlokKNMishra

They were riding a two-wheeler that collided with a jeep at Siddapur, on Friday. Though they were shifted to a hospital in Mysuru, they both died in the early hours of Saturday. Mani,53, and his son Praveen,21, worked as labourers on a coffee estate. Mani was working at the Emmegundi branch of the Tata coffee estate, while Praveen worked in an estate at Arekadu. As it was a holiday on Friday, due to Kail Muhurtha, Mani went to Arekadu and was bringing his son to Emmegundi, to celebrate the festival. While they were near Siddapur, with Praveen riding pillion, a jeep coming from the opposite direction hit the two-wheeler at Mullethodu near Siddapur. The seriously injured man and his son fell on the ground and pleaded for help. Some youths present at the spot carried them to Siddapur Government Hospital for first-aid, after which they were shifted to a hospital in Madikeri, and were then shifted to Mysuru for better treatment, but they both succumbed to their injuries. Their bodies were brought to Siddapur to be cremated, but some people did not allow their last rites to be performed at the Hindu crematorium, because they claimed that they had converted to another religion, and were going to a prayer centre at Hunsur. The relatives then carried the bodies to Hunsur to perform the last rites. Siddapur police have registered a case against jeep owner Ranjith, who was driving the vehicle at the time of the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/teenager-father-die-after-jeep-rams-bike/articleshow/85932000.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BYL Nair Hospital to study T cells’ reaction to Covid in new immunology lab||MUMBAI: The enigmatic T cells, believed to hold the key to long-term protection against the Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus, will soon be the focus of a study at the city’s BMC-run Nair Hospital near Mumbai Central railway station. The study will be carried out in a state-of-the-art immunology laboratory, a first for the city’s public health system, which was inaugurated by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday and funded by Tata Sons. The immunology lab is among the multiple additions to Nair Hospital as it completed 100 years on Saturday. A 3,000-square-foot clinical skills laboratory, again a first in the public system, was also inaugurated to train 6,000 surgeons annually on newer technologies and skills. Dr Jayanthi Shastri, who will head the immunology lab, said along with the genome sequencing laboratory, which was inaugurated on August 4, her teams can study both the “host and the pathogen” extensively. “This is a leap for the public health system,” she said. While the laboratory will initially study Covid, it can be used to study various other pathogens and conditions such as HIV, stem cells and cancer. Global research on Covid and the immune system has shown that antibodies produced by beta cells start waning within a year, but studies are underway to check if the T cells—also called the immune system’s memory cells—boost immunity against Covid. “Initially, we could look at the immune signals in Covid. The equipment here can be used to study why some vaccinated people don’t develop antibodies,” said Dr Shastri. The second laboratory in Nair Hospital is located next to the mortuary as it also has a walk-in freezer to store 15 cadavers to be used for teaching. “The clinical skills laboratory has been developed like a modern operation theatre with an advanced audio-visual system to do any medical or surgical procedure on cadavers,” said Dr Amresh Baliarsingh, former head of plastic surgery department who has worked on developing the lab. He said the clinical skills lab will be used to train medical students on newer surgical skills. “The main advantage is that as Nair Hospital is a public institute, the operational costs will be low. We will be able to provide training at subsidised costs while such laboratories in the private sector charge over Rs 25,000 for two-day training,” he said. Dr Uday Bhatt, who heads the plastic surgery department, said the plan is to offer 50 to 100 courses a year with 60 participants for each. Dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal said, “Since its inception in 1921, Nair Hospital has always tried to upgrade.” After 2005 floods showed emergence of leptospirosis and dengue, it got a molecular diagnostic lab (in partner Kasturba Hospital). “Now, we have a genome lab.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nair-to-study-t-cells-reaction-to-covid-in-new-immunology-lab/articleshow/85936259.cms||---
---||Mysuru||Karnataka: Let go of temporary staff hired sans nod, varsities told||MYSURU: The Karnataka higher education department has ordered all state-run varsities to relieve temporary employees, outsourced workers and those employed on a contractual basis without prior government approval of their duties immediately. The registrars of 23 varsities, including the University of Mysore (UoM), Mandya Cluster University and Karnataka State Open University (KSOU), have been issued a directive to this effect by the government. According to the government circular, the varsities have to relieve both teaching and non-teaching staff of their duties. Coincidentally, Mysuru MP Pratap Simha had only recently made allegations of irregularities in the recruitment of 400 daily wage labourers at UoM. However, UoM vice-chancellor Prof G Hemantha Kumar had dismissed the allegations. KSOU officials too may have to answer a few difficult questions given the recent recruitment of teachers, who were hired on a contractual basis at the varsity. The government has pointed out that those who have been hired by varsities without its consent may move the court seeking regularisation of their employment, with all the benefits it entails. In a bid to pre-empt such a scenario, the government has asked all varsities to relieve those recruited without its consent of their duties. UoM registrar R Shivappa said that the varsity was yet to receive any directions from the government about its employment. “We will take a decision once we receive the order,” Shivappa said. Former UoM syndicate member MSS Kumar blamed the protracted delay in the appointment of regular staff to universities for the present problem. “Nearly 60% of the staff at universities are not regularised workers. Such being the case, no state university will be able to follow the government’s direction. The only solution to this is to initiate recruitment to all the vacant posts at the earliest,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/state-varsities-asked-to-let-go-of-temporary-staff-hired-without-approval/articleshow/85932325.cms||---

---||Mumbai||BYL Nair Hospital to get Rs 100 crore funds on its centenary, says Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday announced a Rs 100 crore fund for further development of Topiwala Medical College and B Y L Nair Hospital on the occasion of the hospital’s centenary celebration. While a press note issued by the director general information and public relations (DGIPR) said the state government would provide the funding, a BMC press release said it would be jointly provided by the state and the BMC. At a function organised on the hospital premises on Saturday, Thackeray said, “A century ago, several philanthropists came forward and hence we got the gift of life through this hospital. While temples all over are closed, God, in the form of doctors, is saving lives. It is a matter of pride that the hospital was part of the freedom struggle,” he said. Thackeray said after the 2005 floods, a laboratory was set up at Kasturba Hospital for infectious diseases. When the Covid pandemic broke out, initially there were only two labs—Kasturba and NIV in Pune. “Today, there are 600 labs. And, while initially there were only 7-8,000 beds, today there are over 4.5 lakh beds available. The first-ever genome sequencing lab for testing the Delta variant has been set up at Nair hospital,” he said. Thackeray said very few records on the Spanish flu are available today. In future, though, if at all there is a pandemic, it must be known what was done during this pandemic and hence it is necessary to build records that can be accessed, he said. He also inaugurated immunology, surgical skills and computer-based education labs. Nair dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal said the funds would be used for the development of infrastructure in the hospital complex. The hospital is in the midst of a mega makeover estimated at Rs 300 crore, including three new buildings. “One of these buildings will offer comprehensive cancer care, including PET scans (to detect cancer cells) and linear accelerator for radiation therapy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nair-hospital-to-get-rs-100-crore-funds-on-its-centenary-says-cm/articleshow/85936294.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Remotely learning: Legwork links villages||At a time when online education is a challenge especially in remote areas, a primary school teacher in Kutch came up with an innovative idea for taking schools to the doorsteps of students by developing an ‘e-bicycle mobile school’. The solar-powered bicycle was developed by Deepakbhai Mota, a teacher in Hundrain Bagh area in Bagh village of Mandvi taluka, Kutch district, who travels to remote areas and runs classes in the open using laptops and speakers. The e-bicycle was developed at a cost of about Rs 19,000 and was used to power the laptop. It can run without solar power and on pedals. The serpentine lanes of Hundraibag area where he first started teaching using the innovative e-bicycle are laden with bushes and foliage making it difficult for four wheelers to commute. At a time when schools are witnessing thin participation due to fear of a possible third wave of Covid-19, Deepakbhai’s innovative concept is a blessing in disguise, said Narendrasinh Jadeja, principal, Hudraibag Primary School, Wadi. Deepakbhai is also the innovator of Shikshan Rath, the first such mobile education school in the state, he added. The e-bicycle has features like charging points, battery indicators, mobile stand, USB connection facility, headlight, among others. For the Shikshan Rath, Deepakbhai had converted his car into a mobile school. "Today informal schools are being widely accepted across the country. Since the Shikshan Rath cannot reach everywhere, I have developed the e-bicycle to ensure that children in remote areas are not deprived of education," says Deepakbhai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/remotely-learning-legwork-links-villages/articleshow/85936361.cms||Bharat Yagnik

It recommended that children with co-morbidities -- such as certain cancers, congenital heart diseases or juvenile diabetes -- should be vaccinated. Read Also'Covid jabs not recommended for 12-15 yr olds in UK'LONDON: The UK's vaccine advisory body announced that Coronavirus jabs were not recommended for healthy children aged between 12 and 15. The joint committee on vaccine and immunisation (JCVI) provided the assessment on Friday, saying the jabs should not be recommended to those in this age group onAlthough many countries such as the US, France and Israel provide vaccine to children in the 12-15 age-group, the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) released a statement underlining that children are at such a low risk from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that vaccine would offer only a marginal benefit. Coronavirus in India: Live updates“There is little direct benefit of vaccinating healthy children as the risk of hospitalization or long Covid is miniscule,” said the statement The document further said that public interventions look at risk benefit. “The data on safety of vaccination in children is small and short term. Though rare, myocarditis is a potential risk,” it said. The only “benefit” of vaccinating children is that adults or immunocompromised individuals in close contacts of children are protected. Read AlsoTeachers should be priority group for Covid jabs: WHOCOPENHAGEN: Teachers and school staff should be among the groups prioritised for Covid-19 vaccinations so that schools in Europe and Central Asia can stay open, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Unicef said on Monday. Measures to ensure that schools can stay open throughout the pandemic“Hence universal vaccination of all children is questioned and not advisable,” the committee ruled. However, the UK government is likely to take a call soon. The UK team’s recommendations seemed to be based on the side-effects of the newer type of vaccines such as Pfizer and Moderna that cause heart inflammation in a fraction of people. Local experts said vaccinating children isn’t an easy question to answer. Apart from scientific data, there also is the Indian reality as far as Covid vaccination is concerned. “The first priority has to be to vaccinate adults with comorbidity,” said Dr Vijay Yewale, who is a member of the Maharashtra state government’s pediatric task force. “We are far, far away from immunising (fully) even 50% of our population,” he said. Read AlsoWait for two-three months till children get vaccinated against Covid-19, says Dr Trehan on re-opening of schoolsNEW DELHI: Stating that India approved Zydus Cadila's DNA vaccine for emergency use in adults and children, Medanta Chairman and Managing Director Dr Naresh Trehan on Sunday cautioned against the re-opening of schools and said that since the vaccine is around the corner, the government should waitDr Yewale said there are still many unanswered questions vis-à-vis vaccinating children. “It needs to be seen if children getting vaccinated will develop a rare condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MISC),” he said. MIC is a serious condition that appears to be linked to coronavirus disease, and a small number of children develop MIC about a month after they have suffered from asymptomatic Covid. Dr Rajeev Jayadevan of the National IMA Task Force on Covid said that the decision to vaccinate is not a black-and-white decision. “The first principle is that children are not little adults. According to data available from across the world, the risk of a child with Covid-19 getting into the Intensive Care Unit is one in half a million. This is a negligible figure,” said Dr Jayadevan, who is based in Kochi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uk-experts-against-shots-for-those-12-15-yrs-old-indian-docs-not-so-sure/articleshow/85936322.cms||---

The woman and her husband, a suspected terrorist, had been arrested by Delhi Police’s Special Cell in 2000 under sections of explosive act and in possession of fake currency. The woman had been living alone in Delhi, while her husband Kamran was deported back to Pakistan. Police are trying to trace the killer, senior officers said. Cops suspect the woman, 55-year-old Mumtaz, was killed on August 30. The body was discovered on Friday night after her neighbours reported foul smell emanating from the house. Her neighbours also told police that she was in financial distress and had nobody to look after her. Deputy commissioner of police (Central) Jasmeet Singh said they had received a call around 7.30 pm on Friday reporting a foul smell emanating from a house in Chandni Mahal. “A team that reached the spot found Mumtaz lying dead in the hallway. Probe so far has revealed that Mumtaz was first married to a man from Meerut but the two got divorced. They have children who still live in Meerut. Mumtaz then got married to another man and moved to Pakistan but shifted back to Delhi and had been living here for over two decades,” Singh said. The DCP said, medical examination revealed that Mumtaz had some wound marks on her face and head. “Entry to her house seems to be friendly as the door was open. Multiple teams have been formed and CCTV footage from the area is being checked to identify the killer,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/decomposed-body-of-55-yr-old-woman-found-in-old-delhi/articleshow/85934422.cms||---

The previous highest turnout for the state was 11.17 lakh on August 21. The corresponding turnout in Mumbai on Saturday, according to BMC’s daily vaccine update, was 1.58 lakh, though the Central government’s CoWin portal put the number at 1.79 lakh in Mumbai till the end of vaccination. (The CoWin portal said 1.02 crore vaccine doses have been given out in Mumbai, but the BMC release pegged the number at 98 lakh). State additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas said, “Happy to share that today we bettered our previous best and in a single day 11,61,141 doses of Covid vaccine administered till 6 pm. Final figures could be still more.” He later sent out a message stating that Maharashtra had crossed the 12 lakh mark at 8 pm. BMC commissioner I S Chahal said, “The good news is that 80% of the eligible citizens of MCGM have taken at least one dose of vaccination. We are Number 1 in percentage terms amongst major cities of India.” Around 30% of the citizens eligible for vaccination in Mumbai are fully vaccinated, he said, adding that “vaccination with ‘mask up’ can save us from the third wave.” On Saturday, the BMC vaccinated 82,432 people, while private players gave the shot to 70,207 people. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said that Saturday's drive focused on people who needed the second shot. While the city has approximately two lakh people who need the second shot, almost half of them were covered on Saturday. While the BMC will not do any vaccination on Sunday, a senior official said there aren’t adequate stocks to carry out a mega drive on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-betters-previous-record-with-12-lakh-jabs-in-a-day/articleshow/85936364.cms||---

---||Allahabad||State-of-the-art tech used to conduct NCR exam for first time||Prayagraj: In the first such instance, the authorities of North Central Railways (NCR) have used the state of the art computer-based technology while conducting the recently held General Departmental Competitive Examination, 2019. Tools like barcode scanning, biometric registration and face validation were included on the e-admit card for verification of the candidates. On the basis of this, an automatic computerised seat allotment system was put in place for the candidates. Throwing light on the technology used to conduct the exam, held on different dates of August, NCR’s chief public relation officer (CPRO), Dr Shivam Sharma told TOI, “A Digital Lab and Centralized Command Control Center (CCCC) was established by Railway Recruitment Cell, Prayagraj for the first time in Indian Railways (IR) for live monitoring of the entire process. In this, live CCTV streaming of each candidate’s biometric registration and examination hall was viewed on 30 large screens in the control room”. He further added that for better tracking of live monitoring, adequate staff was deployed from the personnel wing of the headquarters, apart from it higher officials also monitored the live streaming in the control room from time to time. Jammers were installed at each examination centre, which was fully functional during the examination. Its report was given by the Railway observing officers, as a result of which no unwanted and misleading rumours could be spread during the examination. Earlier, a three-layered screening process was adopted by NCR for screening 65,000 applications received for NCR’s GDCE. During the screening, first at the agency level and followed by divisional/headquarter/unit level and at RRC level, finally 29,005 candidates, who are presently working at NCR and Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW), were found to be eligible. GDCE exam was conducted after five years. “Among these, the successful employees would be promoted to the next level against the vacant posts and the final results of the exam are expected within this month”, said Sharma. To ensure that the exam is conducted in a transparent manner and to eliminate the threat of fake candidates, all those persons were prohibited from entering the examination centre who could not show their ID card / Aadhar card and PAN card, informed the CPRO. Sufficient buffer computers were kept at each examination centre for the examination so that a candidate could quickly log on to another buffer computer in case of any technical glitch in any candidate's computer during the examination. In addition to the above-mentioned steps, every important information related to the examination was timely uploaded on the official website. Moreover, there was no interference of Railway Recruitment Cell, Prayagraj with the exam conducting agency and the Chairman/Railway Recruitment Board, who made the question paper. The data transfer work was directly between the examination conducting agency and the Railway Recruitment Board Chairman. This was ensured through the world’s most secured cyber protocol. Information of all kinds was given through social media and websites, added Dr Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/state-of-the-art-tech-used-to-conduct-ncr-exam-for-first-time/articleshow/85936329.cms||---

Sudhakaran said that talks would be held with the leaders and problems would be resolved. “I have already called Oommen Chandy. We are still very much on talking terms. Some people are just taking advantage of the situation. We trust in Chandy. We will talk and make him understand the situation,” said Sudhakaran. He said that the leadership would also hold talks with Chennithala. “We will talk and resolve the problems amicably. In Congress politics, this is just a breeze in the midst of a storm. Issues bigger than this has happened in Congress and we have settled all of them. There is no need to portray it as such a huge crisis. Considering the sea change the party is undergoing, these are all minor problems. We will overcome all these issues,” Sudhakaran said. Asked about the comments being made by leaders, Sudhakaran said that it would be stopped and it would end. Speaking at a meeting, Sudhakaran said that there was no other party like Congress that allows such a freedom of expression. “However, I would like to specifically remind the leaders and workers that such expression of opinion should remain within the party. Taking freedom above that will only weaken the party and affect the party’s image. You and I are working hard not to weaken the party but to strengthen it,” said Sudhakaran. He said that eligible people had been ignored only due to ‘groupism’. “They have a good reputation in their hometowns. But none of them have any positions. They don’t have it because they were not part of any groups,” said Sudhakaran, adding that organizational elections should happen in the party. He said that the party members can approach the leadership with criticism and suggestions. “Through a total makeover, we are working to form a disciplined party with a semi-cadre system that would strengthen the party,” he said. The KPCC chief said that the Congress you are going to see after the next six months would not be the Congress that you saw yesterday. He said that the fact that a chief minister who had got entangled in a gold smuggling scandal came back to power, has obviously rattled the Congress cadres. Sudhakaran said that surveys that he held has brought to the fore the weakness of Congress at the grassroots level. “We will select 2,500 cadres. These workers will dedicate themselves to the party for three years. These workers will be trained in batches. They will be deployed in areas where the organization is weak. They will be given assistance and allowances. They will form micro units as well,” Sudhakaran said. He said that permanent political schools would be installed in Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram. A two-day workshop for the new DCC presidents will be held in Thiruvananthapuram as well, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kpcc-chief-to-pacify-chandy-ramesh/articleshow/85934388.cms||---

They continued to agitate for over an hour till they were assured that action would be taken on their written complaint. The coach denied ever offering namaz on the stadium grounds. A probe has been ordered into the matter. Coach Abid Ali, who represented India in U-16 category in late 1980s, said that he never offered prayers on the ground but he does offer prayers outside the ground as the time of evening prayers coincides with the training time. He was granted permission for the same since he joined in 2014. An alumnus of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Ali has been coaching young hockey players in Pilibhit without any financial remuneration from the UP government. Ali told TOI, “During the break from practice session, I move out of the ground and go to a corner to offer prayers. While I was a junior in Punjab, a senior coach had told me that I can offer namaz in the stadium but I never offered prayers on the ground. I have a great respect for the game and I cannot do anything unethical on the sports ground.” City magistrate Arun Kumar Singh, who met the protesters, and assured them a transparent probe into the matter.

The message came on the phone number used by deceased Joshi, a resident of Palanpur town in Banaskantha, which is now being used by other family members, said a district health official. He added that it was a human error caused by a wrong data entry done by a health worker. “While entering details, health worker erroneously entered the phone number of the deceased instead of the actual person who got the vaccine,” Banaskantha immunisation officer Dr Jignesh Haryani told TOI. “This happened because Joshi died after taking the first dose. However, his name kept showing in the list of people whose second dose was pending. So when it was time for Joshi’s second dose on Friday, his name showed up in the list and the operator entered his phone number,” said Haryani, adding that the worker responsible for the error was suspended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/dead-man-jabbed-kin-shocked/articleshow/85934328.cms||---
---||Mumbai||With Covid test stopover, fly to Canada from Tuesday||MUMBAI: Fully vaccinated tourists from India can fly to Canada from September 7 as long as they stop in a third country to undergo an RT-PCR test. What has come to the rescue of passengers from India is that certain destinations in Middle East opened up to Indian tourists, so they can now transit from places like Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Turkey too relaxed entry norms and did away with 14-day mandatory quarantine for fully vaccinated passengers from India. “In the past several months, Middle Eastern airports too were shut to Indians. So the only option before students traveling to Canada was to transit via countries like Egypt and Mexico, where they underwent an RT-PCR test. With Canada open to tourists from India as well, a holiday travel itinerary with a short stop in Dubai or Abu Dhabi could be planned,’’ said Anoop Kanuga from Bathija Travels. Fares for travel to Canada with a transit halt in a third country were comparatively cheap too. For travel this month-end and return in mid-October, the return fare on offer on the Mumbai-Toronto route was a transit halt in, say, London was priced at Rs80,000-90,000. For a transit halt in Middle East, the economical options were available only 3-4 weeks down the line. In case of Canada and Turkey, entry has been permitted only to passengers who have taken both doses of Covishield, at least 14 days before arrival. To enter Canada, passengers have to undergo a pre-arrival RT-PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before their arrival in the country. Passengers also need to be asymptomatic, submit proof of vaccination and mandatory information on ArriveCAN app. Those traveling with unvaccinated children aged under 12 have been permitted entry to Canada without quarantine restrictions. But children aged 12-17 and dependent children 18 or older (due to a mental or physical condition) will be subject to a 14-day quarantine. All unvaccinated children (except those under 5) will be subject to day 1 and 8 testing requirements, said the Canadian government order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-covid-test-stopover-fly-to-canada-from-tues/articleshow/85936433.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Out of WhatsApp, video-calling world||AHMEDABAD: The time-table of Nathabhai Chavda, a primary school teacher from Bhavnagar district, is a bit different. Instead of classes, the timings show the ‘sheri’ (bylane) he will be conducting classes at. Chavda starts off from the various lanes of Sipaiwada at Hathiyadhar village near Palitana and proceeds to nearby areas. “I have about 45 students to teach. While several colleagues elsewhere conducted classes through WhatsApp calls, my students didn’t have the facility – their fathers, who have just one phone, would take it to work. They also did not have TVs. Thus, I started conducting classes at their doorstep,” says Chavda, a teacher at Jhaverchand Meghani Primary School. “We also installed a few TVs in houses so students can catch classes through DD Girnar.” While many teachers toyed with the idea of virtual classrooms, for many in the state, that was not possible due to a complete lack of phones or TVs. Thus, these teachers went the conventional way to take education to their students’ doorsteps instead. The In-Shodh platform of the Ravi J Matthai Centre for Educational Innovation (RJMC) at IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A) documented several such practices over the past one-and-a-half years. In all, the online platform has a bank of 800-odd innovations from across the state, which is accessed by teachers from Gujarat and beyond. Another innovation documented by the centre is by Gaurav Joshi, a teacher from Pahadbhai ni Muvadi primary school in Gandhinagar district. When Joshi goes to the village to teach, he carries a load worthy of a small carrier. The students get a mini library, a space to conduct science and mathematics experiments, and a ‘performance space’ where students and sing and dance. “We call it ‘Bal Melo’ or Children’s Fair, so students are attracted to the space and learn while having fun,” said Joshi. “The students get books from the library to read, can perform various experiments and can also learn simple printing, collage-making, etc. It not only drove their pandemic blues away, but also got them interested in resuming their studies.” Nishith Acharya, a primary school teacher from Ropda in Ahmedabad district, also conducted workshops and camps instead of ‘classes’ to teach students the basics of language and mathematics. Binder This Teacher’s Day, TOI celebrates teachers who went beyond the call of duty and did everything from moving about in villages on motorcycles to conducting classes in mohallas, sourcing TVs to learning ‘video calling’ for the sake of their students. Lakhs of students benefited from these gurus who will soon be back to schools to continue their education journey. Two from state to get National Teacher’s Award today Ahmedabad: The list of 44 recipients of the National Teachers Awards for 2021 has two names from Gujarat – Vanita Rathod and Ashok Parmar. The duo will receive their award from President Ram Nath Kovind. While Rathod is the principal of Shri Vinoba Bhave School in Rajkot, Parmar is a teacher at Hiten Dholakia Vidyalaya in Bhuj. Rathod is being felicitated for turning the school around by improving grades through involving students in various aspects of the school’s functioning. The number of girl students improved at the school, added officials. Parmar is known for his interventions like daily quizzes for students to solve. The reason for starting this initiative was the complete lack of interest in students for mathematics. After the initiative, there was a marked improvement in cognitive skills of the participants, said Parmar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/out-of-whatsapp-video-calling-world/articleshow/85936407.cms||Parth Shastri

Her group, which has over 255 members, is carrying out the noble initiative in various areas of eastern and western parts of Ahmedabad. But since the last two weeks they are facing resistance from the society members. This group is not alone; there are many dog feeders in Ahmedabad and Rajkot facing the same problem. According to dog feeders they are facing problems after some newspapers carried reports quoting the high court saying, “If you love dogs then create their Panjrapole.’ However, dog feeders say the court has issued no such order and some of the people who hate stray dogs have misinterpreted the newspaper reports. “There are many societies that have put up notices prohibiting dog feeding. Some of the society members oppose feeding on footpaths also and because of that we have to feed them during night and odd hours,” Shah told TOI. She added that around 500 people from various societies of Ahmedabad have approached her complaining that they are facing opposition for dog feeding. Binaifer Lalkaka, a resident of Anmol tower in Naranpura area of Ahmedabad, had created a designated place in the society to feed the dogs so it doesn’t disturb the society members and playing children. “The society members have put the newspaper cutting on the notice board along with an order prohibiting us from feeding the stray dogs. Now I feed the dogs post-midnight when there is no one around. The society committee members have seized the utensils used to give water to the dogs,” Lalkaka said. Tejal Mistry and her group, having more than 50 members, feed the stray dogs in Rajkot. They started the initiative during the lockdown. “Since the report appeared in newspapers it has become difficult for us to convince people to show sympathy towards the animals,” Mistry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/street-dog-feeders-face-resistance/articleshow/85934414.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Chennai||Take a ragam on your run||CHENNAI: Violinist Kumaresh R and veena artist Jayanthi Kumaresh are hoping that the next time you are out on a run, you do it with ‘strings attached’. Or ‘Run with SA’, as they call it. The musicians have just released an album of workout music completely based on Carnatic ragams, with a little Cuban and Brazilian pep thrown in for a sprint stretch perhaps? "We were out on our morning walk one day when someone mentioned that it would be good to have a classical playlist to listen to while on a run. And that’s how we came up with this 36-minute album," says Jayanthi. To create the five-track album, the artists contacted runners and gym buffs to understand what kind of pace they were looking for in their music. The result was an album with warm-up tracks, fast-paced ones and a cool down. For instance, says Jayanthi, the album begins with a composition based on hamsadhvani, at 160 beats per minute for the warm up, then transitions into ‘nattakurinji’ at 180 beats a minute, and then mellows into ‘kamaas’ to help cool down. It isn’t just the Kumaresh duo that has come up with a Carnatic-themed album for exercise routines, which seems to be getting popular with fitness buffs in the city. Past studies incidentally have shown that slower music between 80 to 115 beats per minute can help slow the heart rate and reduce anxiety before a race or game. A couple of months ago, Madrasana released six Workout with Carnatic albums, which like Run with SA is available across several digital streaming platforms. In the first month there were close to 4,000 streams across all digital platforms, says Mahesh Venkateshwaran, founder of the music platform. Madrasana did a survey of 400 people, asking them about their workouts and types of ragas they listen to.  "We’ve noticed that runners seem to like the faster-paced Carnatic numbers. For our survey, some runners were even specific about the number of beats a minute they wanted," he says. Madrasana roped in classical musicians and vocalists such as Ramakrishnan Murthy, Vignesh Ishwar, Sriranjani Santhanagopalan, Ashwath Narayanan, Sandeep Narayan, Ashwin Srinivasan and Ramana Balachandran for their album. Since runners listen to music on headphones, the album, says Mahesh, was produced in ambisonics, which is a full-sphere surround sound. "It is more pleasing to the ears through a headphone," says Mahesh. Entrepreneur Biju Zachariah says while he usually listens to the blues and rock on his run, he recently gave Carnatic music a try. "It was refreshing," says Zachariah, who tried Run with SA. "I always thought classical music would be too mellow for a run but the numbers with a faster beat set you up for a good pace."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/take-a-ragam-on-your-run/articleshow/85934367.cms||Kamini Mathai

---||Ahmedabad||The master puppeteer of teaching from Saurashtra||Literary critics say that mathematician Charles Dodgson, known better for his pen name Lewis Carroll, concocted the fantastic tale of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland on a boat ride on the river Isis to teach three little girls, daughters of his scholarly friend Henry Liddell, maths. After the success of his first novel, Carroll went on to write more novels and then came a stage when people forgot him as a mathematician but remembered him as the writer. Like Carroll, Pranav Vyas, a drawing teacher in a government primary school in Punjapadar village in Liliya taluka of Amreli, learnt and mastered the art of puppetry when he found that students learned better when taught through this tool of entertainment. "When I started teaching two decades ago I used to teach using the standard teaching method. In 2003, I attended a workshop by Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT) in Udaipur where I learnt puppetry as a teaching tool. I loved puppet shows as a kid. I made one glove puppet and started teaching with it. I noticed that kids who used to be less attentive in classes started getting involved and paid more attention to studies," says Pranav. Since then Vyas, in his mid-forties, has made thousands of glove, rod and shadow puppets, done a PhD on the topic of ‘The role of puppetry in narration of folktales.’ Vyas has also penned and published four books on the art of puppetry. Vyas has carried out over 200 workshops in schools across the state and has taught students as well as teachers. He modifies folktales to teach kids subjects like mathematics, science and also languages using puppets. Vyas has conducted several workshops for CCRT during 2010-17 period where he has taught teachers from across India the art of puppetry as a teaching tool. Apart from CCRT, his efforts have been recognized by the state government and also by organizations like SRISTI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/the-master-puppeteer-of-teaching-from-saurashtra/articleshow/85936557.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

Almost a year after the Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Ltd (SCML) finalized the firm and signed an agreement for the construction of the control centre at the corporation’s main office, the ruling council of the civic body was unable convince the Left union which has steadfastly opposed to the project. In a meeting held here on Saturday, Vijayan who had received a communication from the city corporation regarding the stalemate directed the civic body to go by the proposal. While Mayor Arya Rajendran presented an alternative of setting up a back-up facility at Thampanoor, Vijayan asked the corporation to implement what was envisaged in the proposal. Owing to the pressure from the Left union, SCTL was even forced to redraw the proposal and suggest new design. Though mayor held repeated talks with the union representatives, it failed. Cloud hosting in a remote location was also mooted for the scheme. With the site handover being delayed, SCTL also faced the risk of going for a retender and this would have further increased the project cost for which additional fund mobilization would have been required. CM’s intervention is expected to speed up the transfer of project site to the company, which had won the bid for the project. SCTL had proceeded with the decision to implement the control centre at the facilitation centre with support from the previous council. The building permit was also awarded by the corporation to SCTL for the project. However, staff unions opposed the move citing that it would cause inconvenience to the public. Some of the major wings of the departments and related services are now made available at the facilitation centre and changing the location of the centre would not go down well with the public, according to the corporation staff who expressed reservations regarding the project. The detailed project report for the scheme has fixed the estimated amount at Rs 2.90cr. As per the project, ICCC will be an integrated system that will operate and manage multiple city service operations, including real-time monitoring and improving services delivery efficiency. Various independent solutions will be integrated to command and control centre like smart water network: Continuous monitoring of water supply, intelligent traffic & transport management, SWM data centre and other features like early warning systemand smart mosquito density system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cm-intervenes-deadlock-over-smart-city-project-ends/articleshow/85934471.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Mandhatasinh further said that the dispute over royal property was his family’s internal matter and it should not be discussed in the public. Ranshuvrisinh, the great grandson of Pradhyumansinh Jadeja, had claimed that despite he being a natural heir, he was being deprived of his share in the royal property. Mandhatasinh in a statement on Saturday said, “Late Pradhyumansinhji had given late Prahladsinhji (Ransurvirsinh’s grandfather) his share when he was alive. Now, nobody has right on the property of the royal family.” According to Mandhatasinh, Aniruddhsinh (Ranshurvirsinh’s father) had admitted in court that his father Prahladsinhji got the share of the property and as a result, no family members of Prahladsinhji can claim their share in the royal property. Mandhatasinh added, “Nobody has the right make baseless claims in public on behalf of the royal family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/kins-claim-on-royal-property-turned-down/articleshow/85934479.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: New school of thought! Teachers take edu to poor kids in pandemic||Mumbai: It’s 8.30pm and students are ready for school. Rohini Dandge, their teacher, gets online. A few borrowed smartphones display the faces of the children from classes 1 to 5. On some days, adults are seen behind the children, holding a torch when there’s no electricity. A primary teacher at a zilla parishad school in Barabangla village of Kasara, Dandge (32) has to conduct ‘night school’ for her regular students as that is the only time adults return home from work and hand their cellphones to their children. “Me and my senior teacher, Sanjay Sande, convinced villagers to spare their cellphones for an hour to help children study,” said Dandge, who joined the school in 2014. During the day, she sends the topics, homework, videos on cellphones After 8.30pm, students access it and study which goes on for two hours. Both, children and their parents were stressed about online learning. So was Dandge, whose mobile use was restricted to making calls and a bit of social media. “Video-calling and making PPT was novel to me but lockdown helped me enhance my technological knowledge,” said Dandge. In another remote tribal village in Wada, around 57km from Kasara, another government school teacher Pinesh Jadhav (36) has been teaching students living in the jungles of Sangwan. Here, none of the inhabitants had smartphones. Jadhav, with 15 years of experience, would not give up. He asked students to gather at the home or open space of a local who had a phone. He calls on the phone, asks the receiver to put the call on speaker and conducts class for students from classes 1 to 4. The school is located in Musarane village, which is free of Covid.Jadhav hopes that physical classes will begin soon. Both Jadhav and Dandge, proudly declare that this year their enrolments have gone up and none of the students has been left out of the learning curve. Jadhav and Dandge are among the many teachers who are real heroes, said Uma Kogekar, CEO of the Centre for Equity and Quality in Universal Education that has documented the journey of teachers during the pandemic, by way of a book. The teachers ensured that their students moving from primary to secondary were admitted in schools and did not drop out to work as labourers. “Twelve of my students had to be admitted to other schools for class 5. I am in touch with their new teachers so that they continue education,” said Jadhav. Parents of girls students, have especially being educated about the need to study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-new-school-of-thought-teachers-take-edu-to-poor-kids-in-pandemic/articleshow/85936578.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Goa||Now, Goa looks to homestays, villages to attract tourists||PANAJI: Away from the sun, sea, and sand that tourism in Goa is synonymous with, plans are currently afoot to explore the tourism potential of the state’s villages. A senior government official said that the tourism department has already prepared a scheme on this subject, and sent it to the chief minister for final approval. Through this scheme, the department will invite proposals from panchayats to develop tourism infrastructure in their villages. The department would then appoint an experienced tour operator to explore the village’s potential for tourism. “Once we get an application from the panchayat, a tour operator will visit the village and find out if there is any potential to develop that village for tourism, and a report would be submitted to the department,” the official said. Then, based on the report, the department will gapfund to develop tourism infrastructure, including toilets. The officer stressed that in developing infrastructure, the department will see that the village’s heritage isn’t affected, and that no tall buildings would be allowed. “Locals will be encouraged to develop homestays in villages,” said the officer, adding that this would be called sustainable tourism. He said that there are a lot of tribal villages in the state, and they have different festivals that can be showcased to tourists if those villages are developed for tourism. The official said that the government would rope in experienced tour operators because they know exactly what tourists want, and it is they who will get tourists to the villages. Since tourists want to explore new places in Goa, the scheme will help promote hinterland tourism, he said. “Once the chief minister approves the scheme, it will be notified soon in the official gazette for implementation,” he said. Till date, village tourism hasn’t been given much importance. Officials believe this scheme will change that, and also help villagers get employment and generate revenue. The scheme may also have stalls where villagers can sell local products. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, tourism slowed down in Goa, and only recently has it started picking up. Recently, the high court allowed the state to let in visitors who have received both doses of the vaccine. Those who haven’t must produce a negative RT-PCR certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/away-from-beaches-goa-looks-at-homestays-showcase-villages-to-woo-tourists/articleshow/85936485.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Chennai||Chennai: Libraries get new shelf life||CHENNAI: You know I’m thriving when I’m flipping through the musky fragrance of an old, dusty book, says Prabhu Viswanathan. Until the pandemic struck, the Chennai businessman would be found at the Madras Literary Society almost every week, or on a hunt for first editions, political biographies, and collectibles. For steadfast bibliophiles like Prabhu – who "wouldn’t touch a Kindle at 90," the pandemic has been a period of cruel withdrawal from the romance of that experience. With lockdown restrictions, many libraries have been forced to shut their doors forever. And those that have managed to stay afloat are struggling for subscriptions to survive. However, several initiatives have been launched in the city to take the reading experience to patrons and attract new bookworms, while also creating unique cultural experiences amid excessive digital consumption. "During the first wave, we associated with a lot of libraries, ensuring that memberships were renewed. We showed our support to the local lending libraries," says Thirupurasundari Sevvel, founder of Nam Veedu, Nam Oor, Nam Kadhai, a social history group, which has also been creating various maps of Chennai — from tea kadais to old lanes. "We had taken children on a tour of all the libraries in 2015. Since we had all that data, last August we checked they are still functional and created an e-map," says Thirupurasundari, adding that there are around 300 libraries they have mapped, both established and free smaller ones. "We sent the map to schools and urged them to support these establishments." But then the second wave of the pandemic broke out and libraries had to close. "So recently we printed out the map and have been distributing it. We want people to continue patronising these places," she says. Libraries have also come up with creative ways to stay relevant during the pandemic. "Though I have temporarily suspended operations at my #Stories Library Café in KK Nagar during the pandemic, my mobile library has been very much in demand," says Gopi Sampath, who started the library on wheels around eight years ago. "I have a few hundred members. Many people have turned to reading during the pandemic and though some read e-books, there are those who still prefer physical books, especially people aged 40 and above. Also within families that love reading, the one Kindle in the house may be used by youngsters, but the others still need reading material." Companies and new housing complexes are also requesting his services, says Gopi. "In March, a housing complex in Medavakkam asked me to set up a library. Companies also want my mobile library to come to their campuses so that their staff can borrow books," says Gopi, adding that they sanitise their books and van regularly. But perhaps the most isolated from any tactile learning during the pandemic are the children, who have been spending more screen time than they ever had the luxury to do, before 2020. And that’s why Thirupurasundari, who is also the general secretary of Madras Literary Society (MLS), along with artist-architects Srishti Prabhakar and Muhilan Murugan decided to take storybooks and puzzles to children across the city in autorickshaws — completing close to 72 such trips over the past year. "The intention was also to offer a livelihood to our autorickshaw annas as well as local chai and snack sellers in the neighbourhoods we went to," says Thirupurasundari. "We sanitised our books and games and picked street corners to do impromptu readings. We always had a set of books that kids could borrow," she says. Another concept that has been filling the gap is the pop-up library — curated as part of social or cultural initiatives at a few public spaces. Earlier this month, the Chennai Photo Biennale’s Learning Lab that promotes photographic art, and artist Kaamna Patel's Editions Jojo, launched 'Papertrail', series of pop-up photobook libraries, reading rooms, and photobook shops across eight cities in India. Their locations are also venues established on a countercultural vein, such as the Naushad Ali designer store in Puducherry, G5A, a Mumbai non-profit promoting independent arts, and Museo Camera, a centre for photographic arts in Gurugram. In some other home-bred initiatives, pop-up libraries are often the catalysts offering books a full and deserving shelf life, by taking them to as many readers as possible — like the self-help library set up by 30-year-old Ngurang Meena at a street corner at Mizoram’s Nirjuli town in August last. Similarly, when Pune youngsters Priyanka Chaudhari and Abhishek Awchar started the Open Library Movement two years ago, they placed a glass shelf with 100 donated books of all kinds inside a playground in Pune. "We didn’t want any book to reach the scrap dealer before it was read by at least 25 to 30 people," says Abhishek. Today, their movement has grown across Maharashtra covering villages in Vidharbha and Marathwada, in addition to smaller chapters in Gujarat, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. "We have 100 volunteers who have reached 55,000 readers," says Abhishek. Their bookshelves stand at traffic junctions, outside schools, and important landmarks in villages where people can take the books they like and give back some of their own. On the other hand, the physical libraries that have opened their doors once again say that though book lovers continue to drop in, they have to put a cap on the numbers coming in. "This cinema library was established by Pa Ranjith for assistant directors and aspiring filmmakers to access books on and by famous filmmakers, and filmmaking," says Murugan Manthiram of Koogai Thiraippada Iyakkam in Valsaravakkam. "We used to conduct movie screenings and discussions. We have stopped the events during the pandemic but people still drop in to read." Especially after the pandemic, we must warm up to the idea of a library as a space unbound by physical constraints, believe book lovers. "While brick and mortar libraries are irreplaceable repositories of reference and knowledge, any place that can create a cultural consensus can be called a library — an old book store or a street shop — where there are all kinds of books, and conversations initiated around them."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/libraries-get-new-shelf-life/articleshow/85934445.cms||Priya M Menon

All of a sudden changes in routes and longer travel time over the last few days have inconvenienced commuters using Aapli Bus service. “On many routes, buses are not going to the designated end destination due to bad roads,” said an official from the NMC’s transport department. He added that pothole-ridden roads have been posing problems to commuters and motorists across the city. “The NMC has stopped operating Aapli Buses on at least five routes due to under- construction cement road work or poor condition of roads. Many routes have also been changed due to bad roads,” the official added. The incomplete cement road work on Hingna, Pardi and Kamptee routes have turned into a nightmare not only for private vehicles but also city buses plying on these routes. The other routes affected included Sitabuldi-Nagsenvan and Sitabuldi-Yeshodhara Nagar. TOI has been highlighting pothole-ridden roads posing problems to commuters and motorists across the city. Commuters using Aapli Buses are upset. “The civic body is operating only 65% of its 400-odd red buses and diversion of routes due to bad roads is adding to our woes,” said Mahesh Gothi, a regular Aapli Bus commuter. “Buses take a minor detour, for an hour or so, in case repair work is underway. Everyday breakdowns too have increased and at least 20 buses were stranded on different routes,” said the official. One of the red bus operators confirmed that bad roads have increased the maintenance cost of Aapli Bus by 30%. Bad roads are damaging the suspension, steering box and shock absorbers of many buses. Problems pertaining to foundation bolts and flat tyres are also common, the operator claimed. “This makes matters worse for us and on diverted routes, both buses and commuters have to suffer,” admitted an Aapli Bus driver requesting anonymity. Many a time, commuters were asked to alight mid-way due to breakdowns of city buses. “Breakdowns have led to drivers and conductors of Aapli buses facing commuters’ wrath,” said another driver.

There is no question of side-lining these leaders. They will be an inalienable part of the Congress as long as they are alive,” Satheesan said. He was speaking at the function in which the new DCC president, Jose Valloor, has taken over charge. Satheesan pointed out that the Congress in Kerala was confronting two cadre parties like the CPM and the BJP, and it will be possible for the Congress to meet this challenge only by building up a cohesive organizational structure. Congress cannot remain in an amorphous state, he said. In an indirect response to the reported statement of Chennithala that the new leadership of Congress should not behave arrogantly, Satheesan said even though the Congress needed changes in organizational patterns, this would not be enforced through arbitrary and arrogant dictates, or by wielding the sword of discipline, but the necessary changes will be ushered in through a process of discussions and reconciliation. “Utmost care will be taken to carry everyone together. No leader or worker of the party will be alienated. In fact, all of us should take earnest steps to bring back all the Congress workers and leaders who are now staying away from the party, due to various reasons,” Satheesan said. Satheesan, however, reiterated his stance that KPCC president is the final authority of the Congress unit in Kerala, and none should try to assume a role above him. “Once the KPCC president announces a decision taken after collective discussions, the party workers and leaders from one end to the other end of the state should own it up and implement it in its true spirit,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sr-leaders-integral-part-of-congress/articleshow/85934467.cms||---

A viral video of the carpenter’s daughter, clad in school uniform and riding the currents of the Rapti in UP’s Gorakhpur district, has become an emblem of the girl’s courage and determination to continue her education against all odds and give her parents and three younger brothers a better life. Sandhya is a student of Class XI at Ayodhya Das Girls’ Inter College. Each morning, she gets on the boat near her home in Bahrampur and rows her way through the swollen Rapti — past half submerged houses — to reach Raj Ghat, from where she takes a tempo to reach school. “My school was shut for a long time due to the pandemic and now we are facing a challenge from the Rapti. I don’t want to miss classes any further as I don’t have the privilege of private tuition. I am totally dependent on my school for my studies,” the teenager said. Tenacious as she is, Sandhya believes it is not possible for her – and all others living in the area – to tide over the miseries of monsoon flooding year after year. “I appeal to the CM to get an embankment constructed in my area as floodwaters have entered many houses and families are forced to live on terraces under plastic sheets,” she said. Sandhya, who seeks inspiration from figures like Sarojini Naidu, Indira Gandhi, Kalpana Chawla and PT Usha, said it pained her to see many other students — especially girls — drop out of school because of the challenges they have had to face.  “Many girls in my area are not going to school any more because of the floods, but I can’t afford to be fearful. I aspire to work for the railways, and I am working hard every day to attain my goal.” Once she gets a job and earns enough to meet her family’s needs, Sandhya wants to take a flight somewhere along with her family.

In the state committee meeting of the RSP held on Saturday, it was decided that the party should not take any extreme decision like parting ways with the UDF. After the meeting, party secretary A A Azeez said whatever criticisms the leaders have made against the UDF was in good sense and was to settle the issues. The RSP leaders will have discussion with the Congress leadership on Monday before the UDF meeting. It has also been decided to attend the next UDF meeting. Opposition leader V D Satheesan and KPCC president K Sudhakaran had assured the RSP leaders that their issues will be sorted out through talks. RSP, soon after the assembly election, had written a letter to the Congress leadership to probe into the reasons behind the defeat of the RSP candidates. However, the Congress leadership had not held any discussion in this regard with the RSP, which has irked the party. Following this, the RSP leaders had openly come out against the Congress in the past few days. In the state committee meet, it was decided to have more dialogues with the Congress and settle the issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/rsp-to-hold-talks-with-cong/articleshow/85934509.cms||---

Data from the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) shows that the citizens’ apprehensions are not misplaced. The nature of roads is the cause of nearly a third of the accidents that occur in Goa, the MoRTH report said. Of the 3,440 road accidents that took place in Goa in 2019, 1,160 occurred because of the type of road, leading to 66 deaths, as per the MoRTH’s analysis of road accidents. As many as 729 accidents took place due to the curvature of the road, killing 35 persons, and 127 accidents took place on T-junction, leading to the death of 25 persons. Of the accidents, five were due to potholes, resulting in one death. Four-arm junctions were responsible for 181 accidents and nine deaths, while round about junctions saw 79 accidents, killing seven persons. Another 39 accidents took place at a Y-junctions, causing two fatalities. As many as 1,244 accidents took place on national highways. According to MoRTH’s records, these national highways are being looked after by the state public works department (PWD) and are not under the jurisdiction of the National Highways Authority of India. A third or 107 of the 297 road accident deaths reported in 2019 in Goa occurred on national highways, even though the state government has begun work of expansion and apparent improvement of highways across the length and breadth of Goa in 2016. According to the MoRTH report, during 2019, 3,440 road accidents were reported in Goa — 283 of them were fatal accidents, where 297 persons lost their lives. Though in 2019, the total number of accidents in Goa were down by over 250 since 2018, the number of persons who lost their lives in fatal accidents were up in 2019 by 13.4%. Besides, the 283 fatal accidents, grievous injuries were reported in 196 cases. The MoRTH report shows that in very few of the accident cases in Goa, weather was responsible for the ill-event. ]This indicates that road conditions or road users not following safety measures were the top causes for road accidents in Goa. Most of the accidents in Goa or 3,131 occurred in clear weather, causing 276 deaths. In comparison, 21 road accident deaths took place during rainy weather. Foggy vision was not reported as cause of any accident or fatality. Majority of the accidents reported in Goa involved two-wheeler riders and those riding pillion leading to 1,757 accidents and death of 186 persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nature-of-roads-responsible-for-1/3-of-accidents-in-goa-centre/articleshow/85936530.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

However, as the results of final BDS examinations came out on Friday a 24-year-old Surabhi Suresh, daughter of a wayside food vendor and wife of an auto driver, proved many people wrong. Over the past few years, her life was pitted against all sorts of odds and in between she got married. But, her husband Sajith and her father Suresh made sure that, no matter what, Surabhi did not lose track of her goal. “I wanted to be a doctor since my school days. But some people kept telling me that people from my background cannot aspire to such a career. In a way, those very words fired me up. I spent a whole year preparing for the entrance examination and secured admission to the BDS course. My father and my husband supported me throughout. Be it study materials, books or fees, my father took care of everything with his modest income from the small eatery he ran at Bakery junction. During the final year of the course my husband was my biggest support,” Surabhi said. Her father Suresh shelled out his savings to support her in studies. Surabhi, who is expecting, plans to take a break before she resumes her studies. “I want to do my internship and then complete my PG. For the time being, I will take a break,” says Surabhi who did the BDS course at PSM College of Dental science and Research, Thrissur. Her husband always admired Surabhi’s passion for education. It was him who would coerce her to stay at the hostel and focus on her studies. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rajaji-nagar-girl-beats-all-odds-to-achieve-her-bds-dream/articleshow/85934499.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Olympians thrust Simdega hockey players into limelight||Ranchi: A hockey player from a non-descript village in Simdega district of Jharkhand, Salima Tete, has brought home not just laurels for herself by participating in the Tokyo Olympics but also a plethora of opportunities for her co-players. Having attracted the eyeballs of both government and private players, the fate of players in Simdega is likely to change. The district administration in Simdega has started a skill development, career counselling and personality development centre inside the District Employment Office building to groom the youth, particularly sportspersons to meet industry standards for employment. Deputy commissioner Sushant Gaurav said that Simdega has been excelling in sports but many a time the players do not feel confident enough to perform outside the state and the country. “Body language training and spoken English training to players will boost their confidence and help them in improving their performance on the field. We aim to develop this centre as a ‘Centre of Excellence’ for the youth and students of the district,” he said. On the other hand, an alumnus of St Johns School and St Xavier’s College in Ranchi, professor Arun Roy, in his individual capacity has reached out to the players of the district who are not covered under government schemes. Roy has arranged donations to fund nutritious meals for the players. “Once a player gets an opportunity to participate in the Olympics, it encourages many others to take up sports but not all are covered by government benefits,” he said. Identifying such players through hockey coach at Simdega hockey centre Manoj Konbegi, Roy has arranged nutritious ration for a dozen players to begin with. The ration packets have been arranged in consultation with nutritionist Dr Mamta Kumari and comprise locally available stuff like soya and wheat flour, kabuli, black grams, dates, rajma and mustard oil. A similar support has been extended to players in Bariatu girls hockey centre. Roy has also initiated online spoken English training sessions for the players. “We are trying to operate as a bridge and would channel whatever help comes our way to these players,” Roy said, adding that he has plans to identify more such players and provide them with nutrition support. Dr Raj Chandra Jha from Ranchi has joined Roy’s cause to provide medical assistance to the players while Dr Glenn Mascarenhans and Dr Manisha Bose from Bangkok have offered to provide training in communication skills to the players.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/olympians-thrust-simdega-hockey-players-into-limelight/articleshow/85934953.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

With more than 92% of the total eligible population taking their first jabs, Torpa is moving towards the complete immunisation milestone within the next few days. The high coverage of vaccination in the interior block of Khunti district is possible only after the district administration’s manifold efforts that included counselling sessions, myth-busting by dedicated groups and organising awareness programmes. Khunti DC Shashi Ranjan, who led the inoculation drive, said, “As of Saturday afternoon, we covered 92.53% of the district’s population for their first jabs under 16 panchayats of Torpa block. The target population of eligible beneficiaries under the block is 55,939, of whom 51,763 have received their first doses.” On the expectations of a 100% coverage, Ranjan said, “We are trying to complete it by Monday evening as we have dedicated teams for each panchayat and over 200 people, including sahiyas, ANMs and teachers as well as members of the Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion society (JSLPS) were engaged. We could not have achieved this coverage without their support.” Talking about the challenges that the administration faced during the drive, Ranjan said in early days of the vaccination drive, they had to face severe hesitancy based on myths about the vaccine among the locals. “So, we decided to hold ratri choupals or night counselling sessions in villages, which were attended by officials as well as locals. We could conduct our drive further after our efforts and formed dedicated groups for all 16 panchayats under the Torpa block. A few groups convinced the beneficiaries about the vaccine in the native tongue. Moreover, we made awareness videos in the local language, Mundari, which were played during the choupals. These initiatives helped us gain the confidence of the people,” Ranjan said. JSLPS member Sangita Devi from Jariya panchayat of the block said, “Getting people vaccinated in rural areas is a very difficult job. After a few beneficiaries developed minor adverse events following the immunisation, I had to bear the brunt of their anger. However, I continued to counsel them, and now, 98% of people in my panchayat has been vaccinated.” Officials also said Fatka panchayat’s Churdag, the first fully-vaccinated village in the state, is also in Khunti. “Churdag was the turning point for us as people from the village used to say that they would die after taking the vaccine and that the vaccine is a conspiracy against them to snatch their lands after they die. After we counselled them in their local language, we could achieve cent per cent inoculation. We decided to take up the challenge in the entire block,” Torpa BDO Dayanand Karjee said. The geographical terrain, too, had posed challenges during the vaccination drive as several villages do not have motorable roads and the healthcare workers had to cross rivers to reach the villages. ANM of Derand health sub-centre, Ursula Aaind, who had to cross rivers along with his all-women team for the drive, said, “We crossed a river to reach Saraburu village under Fatka panchayat, but we took the effort as the drive should not be delayed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/torpa-eyes-fully-vaccinated-tag/articleshow/85934752.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Vadodara||Alumni carry on Sindhi teacher’s 70-year-old legacy||VADODARA: Immediately after India’s partition in 1947, a school principal from Sindh (now in Pakistan), Ladharam Chandiramani, came to Vadodara where he started educating Sindhi children displaced by the partition. He was joined by his cousin Lilaram Chandiramani in this teaching profession. Six years later, Ladharam passed away, but the legacy of free and subsidized education which he had started continues to salute his efforts even today after almost 74 years. In the middle of narrow lanes and alleys of Chhipwad near Mandvi, Shri Ladharam School, which had opened doors as the Sind Hindu High School by Ladharam at the Music College in December 1947 and later also moved to the building of Model High School in Dandiya Bazaar, continues to educate over 700 children in English medium even today. The school’s foundation was laid by Ladharam after former Maharaja Fatehsinhrao Gaekwad of erstwhile Baroda state, allowed him temporary use of Music College for the school. Later the school was shifted to the building of Model High School which was then a Gujarati medium school. Finally, the current building came into existence in 1956, when Maharaja Fatehsinhrao gave Lilaram land near Mandvi for a nominal price. “Dada Ladharam and Bhaoo Lilaram were the pioneers of the school. Later, many people from the community, many of them being alumni, made huge donations over the years and continue to do so even today which has helped the school to grow what it is today,” said G V Moorjani, secretary of the Sindhu Vidya Mandal Trust that manages the school. Ladharam’s nonagenarian daughter, Duru Desai, is the managing trustee. The school shut the Sindhi medium in 2009 as there were very few takers, but students from within the community and others who cannot afford continue to receive subsidized education thanks to the donors, some of whom had received a similar benefit while they were students under Ladharam. “There were many students including myself, who could not afford quarterly fees of Rs 3 then. So, we had to give an application after which the fees which we had paid somehow used to be returned. So, this was the real social service started by Dada Ladharam,” said Dr Ram Buxani, a businessman based in Dubai now. “Today, I am well off and am trying to ensure that more and more children take benefit of education from this school,” Buxani added. In 2000, the trust also started the Asha Special Education Centre for children with special needs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/alumni-carry-on-sindhi-teachers-70-year-old-legacy/articleshow/85935037.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Ranchi||Amid 3rd wave fears, low-key Vishwakarma puja celebrations likely||Ranchi: Vishwakarma Puja celebrations will be a low-key affair in the state this year as industrialists said that keeping the probable third wave in mind they are going to keep it simple. Talking to TOI, president of Jharkhand Small Industries Association (JSIA) Philip Mathew said: “We are yet to receive any guidelines from the state government regarding Vishwakarma Puja celebrations. However, keeping the Covid-19 pandemic in mind the celebrations will be a low-key affair and will be organised strictly in accordance with social distancing norms.” On being asked about the current situation of mining and other manufacturing industries in the state, Mathew said that the other reason behind modest celebration is the huge losses companies across various sectors have suffered due to lockdown and subsequent government policies. “The mining industry has been down for the last two years as the consumption by allied industries has decreased substantially due to the pandemic and the lockdown. Even now the business of the automobile industry hasn’t picked up pace and they are still working with a partial workforce as the demand is low. Steel industry has suffered losses as prices of raw materials have increased,” said Mathew. A few other members of industry association said that they used to organise community luncheon as the celebrations used to be grand. But people are scared this time after second wave and they do not want the third wave to arrive. “We are going to avoid gatherings, lunches with staff and family as we too have lost many among us. All celebrations will be done following Covid-19 protocols,” said another member of JSIA. Transporters too said that they would be doing puja but the celebrations will be a modest affair. Vice-president of FJCCI and a leading transporter from state Kishore Mantri said: “We have suffered huge losses in the last two years and with the state government increasing several taxes and operational costs we are not in a position to enjoy.” “How do we celebrate when our income has been affected adversely? We used to offer gifts to our staff handling buses and other automobiles but this year all that will not be there and we will just perform a puja,” Mantri added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/amid-3rd-wave-fears-low-key-vishwakarma-puja-celebrations-likely/articleshow/85934869.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ghaziabad||Mystery stabber on prowl in Ghaziabad, enters two houses, attacks 2 women with knife||GHAZIABAD: Knife attacks on two women in the last two days have triggered a manhunt for a mystery assailant, believed to be a man in his 20s. In both cases, the attacker entered the women’s houses and stabbed them in their sleep. In the city’s Maharajpur area, where the stabbings happened, police have stepped up patrols and local residents are taking turns to put up night vigils, fearing a deranged attacker is on the loose. While police are yet to identify the suspect, the use of a similar modus operandi indicates it could be the handiwork of the same person. The CCTV footage from one of the incidents, police said, indicated that the accused could be aged between 20 and 25 years. The first attack, police said, was reported on Thursday afternoon when a local resident, Shehnaj (27), was stabbed with a kitchen knife in the head, while she was sleeping at her ground-floor house. “Around 3.40 pm on Thursday, my wife was alone in the house. She had fallen asleep while leaving the main door ajar. The attacker crept in, picked up a kitchen knife from our house and stabbed Shehnaj in the temple, just inches away from her right eye, before trying to flee. Even with the knife piercing her head, Shehnaj tried to give him a chase but collapsed a few metres away,” Aslam, the woman’s husband, said. The woman was taken to a private hospital by a passerby where she underwent an hour-long surgery to remove the knife. “The attacker narrowly missed her right eye,” said Aslam, an e-rickshaw driver, adding that though she was out of danger, it’s a long road to recovery. Cops at Link Road police station have obtained CCTV camera footage of the incident from an adjacent building. In the footage, a youth, wearing shorts, is seen running out of the house, police said. A few seconds later, Shehnaj is also spotted trying to give her attacker a chase. In the second incident, Hasmena Khatun (23), who lives a few blocks away from Shehnaj, was stabbed in her face on Friday evening. Ran Singh, the station house officer (SHO) of Link Road, said, “The second attack took place around 7 pm. It seems the attacker had sneaked into Khatun’s fourth-floor house while she was asleep and stabbed her in the face with a kitchen knife. The woman has suffered injuries and had to be rushed to a local hospital.” Police said there was no evidence of the attacks or the victims being connected in any way. “We have questioned the two families and neighbours. It seems that the attacker is mentally deranged because there is no hint of personal enmity and the victims are random,” Singh said. While the condition of both women is currently stable, the twin attacks have created panic in the locality with people wary of stepping outside their houses. “Residents of Maharajpur, especially women and children, are quite shaken following the back-to-back knife attacks. We are taking turns to guard the locality, mostly at night. Residents have also been advised to keep their doors locked at all times,” Bhavtosh, a local resident, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/mystery-stabber-on-prowl-attacks-2-women/articleshow/85937142.cms||Abhijay Jha

The cabinet, which met on Saturday, approved Karnataka Police (Amendment) Bill which seeks to ban online games involving profit or gain. The move came following complaints from organisations and parents seeking action. “The bill will be tabled in the monsoon session (starting September 13),” law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy said. A month ago, Madras high court had declared a similar law enacted by the Tamil Nadu government to ban online betting games as ultra vires (action of the delegated legislation body that affects fundamental rights guaranteed to the people) to the Constitution. Madhuswamy said all online games played using computers, mobile phones and on social media platforms and betting in the form of tokens, electronic transfer of money and virtual currency will be banned. However, lottery and horse races run on race courses within and outside the state do not come under purview of the bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-to-table-bill-banning-online-gambling/articleshow/85938588.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Gujarat scientist’s work on black holes gets global recognition||VADODARA: Work done by Gujarat’s noted astrophysicist and cosmologist Dr Pankaj Joshi is getting global recognition. The ‘Scientific American’, one of the topmost journal in the world, has published a cover story on ‘Naked Singularities’ in which Joshi’s paper is the very first reference.  Earlier, it was in 2009 that the 150-years-old US magazine had invited Joshi to write a full-length article on his path-breaking research. The article ‘Naked Singularities’ was published as international cover story, translated in more than 20 international languages then.  It was for the first time in seven decades of independent India that an Indian scientific research was published as a cover story in the topmost journal. Joshi’s work is one step ahead of Roger Penrose, who was conferred the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, for his discovery in 1965.  Penrose’s theory was that massive collapsing stars in the universe end up in space-time singularities at the end of their lives. The result was derived using Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Singularities are unique fireballs, where densities, temperatures and all physical quantities are arbitrarily and extremely high. These are such unique entities in cosmos, which are seen at no other places, and yet unknown laws of quantum gravity would operate there.  “Penrose always assumed that such singularities must happen hidden within interiors of blackholes only. That is, they are never seen by faraway observers like us. This assumption is called ‘cosmic censorship’ hypothesis. However, this assumption was never scientifically proved in past many decades,” said Joshi, while taking about his paradigm changing research in blackhole physics.  Work by Joshi, his team and students have shown that singularities or fireballs can occur outside blackholes. “These are also called naked or visible singularities,” said Joshi.  Joshi had written his first paper on the subject in 1986 and then published a whole series of papers on these ‘Fireballs, Naked Singularities and Blackholes’.  This culminated in his 1993 Oxford monograph - `Global aspects in gravitation and cosmology’ - published by the Oxford University Press, included in their famous pre-world war I series, the International series of monographs in physics edited by famous Nobel laureate scientists.  He went on to author more research papers in reputed and topmost international journals resulting in his second research monograph – ‘Gravitational collapse and spacetime singularities’ - published by the Cambridge University Press , a world famous series in which Stephan Hawking also wrote his monograph. Joshi’s article was also included in ‘Extreme physics’, a SciAm special issue where top 16 research stories of the decade were authored by the likes of Hawking as well. The publication had generated so much of excitement that an American lawyer wrote a novel – ‘Naked singularity’ which has also turned into a movie now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/gujarat-scientists-work-on-black-holes-gets-global-recognition/articleshow/85935087.cms||Prashant Rupera

The average daily deaths in August was 24, which is around 51% less than the figure in July, and 87% lower than June. To grasp the magnitude of decline, contrast these numbers with May, the deadliest month so far. In that month, Karnataka lost at least 437 people on average each day — a 1,700% rise over the toll in August. As of September 3, the state had recorded 37,380 Covid-19 deaths at the rate of 68 deaths per day over the two Covid waves since March 2020. At 1.3, Karnataka has second worst case fatality rateBengaluru, which accounts for 43% of all deaths in the state, has seen a decline in fatalities in August: at 121, it’s in fact, lower than even March (140). In August, the capital saw nearly four deaths per day compared to nearly eight a day in July. In contrast, the figure was 76 in June and 225 in May. Compared to May, average daily deaths in August were nearly 100% lower. As of September 3, the total deaths in Bengaluru stood at 16,012, that’s 29 deaths a day over the two Covid waves since March 2020. Other than Bengaluru, seven districts have a toll exceeding 1,000. Mysuru leads the table with 2,364 deaths, followed by Ballari (1,689), Dakshina Kannada (1,583), Dharwad (1,299), Hassan (1,227), Tumakuru (1,099) and Shivamogga (1,075). Case fatality rate among top statesPublic health experts have been pointing out from the first wave peak that any response strategy must focus on keeping deaths to a minimum. But Karnataka, like many other states — Maharashtra being an exception as it had high fatality in both waves — missed out on that during the second wave. As on date, Karnataka’s overall case fatality rate (CFR), percentage of deaths among those infected, is nearly 1.3. Among the states with the five most overall infections — Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh — Karnataka jointly has the second worst CFR along with Tamil Nadu. Kerala with a CFR of 0.5 ranks first, followed by Andhra (0.6), Maharashtra is the worst with the fatality rate at 2.1, followed by Karnataka and TN. The CFR in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is 1.3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-covid-19-toll-under-1k-in-august-lowest-in-5-months/articleshow/85937773.cms||Chethan Kumar

Additional PP Pravin Faldesai said that the matter seeking leave to appeal against the order of acquittal is pending before the high court. “The case concerns the acquittal of the accused in a rape matter. The case is very important for the state of Goa and also the public at large, and has wide ramifications on the law and conduct of rape cases,” he said. In this appeal, the state has been represented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who is based in Delhi. Thus, since the high court is now hearing matters physically, it is difficult for Mehta to travel to Goa to physically appear before the high court, the application states. The high court, in its order dated August 10, allowed the parties involved to approach its chief justice to present this request. “The present matter may be conducted via video-conferencing hearing in furtherance of justice and equity,” the state said. On August 10, Tejpal’s counsel told the high court that the state’s appeal challenging his acquittal is “defective” on grounds of maintainability, and sought that the case be heard in-camera.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/conduct-virtual-hearing-in-tejpal-case-state-to-hc/articleshow/85935773.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||You’re the root cause of farm laws problem, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh tells Sukhbir Singh Badal||CHANDIGARH: Ridiculing the Akali Dal decision to set up a panel to hold talks with the state’s angry farmers, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday said no overtures could absolve the Badals of their responsibility in thrusting the “draconian and undemocratic” farm laws on the farming community. Considering that the Badals themselves were at the root of the problem, and the “co-conspirators” of the Centre’s anti-farmer agenda, the Akalis neither deserve nor can expect any understanding or forgiveness from the farmers, he alleged. “The Akalis’ apathy towards the farmers was evident from the fact that even now, instead of understanding and relating with the pain of the farmers, Sukhbir was refusing to simply recognise the protesters as farmers and was insulting them by alleging that they owed allegiance to other political parties, including the Congress,” said Amarinder. “If you (Sukhbir) cannot even recognise a farmer when you see one how can you ever hope to gain their trust and confidence,” asked the chief minister, adding that only a true son of Punjab’s soil can empathise with its people and their pain. Amarinder termed Sukhbir Badal’s announcement of suspension of the Shiromani Akali Dal’s election outreach programme and formation of the panel to engage with the farmers as a desperate measure to woo Punjab’s voters ahead of the 2022 assembly polls. “But the farmers, and the people of Punjab are not fools, and your attempts to befool them with lies will backfire on you,” he warned the SAD president. He added that the state had completely and unequivocally rejected the Akalis, who had first looted them for10 years in coalition with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and then cruelly worked hand in glove with them to impose the farm laws on the farmers. The chief minister pointed out that SAD was an “integral part” of the ruling NDA at the Centre all through the laws legislation process, with Harsimrat Badal a member of the Union cabinet which approved the ordinance that spelt the death knell for the farmers. Their dramatic split from the NDA subsequently was nothing but an attempt at eyewash, he said, adding that SAD and BJP were clearly still working in collusion against the interests of Punjab. All that the Badals are interested in is getting back into the saddle by hook or by crook, said Captain Amarinder, adding that having failed in restoring the faith of the farmers with their crocodile tears, the Akalis were now pretending to engage with them. “Why did they not talk to the farmers before allowing their partners in the NDA to bring in the black laws,” he asked, pointing out that even after the ordinances were introduced, the Badals had refused adamantly to pay heed to the farmers’ concerns and had, instead, vigorously defended the laws for several months. Terming Sukhbir’s statement on ‘removing all misunderstandings’ by talking to farmer organisations’ as ludicrous, Amarinder said that there were no misunderstandings among the farmers about SAD’s role in the entire farm laws affair, which was a clear and brazen conspiracy on the part of the BJP to appease their capitalist crony friends at the cost of the farming community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/youre-the-root-cause-of-the-farm-laws-problem-amarinder-to-sukhbir/articleshow/85937800.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Akalis go full throttle to gain lost ground in Majha||Amritsar: As the 2022 Punjab assembly elections near, a fractured SAD (B), which has already lost its ‘Majhe da Jarnail’ and other stalwarts, has gone full throttle in Majha to regain its lost political ground Taking a lead over its rivals, the party has already launched a door-to-door campaign to apprise their vote bank about its election manifesto, a move primarily to counter the dent made by the Congress as well as the AAP. The leaders of both the ruling and opposition parties in the state have been making tempting promises to the people. But apparently, more than intriguing assurances and promise of freebies, the voters of Punjab expect their elected government to rein in criminal violence, including gang wars, kidnapping, extortion besides drug abuse and drug-related crimes, which have called for a more focused approach of the government to tackle these evils. “Our findings have revealed that Majha in Punjab has emerged as a centre of drug abuse due to its proximity with international border with Pakistan, rise of gangster culture and the failure of police to effectively tackle crime,” claimed political analyst Sarabjit Singh. Akalis would have to win the voters’ confidence and assure them to break the police-politician nexus, he said. Four districts of Majha — Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran and Pathankot — has 11, seven, four and three assembly seats, respectively, out of which Akalis won only on two seats of Majitha and Batala that are represented by Bikram Singh Majithia and Lakhbir Singh Lodhinanagal, respectively. The exit of senior Akali leaders, including Ranjit Singh Brahampura, also known as ‘Majhe da Jarnail’, Dr Rattan Singh Ajnala and Sewa Singh Sekhwan who left SAD (B) to form their own parties or shifted loyalty to other political outfits as in the case of Sekhwan who recently joined AAP, had created a void in the region, which was filled by Majithia. The entire Akali politics of Majha now revolves around him. Major issues concerning the Akalis included missing of 328 saroops of Guru Granth Sahib and international drug racket, which are presently lying dormant due to the farmers’ struggle, but are likely to be raked up ahead of beginning of the political campaign. Sarabjit, who is also the chief investigator of Punjab Human Rights Organizations, said the Akalis would have to explain the whereabouts of 328 saroops since the party was behind all major decisions taken by the SGPC. Besides, SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur is herself a former Akali minister, he pointed out. He said Majha region of Punjab has made a major contribution in almost every sphere and was of much importance to all parties, including SAD (B). According to senior Akali leader Gurpartap Singh Tikka, SAD (B) has launched a door-to-door campaign to disseminate information about its recently launched 13-point manifesto for the 2022 assembly polls to counter “assurances” campaigns of AAP and Congress. Asked whether party’s Panthic face was diluted with the induction of non-Sikhs, Tikka, who is also president of SAD (B) Amritsar, replied that a few Taksalis think so, but the social engineering had immensely benefited the Sikhs living outside Punjab. Besides, he added, Sikhism didn’t differentiate people on the basis of caste and religion. Stating that SAD (B) and SGPC were inseparable, Tikka said the former had extended support to the latter in delivering various services for the welfare of people during the pandemic. “People should also recognise the party’s relentless service, rather than just criticising it,” he said. Sources in SAD (B) said the party needs to launch an extensive campaign to counter the campaign of other political parties. “For example, AAP is propagating its achievements in Delhi and assuring to replicate them in Punjab. But how many people have seen AAP’s developments in Delhi? Here is what we need to counter them as well as Congress,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/akalis-go-full-throttle-to-gain-lost-ground-in-majha/articleshow/85937867.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Chandigarh||2 ‘dissident’ ministers write to CM, want Batala upgraded to district||Chandigarh: Two cabinet ministers who had raised a banner of revolt against chief minister Amarinder Singh – Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa – on Saturday demanded that Batala should be created as the 24th district of Punjab in view of the wish of the locals and for overall development of this area. Interestingly, the two ministers have sought time to meet the CM. The move comes in the mid of the internal turmoil in the Punjab Congress and three-time Congress ex-MLA from Batala Ashwani Sekhrihas been recently appointed as the chairman of the Punjab Health Systems Corporation amid regrouping in the Congress. He had earlier threatened to join the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) because of the “continued interference of cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa in his domain.” Meanwhile, the two ministers have written to the chief minister in this regard, underlining that Batala was a historic town but did not get the focus it deserved. In a press statement, the two ministers also said along with this, the historic towns of Fatehgarh Churian and Sri Hargobindpur or Ghuman should be made new sub-divisions of this new district. Bajwa is the MLA from Fatehgarh Churian. The ministers pointed out that Batala was an important city of Punjab with which rich historical, religious, social and literary heritage are associated. Batala was the oldest city of Punjab after Bathinda, which was founded in 1465 and also the eighth largest city in the state in terms of population where a municipal corporation was formed last year. Stressing upon the historical heritage of Batala, they said, “Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the first Guru, was married to Mata Sulakhni in this city on July 8, 1487. Gurdwara Dera Sahib and Gurdwara Kandh Sahib are adorned in his memory. Guru Hargobind, the sixth master, also came to Batala to marry off his son Baba Gurditta and in his memory Gurdwara Sat Kartaria is adorned in the middle of the city. Both the ministers said Batala was an important city of the Sikh Empire after Lahore and Amritsar during the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. They said apart from the historic Kali Dwara Mandir and Sati Lakshmi Devi Samadh, near this city is the historic site of Achal Sahib where Achaleshwar Dham is adorned in the memory of Lord Shiva’s son Kartik. Guru Nanak Dev also interacted with Sidhs at this historic place. . The ministers said, “From a cultural and literary point of view, there is no Punjabi across the globe who has not heard the name of the great Punjabi poet Shiv Kumar who added Batalvi to his name thereby adding to its eminence. The late poet is known in the literary field as Birha’s poet and Punjabi’s Keats.” Ministers seek early appointment What raised eyebrows was that the two ministers have sought ‘early appointment’ from the chief ministers, even though the Council of Ministers is believed to have direct access to the CM and also frequently interact during cabinet meetings. The last meeting was held through video conferencing due to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2-dissident-ministers-write-to-cm-want-batala-upgraded-to-district/articleshow/85937879.cms||---
---||Goa||Govt to place on record docus in dhirios plea||Panaji: The state government has told the high court that it will place on record certain documents in a plea alleging contempt of court in view of bullfights in Goa. “It is alleged on basis of certain articles published in the press and on social media that bullfights are taking place in Goa in the teeth of judgment of this Court dated Dec 20,1996 and, therefore, present contempt petition deserves to be entertained,” Justices Manish Pitale and M S Jawalkar said. People for Animals, a society, through its president Norma Alvares submitted to the high court that state authorities have been lacking in proactively enforcing the ban on bullfights and added that there has been an unprecedented increase in bullfights since the Covid-19 lockdowns began to be lifted. The petitioner stated that bullfights have become a regular occurrence in some villages - notably in Cansaulim, Colva, Utorda, Benaulim and Varca in South Goa and Arambol and Mandrem in North Goa – with several bullfights being held on a weekly basis. “Despite the presence of vast crowds, the government and police do not appear to be aware of the same. At any rate, there has been little effort to stop them. Hence this contempt petition,” the petition submitted to the high court. People for Animals attached several news reports to the court, including at least six news reports by TOI between January and August 2021, on bullfights taking place around Goa and bulls dying as a result. The NGO has stated that despite high court directions banning organising of bullfights, and directions to the government to take effective steps to enforce the ban, authorities are “turning a complete blind eye to such illegal organising of bullfights” due to which there is an unprecedented rise recently. The NGO and other citizens and organisations have lodged many police complaints against reported bullfights with complaints from Govansh Raksha Abhiyan Goa to collectors of both districts. “Even when citizens have been able to give advance notice of impending fights, the police have no preventive plan. They generally say they are short staffed. Moreover, the fights have shifted to early morning to escape detection,” the NGO stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-place-on-record-docus-in-dhirios-plea/articleshow/85936078.cms||---

The two-hour long rescue operation involved 30 lifeguards led by Drishti deputy manager Shashikant Jadhav. The Drishti lifesaving team received a call at around 9.30pm from a local fisherman that a boat with several fishermen onboard had capsized off Velsao. A 30-member team of lifeguards quickly launched a search and rescue operation.  Two jetskis were pressed into action and two all-terrain vehicles equipped with oxygen tanks and first aid kits were kept on standby. An ambulance back-up was also called for in case of any emergency. Pitch dark conditions, gusty winds, choppy waters and undercurrents made the operation a challenging one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fishermen-rescued-as-boat-capsizes-off-velsao/articleshow/85936202.cms||---

The state government is under pressure from various groups and BJP legislators to grant relaxation. At the cabinet meeting, many ministers reportedly batted for allowing public celebrations. Some apparently said Bommai should end night and weekend curfews that are still in place in some districts. “We discussed in detail about allowing celebrations. The CM will take the final call after deliberations with experts,” said law & parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy, adding a meeting was scheduled on Sunday. The cabinet has sanctioned Rs 17.7 crore for medicines and medical equipment as part of preparations for the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-govt-may-ease-norms-for-ganesha-festival/articleshow/85939883.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Robber files plaint against crowd for attacking him||BENGALURU: In a bizarre twist, an armed robber lodged a police complaint alleging physical assault by passersby who tried to overpower and nab him on Richmond Road two days ago. He wants the cops to act against those who attacked him. Ritesh Jayakumar, 18, of Domlur was caught on camera in the afternoon of September 2 while escaping after a failed robbery bid. Brandishing a knife, he had barged into a cab parked by the roadside and threatened driver Pratap Patil if he didn’t part with his mobile phone and cash. But Jayakumar’s plan did not work as Patil pushed him out of the vehicle and shouted for help. A few passersby and motorists rushed to Patil’s aid and attempted to nab Jayakumar. However, in the melee, the thief tried to slash the people with his knife. When he turned aggressive, the crowd landed him a few blows. One motorist, in fact, grabbed Jayakumar’s arm and another hit him with a helmet and a log. Yet, Jayakumar escaped by taking advantage of the traffic snarl on the road. Following this, Patil lodged a police complaint on the robbery attempt. “We tracked the injured robber and booked him under under IPC sections 393 (attempt to commit robbery) and 398 (attempt to commit robbery or dacoity when armed with deadly weapon),” a police officer said. But in his counter-complaint to cops, Jayakumar reportedly said: “I tried to rob a cabbie who was sitting in his vehicle in Richmond Town around 4pm by threatening him at knife-point. I wanted to snatch his mobile and wallet. But he escaped and shouted for help. Hearing his screams, 30-40 men surrounded and beat me up. I sustained injuries on my head, lips, hands and legs. I seek legal action against unknown persons for attacking and beating me.” Following his complaint, police booked a case under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 341 (wrongful restraint) against the crowd. When questions were raised as to how cops could book a case against those who risked their lives to catch an armed robber, an officer said: “It is the duty of police to register an FIR when a complaint is filed. We seek public cooperation in catching miscreants, but we also request people not to take law in their hands by beating up suspects.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/robber-files-plaint-against-crowd-for-attacking-him/articleshow/85934217.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Kolkata||In first N Bengal defection, BJP’s Kaliaganj MLA joins Trinamool||Kolkata: The BJP’s Kaliaganj MLA Soumen Roy joined Trinamool Congress in the presence of party general secretary Partha Chatterjee in Kolkata on Saturday, effecting the first legislative wing defection in north Bengal and the fourth in the state, bringing down the saffron party’s MLA tally to 71. Earlier, Mukul Roy, Tanmoy Ghosh and Biswajit Das had joined Trinamool despite efforts by Bengal BJP leaders to keep the party flock together. Soumen, a Mukul Roy loyalist, had joined the BJP after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls just like Bada MLA Das. After taking the TMC flag from Chatterjee, he apologised for leaving the Trinamool. “Even after I quit Trinamool, my mind and soul was with the party. I do not subscribe to the divisive ideology of the BJP. I want to be a part of the development work Didi has taken up in north Bengal. The state’s culture doesn’t match with the BJP’s culture,” he said. The MLA had run into a controversy after the BJP gave him a ticket from Kaliaganj assembly seat. Party leaders had a tough time persuading the cadre in North Dinajpur to work with him. BJP workers had dubbed him an “outsider”, coming from Jalpaiguri. Even Soumen’s wife ran a social media campaign against him during the polls. Yet, the BJP brass was against making a last-minute change because he belonged to the Rajbanshi community. Soumen, however, was not comfortable in the BJP particularly after Mukul and his son Subhrangsu returned to Trinamool. Leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari said: “Some people can leave the party (BJP) and think that they will remain with the ruling party. We will follow the same procedure that we follow with other defectors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-first-n-bengal-defection-bjps-kaliaganj-mla-joins-trinamool/articleshow/85935982.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Visva-Bharati resumes admission process, merit list date to be declared soon||SANTINIKETAN: Visva-Bharati will announce the date for publication of the merit list for undergraduate admission next week. University officials are yet to decide if they should stick to the original September 7 schedule or defer it by a few days. The varsity, which had suspended admissions on August 30 in the wake of a student agitation, resumed work following Calcutta High Court’s Friday order, which barred protests in “key areas” on the campus. Members of staff reported for duty at the central administrative and admission offices on Saturday, a holiday in the university calendar. The attendance was regular in emergency departments too. “We came to office freely, without any obstruction,” a Visva-Bharati employee said. According to sources, vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty didn’t attend office even though the student dharna had been shifted far from his residence and close to the varsity guest house at Purba Palli. In keeping with the court order, counsel for the three rusticated students Shamim Ahmed visited the campus on Friday evening to get a first-hand account of the ground situation while acting registrar Ashok Mahato will submit a compliance report on Monday. Birbhum SP Nagendra Tripathi has already submitted his compliance report in court. Visva-Bharati authorities have already raised objections to the new dharna site. “We told police on Friday that the new site was deep inside the campus. It could hamper administrative work. We will submit our report in court on Monday,” an official said. Students argued that they had shifted the dharna 50 metres away from the VC’s residence, the central administrative zone, classrooms and the central library as directed by the high court. Meanwhile, Trinamool Chhatra Parishad took out a rally from Bolpur to Dak Bungalow More on Saturday in support of the ‘Bhango Achalayatan’ call given online by agitating students who had urged teachers and civil society members to back their movement against the “authoritarian steps” and “acts of vengeance” of the vice-chancellor. The rally ended near the international guest house from where a few leaders went to the dharna site and distributed food packets among protesters. Two other outfits — AIDSO and Bangla Paksha — also took out rallies in Bolpur town. Bolpur Trinamool leader Anubrata Mandal, against whom Visva-Bharati complained in its writ petition, said: “We won’t spare the VC, especially when he has done the students harm.” A section of Santiniketan ashramites resented the way things took a turn at Visva-Bharati. They felt that “political parties from outside” couldn’t have had access had the Visva-Bharati authorities engaged with the accused students before taking the “ultimate step”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vb-resumes-admission-process-merit-list-date-to-be-declared-soon/articleshow/85935875.cms||Someswar Boral
---||Kolkata||It’s time to say buy-buy||Kolkata: There’s almost nothing that a little bit of shopping can’t fix and when a pandemic turns you into a homebody, new appliances are bound to be a blessing. This is precisely what retail leaders in consumer electronics are hoping to cash in on in the run-up to the festive season in Kolkata and elsewhere. They are rolling out a bouquet of offers — online and offline — to woo, wow and win shoppers. Prerna Khosla GuptaIn April last year, Khosla Electronics had launched its e-commerce site khoslaonline.com and raked in “satisfactory business”. Now, the retail chain is primarily focusing on its offline stores that are likely to see “good footfall” ahead of Durga Puja and Diwali. “Our festive campaigning has begun. We have lucrative EMI schemes and cash-back offers for customers. The main mantra is lowest prices and best service,” said Prerna Khosla Gupta, the digital head and operations manager of Khosla Electronics. The consumer electronics chain, which debuted in 1987 and has 50 outlets across Bengal, is planning to launch four more before Puja. The stores have seen products like dishwashers and laptops fly off shelves in the recent past, and are likely to see a surge in demand for smart TVs and phones amid a growing addiction to OTT content platforms such as Netflix. According to Great Eastern Retail director Pulkit Baid, shoppers have rarely ever disappointed marketers during the festive season. “We hope this year will be no exception. We are going to unwrap some exciting offers for our customers soon. Price parity between online and offline purchases is expected to reduce migration,” he said, indicating that buyers keen on demo would likely make a beeline for offline stores. Pulkit BaidGreat Eastern, which began its journey in 1996, has around 34 outlets in the state and is planning six more soon. “We deal with 40 companies — Samsung, LG, Sony, Apple and Vivo to name a few. We are the only retailer to display 1,000 appliances at our Dalhousie store. We are also the only retailer to offer 100km free home delivery — even to remote areas — and our deals are 100% better than online ones,” Baid said. Baid maintained that amid the pandemic, they focused on keeping employees healthy and connecting with consumers online. “We brought down costs and created a lean structure to fight the revenue that was lost owing to the lockdown. Our increased digital presence, both in sales and marketing, helped us reach out to consumers. We gave them the best shopping experience. Dishwashers, laptops and vacuum cleaners saw an unprecedented demand,” he said. Abhishek JainBorn in 1964, Sales Emporium is proud to be old school and is still cashing in on its “emotional bond” with customers. The retail chain boasts 10 outlets in north and south Kolkata. “The pandemic had hit our business hard. We came up with various offers to stay afloat. Festive sales are likely to be satisfactory. We are operating at a low profit margin, maintaining competitive prices and using telecallers to retain customers,” said Abhishek Jain, a partner at Sales Emporium. Jain conceded that home appliance and gadget costs had gone up owing to import restrictions while proliferation of e-commerce too had dealt a heavy blow to offline businesses. “Luckily, washing machines, LED TVs, air conditioners, dishwashers, laptops and mobile phones are still in demand at our stores,” he said. Rajinder Singh RaipurRaipur Electronics, which has 25 showrooms in Kolkata, Howrah, Hooghly, North 24 Parganas, Midnapore, Nadia and Burdwan, is keeping its fingers crossed for “a massive growth” during the festive season. Director Rajinder Singh Raipur said special offers had helped them keep the customer base intact. “We survived the economic slowdown (last year) by reducing unwanted expenses and passing on the same cost-cutting benefits to our customers along with additional discounts and offers. Despite all such measures, our business was affected to some extent too. It prompted us to develop an online platform and boost sales.” Singh added: “Our trained retail professionals and a team of over 750 counter personnel, service staff and back-end support staff are working round the clock to deliver what people need; and that too at the most competitive prices. Laptops, mobile phones, washing machines and dishwashers have been in high demand amid the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/its-time-to-say-buy-buy/articleshow/85937973.cms||---

The HC had handed over the investigation into alleged cases of murder and atrocities against women to the CBI on August 19. The agency formed teams that visited alleged crime scenes, spoke to families of victims as well as police officers and registered 34 FIRs. In the past eight days, five persons have been arrested and charge sheets filed in two cases. Earlier this week, the Bengal government had moved the Supreme Court against the HC order, saying the CBI investigation could turn into an avenue for political witch-hunting. The agency, sources said, may submit a report in the court soon. Meanwhile, a CBI team reached Chilakhana in Cooch Behar on Saturday morning to investigate the death of Trinamool Congress worker Shahinur Rehman. The 32-year-old was allegedly hacked to death by a group of BJP workers on May 5. The CBI team had registered a case last month. Now, it tried to recreate the sequence of events that led to Rehman’s alleged abduction and murder. The sleuths, who have already quizzed the IO in the case, spoke to family members too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/post-poll-violence-cbi-teams-review-probe-progress-at-e-meet-with-hq/articleshow/85935825.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Coal scam: ED raids offices in Dalhousie, Park St||Kolkata: The Enforcement Directorate on Saturday conducted raids across several office premises in the city, including three in Dalhousie, Park Street and Lindsay Street, in connection with illegal coal mining in the state. A marathon search was conducted at the office of a travel agency in Dalhousie while a company listed on the stock exchange was raided in Park Street. In April this year, the ED had attached properties worth Rs 165 crore of two companies jointly owned by key coal scam accused Anup Majee, alias Lala. During investigations, officials came across several bank accounts which, the ED believes, were used to stash the ill-gotten money. Teams searched the office premises used by Lala and his close aides. The key accused had opened a chain of shell companies to route the money he had allegedly siphoned off from the illegal coal trade. He had invested in sponge iron manufacturing units, rolling mills, silicate factories and hard coke manufacturing units. Investigators have reasons to believe that Lala is “jointly associated” with the Park Street company, along with another director who may be “involved” with “a chain of companies” in Kolkata. They are now trying to track the money route. Majee had earlier moved the Supreme Court against a Calcutta High Court order directing a CBI probe into illegal coal mining “without the state’s consent”. The apex court adjourned the hearing for two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/coal-scam-ed-raids-offices-in-dalhousie-park-st/articleshow/85936569.cms||Rohit Khanna

She was keen on buying one that would help her seamlessly attend online classes. At the same market, IT professional Abhik Ghosh bought a new smartphone to ensure his work-from-home needs were met without a glitch. Nafisa and Abhik are among several students and young professionals who are driving gadget sales amid the pandemic, when remote working, e-lectures and even virtual PTMs are norms. “We don’t know when schools will reopen. There was a time when parents warned us against extensive gadget use. Now, the pandemic has given us the licence to own the best in the market,” said Nafisa, a student of Our Lady Queen of the Missions School. Abhik admitted that a laptop and a mobile phone had become the “most important things” in his life over the past year along with “reliable” internet connectivity. “My phone wasn’t properly working and I had to immediately buy a new one,” he added. While the Covid lockdown took a toll on most businesses, many shops at this Chandni Chowk mall made hay because gadgets kept the world going. “During the first wave, the demand had plummeted. But, once WFH became the norm, the sale of smartphones, tablets and laptops picked up. The demand is still rising,” said Bhaskar Bhattacharya, manager, Bard Roy Infotech Pvt Ltd. There has also been a paradigm shift in consumer behaviour because of lifestyle changes. With health and wellness practices gaining ground, the demand for wearable electronics has gone up. “Many people are buying smartwatches and fitness trackers that facilitate monitoring of oxygen saturation, sleep cycle, steps covered, calorie consumption and heart rate, among other things,” said Suman Paul Roy, an employee at Bhajanlal Commercial Pvt Ltd. Gaming peripherals are witnessing a huge demand too. “Being confined indoors has prompted many to take extra interest in video games. Before Covid, we hosted in-store gaming tournaments. Now, we have expanded our presence online,” said Amit Dey, an employee at Republic of Gamers, an exclusive gaming store that opened in Kolkata in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/work-from-home-online-classes-drive-gadget-sales/articleshow/85937434.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari called by CID in guard’s death case||KOLKATA: The state CID has summoned leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari for questioning on Monday in connection with the death of his security guard Subhabrata Chakraborty, a sub-inspector with the State Armed Police who was found with gunshot injuries in his head in the police barracks adjacent to Adhikari’s residence in Contai on October 13, 2018. The SI succumbed to injuries a few days later. The senior BJP leader has been asked to be present at CID’s Bhawani Bhavan headquarters at 11am. The CID, however, had not issued a formal statement in this regard till late night. Adhikari could not be reached for comments. The development comes exactly a week after the Enforcement Directorate called senior Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee, his wife and aides for questioning in the illegal coal-mining case. A special CID team is probing the SI’s death on a complaint by his widow and has already questioned over a dozen people, including 11 cops, over the past three months. This is the first time Adhikari has been summoned in the case. The CID had visited the police barrack a few metres from his residence several times in the case. The politician’s brother and Tamluk MP, Dibyendu Adhikari, has twice interacted with the investigators. There were indications that Suvendu would be summoned after the CID insisted that everyone who was at Contai Hospital the day Chakraborty passed away would be questioned. According to sources, the decision to summon Adhikari comes after marathon interrogation of cops who were present at the police barracks when SI Chakraborty was found with gunshot injuries, sources said. The case was initially closed but after the Bengal polls, Chakraborty’s school teacher wife lodged a fresh complaint urging that the case be probed afresh and questioning the role of Adhikari and his aides in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suvendu-called-by-cid-in-guards-death-case/articleshow/85936697.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The man, who his mother said was suffering from mental illness, was sent for treatment. Chhabi Pujari, a resident of Kuapur in Chandrakona, had to resort to begging to make ends meet after she lost her husband years ago. As her son disturbed neighbours when she was away, the woman decided to chain him up. “What else could I have done? We have been living in a broken house since my husband passed away. There is no source of income. I have to make a living by begging throughout the day. I never wanted to chain my son. It hurts me too. But how can I stop him from creating trouble for others when I am away?” she said. Amit Ghosh, block development officer of the area, said: “The family has a Swasthya Sathi card, but they are yet to avail the benefits. We will also look into if they were getting benefits of schemes like Lakshmir Bhandar.” Panchayat samiti head Hiralal Ghosh said: “We will try to make arrangements for the son’s treatment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mentally-ill-man-chained-to-pole-rescued-in-midnapore/articleshow/85937296.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Guwahati||Get vaccinated or face pay cuts, Assam health minister Keshab Mahanta tells govt staff||GUWAHATI: Assam health minister Keshab Mahanta on Saturday said state government officials will face pay cuts from Monday if they fail to attend office due to lack of vaccination. “If some government officials fail to attend office for not being vaccinated, such officials will face pay cuts,” Mahanta said. He added that government officials can not skip duty citing “vaccine shortage”. Mahanta added that no staff in government offices, educational institutions or commercial establishments will be allowed to enter their workplace unless they get themselves vaccinated with at least the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. “From Monday, in front of every government office, educational institutions, a self-declaration must be installed confirming ‘we are all vaccinated’. Everyone inside these premises should get vaccinated with the first dose at least,” said Mahanta. He added that even private sector offices will have to hang a banner, confirming that their staff have been inoculated. The same instructions will be applicable for commercial institutions as well. “Wrong information in the self-declaration will be a punishable offence. Every DC has been entrusted with the responsibility to keep vigil in their respective districts and ascertain the vaccination status in government offices under his or her jurisdiction, private offices and market areas,” Mahanta said, cautioning that commercial establishments flouting the directive will be sealed by the district authorities. Even as active cases in the state have declined to around 5,000, the minister said the second wave is not yet over in Assam and the state is facing the threat of a third wave. Despite ample relaxations given in Covid curbs, Mahanta said the government will be stricter to ensure that virus doesn’t take a toll again. Vaccination has gained momentum in the state with about 2.18 lakh getting vaccinated on Saturday itself. Of the 2.31 crore 18+ citizens eligible for vaccination, around 1.5 crore (1,50,70,749) have been inoculated with the first dose. Around 33.19 lakh (33,19,255) have got the second jab. In Assam, more than government offices, the prime focus is on reopening schools for Class XII, graduation and post-graduation final year students from Monday. Minimum single-dose vaccination for all is mandatory on campuses, except Class XII students below 18 years. Even as Thursday, Friday and Saturday were earmarked for vaccination on campuses, most school and college heads have put the onus on teachers, non-teaching staff and students to get inoculated at their own capacity in vaccination centres outside. Though the state government has allowed the reopening of educational institutions from Monday, a supplementary SOP published by the state education department has clarified that the educational institutions will get closed if the positivity rate in that district crosses 2%. The SOP also stated that whenever multiple Covid-19 positive cases are detected in educational institutions, these will be closed for seven days. It has been directed by the education department that a physical distance of at least 6 feet is followed while preparing sitting arrangements in the classrooms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/vaccinate-and-come-to-office-or-suffer-pay-cuts-assam-minister-tells-govt-staff/articleshow/85932257.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Agartala||Tripura RSS leader held in ‘minor abduction’ case||AGARTALA: An RSS leader has been arrested in connection with the alleged kidnapping of a minor girl from Charilam of Bishalgarh in Sepahijala district on July 24. The girl was allegedly abducted while she was returning home from her private tuition classes, said police. Police added that RSS leader Tapan Debnath, a resident of the Indranagar area of Agartala, was arrested on Friday, a day after the president of the Viswa Hindu Parishad (VHP) state unit Chandra Sekhar Kar was detained for his alleged involvement in the abduction case. According to police, the 16-year-old girl, belonging to the Muslim community, was abducted by a 23-year-old youth, Suman Sarkar, a resident of Chandantilla area of Bishalgarh. Sarkar reportedly married the girl after converting her to Hinduism, and both Debnath and Kar had allegedly played a role in the entire incident, they added. “So far, we have arrested five people in this connection and got some leads. We hope to rescue the girl soon,” said Superintendent of Police (SP), Sepahijala, Krishnendu Chakraborty. However, the girl has still remained untraceable. During interrogation, the police said, Debnath had admitted that he gave shelter to Sarkar and the minor girl at his sister’s house. After the girl went missing on July 24, her father had filed a missing diary with the police the next day. However, he alleged that the police did not take any step to find her. He then filed a complaint against the police in the high court that said his daughter, a student of Class 9, was returning home from her tuition classes and Sarkar had kidnapped her. It added that the police did not do enough to search for her. Following this, the bench, comprising Justice Akil Kureshi and Justice S G Chattopadhyay, had directed the police to find the girl and report to the court by September 2. But the police failed to meet the deadline. Based on the petition of the victim’s father, the High Court of Tripura registered a writ of habeas corpus and directed Sepahijala SP Chakraborty to produce her before the court from unlawful detention by September 7. The Advocate General apprised the court that all efforts are being made to bring the petitioner’s daughter back. The court said if the girl is found before September 7 and the police have her custody, the state can mention the case for preponing the date. “Till such hearing takes place, the official respondents shall ensure that the girl is kept in safe custody at a women’s protection centre in comfortable and secure surroundings. The custody of the girl shall not be handed over to her parents without the permission of the court,” the court directed the police. Following pressure from the court, the police arrested Sarkar’s father, Falu Sarkar, and a friend. The victim’s father also accused the investigating officer in the case of remaining silent in exchange for a large amount of money from the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/tripura-rss-leader-held-in-minor-abduction-case/articleshow/85933530.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee
---||Kolkata||Five months later, Bhowanipore voters set to ink fingers again||Kolkata: Less than two hours had passed since the Election Commission announced the September 30 bypoll to the Bhowanipore assembly constituency, Trinamool Congress workers started decking up prominent neighbourhoods like Harish Mukherjee Road, Chakraberia, Potuapara and Elgin Road with wall graffiti, flags and banners with some already mentioning Mamata Banerjee as the candidate. A landscaped banner on Harish Mukherjee Street read “Unnayan ghore ghore, ghorer meye Bhowanipore e ”, while one on Asutosh Mukherjee Road near Jadubabu bazar read “Banglar Bhowanipore, Bhowanipore er Mamata”. Another banner on Potuapara read “ Bhowanipore Didikei Chay”. All banners had multiple photographs of Banerjee and the one on Harish Mukherjee Road urged voters to elect her with a massive margin. “We are ready with all election promotional material. Although the party hasn’t officially named Banerjee as candidate, we are certain she will be the one. We are excited to kick off the campaign and deck up Bhowanipore,” said Jhontu Dey, a party whole-timer and close aide of Kamarhati MLA Madan Mitra. Ward 70 councillor Asim Basu was whitewashing a wall on Roy Street in Chakraberia, preparing it to be painted with the TMC symbol. He added that keeping Covid protocols in mind, TMC would stress on banners, hoardings, cutouts and promotional materials behind autos and taxis for the campaign with one or two street-corner meetings maintaining all safety norms. “Mamata Banerjee is a household name and she doesn’t need to be introduced to voters. The Covid situation is absolutely under control in this part of the city but we will try to organise the campaign with least physical presence to ensure strict compliance of Covid protocols,” said Basu. Banerjee, in the past three decades, had always chosen Bhowanipore (also her home), and Kolkata (South) Lok Sabha (of which Bhowanipore is a part) to contest polls. Barring a 176-vote deficit scare in the 2014 Lok Saha polls in Bhowanipore, she has never trailed here. She was a Kolkata (South) MP from 1991 to 2011 and a Bhowanipore MLA from 2011-2021. Some voters didn’t share the enthusiasm though. “We have just seen how an election spiked Covid cases. I am not sure if I would risk standing in queue and vote again,” said a businessman and resident of Elgin Road. Another shopkeeper, Tarun Dutta, however, said the timing was just right. “There are very few Covid cases being reported from our area. Since the bypoll is necessary, this is the best time to hold it just before Pujas,” he said. Actor and BJP leader Rudranil Ghosh, who had contested and lost the election against Sovandeb Chattopadhyay five months ago, criticised the bypoll being held only in three out of seven places. “Does the Election Commission feel Bhowanipore is immune to Covid 19 or do they feel people in Bhowanipore need an MLA and not others? If the party asks me to contest again I will happily fight the election but there have been no such instructions yet,” said Ghosh.

On September 11, the president and First Lady Jill Biden will "honor and memorialize the lives lost 20 years ago," according to the White House statement. They will take part in ceremonies in New York, where the twin towers of the World Trade Center fell; in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the site of a crash of a plane hijacked by four jihadists; and in Arlington, Virginia, where the Pentagon was struck. Biden had been counting on marking the 20th anniversary of the tragedy with a symbolic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. But America's longest war ended in chaos, with the US military unprepared for Taliban's swift takeover of the country and the death of 13 US troops in an attack in Kabul as the pullout was being completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-to-visit-three-sites-of-9/11-attack-on-20th-anniversary/articleshow/85939860.cms||---

Quarantine violators will be fined and legal action will be taken against them, the CM warned. “Only Covid positive persons having independent bathroom facilities at home and with no co-morbidities will be allowed to stay under home quarantine," said the CM. Vijayan said that Covid has now more or less become part of one's life and the need of the hour is to ensure all are vaccinated and go forward observing Covid protocols. “During discussions with experts, they pitched for reopening of schools and opening up of all financial and economic sectors,” he said. “The post-Onam surge in Covid cases has not affected the state as expected. There has been no substantial increase in hospital admissions and new cases. In the last six weeks, hospital admissions have come down. Thus, there is no need for any concern or fear at present,” the CM said. State may get 9.97L doses today: CM Ward-level activities will be strengthened to prevent the spread of Covid from areas where weekly infection population ratio (WIPR) is above 7%. Local bodies have been asked to get the exact data of Covid positive persons under home quarantine, Vijayan said. Ward-level committees will have to ensure that all primary contacts of a positive person are under home quarantine and are not venturing out. The committees have been directed to impose fines, register cases against violators and shift them to quarantine centres. Police’s two-wheeler patrols will be deployed to monitor those in quarantine and police will also have to ensure that essential commodities are reaching families under home quarantine, the CM said. Local bodies should ensure that people who are not having facilities at home for quarantine are shifted to Covid first-line treatment centres, he said. The state currently has only a limited vaccine stock. The Centre has assured that it will dispatch a consignment of 9.97 lakh vaccines on Sunday, Vijayan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/night-curfew-sunday-lockdowns-will-continue-in-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan/articleshow/85940028.cms||---

Though the mosquito population increased in these areas, the vector control unit could not conduct routine surveys to know the density due to Covid pandemic. “The density of culex and armigeres are rising in some places in the corporation area. Insect repellent spraying is held in such places whenever residents raise complaints. We could not do a routine survey due to Covid. Complaints are mostly from interior places of the city. Places where drains are covered with slabs do not report mosquito menace. In some other places, tile and slab works are going on. It is expected that the works will be completed in two months,” said Abdul Jabbar, senior biologist in the vector control unit. Armigeres is commonly seen in evening hours and its bite causes severe itching on the skin. Abdul Jabbar said uninhabited houses are also the breeding ground of mosquitoes in the city. “Stagnated water in these houses is a problem,” he said. The corporation is carrying insecticide spraying measures to address the issue, informs health standing committee chairperson T K Ashraf. “As rain water gushes out of drains, mosquito menace is not rising. The problem is in places where unwanted weeds and waste dumping block the flow. Spraying cannot be done in drains as the insecticide will gush out along with rainwater. We have asked workers not to spray insecticide in drains,” he said. However, with preventive measures, the density of aedes aegypti, which causes dengue fever and chikungunya, has come down thanks to awareness creation among residents. Currently, one or two dengue cases are reported in places which used to report 20 to 25 cases per day.

A delegation of senior Pakistani officials led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lieutenant General Hameed arrived in Kabul to conduct discussions with the incoming Taliban government, the Pakistan Observer newspaper reported. In a short video clip circulated in the media, Hameed is seen trying to respond to questions by a journalist who first asked: “Will you be meeting senior people in the Taliban?” “No, I'm not clear…” the ISI chief said and looked towards Pakistan ambassador to Kabul Mansour Ahmad Khan, who was standing by his side, to respond to the question. But before Khan said anything, the journalist posed another question. “What do you hope is going to happen now in Afghanistan?" he was asked. “I have just landed…,” Hameed said and once again looked towards Khan who quipped: “We are working for peace and stability in Afghanistan.” At this Hameed smiled and said: “Don't worry, everything will be okay.” Hameed's visit to Afghanistan comes as pressure is mounting on the Taliban to form an inclusive government acceptable to the international community. Earlier, Pakistan Observer newspaper reported that the ISI chief was expected to meet the Taliban leaders and commanders. “Issues relating to Pak-Afghan security, economy, and other matters will be taken up with the Taliban leadership,” the report said, quoting sources. It is the first high-level visit of any Pakistani official to Afghanistan since the Taliban took over of Kabul on August 15, in a move that surprised both their foes and friends. Since then, the Taliban have been trying to form a government but so far have held back the announcement. The Taliban have postponed the formation of a new government in Afghanistan for next week, their spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said on Saturday, as the insurgent group struggles to give shape to a broad-based and inclusive administration acceptable to the international community. This is the second time that the Taliban have delayed the formation of the new government in Kabul since their toppling of the US-backed Afghanistan government. The insurgent group was expected to announce the formation of the new government led by its co-founder Mulla Abdul Ghani Baradar on Friday, but later postponed it by a day to Saturday. According to the Express Tribune, Hameed will also meet Pakistan's envoy in Kabul to discuss the matter of repatriation and transit through Pakistan of foreign nationals and Afghans fleeing Taliban rule. "The issue of pending requests from countries and international organisations for the repatriation/transit through Pakistan and the need to determine the mechanism through which Pakistan could allow these, in coordination with the ground authorities in Afghanistan will be discussed during the meeting with the Taliban officials,” it said, quoting sources. The intelligence chief will spend a day in the Afghan capital, the Geo News reported. Border management is another important issue that will come under discussion during the visit of Hameed, it said. Pakistan was often accused by the Afghanistan government of giving the Taliban military aid, a charge denied by Islamabad. Hameed's visit to Kabul came as Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa met with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab earlier in the day and said that Pakistan will assist in the formation of an inclusive administration in Afghanistan. Raab arrived in Islamabad on Thursday night to meet top Pakistani leadership and discuss the Afghanistan situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/everything-will-be-okay-isi-chief-during-visit-to-afghanistan/articleshow/85940133.cms||---

And further declined to 6,975 million nuts by 2020-21, CDB said in a reply to the RTI activist K Govindan Nampoothiry. Over the four-year period (FY15 to FY18), Rs 1.8 crore was spent on training 2,637 neera technicians. The spending on training during 2014-15 was Rs 49.47 lakh, which grew to Rs 98.57 lakh in 2015-16. The next year, the spending declined to Rs 28.84 lakh and then declined further to Rs 3.72 lakh in 2017-18.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Schools to keep complaint box for girls||CHENNAI: Following recommendations from the Madras high court, the school education department has directed all schools to keep complaint boxes to receive complaints about sexual offences from girl students. However, child rights activists say boys are also affected by such offences and should be allowed to drop complaints in those boxes. "While confirming an order of a Mahila court sentencing a pastor to five years of rigorous imprisonment under the Pocso Act for sexually abusing a 12-year-old girl in 2019, the court opined that the female students were deterred from tendering complaints against teachers or school management regarding sexual offences considering future studies. The court recommended the state government to form a committee comprising of the district social welfare officer, secretary of the district legal services authority, a woman police officer not below the rank of superintendent of police, district educational officer, a woman psychiatrist and physician from government hospital," a letter from K Jeyalalitha, deputy secretary of the school education department, to the commissioner of school education said. It was forwarded to all the chief educational officers and district educational officers for taking action. The court also directed to keep a complaint box regarding sexual offences in every educational institution and the key of the box should be kept under the control of the secretary, district legal services authority. "The box shall be inspected by the district legal services authority and district social welfare officer, once in a week and inquiry in the same, if prima-facie reveals any sexual offence, and forward it to the police station concerned," the letter further said. "Apart from the above, it is suggested that the phone numbers of the jurisdictional all women police stations may also be displayed in the notice board of the educational institutions to create awareness and also seek police assistance, if required," it added. It requested to take necessary action on the above directions of the high court of Madras and to form a committee to prevent sexual offences against girl students. The action taken report may be sent to the government at the earliest, the letter said. Activists said the recommendations are not practical as it is not possible for district level officers to open the complaint boxes once a week in schools. "We need a protection mechanism at schools. However, the complaint boxes should be gender neutral as boys are also equally affected. The boxes should be put up in a place where there are no CCTV cameras and accessible to children inside the school campus," said A Devaneyan, a child rights activist. He said children are facing different types of abuses including physical, emotional, sexual, neglect and online abuse. He said creating a child protection committee at school level will be a solution. J Shyam Sundar, director of Institute of Social Education. said the complaint boxes may not encourage children to notify the sexual offence. "We need to empower the children to share their issues inside and outside the school freely at regular intervals. It will encourage children to share their issues rather than complaint boxes," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-schools-to-keep-complaint-box-for-girls/articleshow/85940251.cms||A Ragu Raman

Three zonal level panels headed by retired high court judges would be set up to supervise the entire exercise, HR&CE minister P K Sekar Babu told the assembly on Saturday. Large quantities of such offerings over the past 10 years were lying unutilised in temple vaults, he said. Gems and precious stones in the jewellery would be removed before sending the gold to the government-owned refinery in Mumbai to melt down and convert to gold bars. They would, in turn, be deposited in banks to generate revenue, he said. Senior officials in the department said about 2,000kg of gold jewellery could get converted to gold bars. The department had been doing this exercise from 1978 till 2010. It was discontinued by the AIADMK government. Verification officers would take stock of the gold jewellery to be converted to gold bars in the next two weeks. The entire process of verification of stock would be recorded and telecast on LED screens on temple premises. “It will also be live-streamed on our department website,” a senior official told TOI. The revenue generated would be utilised for creating better infrastructure for devotees at all major temples, he said. The official said big temples such as Tiruttani, Palani, Samayapuram and Tiruchendur would top in the stock of gold jewellery. “We will retain big gold jewellery pieces to adorn the deities. Only small ear and nose rings and chains will be taken for melting. The precious stones will also be retained to adorn the deities. The gold bars, apart from depositing in banks, will also be used for making gold temple cars,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-revenue-from-gold-will-be-used-to-build-temple-infrastructure-says-minister-p-k-sekar-babu/articleshow/85940287.cms||Shanmughasundaram J

DTCP officials said the developer carried out construction at the mall in violation of the building plan. It also allegedly failed to resolve land disputes and didn’t have complete ownership of the residential colony. The order, which was issued on Thursday, is likely to affect hundreds of property owners and residents, apart from the sale and purchase of properties in the colony and mall, which collectively cover around 210 acres. Ardee City and Palm Grove Heights, built across 204 acres in sectors 51, 52 and 57, are the flagship properties of developer Ardee Infrastructure Pvt Ltd in Gurgaon. Around 2,850 families are living in the residential plotted colony and housing society. DTCP had issued a conditional OC to Ardee Mall, which is spread over 5.1 acres in Sector 52, in June 2020. Officials said additional construction was carried out in the lower basement and lower ground floor in violation of the approved building plan after the OC was granted. “During a recent inspection, we found some additional structures in the basement and ground floor. The OC has been withdrawn, but the developer has a week’s time to make changes and approach court against the withdrawal if they want,” Batth said. DTCP also cancelled the licence granted for developing Ardee City on Thursday. The builder was given three licences in 1995, 1997 and again in 2002 for the project. But after DTCP received complaints about disputed ownership of some of the land, it demanded a response from the builder in 2011. DTCP served a fresh notice in 2019 saying the licensee and its associated companies had failed to submit compliance regarding the clear title of 41.8 acres in their favour. As per norms, the developer needs to have the ownership and possession of land before applying for a licence on it. DTCP director KM Pandurang said sufficient time was given to the developer to clear the dispute and ensure compliance of the terms and conditions of the licence, but they failed to resolve the land dispute. Ardee vice-president Anil Hasija said one of the allottees erected some temporary structures in the basement of the mall due to a misconception. “We are resolving the issue and the operation of the mall won’t be affected. We have already taken a stay against the OC withdrawal from the high court,” he said, adding that they are seeking legal opinion on cancellation of Ardee City’s licence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mall-flouted-building-plan-oc-revoked/articleshow/85936927.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Amritsar||50% coal-fired plants flouting water norms||BATHINDA: Advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment has claimed that half of country’s fresh water based coal-fired power plants fail to meet the 2015 water-use standards. Citing its study titled ‘Water Inefficient Power’, the CSE claims that even six years after these norms came into force, the thermal-power industry continues to guzzle water. In support of its theory that the sector was adding to water stress in the country, CSE says it found 48% of coalpower fleet to be in waterscarce districts like Barmer and Baran in Rajasthan. “Counted among the most waterintensive industries, the coalpower sector is responsible for about 70% of the total freshwater withdrawal by all industries. Indian power plants with cooling towers consume twice as much water as their global counterparts,” reads the report. The 2015 norms (re-revised in 2018) requried the plants installed before January 1, 2017, to meet a water consumption limit of 3.5 cubic metres per megawatt hour of power produced. For the plants installed after January 1, 2017, this limit is 3 cubic metres per MWh, apart from adopting zero liquid discharge. Additionally, all freshwater-based plants must install cooling towers and meet the 3.5 cubic metres limit. The seawater-based plants were exempt from meeting this limit. The compliance deadline of December 2017 has long passed. The water standards for thermal power plants were introduced in 2015 along with the emission norms. Though emission norms timelines were revised twice (2017 and 2021), while the water norms were overlooked. CSE industrial pollution unit programme director Nivit Kumar Yadav said: “Many power producing regions of the country have water crisis and water pollution because of the discharge from these plants.” CSE surveyed plants of more than 154 gigawatt capacity and found 50% non-complying, most of these state-owned. The CSE claims that some of the old plants operate without the cooling towers, indicating a flouting of not only the water norms but also the emission standards. These pre-1999 units were identified for retirement but neither retired yet nor upgraded, says CSE deputy programme manager Sugandha Arora. The survey found loopholes in the self-reported data and variance in formats across states. Yadav said: “This sector should reduce its massive water footprint, report data accurately, and ensure zero discharge in newer plants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/50-coal-fired-plants-flouting-water-norms/articleshow/85940318.cms||---

Nearly 1,500 people had invested over Rs 1,300 crore in the project, which was launched in 2012 with a three-year deadline. The investors, however, allege that the developer has reduced the size of shops and increased its cost over the years while not paying them the assured returns. They have also accused the developer of making illegal agreements. The FIRs were, in fact, filed on the directions of a local court, after two of the investors sought legal recourse to recover their money. One of the complainants, Sanjiv Bhatia alleged they were lured through advertisements by International Recreation & Amusement Limited (IRAL), the holding company of the Appu Ghar brand, that it was allotted 42 acres of land (25 acres in Sector 29 and 17 acres in Sector 52A) for the development of the theme park by HUDA (now HSVP). “However, we came to know from an RTI response in February 2021 that IRAL did not bid for the land at all. Another company belonging to the promoters, International Amusement Ltd (IAL), was allotted the land, while IRAL was executing the lease agreement with the investors,” claimed Bhatia, a resident of resident of Central Park, who booked two units of 500 sq ft commercial space for Rs 62.50 lakh per unit in 2014. According to Bhatia, the project failed to take off till 2017 and another agreement was made in which the size of each unit was reduced to 400 sq ft, the location changed and the price rose to Rs 1 crore. “They had promised us an assured rental of Rs 1 lakh per month but that never came,” he alleged. Another complainant, Vishal, said, “IRAL started sub-leasing of commercial retail shops while it had no rights to execute any sub-lease. All such deeds executed were illegal as the IRAL was formed six months after the allotment of land was made to IAL.” According to a forensic report by the Haryana government, dated March 2018, the holding company and its directors siphoned off around Rs 900 crore that they had collected from 1,500 investors. On the direction of the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) of Gurgaon, two cases were registered against IRAL and 16 others, including the directors and senior management of the company, under sections 420 (cheating), 409 (criminal breach of trust), 467 (forgery), 468 (fording document), 471 (using forged document), 34 (common intention) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC at the Sector 29 police station on Friday. Rakesh Babbar, director of IRAL, said, “There is no point in registering such cases as the matter is being heard by NCLT. We have not taken any bank loan on this project.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/appu-ghars-directors-booked-for-fraud-firs-filed-after-court-order/articleshow/85936994.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Gurgaon||Pipe broken, water being wasted, but no MCG action yet, say residents of HSVP sectors||Gurgaon: Residents of HSVP sectors have raised concerns over the wastage of drinking water due to a pipeline leakage. They claimed to have made several complaints to the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG), but no action has been taken by the department concerned to prevent the wastage by plugging the leak. In Sector 23A, the residents claimed that a water pipeline near the old water supply pump was damaged over a month ago while laying of new pipelines in the area. They said that they have already apprised an official of the MCG multiple times, but all their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Malkhan Singh, RWA president of Sector 23A, said: “The water pipeline was damaged over a month ago when pipelines were being laid in the sector. We had immediately informed the officials concerned about the matter but nothing has been done ever since.” Similarly, the residents of Sector 46 have also been facing the problem for over 20 days now, but nothing has been done to rectify the problem resulting in thousands of litres of potable water being wasted on a daily basis. They claimed that the accumulated water on the roadside has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and is causing damage to the road. The pipelines in the sectors were laid over two decades ago and now become old and rusty resulting in frequent damage. RK Yadav, RWA president of Sector 46, said: “We are fed up with the functioning and callous attitude of the MCG officials. Even after informing them, our problems are not being resolved in a timely manner. This is not only causing inconvenience to residents but also wasting resources. The pipelines in the sector are old and rusty, which results in frequent leakages. Moreover, the sector road has also been dug up by various agencies and authorities causing further damage to the pipelines.” Meanwhile, a senior MCG official said that the maintenance of water pipelines is routine work, and if complaints have been made, immediate action will be taken. “The matter is not in my knowledge yet, but I will ask the official concerned to look into the matter and resolve it at the earliest,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/pipe-broken-water-being-wasted-but-no-mcg-action-yet-say-residents-of-hsvp-sectors/articleshow/85937004.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Gurgaon||Delayed due to Covid, restoration of 200-year-old tomb in Gurugram to begin in October||GURUGRAM: Delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the much-awaited restoration of a 200-year-old tomb of a French major, who served in the mercenary army of Begum Sombre, in Jharsa is finally set to commence from the next month, the Gurugram chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) said. Nestled in the middle of a park at Mohyal colony, the tomb, believed to date back to 1821, has withstood the years of construction and developmental activities and now stands as one of the very few remnants associated with Begum Sombre, the wife of Captain Sombre from France, who led her own mercenary army after her husband’s death. The principal cantonment of the army of Begum Samru, as she was popularly known, is believed to have been located in Jharsa and the tomb is a “proof” of its “positioning” in the city, officials said. In October 2018, the INTACH and the Sushant School of Art and Architecture (SSAA) had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to carry out “conservation and interpretation” of the tomb dedicated to the memory of Major Jean Etienne. While the documentation process was completed by January 2019, the work was repeatedly put on hold after the pandemic hit the country in March last year, officials said. “We are now planning to begin restoring the tomb in October. There has been a delay in the work because of the pandemic. Initially, when we spoke to contractors, there were no labourers available for the work. When we again tried to start the work in February-March this year, Covid-19 cases started to rise and the second wave hit,” said Major Atul Dev, the convener of INTACH’s Gurugram chapter. As per the project report, Major Dev said, the estimate for restoring the tomb is Rs 16 lakh. “It will take us around three months to complete all the work. INTACH has conservation architects among its staff, one of who is a team member of the Gurugram chapter. We have given him the responsibility of heading the team and picking other members,” he said. According to officials, while there is no signage dedicated to the history of the tomb, an inscription on the structure revealed that it was “sacred to the memory of Major Jean Etienne”, who hailed from Bordeaux, France, and died on “5 June AD 1821” at the age of 75. The inscription also states that he served Begum Sombre for 35 years and was a “gallant soldier” and “honest man”. Begum Sombre, who had begun her career as a 'dancing girl' in the 18th century and later married Captain Sombre, had become popular as ‘Begum Samru’ among the local people who struggled to pronounce the name 'Sombre', INTACH officials said. After the death of her husband, Begum Sombre had inherited his mercenary army and began leading it. “The tomb is a landmark to remember the history of Gurugram and it has become the proof of Begum Samru’s positioning here. Earlier, there were only rumours about this. In addition, the tomb also has historical, architectural and educational value as the only surviving tomb out of many others representing the early 19th century,” Major Dev said. While the tomb remains intact, a closer inspection shows that the structure is plagued by soiling, growth of weeds and plants, bird droppings, cracks, and chipping in some portions. Along with rectifying these problems, INTACH will erect appropriate signage on the main road to “guide people to the park”. The MoU for restoring the tomb had been signed after INTACH officials had approached the then deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh in June 2018. Subsequently, the deputy commissioner had granted permission for restoring the structure on June 29, 2018, and the MoU was inked on October 18 that year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/delayed-due-to-covid-restoration-of-200-year-old-tomb-to-begin-in-october/articleshow/85937083.cms||Sakshi Dayal

Mostly used in pre-term babies suffering from respiratory distress, the therapy was administered to an adult Covid-19 patient suffering from severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) for the first time, said experts at the hospital who treated the woman, a resident of east Delhi. In this therapy, fluid from bovine lung tissue — pulmonary surfactant — is administered to the lungs through the trachea. It helps reduce air leakage by not letting the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs that function as respiratory units) collapse during exhalation. The patient was discharged on August 20 but remains on oxygen support at home. Her condition is being monitored closely by doctors through video calls. Of the 97 days she spent at Artemis hospital, 29 days were on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. According to Dr Dr Shivanshu Raj Goyal, consultant (respiratory/pulmonology and sleep medicine) at Artemis, lung surfactant is naturally present in humans but gets denatured or destroyed due to the novel coronavirus infection. The woman was admitted to the ICU of Artemis on May 15 after she was transferred from a hospital in Delhi. According to doctors, air was found to be leaking from her lungs, getting trapped in the thorax, around the heart, and under skin tissues. “Her oxygen levels kept dropping and she had to be put on ventilator support. However, even after three weeks on a ventilator, there were no signs of improvement. The patient developed pneumo-mediastinum with subcutaneous emphysema, one of the deadliest complications of Covid-19 involving abnormal presence of air in the centre of the chest between the lungs, around the heart and in the skin tissues, due to leakage from the lungs,” said Dr Goyal. Survival chances of Covid-19 patients on mechanical ventilation, whose lungs are leaking air, are next to zero, according to the doctor. “But we did not lose hope and with the basic idea that a body part needed rest to get a chance to heal on its own, we took a bold decision. We decided to bypass the patient’s lungs by putting her on ECMO, which is akin to a heart-lung bypass machine used in open-heart surgery,” he explained. ECMO pumps and oxygenates a patient’s blood from outside the body and allows the heart and lungs to rest. It is usually considered the last line of treatment used for critical patients when all other treatments fail. There were several challenges – risk of bleeding, prevention of infection, and persistent leakage of air from the lungs – faced by doctors in performing the intratracheal process. “It was clear that some out-of-the-box thinking was urgently required to save the patient’s life,” Dr Aseem Srivastava, head of paediatric cardiac surgery at Artemis. Dr Goyal, who continues to monitor the patient’s condition, said doctors were in constant touch with her family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/therapy-for-pre-term-babies-revives-covid-patient-47-with-leaking-lungs/articleshow/85937338.cms||Ipsita Pati

A few borrowed smartphones display the faces of the children from classes 1 to 5. On some days, adults are seen behind the children, holding a torch when there’s no electricity. A primary teacher at a zilla parishad school in Barabangla village of Kasara, Dandge (32) has to conduct ‘night school’ for her regular students as that is the only time adults return home from work and hand their cellphones to their children. “Me and my senior teacher, Sanjay Sande, convinced villagers to spare their cellphones for an hour to help children study,” said Dandge, who joined the school in 2014. During the day, she sends the topics, homework, videos on cellphones After 8.30pm, students access it and study which goes on for two hours. Both, children and their parents were stressed about online learning. So was Dandge, whose mobile use was restricted to making calls and a bit of social media. “Video-calling and making PPT was novel to me but lockdown helped me enhance my technological knowledge,” said Dandge. In another remote tribal village in Wada, around 57km from Kasara, another government school teacher Pinesh Jadhav (36) has been teaching students living in the jungles of Sangwan. Here, none of the inhabitants had smartphones. Jadhav, with 15 years of experience, would not give up. He asked students to gather at the home or open space of a local who had a phone. He calls on the phone, asks the receiver to put the call on speaker and conducts class for students from classes 1 to 4. The school is located in Musarane village, which is free of Covid-.Jadhav hopes that physical classes will begin soon. Both Jadhav and Dandge, proudly declare that this year their enrolments have gone up and none of the students has been left out of the learning curve. Jadhav and Dandge are among the many teachers who are real heroes, said Uma Kogekar, CEO of the Centre for Equity and Quality in Universal Education that has documented the journey of teachers during the pandemic, by way of a book. The teachers ensured that their students moving from primary to secondary were admitted in schools and did not drop out to work as labourers. “Twelve of my students had to be admitted to other schools for class 5.

Narwal achieved the feat in his debut Games. Three days back, Sumit Antil of the same district had won a gold. Narwal had a keen interest in sports from childhood and dreamt of becoming a football player. He could not fulfil his dream due to a congenital ailment in his right hand, but his wrestler father Dilbagh tried to ensure that nothing held him back. In 2016, Dilbagh took Narwal to a nearby shooting range at Ballabhgarh run by coach Rakesh Thakur, marking a new journey for him. The teenager's talent was spotted by coach Jai Prakash Nautiyal and he went on to win the yellow metal in P1 and silver in P4 in 2018 Asian Para Games in Jakarta. The shooter's family originally belonged to Kathura village of Sonipat district but is presently based in Shahupur village of Faridabad district. On Saturday, as soon as the Manish shot his way to victory, celebrations began at his house. His family members danced in glee to the dhol's beats, accepting congratulations from the neighbours and well-wishers. Cabinet minister Mool Chand Sharma and Faridabad MLA Rajesh Nagar called on Manish’s parents to congratulate them for his feat. His mother Santosh Devi, beaming with joy, said that Manish had worked hard for the gold medal and he was sure that he would not come empty-handed. “My son never missed his shooting practice and always won medals in every national or international competition that he contested,” she added. His father said that Manish had fulfilled his dream of winning an Olympic gold. “For the family, seeing the Indian flag being raised for the gold medal was a proud moment,” he added. Basking in his glory, Nafe Singh Narwal, head of Narwal khap from Kathura village, dubbed Manish as the ‘pride of the village and Narwal clan’. The Narwal khap would organise a big homecoming celebration for Manish and the village would invite chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to facilitate him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sonipats-goldfinger-manish-narwal-shoots-record-win-in-tokyo/articleshow/85937399.cms||Sat Singh

According to the police, the mishap occurred while the victims were crossing the swollen rivulet. They were caught in the swirling waters between Akuru and Badigunta villages. The police said 5 villagers of Badigunta went to Rampa Chodavaram for Aadhaar updation and new Aadhaar cards. While crossing the stream to reach the other side, they were caught in the flood waters. While two managed to swim to the bank, the other three were washed away. The police have identified the dead as Podium Ganesh Dora (5), Vetti Vamsi Dora (5) and Vetti Jyothi (30). Podium Veera Mani and Madi Pentamma escaped from the fury of the flood. The bodies of Ganesh Dora and Vamsi Dora were traced by the villagers in the downstream. A search has been launched for Jyothi’s body. Meanwhile, streams and rivulets are overflowing in the Agency areas of East Godavari district.
